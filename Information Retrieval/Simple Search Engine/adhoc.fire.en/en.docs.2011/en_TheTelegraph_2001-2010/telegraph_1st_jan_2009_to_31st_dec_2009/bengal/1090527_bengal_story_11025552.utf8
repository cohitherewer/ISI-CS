The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Axe hangs on Seths Haldia throne
                                                                                                               Axe hangs on Seths Haldia throne
          BISWAJIT ROY                          Lakshman Seth: Time up?                                  
	Calcutta, May 26: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is set to remove former Tamluk MP Lakshman Seth from the post of Haldia Development Authority chairman, a move CPM sources said was part of a post-poll attempt at damage control.         
	Seth is likely to be replaced by a government official, though the Opposition wants his nemesis, newly elected Trinamul Congress MP Subhendu Adhikary, in the post.         
	Many in the CPM, including the chief minister, had held Seth largely responsible for the Nandigram fiasco since the HDAs untimely land acquisition notice for a chemical hub and other projects sparked off the farmers resistance. The notice later proved a godsend for the Opposition, which cashed in on the popular resistance and handed the Left one poll drubbing after another in the past two years, from the panchayat to Parliament.        
	Seth had earlier defended the HDAs right to issue the notice and survived with the support of a section of the state leadership. He even secured a ticket from Tamluk, despite Bhattacharjees reservations.         
	Today, Seth said he had resigned from his post before the polls, though there was no legal obligation to do so as it was not an office of profit. I resign every time I contest polls because that is the convention. This time, I have not heard yet from the government or the party on my renomination. Hope the government notification comes soon.        
	The chief minister, however, reinstated defeated Calcutta North candidate Mohammad Salim as the Minority Development Financial Corporation chief the day after the results.        
	Seth said that even if he was replaced, it should not be seen as punishment but the partys acceptance of his own moral concerns. Nobody in the party came to criticise me. I dont want to be the chairman again on moral grounds. I have lost the peoples mandate and they will not like it if I take the charge again, Seth told The Telegraph.         
	Those who favour his renomination pointed to his role in the industrialisation of Haldia and argued that dumping him would demoralise the rank and file and send a wrong signal to industry and pro-development people.         
	However, the drubbing both he and the party got in the just-concluded polls appears to have sealed his fate.         
	Officially, the government nominates the heads of development authorities in upcoming industrial and urban centres, but not without the party seal.         
	CPM veteran Benoy Konar said: The government would decide over it (Seths renomination). No decision was taken in the state secretariat.        
	He pleaded ignorance when told the chief minister had already taken a decision after speaking to state party secretary Biman Bose.

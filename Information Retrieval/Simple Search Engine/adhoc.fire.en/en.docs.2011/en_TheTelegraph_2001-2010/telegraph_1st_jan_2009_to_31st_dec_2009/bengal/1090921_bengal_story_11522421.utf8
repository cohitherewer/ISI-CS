          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 20: The CPM has decided to launch for the first time an inquiry against three district committee members following charges that they had connived with land sharks, sources said.        
	The district  North 24-Parganas  is the same as the one where the Vedic Village controversy broke but the sources said the particular scandal was not mentioned in relation to the probe that has been ordered.        
	Among the three is Kalyan Mukherjee, who used to manage finance minister Asim Dasguptas election in Khardah. The others are Ranjit Das from Baranagar and Arun Mahapatra from Gaighata.         
	The decision to probe the charges was taken by the North 24-Parganas district committee in the presence of CPM state secretary Biman Bose.        
	The sources said the three members were accused of immoral activities, including use of political clout and muscle to help realtors. The complaints against them were lodged by some party activists.        
	The faction-ridden district committee, however, could not finalise the names of those who will carry out the inquiry and left the matter to the district secretariat.         
	The sources said Bose did not mention the Vedic Village controversy in which the land and land reforms ministry reached an out-of-court settlement with the promoters and handed over vested land.        
	Bose has asked the units in other districts also to take action against corrupt elements, not only at the lower level, but also those in the top rungs.        
	Although the probe is being construed as part of the partys renewed rectification campaign in the wake of a series of electoral setbacks, the silence on Vedic Village has raised eyebrows.        
	A section in the party had accused the district leadership of inaction despite complaints of land-grab against the resort promoters. Some district leaders of the party, including ministers, were regular visitors to the resort.        
	But district secretary Amitabha Bose and Rabin Mondol, Rajarhat MLA, in their report to Bose did not admit the involvement of party activists, sources said.         
	But another leader pointed out that the leaders nexus with the real estate promoters in the suburbs had begun in the late eighties. Although the ties developed under the nose of the state leadership, it hardly took any action, he said.

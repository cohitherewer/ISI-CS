The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Trinamul tiptoes on Lalgarh
                                                                                                               Trinamul tiptoes on Lalgarh
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 17: The Trinamul Congress has distanced itself from the attacks on the CPM in Lalgarh but plans to use the violence to buttress its claim that the state government lacks control over law and order.         
	In the coming days, the party will argue that while it does not support violence, the attacks in Lalgarh are a result of the CPMs policies.         
	The strategy was outlined by Trinamul leaders here a day after party chief Mamata Banerjee broke her silence on Lalgarh in Calcutta. I dont support that (the Lalgarh violence). It is our collective duty to maintain law and order, Mamata said yesterday.         
	Trinamul sources conceded they were worried that the brutal attacks on CPM workers in Lalgarh could win the party some sympathy elsewhere in the state. But the anger against the CPM is such that unless we make a blunder, the Lalgarh violence will also work against the CPM.        
	Mamata, sources said, was keen to portray a statesman-like attitude, and was unlikely to immediately demand the state governments dismissal.         
	We are aware that such a demand now will mean playing into the hands of the CPM. Our strategy will be to focus on the CPMs crimes and polices failures to weaken the state government further, another Trinamul leader said.         
	CPM blame        
	The CPM central leadership held the Trinamul-Congress combine responsible for the Maoist attacks. It also said the state government was ready to talk to any tribal group that did not believe in violence to end the Lalgarh impasse.

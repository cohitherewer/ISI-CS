                                                                                                               No harm to villagers, Gandhi told
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, June 26: The Bengal government told governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi today that care was being taken to avoid casualties and harassment of innocent villagers during the operation against Maoists in Lalgarh.         
	Chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti and home secretary Ardhendu Sen went to Raj Bhavan to brief Gandhi on the situation.         
	Sen later said they spoke to the governor on the steps the government had taken in Lalgarh. We told him state and central forces were jointly carrying out the operation without disturbing the lives of innocent people.        
	Asked if Gandhi had asked them to ensure the seizure of arms allegedly stockpiled by political activists in Garbeta, Keshpur and Goaltore in the same West Midnapore district, Sen declined comment.        
	Mamata Banerjee had urged Gandhi last week to ensure raids by security forces against CPM activists in other parts of West Midnapore. She raised the same demand with Union home minister P. Chidambaram and finance minister Pranab Mukherjee.

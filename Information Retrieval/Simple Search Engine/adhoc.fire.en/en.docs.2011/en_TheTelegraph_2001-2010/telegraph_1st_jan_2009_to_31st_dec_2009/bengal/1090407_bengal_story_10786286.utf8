  - Police suspect suicide pact from note        A STAFF REPORTER                          A grieving Malati Samui at home on Monday. Picture by Gopal Senapati                                        
	Howrah, April 6: A 70-year-old man and his three unmarried daughters were found hanging in a row over the veranda of their single-storey home in a Howrah village last night.        
	Police found a note suggesting a suicide pact but the girls mother said only Kabita, Sabita and Nirupama were hanging when she stepped out of her bedroom and stumbled on the horror scene at 11.45pm. My husband lay on the floor with his eyes closed, said Malati Samui, who had screamed and rushed out for help.        
	When she returned with neighbours, she says, Asto Samui had mysteriously joined his daughters at the end of a fourth rope, all hanging from the bamboo frame that supports the tiled roof.        
	Malati said she had gone to bed after dinner around 10.30pm. When my husband, who was sitting on the veranda, did not come in till 11.45, I stepped out to look for him.        
	The girls and their father, who grew vegetables on six cottahs in Krishnachak, about 70km from Calcutta, had been depressed, Malati said. The reason was that the youngest, Sabita, wanted to quit her job at the block development office in Arambagh.        
	Sabita, 29, had majored in physics from a south Calcutta college while Nirupama, 34, and Kabita, 32, both school dropouts, rolled bidis to pay her fees.         
	Last month, Sabita took up her job as youth welfare officer and shifted to Arambagh, returning home for weekends.        
	Soon after joining, she appeared to suffer a loss of self-confidence. She told us she often made mistakes at work. She wanted to quit but her sisters tried to encourage her to continue, Malati said. Nirupama and Kabita would tell her how they had slogged to pay her way through college. My husband too told her not to leave her job.        
	District police chief Niraj Kumar Singh said a suicide note was found, apparently written by Sabita. Preliminary investigations indicate suicide. We are waiting for the post-mortem report.        
	Neighbours said the Samuis did not mix with anybody. They were like an island. They never went to anyones house nor encouraged others to visit them, said Ranjit Mondal.        
	Astos two sons live elsewhere in Howrah. Utpal, 36, a sharecropper, had moved in with a relative in Amta after marriage. Uttam, 27, is a carpenter with a timber merchant in Dakshineswar.        
	I dont know how this happened. I havent been living with my family for the past three years, Utpal said.

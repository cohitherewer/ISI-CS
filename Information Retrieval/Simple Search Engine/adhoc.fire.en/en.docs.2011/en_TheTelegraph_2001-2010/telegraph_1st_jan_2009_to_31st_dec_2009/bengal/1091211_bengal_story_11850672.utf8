          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 10: Mamata Banerjee today gifted Bengal the lions share of some 50 projects which will be paid for by a Rs 731.3-crore supplementary demand for grants she placed before Parliament today.         
	The projects include doubling of tracks between Krishnagar and Bethuadahari, laying a Liluah-Dankuni third line, deploying personnel at some 450 unmanned level crossings, installation of public address system in suburban trains which feed Calcutta from Eastern and South Eastern Railway networks and a rake rehabilitation yard at Noapara. Siliguri, where her party has recently made inroads, will get Rs 20 crore for a shed to house some 100 locomotives.         
	The railway minister described the projects for which she was seeking funds as national projects.

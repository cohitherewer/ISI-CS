The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Caste abuse charge on in-laws after suicide
                                                                                                               Caste abuse charge on in-laws after suicide
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Behrampore, Jan. 14: A young Scheduled Caste girl killed herself last night after her parents-in-law allegedly refused to accept her for being a Harijan (untouchable).        
	A motor mechanic who had married Mousumi Gangaputra in August is said to have disowned her last week following pressure from his parents.         
	The rejection came when the girls family had almost completed preparations for a social reception at Raghunathgunj, about 250km from Calcutta, on January 18.        
	Mousumis father Ashok, 48, a sweeper at Jangipur Subdivisional Hospital in Murshidabad, lodged a police complaint today accusing her husband and his parents of abetting the suicide.        
	Gangaputras are Doms, who traditionally handle bodies during last rites and at morgues.        
	Ashok and his family live at the staff quarters on the hospital premises, 1.5km from the boys house.        
	Police said the boys family has fled. We have started a case of abetment against Mousumis husband and his parents, said Rahunathgunj inspector-in-charge Sandip Mal.         
	Untouchability is illegal, but grooms are still difficult to get for girls from lower castes.         
	Mousumi, who had studied till higher secondary, had married the motor mechanic  a Das, a higher caste  at a registrars office.        
	Ashok said: The boy told us that there would be a social marriage later and we accepted it. A reception was fixed for January 18. We have invited our relatives and engaged a caterer to serve dinner.        
	Mousumis husband allegedly snapped ties with her last week. My daughter went to his house yesterday. He wasnt there. His father, a clerk in the land department, called her a Harijan and said they could not accept her as daughter-in-law. The mother-in-law joined her husband, said Ashok.        
	Stepping out of the house, tears streaming down her cheeks, she saw her husband. He refused to acknowledge the marriage to a low-caste girl, said Mousumis mother Minu.        
	Returning home, Mousumi told Minu about her humiliation. I told her we would go to the police.... Her body was found on our terrace. Next to it was an empty bottle of acid.

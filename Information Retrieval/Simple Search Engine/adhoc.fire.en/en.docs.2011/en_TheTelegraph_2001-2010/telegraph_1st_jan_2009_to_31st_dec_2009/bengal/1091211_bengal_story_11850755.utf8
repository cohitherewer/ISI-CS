The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Stillborn spectre on Singur plan 
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Stillborn spectre on Singur plan 
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	Calcutta, Dec. 10: Chief sec-retary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti today said he had received the railways reply to the governments proposal for a coach factory in Singur, but signalled that the project could be stillborn as there were clear differences between the two on several key aspects.         
	The letter I received from the chairman of the Railway Board, S.S. Khurana, asks for the particulars of the land in question and says they want to build a coach factory of international standards only on undisputed land, he said.         
	However, the Bengal government sees all of the 997.11 acres acquired in Singur as undisputed. The land has been acquired legally and that, for me, makes the whole of it undisputed, Chakrabarti said as it emerged that the issue could keep the coach factory from seeing the light of day.        
	More crucially, Khuranas letter says: Railways wants to set up a world-class coach factory in Singur on the entire land (600 acres) after returning 400 acres to the unwilling farmers/landowners.        
	Trinamul Congress chief and railway minister Mamata Banerjee has said all along that she wants the 400 acres returned to unwilling farmers before any industry comes up on the land. She had iterated the stand on November 29 at a programme in Singur where she first made the offer to set up a coach factory in joint venture with the state on the land acquired for Tata Motors.        
	Today, a Railway Board official said: Our position is very clear. There is no question of starting work unless the 400 acres are returned to unwilling farmers by the Bengal government. The railways dont own the land, so how can we return it?        
	Chakrabarti pointed out the legal tangles involved in giving the land back to unwilling farmers. The entire 997.11 acres was acquired by the WBIDC (West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation) for industrialisation and, as far as my knowledge of the laws of the land goes, 400 acres or any fraction of the land, cant be used for purposes other than industry.        
	According to legal experts, if land is acquired under the Land Acquisition Act, the government cannot give it back to unwilling farmers. There are two options to deal with such land if it has not been used for the purpose it was acquired for: use it for some other public purpose or auction it.        
	Theoretically, even if giving the land back is legally feasible, it will not be possible as the plots of those who have not collected their compensation are spread across the 997.11 acres and are not contiguous (see graphic).        
	If such land were to be returned, it will not be possible to get a clear 600-acre plot, an official said. The coach factory cant come up on bits and pieces of land.         
	That the government was aware of the slim possibility of the coach factory becoming a reality became clear when Chakrabarti said it was not in any hurry to get the land back from the Tatas.        
	In the first letter to Khurana on this issue, Chakrabarti had said on December 7 that the state government would advise the WBIDC to initiate the process to resume the land from the Tatas once the railways confirmed its stand.        
	Today, he said: I dont think now is the time to get in touch with the Tatas regarding the land. They may well be willing to hand back the land to us by tonight but we dont have a project in place just yet.        
	We had asked for a firm proposal from the railways but what we have received is not that. It doesnt even clarify if they want to lease the land or go for equity participation.         
	Asked if he expected the process of getting the land from the Tatas to be smooth, Chakrabarti said: The Supreme Court has ruled that if land acquired and leased out by the state for a particular project lies unused for over three years, the state can reclaim it.

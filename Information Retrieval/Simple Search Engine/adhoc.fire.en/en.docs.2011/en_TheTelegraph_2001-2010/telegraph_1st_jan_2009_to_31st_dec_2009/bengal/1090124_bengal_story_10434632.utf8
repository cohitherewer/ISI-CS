The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Talks call to Adivasis
                                                                                                               Talks call to Adivasis
                            
	Siliguri, Jan. 23: The Bengal government has called the Adivasi Vikas Parishad, which has been spearheading the anti-Gorkhaland agitation in the Dooars, for talks in Calcutta next week.         
	The chief minister will meet us on January 29, Birsa Tirkey, the state president of the Parishad, said in Calcutta.        
	Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee spoke to Gorkha Janmukti Morcha leaders, who want a Gorkhaland state carved out of Darjeeling, Siliguri, the Dooars and the Terai, on January 21 to avert ethnic clashes.         
	After the meeting, where Morcha leaders accused the Parishad of inciting violence, the Darjeeling district Left Front had said the government should also hear the other side. There were clashes last week when members of the Parishad foiled Morcha attempts to hold rallies in the Dooars.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CPM leader shot dead
                                                                                                               CPM leader shot dead
                            
	Bankura, Aug. 16: Suspected Maoists yesterday shot dead a CPM leader in a Bankura village about 25km from Lalgarh.        
	Ramkrishna Duley, 47, was returning home from his field in the afternoon when two men cycled up to him on a dirt road and opened fire.        
	Two cowherds, alerted by the sound of gun-shots, saw the assailants pedalling away. Loudspeakers were blaring patriotic songs and crackers were being burst once in a while, a police officer said. So initially, the cowherds thought they had heard crackers.        
	Duley was killed 500 metres from his home in Sarenga. He is the first CPM man to be killed in Bankura since the police moved into Lalgarh. The last time Maoists struck in the district was on June 3, when they killed three policemen.

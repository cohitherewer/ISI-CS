The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Tourists stuck in Sikkim
                                                                                                               Tourists stuck in Sikkim
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Calcutta, May 9: Nearly 800 tourists, of whom over 50 are from Calcutta, are stuck on a road from North Sikkim following a landslide tonight.        
	Around 11.30pm, when we were returning from Chungthang, our car and nearly 100 other cars got trapped on the road. A river had washed away the road after a landslide. We have no food, no light and its too cold, Mohana Sarkar, a resident of south Calcutta, said over the phone.         
	The tourists were stuck on the road as the vehicles could not return to Chungthang because of another landslide earlier on the route. Their return trip was delayed by several hours because of that slide.        
	The local police station told them rescue was not possible at night.         
	I managed to get the number of Mangan police station and inform them about our plight but they pleaded helplessness, a tourist said.

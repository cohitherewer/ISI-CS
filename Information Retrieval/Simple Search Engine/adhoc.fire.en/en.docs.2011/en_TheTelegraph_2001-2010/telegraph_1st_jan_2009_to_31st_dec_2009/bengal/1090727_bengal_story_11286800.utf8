                                                                                                               Basu heritage
                                          
	Dhaka, July 26 (PTI): Bangladesh has decided to preserve as a heritage site Jyoti Basus ancestral home in suburban Sonargaon.        
	A plan has been drawn up to set up a museum and a library of international standards, an official said in Dhaka.        
	A panel headed by that countrys parliamentary standing committee chairman for cultural affairs, Obaidul Qader, will oversee restoration of the house the Basus left during Partition. The two-storey building is in a two-acre compound 8km from Sonargaon town. Father Nishikanta was a doctor in Sonargaon, but Basu was born in Calcutta and studied there.         
	He (Basu) is a pride for the Bengali nation and so Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina took the initiative, Qader said.

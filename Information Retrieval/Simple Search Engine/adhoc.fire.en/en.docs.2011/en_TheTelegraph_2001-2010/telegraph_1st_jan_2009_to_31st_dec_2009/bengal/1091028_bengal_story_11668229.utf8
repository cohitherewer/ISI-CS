	Calcutta, Oct. 27: Atindranath Dutta was called to Bhabani Bhavan fir the second consecutive day. The police are examining the call records of Duttas two cellphones that were taken away by the Maoists. We want to check if the Maoists used the OCs phone to make any calls, said a CID officer.        
	The Telegraph had reported in Tuesdays edition that CPM sources had quoted the chief minister as saying the Centre might defer the offensive against Maoists because of Jharkhand elections and differences in the Congress over the operation.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Bengal   set to intensify operation
                                                                                                               Bengal   set to intensify operation
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Calcutta, June 20: The Bengal government is preparing for a long haul in Lalgarh, aware that the real operation has just begun and factoring in the possibility that the action would have to be intensified.        
	State chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti today said the operation would continue till the rule of law was established there.        
	After being briefed by the home secretary who was in Midnapore today, Chakrabarti said in Calcutta: There were several places we hadnt been able to enter in the past six months. Now our forces have moved into many areas, though some places still remain inaccessible. The operation has just begun and will have to be intensified in a steady manner. So we cannot say how long it would take as theres no definite time frame for withdrawal.        
	The chief secretary said the security forces had entered Lalgarh to instil confidence among villagers and restore normality. We will have to see that schools are reopened, block development and panchayat offices function normally and dug up roads are repaired.        
	He said seven persons  suspected Maoists or their sympathisers  had been arrested so far. Responding to a question, the chief secretary said: I will not say whether hardcore or not-so hardcore Maoists are there or not. This is part of intelligence gathering. But we are determined to weed them out.        
	Chakrabarti ruled out the possibility of holding a dialogue with the Maoists now. How can we hold discussions with people who have killed innocent people, doctors and nurses? Is it possible? The immediate job is to round up the culprits, he said.

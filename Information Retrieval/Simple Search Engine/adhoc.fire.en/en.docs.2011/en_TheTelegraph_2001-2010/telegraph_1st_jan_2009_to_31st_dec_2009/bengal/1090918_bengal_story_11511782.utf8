The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Super clean Mollah faces flak
                                                                                                               Super clean Mollah faces flak
          BISWAJIT ROY                                            
	Calcutta, Sept. 17: The CPM today told Abdur Rezzak Mollah not to send the wrong message to the masses with his critical statements on the party, but he faced no flak on the Vedic Village controversy.        
	State CPM secretary Biman Bose reportedly told the land and land reforms minister at a closed-door state committee meeting that no minister can speak on a matter that involves other departments or the policy decisions of the government as a whole. It must be dealt with by the chief minister alone.         
	Sources said the CPM state secretariat had decided to censure Mollah for exceeding his brief as a minister and violating party discipline by publicly mocking the party and the government. But the secretariat wanted the state committee to pull up Mollah first.        
	Mollah has been conveyed that he should not proclaim to be super clean and publicly call for rectification at all levels (of the party) starting from the top. These words from the land minister seem to have riled the leaders the most.        
	Among those who spoke out against him were Amitava Nandi, Tarit Topdar and Tarun Roy. Who gave him the right to insinuate us? Does he consider him above the party? a member asked.        
	Mollah kept mum.         
	Sources said Mollah was also criticised for not going after Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee, who had favoured the direct purchase model that was used to acquire the Vedic Village land. He chose to criticise the party instead, a source said.        
	The leadership wants us to speak in one voice when the party is facing a bad time, said a committee member.        
	Two days ago, Mollah said a communist party doesnt have place for promoters, dealers or contractors. If some of them are in the party or associated with it, they should be caught by the scruff of their necks and thrown out.         
	Asked why he was not giving his views to the party in writing, the minister whose department handed over vested land to the Vedic promoters, said he had been warning the party since 1993 but the party didnt listen.        
	A member said: We did not refer to the deal with Vedic Village as this is under investigation. But he cannot claim to be super clean.        
	Earlier, asked about a report that he had resigned, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said: I cant reply to bogus questions.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 12: The Trinamul Congress is in a quandary over whether to press for early elections  a demand Mamata Banerjee had made  even as it officially seeks imposition of Presidents rule.         
	The rising calls for early polls, now also from within the Left Front, have left Trinamul leaders questioning the relative benefits of elections now instead of allowing a floundering Left government to embarrass itself further till 2011.         
	The dilemma plaguing Trinamul found voice in Mamatas seemingly conflicting statements at a gathering where she repeated her demand for Presidents rule but was ambiguous on early polls. Things have become so bad in Bengal that the state government is not even responding to the Union home ministers letters, Mamata said.         
	She has, over recent days, tried to draw a distinction between her demand for the Left governments exit and early elections in the state.         
	The government should resign on moral grounds after losing a spate of elections, she has argued.         
	Mamata has at times hinted that she wanted polls brought forward but on other occasions indicated that she did not want Left rule to end through central intervention but votes alone. On at least two occasions, she said Trinamul wanted to defeat the Left electorally, party sources said.         
	The apparent ambiguity in Mamatas demands reflects a partywide dilemma, a Trinamul leader said. The question that the party needs to answer is whether early elections will benefit us more or the Left.         
	Trinamul leaders said the party was reasonably confident of winning the polls even if the government were to resign. But such a move by the Left could help it regain some moral high ground it may have lost. Mamata, the leaders said, may be better placed allowing the Left to possibly suffer in municipal polls next year.         
	But others in Trinamul are jittery about their troubled alliance with the Congress and are unsure how it will evolve between now and 2011.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Calcutta, Dec. 1: After CAT virus, audio virus.        
	The winter session of the Bengal Assembly was adjourned today for nine days bec- ause a virus has allegedly hit House microphones, part of a Rs 1.64-crore acoustic system installed last week.        
	Within a minute of the days 11am start, Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim stood up and said: The proceedings of the House will remain adjourned till December 9.        
	Halim, the Speaker since 1982, could not recall another such adjournment.        
	At the start of the budget session last year, a CD containing the national anthem had refused to play, prompting governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi to sing Jana Gana Mana with the MLAs joining in.         
	The new acoustic system, designed by Bosch, was installed on November 22.         
	On November 29, the public works department (PWD), which is in charge of the Assemblys maintenance, was to run a check to find out whether the new system was working properly. It was found that the Speakers microphone wasnt. The PWD men tried to repair it but in vain. A microphone attached to the desk of one of the MLAs was tried as replacement, but that failed too, said an Assembly official.        
	On November 30, the first day of the session when only obituary references were to be read out, Halim quickly got over with the job without the microphone.         
	It was detected yesterday that at least 45 other mikes in the 294-member House were also not working, Halim said.         
	PWD engineers assured Halim that they would get the faults corrected overnight, but that did not happen.        
	An official said the snag left the Speaker irritated today and he did not want to conduct proceedings.         
	Halim would know how difficult it is to rein in unruly MLAs even when he can raise his voice over the microphone.        
	However, he may have also spared the government the blushes because the Opposition wouldnt have let go of another opportunity to slam its incompetence had the session continued with a section of the House silenced.        
	PWD minister Kshiti Goswami offered an unconditional apology. The Speaker was very annoyed and rightly so. A software virus upset the arrangement. I have told the company it has to put the system in order in 10 days. Otherwise, we will throw them out.        
	The Bengal governments blame on the virus came at a time the IIMs have cited a virus attack for trouble in its CAT exams.         
	Bosch officials could not be contacted. The system, which replaced a 25-year-old one, has taken the company almost seven-eight months to prepare, the PWD minister said.        
	Assembly sources said the embarrassment could have been avoided had proper trials been conducted.         
	Dipankar Chaki, who runs a reputable sound lab in the city, said: A new system can always develop glitches. Thats why trials over a considerable period are a must.        
	This is a glaring example of the governments callousness, said Debaprasad Sarkar, an SUCI member.         
	Trinamul Congress leader Partha Chatterjee spied a political motive behind the adjournment. Manas Bhuniya of the Congress said he would urge the Speaker to conduct a thorough inquiry.        
	The mikes are likely to be overworked when the House resumes on December 10.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CPM tonic and toil
                                                                                                               CPM tonic and toil
          BISWAJIT ROY                              
	Calcutta, March 13: Booster shot to some, shock treatment to others.        
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today sought to lift the morale of Left legislators by telling them to focus on their strengths and not to worry too much about the Congress-Trinamul Congress seat adjustment.        
	A few hours later, CPM state secretary Biman Bose borrowed from Winston Churchill to tell party workers that we have to shed blood and tears to ensure victory in all 42 seats.        
	At a closed-door meeting of the Left Front MLAs in the Assembly, Bhattacharjee termed the Congress-Trinamul alliance immoral. The Opposition alliance is nothing new. We had fought it in 2001 and won. We should not lose confidence as we have worked among the people and they cant win the polls by doing nothing. So we should not worry about this immoral alliance, an MLA quoted him as saying.         
	At another closed-door meeting, Bose appeared to be preparing workers for a far tougher fight. Addressing the Calcutta unit, he told the cadres to be ready for a maranpan ladai (fight to finish).         
	The CPM is not leaving the fight to stirring speeches alone. The state secretariat has reportedly decided to focus on the state Congress leaders disgruntlement over the high commands surrender to Mamata Banerjee as well as her record as an unreliable partner.         
	People would want to know whether it is a front, alliance, seat adjustment or mere understanding, which claims to be an alternative to the Left Front, said CPM state secretariat member Mohammad Salim.         
	However, the chief minister told the MLAs to approach the polls with positive planks and highlight development. He stressed on the initiatives for the welfare of minorities and Scheduled Castes and Tribes. The chief minister did not mention industrialisation but asked us to highlight infrastructure development, said an RSP MLA.

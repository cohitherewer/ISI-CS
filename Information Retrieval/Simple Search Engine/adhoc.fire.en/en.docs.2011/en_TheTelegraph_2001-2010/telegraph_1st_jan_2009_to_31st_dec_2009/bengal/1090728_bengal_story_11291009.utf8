          OUR BUREAU                              Mamata Banerjee and Chhatradhar Mahato (with microphone) in Lalgarh on February 4 this year. Mamata had attended a meeting in the tribal zone to condole the death of three villagers, who were allegedly killed by CPM activists.   Mahato had said the villagers who were killed were supporters of the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities; (below) Mamata and the Congresss Bengal in-charge, K Keshava Rao, in Calcutta on July 21.

	July 27: A Trinamul Congress team will visit Lalgarh tomorrow despite the governments objections but will not meet resistance leader Chhatradhar Mahato though he seems keen for an interaction.        
	The team, led by Trinamul leader of Opposition Partha Chatterjee, will also have ministers of state Mukul Roy and Sisir Adhikary, and Purnendu Bose, a leader from the Save Farmland Committee.        
	Their task is to disburse aid and relief material to the tortured people of Lalgarh.         
	Today, while speaking in Nanoor, where she had gone to commemorate the killings of 11 Trinamul supporters in the year 2000, Mamata Banerjee said: The security forces are torturing villagers in the name of a joint operation. We are sending a team tomorrow to find out what is happening.        
	I had told the Centre about our visit. I came to know this morning that the Centre has asked the state government to make all necessary arrangements.         
	But West Midnapore district magistrate N.S. Nigam has written to district Trinamul president Mrigen Maity saying the team should not visit Lalgarh as it would not be possible to provide adequate security. Second, Section 144 of the CrPC was in force in the area so there should not be any gathering of people.        
	Home secretary Ardhendu Sen said he was not aware of any such order. I am not aware of any communication from the Centre in this regard. I also dont know whether the chief secretary got any letter of this kind, he said.        
	Sen, however, said the state government would provide security to the team if they insisted on visiting the area.        
	Last month, when artistes had gone to Lalgarh while the security operation was on, Union home minister P. Chidambaram had appealed to people, especially political leaders, NGOs and others not to go to the conflict areas.        
	But today Chatterjee said in Calcutta: We shall visit Lalgarh tomorrow, come what may. Our leader Mamata Banerjee announced the programme at the July 21 rally. We wont budge an inch.         
	The other problem for the Trinamul team is Chhatradhar Mahato, the leader of the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities.         
	Mahato wants a 1,000-strong delegation of tribal women to meet the ministers and speak to them about their grievances. We welcome the Trinamul team to Lalgarh. Mamata Banerjee had objected to operations by the joint forces. Our members are eager to meet them, he said today.        
	But Chatterjee and his party may not be as keen to meet him, perhaps. Chatterjee made it clear that meeting Mahato was not part of his brief. Our sole purpose (of going to Lalgarh) is to distribute relief to those affected, he stressed.        
	Trinamuls hobnobbing with the Peoples Committee, especially before the Lok Sabha polls, is not something the party would like to be seen doing now. Mamata had shared the stage with Mahato three months before the elections.        
	But she threatened agitation last month when the chief minister said: The Trinamul Congress has strong links with the so-called Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities.... The leader of the group, Chhatradhar Mahato, is very much a member of the Trinamul Congress.

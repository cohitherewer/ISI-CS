The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Cong on CPM radar
                                                                                                               Cong on CPM radar
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 13: Prakash Karat may be gunning for the Congress, but state CPM secretary Biman Bose today hinted that a section of the party still hoped for a tacit understanding with the Congress before the Lok Sabha polls.         
	He declined to attack the Congress for withdrawing its candidate for the Bishnupur West Assembly and refused to see it as a prelude to its larger alliance with the Trinamul Congress.        
	I dont think the withdrawal of the Congress candidate will automatically pave the way for its Lok Sabha poll tie-up (with Trinamul). I am not an astrologer and cant predict what will happen. But the Congress is yet to clear its mind, he said.         
	A Congress-Trinamul alliance may pose the Left Front its biggest challenge in its 30-year rule.         
	Bose today left for the politburo meeting in Kerala, which would discuss the alliance among other issues.        
	The state party secretariat discussed the list of candidates today. Veteran Benoy Konar said it would be ready in March.         
	He insisted that not all Congress voters would vote for Trinamul even if the two parties tied up. The front will fare better in the event of a straight fight as it will help us close ranks.

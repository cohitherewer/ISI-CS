The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Leeway to bus drivers
                                                                                                               Leeway to bus drivers
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 6: A government committee appears to be veering round to the view that the charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder should not be slapped on bus drivers indiscriminately in cases of road deaths.        
	Subhas Mukhopadhyay, the Citu leader on the panel, said: We are of the opinion that Section 304 cannot be used indiscriminately against drivers if someone dies in a road accident. Section 304 is non-bailable and could lead to imprisonment for at least 10 years.         
	A government official on the panel said the recommendation for lesser punishment under Section 304A, which is bailable, would amount to succumbing to pressure from Citu. If we recommend lesser punishment for killer drivers, it would amount to succumbing to Citus pressure, he said.         
	The committee has time till February 15 to submit its report, but the recommendation is not binding on the government.        
	Citu, the CPMs labour arm, called a bus strike last December demanding that drivers should not be charged under the non-bailable section. Police have to examine whether the driver is responsible for the death, Mukhopadhyay said after the panel met at the Writers.         
	Five members are state officials. Apart from Mukhopadhyay, who is a joint secretary of the West Bengal Road Transport Workers Federation, there is a member representing the bus syndicate.        
	The committee was formed after transport unions, particularly those affiliated to the Left, said the drivers may be charged under Section 304A (death due to negligence). The offender can be jailed for two years at most under the section.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Mamata ups alliance heat
                                                                                                               Mamata ups alliance heat
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 28: Mamata Banerjee today indicated that she would not want to part with more than a dozen seats in case of an alliance with the Congress.        
	The Trinamul Congress chief said she had not had any talks with the Congress on a poll pact in the past two months. The last time we discussed a possible alliance for the Lok Sabha polls, the Congress had asked for 12 seats, including the six now represented by its MPs.        
	That was about two months back. No discussion has taken place since, Mamata told a news conference at her Kalighat house.        
	She spoke her mind on the possible Congress demand for a larger slice of the cake. We (Trinamul leaders) organi- se political movements across the state through the year. We stood by the people of Nandigram, Singur and Lalgarh when the CPM let loose state-sponsored terror on them. Are we supposed to part with whatever number of seats they (Congress leaders) want?         
	Against this backdrop, Congress general secretary K. Keshava Rao will arrive here tomorrow with state party president Pranab Mukherjee to chart the road ahead. Their first task will be to gauge what the state unit feels about the possible alliance.        
	Sources said Rao might call on Mamata after attending an emergency meeting of the state Congress executive committee tomorrow.        
	Although Mamata hinted at not being ready to spare more than a dozen seats for the Congress, she told a Trinamul core committee yesterday that the party would contest 28 of the 42 seats in Bengal if the alliance worked out. That means she will be ready to part with two more seats to seal the deal.         
	We shall put up candidates in 28 seats if there is an alliance with the Congress, Mamata was quoted as saying by a party colleague.         
	Trinamul sources said Mamata sounded even more keen on the alliance after CPM pa- triarch Jyoti Basu admitted yesterday that it could bring down the number of Left Front seats. Mamata reminded us that even Jyotibabu felt Left seats would come down if we forge an alliance with the Congress. The alliance has to be worked out at any cost, said a Trinamul general secretary.         
	A Congress source said the party would press for quality seats and not just the numbers. We have to be provided with quality seats where party candidates have a fair chance of winning.

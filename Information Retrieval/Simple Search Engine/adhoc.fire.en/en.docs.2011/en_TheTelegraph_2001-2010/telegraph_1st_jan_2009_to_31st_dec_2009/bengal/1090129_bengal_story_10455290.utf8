The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Party sermon to cadres
                                                                                                               Party sermon to cadres
                            
	Calcutta, Jan. 28: CPM state secretary Biman Bose today renewed his efforts to sanitise the party before the Lok Sabha polls by rapping wrong-doers in the rank and file.         
	Addressing party workers at a closed-door meeting, he once again reminded them about the tougher electoral battle ahead.         
	Worried over organisational inactivity and vices like greed, corruption and feuding that have led to the partys alienation from the masses, Bose asked the rank and file to pull up their socks.         
	If need be, write to me directly, Bose said, alluding to the fear among cadres to speak out against wrongdoing by higher-ups.

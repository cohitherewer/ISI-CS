The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | On GNLF path to fair politics
                                                                                                               On GNLF path to fair politics
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Kalimpong, Jan. 7: Taking a leaf out of the GNLF book, the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha has decided to practise fair politics by organising a 10-day Milan Mela at Upper Phagu near Gorubathan from January 13.         
	Gorkha-Adivasi Sanskritik Milan Mela, which is a brainchild of Morcha president Bimal Gurung, is being organised to highlight the close cultural ties between the two communities.         
	In the past, the GNLF had sought to use the annual Mange Mela, generally held in mid-January, to establish the tribal roots of the Gorkhas in the wake of its demand seeking Sixth Schedule status for the Darjeeling hills.        
	Kalyan Dewan, the Morchas Kalimpong branch president, said much like the Gorkhas, the Adivasis, too, had been deprived of their rights by the Bengal government.        
	The mela will not only showcase the cultural integration of the Gorkhas and Adivasis, but is also aimed at raising awareness among the tribal community on Gorkhaland, he added.        
	The Morcha wants the Adivasi-dominated areas of the Dooars and the Terai included in Gorkhaland. The party had, in fact, included three members of the Adivasi and Rajbongshi communities in its delegation during the second round of tripartite talks that was held in Delhi late last month.         
	The Milan Mela will be held at the football grounds of the Upper Phagu tea estate, 60km from here, and comprise cultural programmes, exhibitions and sporting activities.        
	In the football tournament that began yesterday, 11 teams from the Dooars, Terai and the Darjeeling hills are vying for the Shaheed Pramila Sharma Trophy. The final is slated for January 16.        
	Raju Ghimeray, the vice-president of Morchas Gorubathan unit, said the trophy has been named after Sharma, who is considered the first martyr of the partys movement for Gorkhaland. The winner will walk away with Rs 50,000, while the runners-up will take home Rs 25,000.         
	Miss Dalim Ki Rani beauty pageant is expected to lend a touch of glamour to the fair. The crown is named after the Dalimtar, which is considered to have been the capital of the legendary Lepcha king, Gaeboo Achyuk.        
	We will also be holding games for the farmers like the biggest pumpkin contest and other rural sports, said Ghimeray. The organisers are expecting a daily footfall of 50,000 during the mela. To manage the crowd, about 4,000 volunteers of the Gorkhaland Personnel will be deployed. The members of our womens and youth wings will be assisting them.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Mollah land finger points at his officials
                                                                                                               Mollah land finger points at his officials
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 6: Abdur Rezzak Mollah today said an inquiry into the land deal by promoters for a proposed IT township had revealed the involvement of some employees of his land and land reforms department in certain irregularities.        
	We had issued orders for an inquiry into the purchase of land and their mutation for the IT township that the government had thought of in Rajarhat and Bhangar, in North and South 24-Parganas. Our intention was to find out how much land had been purchased by the private players and whether there had been inconsistencies in the deal. According to preliminary reports, some irregularities have been detected in transactions and the involvement of some land department employees has been found, he said at Writers Buildings.        
	Asked if the employees had been identified, the minister said a second round of inquiry had been ordered to find out who were behind the irregularities and to find out what sort of irregularity was committed. We have asked our officials to make a detailed second inquiry. We want to know who are the people involved and to what extent they have committed irregularities.        
	Raj Kishore Modi of Vedic Realty and Amarnath Shroff of the Diamond Group-promoted Akash Nirman had joined hands with Webel, a state agency to promote IT, to form a company called Webel Akash IT Link. The idea was to procure 1,200 acres for the IT township of which 600 acres would go to Webel free of cost. Webel would create the infrastructure for the entire 1,200 acres and allow Akash Nirman to sell land to IT majors like Wipro and Infosys.

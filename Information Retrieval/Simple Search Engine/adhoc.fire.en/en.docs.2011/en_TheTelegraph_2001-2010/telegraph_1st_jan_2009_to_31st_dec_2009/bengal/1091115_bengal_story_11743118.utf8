The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Rain in city
                                                                        Sunday , November 15 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                              Rain in city
                            
	Calcutta, Nov. 14: Surprise showers this afternoon did not cool Calcutta but more rain that the Met department expects after 48 hours may bring down the mercury level.         
	The drizzle, caused by a localised thundercloud formed because of abundance of moisture in the lower atmosphere, did not lower humidity either.        
	More rain in 48 hours is unlikely. But chances of rain after 48 hours are bright. The rain should help lower the temperature, said Gokul Debnath, director of the Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore.                                                        
	Tomorrow, said the weatherman, should be partly cloudy, with the temperatures ranging between 23 degrees Celsius and 32 degrees Celsius.        
	The city and its neighbourhood went through an unusually warm and sultry first half of November. The weatherman said the second half shouldnt be as bad.        
	What we experienced in the first half was really out of the ordinary. Factors like cyclone Phyan and the high pressure belt over the Bay of Bengal worsened things over the last few days, said Debnath.         
	The second half is unlikely to be as bad. Once the rains take place next week, the mercury would start climbing down steadily, he added.        
	When is winter expected to set in?        
	For Calcutta and south Bengal, what can be technically termed as winter is at least a fortnight away. We dont expect its onset before late November or early December, said an official from India Meteorological Department, Pune.

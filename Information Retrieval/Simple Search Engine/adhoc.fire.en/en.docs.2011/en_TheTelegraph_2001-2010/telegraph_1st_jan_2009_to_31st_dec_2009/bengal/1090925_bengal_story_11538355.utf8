The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Atish probe on CM prod
                                                                                                               Atish probe on CM prod
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Calcutta, Sept. 24: Nudged by the chief minister, the government has launched a probe into the circumstances that led to the death of engineering student Atish Sen Gupta and the cremation of his body without informing his parents.         
	Whatever I have gathered about the incident is very basic. Thats why I have asked for a detailed report on the incident involving the engineering student. This is a matter of concern, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said at Writers Buildings today.        
	The Government Railway Police has launched a probe into why Atishs body remained unidentified for 15 days before it was cremated.         
	The probe would also try to find out how the family, which lodged a missing complaint the night the 19-year-old did not return home, was not informed of Atishs death even 24 days after his body was found near train tracks in Dhakuria.         
	But to Deepankar Sen Gupta, Atishs father, the governments sudden interest means nothing. My son is gone. I just hope no other family goes through the torment we faced while trying to trace Atish. Its a pity that while my son was kept in the morgue as unidentified, we kept looking for him, he said.        
	Home secretary Ardhendu Sen has asked Dilip Mitra, the additional director-general of police (railways), to get information about the incident. I have also asked for information on why there was a mismatch in the actual age of the deceased and the one in the records, Sen said.         
	The probe is aimed at finding out where things went wrong. There is dignity even in death. An officer has no right to be disrespectful towards the sentiments of the family of the deceased. Its unfortunate. Action will follow on the basis of the report, Mitra said.

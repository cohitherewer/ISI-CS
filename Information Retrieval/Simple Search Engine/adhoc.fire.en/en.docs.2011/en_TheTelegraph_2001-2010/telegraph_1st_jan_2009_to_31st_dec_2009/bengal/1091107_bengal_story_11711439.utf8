	Purulia, Nov. 6: The Delhi-Puri Purshottam Express was detained at Purulia station for two hours tonight after railway police found under a seat two tin cans, the type Maoists use to stuff explosives.        
	The 50 passengers in the unreserved coach at the rear of the train were asked to clear out and board another compartment. The coach with the cans was detached as the police surrounded it and the stations public address system asked people to keep off.         
	One of the cans was wrapped in a plastic sheet, an officer said. A bomb squad went from Kharagpur to inspect the cans as the express resumed journey at 10pm.        
	Another train with an Orissa connection had been stalled in Bengal last week. Maoists had laid siege to the Bhubaneswar Rajdhani.

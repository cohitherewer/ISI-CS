The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Biman plays safe on Congress ties
                                                                                                               Biman plays safe on Congress ties
  - Assembly poll scare makes CPM wary        BISWAJIT ROY                      Bose, Karat      
	Calcutta, April 16: Prakash Karats Bengal comrades dont seem keen to burn the bridges with the Congress just yet.        
	CPM general secretary Karat recently ruled out supporting the Congress if the party formed a government at the Centre, but Biman Bose, the CPM state secretary, was ambivalent today. The political scenario at the Centre would change after the polls. We will take our decision as the post-poll situation evolves, Bose told a news conference.        
	He declined to comment on Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs statement yesterday in which he said working with the Left at the Centre had been a privilege but Bose added that it was still too early to speculate which way the poll ball would roll.        
	I wont comment on what the Prime Minister said. But we are hopeful that the Left-led third front would garner more strength and the Congress and BJP would become a minority. The situation will begin to change after the third phase. So there is no need to speculate now, he said.         
	The state CPM is perhaps taking a longer view of the matter, keeping in mind the Assembly elections in 2011.        
	A CPM minister said: Prakash (Karat) himself has admitted that the Opposition (Trinamul-Congress) alliance has made the electoral battle very tough in the general elections. It will be more difficult for us in the next Assembly polls if the Congress props up a government at the Centre without us and continues to stick with Mamata (Banerjee).        
	The state CPM leaders also fear the Left may not get as many seats this time  the combine had 61 MPs in the 14th Lok Sabha.        
	With the Left strength likely to reduce in the new Lok Sabha, it will become difficult for us to sustain unity among the regional parties if the Congress and the BJP are in a position to woo them. So what will we do if the third front fails to materialise? a CPM state committee member asked.         
	 We are harping on the mismatch between the Congress and the Trinamuls interests in Bengal as well as dissent in the Congress on seat-sharing. We are also highlighting the possibility of Mamata ditching the Congress again to join the BJP, the CPM minister said.         
	Tapasi denial        
	Biman Bose today denied to speak on a CD on Tapasi Maliks murder, allegedly brought out by CPM labour arm Citu. Bose said: I am not even a primary member of the Citu. So I cant comment on it.         
	The Trinamul Congress has complained to the Election Commission saying the CD had distorted the facts about the murder of Tapasi, and anti-land acquisition activist in Singur. The CD suggested she was killed by her family over an illicit relationship, Trinamul said.

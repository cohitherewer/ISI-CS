          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Durgapur, May 4: A black leather bag lying in a Burdwan police station has brought to light the tragedy of a son who set out to buy the freedom of his father from kidnappers but did not return.        
	Thirty-year-old Rohit Mishra, a technician with the Tata Steel in Jamshedpur, walked into Andal police station on May 2 to lodge a complaint about his missing elder brother, 35-year-old Rahul.        
	The bag Rohit spotted on the duty officers table was the one his brother was carrying. In it was Rs 5 lakh  the ransom money the Chhattisgarh transporter was taking to his father Jagdish Prasad Mishras alleged kidnappers.         
	At the police station, the bag was lying empty. The police told Rohit to identify a body beside which the bag was found. It was Rahuls.         
	There were bullet and injury marks, indicating Rahul had been shot and hacked.        
	Rohit told police his father went missing on February 24 while returning home from his Central Coalfields office in Chhattisgarhs Korba.         
	On April 27, Rahul got a ransom call on his cellphone. The voice said their father had been abducted. The abductor told Rahul to come to Dhanbad with Rs 5 lakh on May 1. Rahul took Rohit and a family friend with him.         
	When we reached Dhanbad, we were called on the cellphone and asked to go to Burdwan, Rohit said. So, the three took a train to Burdwan station.         
	After we reached there, the caller, who introduced himself as Munna Vajrangi, asked us to go to Andal station (about 70km from Burdwan). We took a train to Andal. He then told us to go to a Shiv temple in the Khas Kajora coal mine, about 12km from the station, Rohit said.        
	By the time they reached the temple, it was late afternoon. Another call came. The voice asked why three people had come when only one had been told to come with the money. My brother told the person he had taken us along because he was carrying a lot of money, Rohit said. Rahul was told to go to a local high school, a kilometre from the temple. He went alone with the money and did not return.        
	On May 2, Rohit and his friend went to Andal police station and found the bag.         
	There is still no trace of Rohits father.

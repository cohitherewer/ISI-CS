The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Mamata in Kasba with land war cry
                                                                                                               Mamata in Kasba with land war cry
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Mamata Banerjee: Walking the talk                                  
	Calcutta, April 6: Mamata Banerjee today left behind her guards and marched through a CPM pocket in her constituency to instil confidence among party workers who had complained of harassment by cadres.        
	The march followed a meeting with Trinamul Congress activists in Kasbas Rajdanga where she accused the government of grabbing land to build malls.        
	The area, a CPM pocket borough, became part of Mamatas Calcutta South constituency after delimitation this year.        
	I started a movement in Rajdanga way back in 1985 as an MP of Jadavpur (the constituency under which the area came then) when the CPM was evicting refugees to grab land. I shall start a Singur-Nandigram-style agitation here if the CPM dares to grab land to build malls in the name of development, she told the meeting.        
	The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) had acquired the Rajdanga playground nearly five years ago for a stadium, a swimming pool and a mall despite opposition from a section of local residents.         
	The residents profile in this part of south-east Calcutta has undergone a sea change with a boom in real estate and mushrooming of shops and restaurants.         
	In the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, Rajdanga is represented by a CPM councillor.        
	A large police contingent had today been deployed in the area, awash with CPM flags, festoons and banners.        
	After the meeting, over 50 Trinamul workers from the neighbouring Naskarpara complained to Mamata about not being allowed to campaign by CPM activists. Trinamul flags and festoons are being ripped off, she was told.        
	A fuming Mamata left her convoy and personal security at the meeting venue and marched through the lanes and bylanes of the congested area, covering a distance of nearly 4km. I will not go home. Instead, I shall walk with you to see how the CPM have unleashed terror on you, she was heard telling supporters walking with her.         
	Asif Khan, the leader of a Trinamul-affiliated minority forum in Rajdanga, said the padyatra would help boost party workers morale.

	Asansol, Nov. 18: The Centre has sanctioned Rs 2,629 crore to relocate by 2020 about 3.5 lakh people from the subsidence-prone parts of the Asansol-Ranigunj-Durgapur coal belt.        
	According to the Asansol-Durgapur Development Authority (Adda) estimates, about 8,050 acres will be needed to rehabilitate nearly 80,000, mostly rural, families.        
	However, for once, arranging for land may not be a problem. Officials said the 8,000-odd acres need not be contiguous and the state government and Eastern Coalfields Ltd (ECL) together had the land to house the new townships.        
	Adda, which is implementing the project with help from the Union coal ministry, will start identifying the land in December. Its chairman, Asansol MP Bansagopal Chowdhury, said: The Centre has sanctioned Rs 2,629 crore for the project which will take about 10 years to complete.         
	Coal India has identified 139 subsidence-prone zones. The ECL will provide us with its unused land and the rest will be taken from the states bank, Chowdhury added.         
	According to the plan, house owners will get the market value of their property and a 1.5-cottah plot. Instead of the land, they can opt for a 450sqft, two-room flat in a cluster of three-storey buildings. Those who neither take the land nor the flat will get the market value of the 1.5 cottah plot, said Adda chief executive officer Sanjay Bansal.        
	Those living on rent in the area for over 10 years will also be rehabilitated. They will get 300sqft flats. All affected families will be paid Rs 10,000 as cost of shifting in addition to the equivalent of 500 days wages for day labourers, an official said. At the going rate, the wage comes to about Rs 36,000.         
	The CEO said it would finally turn out to be several small townships for which Adda would provide the infrastructure  roads, sewerage, playgrounds, schools, community and health centres. We have drawn up the plan consulting villagers and Coal India. If needed, we may modify it.        
	Many villagers hailed the plan. Bablu Badyakar, 35, of Bangalpara in Durgapur said: We had been living in fear all these years.         
	Flames and smoke often leap out of the ground now and houses develop cracks as vast stretches are hollow beneath because of mining. Studies have shown all these areas can cave in any day.

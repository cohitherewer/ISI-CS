The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Bengal lives up to killing fields tag                                                                                                                  Bengal lives up to killing fields tag     4 killed in 24 hours
          OUR BUREAU                                    
	Aug. 2: Four people have been killed in two districts since last night. At least 66 people have been killed in political clashes since the Lok Sabha polls.        
	The seemingly endless spiral of violence appears to lend credence to P. Chidambarams remark that many Bengal districts resemble killing fields.         
	The Union home minister, who made the remark on Thursday, yesterday nudged the state government to get its act together in the trouble zones by urging chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to take steps so that central forces could be pulled out of Lalgarh.        
	The remark has left the CPM bristling. Politburo member Sitaram Yechury today asked Chidambaram to come out with the central intelligence inputs he had to reveal who were responsible for turning some districts of Bengal into killing fields. He must be knowing who were responsible. He should come out with the truth, Yechury said, hinting that the CPMs political rivals were to blame for the trouble.         
	State party secretary Biman Bose said Chidambaram should get the proper facts from the state government before blaming it. He also sought to paint the Left as the victim, saying 72 party workers and supporters had died in clashes since the elections were announced in February.        
	Bose sniffed a topple plot behind the violence and drew a parallel between the 1959 dismissal of Keralas first communist government and the Oppositions clamour for central intervention in Bengal on the ground of deteriorating law and order.         
	Those who have unleashed a killing spree against us are now complaining about the law and order. It reminds me of a Bengali proverb Chorer mayer bara gala (the thiefs mother shouts the loudest), Bose said.        
	Trinamul leaders insisted the CPMs terror was to blame. Mamata Banerjee has been trying to tell the Centre there is neither law nor order in Bengal, said Partha Chatterjee, leader of the Opposition in the Assembly.         
	Terror is being spread across the state, from Bhangar, Canning (both in South 24-Parganas) and Mangalkot (Burdwan) to closer home at Ghola (on Calcuttas northern outskirts).         
	The places he did not name are the ones where the CPM is getting hit in what is essentially a battle for turf. The Left and the Opposition are going after each other wherever they are stronger.        
	In the latest bout of violence, two CPM men were killed in West Midnapores Maoist strongholds of Lalgarh and Belpahari, not far from camps housing security forces.         
	Kalipada Singh, 54, was the convener of a CPM-backed committee formed to counter the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities. Nirmal Mahato, 52, was the secretary of the CPM branch committee at Amdanga, 2km from Lalgarh police station.         
	A CPM activist and a Congress supporter were killed in clashes for the control of a village market in Burdwans Ketugram last night.         
	A top state official appeared to admit polices failure to contain the violence. Asked to comment on Chidambarams statement, home secretary Ardhendu Sen said: The attacks and retaliations are just not right. We cant remain silent spectators. The police will have to be toned up so they react at the right time.

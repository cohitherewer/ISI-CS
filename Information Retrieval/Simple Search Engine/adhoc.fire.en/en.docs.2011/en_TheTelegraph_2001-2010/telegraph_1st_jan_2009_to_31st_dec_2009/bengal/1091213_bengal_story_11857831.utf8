The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Mamata refuses to send team to Singur
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Mamata refuses to send team to Singur
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 12: Mamata Banerjee today ruled out sending a railway ministry team to inspect the Singur land saying she did not want to encroach on property held by the Tatas.        
	I dont want to speak as railway minister on the Singur issue as the Railway Board is interacting with the state government. But the point is, who is the owner of the Singur land? The land is still with the Tatas and not with the state government. So, why should I encroach on someone elses property? I can make a visit to Singur only when I know that I have the right to do so. So, how does the question of inspection of the Singur land arise? Mamata asked.        
	Chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti had requested the Railway Board to inspect the site.        
	Mamata added: I dont believe in the idea of barging into somebodys room. That is not done. I cannot enjoy the fortunes of other people. These people have given the land to the Tatas on lease. How can I put my foot on Tatas land?         
	Railway Board sources said chairman S.S. Khurana has sent a reply to the state governments second letter, too. In the letter it has been repeated that out of the 997.11 acres, 400 acres should be excluded and 600 acres handed over to the railways, an official said.

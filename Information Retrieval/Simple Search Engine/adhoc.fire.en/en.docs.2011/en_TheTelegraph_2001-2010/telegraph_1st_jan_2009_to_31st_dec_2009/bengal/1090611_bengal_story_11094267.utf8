                                                                                                               Celebration and flight after Khejuri capture
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Aleya Bibi in Tamluk hospital on Wednesday. (Ranajit Ghara)                                  
	June 10: Aleya Bibis bullet wound is yet to heal but she smiled when she was told that the Trinamul Congress had taken over Khejuri.        
	Aleya still does not know that her two-year-old daughter died on the night of May 7. Little Shania, too, was hit by a bullet fired by alleged CPM activists when they targeted people in Satengabari for defying their diktat not to vote.         
	I still remember that night of terror on May 7 after polling was over in Nandigram, Aleya said from her hospital bed in Tamluk. Those goons came from Khejuri and attacked us. Now, hopefully, that chapter will be over and we will live in peace.        
	Yesterday, Trinamul activists invaded the CPM stronghold, burnt the partys zonal office in Hedia and claimed the area as theirs.        
	Today, in all the villages on the banks of the Talpatti canal  the line of division between Nandigram and Khejuri  the mood was that of celebration. In some villages, people distributed sweets.         
	It was these villages on the Nandigram side that bore the brunt of attacks of alleged CPM cadres who crossed the canal using the Tekhali and Bhangabera bridges.        
	I left home on May 7 for the third time and spent more than 10 days in a refugee camp till the Lok Sabha results were out, said Ranjit Bera of Ranichowk village. We also patrolled the village, I was a night guard. But last night our patrol was called off.        
	Nurul Ali, a 40-year-old farmer in Satengabari, said there would be no processions to celebrate victory. We dont want to create fear and apprehension in the minds of those who live in Nandigram and Khejuri even if they are CPM supporters, he said.         
	We dont want them to leave their homes and flee like we had to. It is terrible and we dont want them to undergo the same experience even if they are supporters of the CPM. We want everyone to live peacefully, Ali said.        
	But according to the district administration, about 300-400 people have fled their homes in Khejuri. Almost all are CPM leaders and activists.        
	Raju Bag, a CPM activist who has taken shelter in Sramik Bhawan in Haldia, said unless he was promised safety, he would not return to Khejuri. After the Trinamul set ablaze our party offices and ransacked the homes of leaders, we dare not return. What is the guarantee that they will not beat us up. After all, they are in control of Khejuri now.        
	Some CPM supporters in Khejuri have, however, decided to stay. Why should I leave? asked Asit Pradhan of Khejuri. I am a CPM supporter. The Trinamul only targeted the party offices and homes of some leaders.        
	Friday march in city        
	Left supporters will take out a procession on Friday from Rani Rashmoni Avenue in Esplanade at 5pm and march to College Square to protest the post-poll violence across the state, allegedly triggered by Trinamul supporters.

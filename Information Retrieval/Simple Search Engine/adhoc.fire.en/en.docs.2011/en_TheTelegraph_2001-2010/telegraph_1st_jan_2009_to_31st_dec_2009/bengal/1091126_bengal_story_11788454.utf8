          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Raiganj (North Dinajpur), Nov. 25: A six-year-old student drowned while relieving himself on the edge of a pond allegedly after a teacher refused to let him use the schools only washroom, reserved for staff.         
	Three lady teachers of Shergram Primary School at Kaliaganj, 30km from here, were arrested after villagers, enraged by the death, raided the institution and locked them up.        
	The police said the teachers were held on the basis of a complaint by Ratan Roys father.        
	Other students saw Ratans body in the pond around 2pm. A boy came running from the school and said my son had fallen into the pond. When I went there, all was over. His lifeless body was stuck in weeds. We could not retrieve the body till civil defence personnel arrived, said Bangu Roy, a small farmer.        
	A villager, Bishnu Roy, said he came to know from other students that Ratan had wanted to use the washroom but the teachers asked him to relieve himself near the pond. There is one toilet in the school but it is kept locked by the teachers who use it themselves, he alleged.        
	Bishnu blamed the selfish teachers for the death.         
	We demand that they be justly punished, he said.        
	Block development officer Soumalya Ghosh confirmed that the washroom was locked when he went to the school after the incident.         
	The district primary school council promised appropriate steps if the charges against them are proved.        
	One of the arrested teachers, Mira Sarkar, denied the allegations against them. The students are allowed to use the toilet. The boy went to the pond instead of going to the toilet and fell. All this happened without our knowledge, said Sarkar, who is in charge of the school.        
	The two others held were Minoti Deb Sen and Bhabani Chanda. When the police reached the school, they were inside a classroom, which a section of the mob outside wanted to torch.         
	North Dinajpur police chief Milan Das said: We are charging the three teachers with negligence and dereliction of duty.        
	According to reports with Raiganj subdivisional officer Sumita Bagchi, the 150-odd boys and girls of the school were not allowed to use the washroom. What the teachers have done is illegal as the funds we send to the school is for the benefit of the students. I have also asked the block development officer to erect a fencing around the pond, she said.

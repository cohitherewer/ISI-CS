The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Mamata threat
                                                                                                               Mamata threat
                            
	Durgapur, April 27: Mamata Banerjee today said she would oppose land acquisition for the airport city in Andal, planned across 4,500 acres.         
	Only 600 acres are required for an airport. Why is the government acquiring 4,500 acres? she said at an election meeting in Jamuria near Asansol, 230km from Calcutta. If it tries to acquire 4,500 acres, we will oppose it, she said.        
	The airport and the city, however, are part of the same Rs 10,000-crore project.

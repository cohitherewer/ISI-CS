The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Biman wants schools freed
                                                                                                               Biman wants schools freed
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              Biman, Mamata				                                 
	Calcutta, July 22: Left Front chief Biman Bose asked the government to arrange for alternative accommodation for the security forces and vacate schools in Lalgarh on a day Mamata Banerjee needled it saying the police action there had achieved nothing.        
	 The government should make alternative arrangements to house the forces so the schools can run, Bose said, reacting to the hint of fresh unrest in the region.        
	The government said it was trying to vacate the 11 schools occupied by the forces by end-July. We already built four temporary structures for the relocation of the police from four schools. We hope to vacate the remaining seven by the end of this month, home secretary Ardhendu Sen said.        
	The government had said this earlier as well but Boses remark was apparently to add urgency to its efforts.        
	Before leaving for Delhi today, Mamata said the joint action by central and sate forces should be called off immediately. This operation has achieved nothing. The area needs comprehensive development, the lack of which under the CPMs rule had triggered the agitation by the poor, the Trinamul Congress chief said.         
	She hinted that her MPs would raise the issue in Parliament during the discussion on the home ministrys budget.         
	Mamata refrained from commenting on the successive murders of CPM sympathisers in the Lalgarh region, but distanced herself from the guerrillas without naming them. We neither support the CPMs terror nor the politics of killing individuals.        
	However, she also said the violence in Lalgarh was a re- sult of squabbles within the CPM.        
	Job jibe        
	Bose ridiculed Mamatas promise yesterday that she would provide jobs to 1 lakh people if her party came to power in the state. How can a chief minister dole out a lakh jobs? Maybe she can, said Bose, also the CPM state secretary.         
	On Mamatas no-blockade sermon to party workers, he said: Lets see how they behave on the streets.

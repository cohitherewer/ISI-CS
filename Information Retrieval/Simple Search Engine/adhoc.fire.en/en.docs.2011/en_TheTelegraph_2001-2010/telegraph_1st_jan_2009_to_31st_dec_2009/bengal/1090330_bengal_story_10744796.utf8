The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Rift in Ghani house in the open
                                                                                                               Rift in Ghani house in the open
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Mausam campaigning in Malda North. (Surajit Roy)                                   
	Malda, March 29: Abu Hashem Khan Chowdhury today drove past the Trinamul Congress office in Malda town where niece Mausam Noor was planning a joint campaign with her allies, bringing into the open fissures in the Khan Chowdhury family.        
	When Mausam, the Congress candidate from Malda North, was in the huddle, her uncle was telling Pranab Mukherjee over the phone the CPM could snatch the seat if his ni-ece contested instead of brother Abu Naser. It would be the CPMs gain in Malda North if Mausam is fielded. Not only that, the Congress may end up losing both seats (North and South), he claimed to have told the state Congress chief.         
	Abu Hashem, the party nominee from Malda South, later said he was not aware of any meeting with Trinamul on a joint campaign.        
	The Congress brass had nominated Mausam for the new Malda North constituency after Naser failed to produce papers to prove he was not a citizen of Switzerland, where he spent many years.         
	Abu Hashem said Mukherjee, campaigning in his Jangipur constituency, had promised to fix Nasers appointment with party president Sonia Gandhi on his return to Delhi.        
	Naser, who is camping in Delhi, has been told that only Sonia can reverse the decision to field Mausam. The party workers of Malda North want me, he had said yesterday.         
	At the Trinamul office, Mausam had Congress MLA Sabitri Mitra and the chairman of the local Englishbazar municipality, Narendranath Tewari, for company.         
	Malda party heavyweights such as general secretaries Hashan Ali Shah and Mostaq Alam were missing. Known to be close to Abu Hashem, they had announced a few days ago that the district unit had recommended only Abu Nasers name for Malda North.        
	Malda Trinamul chief Babla Sarkar said: Congress district president Abu Hashem Khan Chowdhury was supposed to join us. I had spoken to him about the meeting. I cant say why he couldnt come.         
	Abu Hashem had earlier denied any rift in the family and posed for photographers hand in hand with Mausam.         
	Even today, Mausam, 28, daughter of the late family patriarch Ghani Khan Chow-dhurys sister, insisted all was well. Lebumama (Abu Naser) is naturally upset. But he will recover soon. After he returns from Delhi, Ill ask him to campaign for me. Dalumama (Abu Hashem) was supposed to come for todays meeting. I cant say why he didnt, she said before leaving for Chanchol, about 80km away.        
	Asked about the meeting, Abu Hashem first said he was busy campaigning in his constituency. Then he added: I didnt know about any meeting with Trinamul. Well sit with them tomorrow.         
	He insisted that the Malda North candidate had not been finalised yet. I have written to Sonia Gandhi about the reports Ive been getting. If Lebu is not fielded, we will suffer. Ive told Pranab Mukherjee about it as well.         
	Abu Naser said from Delhi. What wrong have I done? All documents proving Im no lo-nger a Swiss passport holder and that Im an Indian citizen have been given to the AICC.

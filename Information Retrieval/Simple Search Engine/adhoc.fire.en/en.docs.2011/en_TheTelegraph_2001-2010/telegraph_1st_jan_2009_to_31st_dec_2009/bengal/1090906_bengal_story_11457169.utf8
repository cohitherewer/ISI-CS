The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Search in Gaffar house
                                                                                                               Search in Gaffar house
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Calcutta, Sept. 5: Police today raided Gaffar Mollahs home, nearly a fortnight after it emerged that he was the key accused behind the Vedic Village killing on August 23.         
	The cops fished out a few documents along with an 8mm cartridge and three green helmets from the two-storied house in Champagachhi, adjacent to Vedic Village.         
	We have seized a few items from his house and are looking for his whereabouts. It would be inappropriate to say anything more about Gaffar right now, said Rahul Srivastava, the North 24-Parganas police superintendent.        
	Around 3.30pm, a six-member team led by Barasat subdivisional officer and Sukumar Chatterjee, the investigating officer in the case, landed at Mollahs home.         
	Its too early to make any definite comment on the documents, but they appear to be related to land. We also collected some small bits of paper which had phone numbers of some people. We are checking to see whose numbers they are and whether they can give us any leads, said an officer.

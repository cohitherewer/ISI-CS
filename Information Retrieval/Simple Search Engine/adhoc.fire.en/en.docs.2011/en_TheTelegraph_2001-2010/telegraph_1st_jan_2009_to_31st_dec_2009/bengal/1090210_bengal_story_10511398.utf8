The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Panchayat chief flees home
                                                                                                               Panchayat chief flees home

	Papuri (Nanoor), Feb. 9: A CPM panchayat chief here fled home with her two daughters and husband last night after suspected Trinamul Congress supporters hurled bombs outside her house, bayed for her blood and left after planting their flag on her mud wall.        
	The Trinamul goons threatened to finish off the entire family, said Mahadeb Ghosh, 55, a farmer at Hatserandi village, adjoining Papuri, where six people were killed and many houses torched on Saturday morning.        
	Charkolgram gram panchayat pradhan Dharitri Saha (she was mistakenly called Kakali Debangshi in todays paper) has two school-going daughters. Police said she had possibly taken shelter in a relatives house in another village.        
	Madhu Hazra, who lives close to the pradhans house, heard a group scream around 10 last night that she will face dire consequences if she did not resign from her post and quit the CPM. They hurled bombs and left. We were too scared to look out, Hazra added.        
	Hundreds of CPM supporters, rendered homeless during the Trinamul Congresss 10-year rule of the panchayat, were not able to return even after the party wrested the village body last May because Papuri village, 250km from Calcutta, remained a Trinamul fort.         
	Officially, the CPM did not admit that Dharitri had fled. The partys Birbhum district secretariat member, Ananda Bhattacharya, said: She has gone to visit a relative.         
	Trinamul, which had driven away 70 families of our supporters from Papuri, is now preventing their return.        
	District Trinamul chief Anubrata Mondal accused the CPM of terrorising villagers since winning the panchayat.         
	An Indian Reserve Battalion team arrived here today.

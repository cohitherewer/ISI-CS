	May 25: At least 20 people were killed and nearly two lakh left homeless in the south Bengal districts as winds flattened houses and rivers burst their banks.        
	South 24-Parganas was the worst hit, recording 13 deaths. Army and BSF personnel have managed to shift some 80,000 people to safer places there but many are still trapped.         
	Three deaths were reported from Hooghly, two from North 24-Parganas and one each from East Midnapore and Bankura.         
	Sea water gushed into Digha town, leaving tourists stranded. In Sandeshkhali, North 24-Parganas officials said a hundred people marooned by the waters of the swirling Vidyadhari would have to be airlifted.        
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said he had asked his ministers to camp in the affected areas to monitor relief. Our focus is on the evacuation of people and distribution of relief. The irrigation, land reforms and Sunderbans affa-irs ministers will go to Kakdwip, Canning and Patharpratima in South 24-Parganas.         
	The chief minister will go to Nimpith, in the same district, tomorrow. Other ministers, too, would fan out to the storm-ravaged areas.        
	All leave has been cancelled in the states relief, health, police, civil defence and fire service departments.        
	In Delhi, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh announced Rs 2 lakh for the next of kin of the dead. Home minister P. Chidambaram said the Centre had sent 1,000 personnel of the National Disaster Response Force to Bengal.        
	South 24-Parganas district magistrate Khalil Ahmed said: Many fishermen are at sea. We will search for them by helicopter tomorrow.         
	Over 1,000 villages in Basanti, Gosaba, Canning, Patharpratima, Sagar and Namkhana were inundated by the Matla, Thakuran and the Bhukhalakshmi.        
	In North 24-Parganas Sandeshkhali, a group of 16 children, between 14 and 15 years old, has gone missing. Officials said they were playing in an abandoned house that was washed away by the Vidyadhari.         
	The search for the kids became tough as water entered government offices and dam-aged equipment like wireless sets, disrupting communication links.         
	Parts of Haroa, Minakhan, and Hasnabad also went un- der water. North 24-Parganas officials said the floods had hit nearly 50,000.         
	In East Midnapore, 30,000 people became homeless as three-metre-high sea waves pounded villages in Digha, Shankarpur and Ramnagar. There is no word on around 100 fishermen.         
	The chief executive officer of the Digha-Shankarpur Development Authority, Jyotirmoy Tanti, said the waves entered Digha early this morning. We have asked tourists not to go anywhere near the sea.        
	Many tourists were stuck on the road to Calcutta. Those in the town were also plagued by power and water crises.        
	Electrocution and wall cave-ins claimed most of the victims.

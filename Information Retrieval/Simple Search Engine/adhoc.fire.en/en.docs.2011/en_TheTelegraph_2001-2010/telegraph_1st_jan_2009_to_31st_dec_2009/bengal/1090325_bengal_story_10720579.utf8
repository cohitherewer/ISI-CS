          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Dhubulia, March 24: A six-inch blade pressed against their youngest members throat, a Nadia family had no option but to help a band of robbers clean out their cupboards.        
	The masked men left with Rs 3 lakh and jewellery from the Dases house in Dhubulia, but their one-year-old daughter is safe and merrily crawling again.        
	About 25 men raided the house of three businessmen brothers around one this morning. Some of them scaled a 12ft wall with the help of a ladder they had brought and smashed two doors open to enter the sprawling single-storey house.         
	A police officer said they moved in so fast the large family, spread across the nine-bedroom house, did not get a whiff.         
	They snapped the phone line and went into the room in which ration dealer Bhagyadhar Dass daughter-in-law Priyanka was with her one-year-old daughter Debanjana. A group of men, their faces covered, stormed in with revolvers pointing at me. One of them snatched my daughter, held a knife at her throat and asked me to hand over my jewellery. They split into groups and went room to room, said Priyanka, whose husband works in Calcutta.        
	The others in the family were stunned to see Debanjana crying in the arms of a masked man with the knife held to her throat. They pleaded with the goons not to harm her and opened the safes one by one.        
	One of the goons slapped Bhagyadhars wife Rekharani as she took time to take out the bangles from her wrists. They beat up Bhagyadhar, 60, when he tried to intervene. They took away everything, said Badal, 55, the second brother, a fertiliser dealer.        
	The other brother, Shaktidhar, 50, is a hardware merchant.        
	Hearing the little girl cry and voices from the Das household, a neighbour at Belpukur village, about 140km from Calcutta, had switched on the light in his room and come to the window. Goons standing guard outside threatened to bomb his house if he did not go back to sleep.        
	Over with the job, they left through a rear door. Someone, however, had called the police. A jeep arrived while the robbers were fleeing through the paddy fields.         
	The policemen were outnumbered and bombed and the chase had to be called off, said Nadia additional superintendent of police Annappa E.

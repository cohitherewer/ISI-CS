The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | 35 principals threaten to quit
                                                                                                               35 principals threaten to quit
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                        
	Calcutta, Sept. 21: Principals of 35 state-aided colleges have threatened to quit to protest the scrapping of a special allowance and the lack of support from the local administration to tackle campus violence at a time the Trinamul Congress is trying to gain a foothold in many colleges.        
	The main complaint that the principals have is about the scrapping of a special allowance  the amount was Rs 2,000 earlier. The principals wanted the allowance to be increased to Rs 5,000 but the UGC scrapped it altogether.         
	The salary of a principal (Rs 67,000 after the UGC revision) is nearly the same as a lecturers after the scrapping of the special allowance. Why should we bear the additional burden (of administrative work) if we dont get paid more? asked a principal of a college in south Calcutta.        
	All 35 principals are working on lien  they are posted in colleges different from the ones in which they used to teach. Once their term is over, they will go back to the earlier colleges as lecturers. This is the first time college principals have threatened to quit.        
	The college heads, who took their grievances to a two-day conference of the All Bengal Principals Council on Sunday, said besides losing the allowance, they were under great pressure because of spiralling campus violence since Trinamul started making inroads into colleges. But the local authorities such as police were not helping the institutions.         
	On September 19, Trinamul Congress Chhatra Parishad supporters gheraoed the principal of Thakurpukur College from afternoon till 1am protesting improper scrutiny of nomination papers for the students union election. The police were informed immediately but reacted only after midnight, said a member of the principals council.        
	Eleven principals have already left their posts and gone back to their old colleges.         
	Another grievance that the principals have is about losing out on some financial benefits at the time of retirement because of the lack of a good leave encashment policy.         
	According to the rules, the accumulated leave of a college teacher is not taken into account when he or she becomes a principal. Principals can encash a maximum of 240 days leave at the time of retirement. But hardly any principal enjoys the benefit because the leave accumulated by a teacher is not carried forward when he becomes a principal, a college principal said.         
	Anjan Sengupta, general secretary of the principals council, said: We have discussed the financial and administrative problems at the council meeting and also with the state government. The government has given us an assurance to solve our problems soon.         
	The principals also want the government to allow colleges to recruit part-time teachers who dont have MPhil or PhD degrees and have not cleared the National Eligibility Test or its state equivalent. It is difficult to get candidates with such qualifications for such posts, a principal said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Meet to explain ban to restive allies
                                                                                                               Meet to explain ban to restive allies
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, June 24: The CPMs allies today objected to the arrest of CPI (Maoist) spokesman Gaur Chakraborty within hours of the chief ministers announcement yesterday that the central ban on the outfit was also applicable to Left-ruled Bengal.         
	State party secretary and Left Front chairman Biman Bose spoke to some of the partners in a bid to calm them and then called a meeting of the alliance tomorrow to discuss the application of the ban.         
	The allies want clarifications on the confusion over the chief ministers statement and its contradiction with the fronts stand.         
	Forward Bloc veteran Ashok Ghosh said: Well ask the chief minister to explain why Chakraborty was arrested under a ban that we had opposed. Our party had not asked for a ban on Naxalites even when they killed our leader Hemanta Bose, but focussed on a political battle. The front chair- mans earlier statement had also held the same view.        
	At the last front meeting, Ghosh had said the Maoists are not our class enemies.        
	The CPIs Manju Mazumder complained that the ban was enforced even before a discussion, which the chief minister had promised. The arrest was made before he discussed it either in the cabinet or the front. We will ask the chief minister why.        
	The RSP and the CPI held emergency meetings to articulate their opposition to the enforcement of the ban.         
	The Left parties were always opposed to Draconian and repressive laws. We will lose our ideological mooring if we succumb to the Congress-led Centres pressure now. The same law will be used against other Left parties in the future, said PWD minister Kshiti Goswami, of the RSP.        
	The Socialist Partys Kiranmoy Nanda, who had been the most vocal at yesterdays cabinet meeting, held his ground today and refused to accept chief ministers stand. Let us know from the chief minister whether the Maoist spokesman has been booked under the UAPA (Unlawful Activities Prevention Act), Nanda said.         
	Biman Bose declined comment on the arrest, though he had tried to strike a balance yesterday between the compulsions of the CPM and the government by stressing on a political battle as well as administrative action against the Maoists.        
	Party veteran Benoy Konar said its secretariat was yet to discuss the arrest but one of its members, Mohammad Salim, defended the chief minister. Political battle and administrative steps are not mutually exclusive but complimentary. A special situation demands special actions.        
	Reacting to the allies reminders on the Lefts earlier opposition to Draconian anti-terror laws, Salim said they were different from the UAPA.         
	We were completely opposed to the Terrorist Activities and Detention Act (Tada) and the Prevention of Terrorism Act, but not the entire UAPA, Salim said.         
	According to him, the Lefts objections to the UAPA were mainly over the period of detention without chargesheet. Under the UAPA, it is 180 days, double the period under other laws. Second, we opposed the provision that required suspects to prove their innocence instead of the prosecution having to prove their guilt, Salim said.         
	Also, the party resented the heavy punishment for suspected accomplices of terror accused as it could lead to punishing innocents who had no knowledge of a terrorists plans or helped them under duress. But the CPM did not press for the amendments that it had moved as the situation did not warrant so.  
	delhi claim  
	A Union minister said the Centre generally banned an outfit following the recommendation of a state government and Bengal may have asked for it this time.   
	The state government may have recommended it (the ban) orally if not in writing. Maybe the Centre has banned the CPI (Maoist) after getting an intimation from the state government, coal minister Sriprakash Jaiswal said after a meeting with Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at Writers Buildings.   
	Jaiswal, a junior home minister in the last Manmohan Singh government, said the state should be firmer with the Maoists. No violence can be tolerated.

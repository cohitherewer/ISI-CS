The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Gorkhaland makes the difference in plains
                                                                                                               Gorkhaland makes the difference in plains
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Siliguri, Sept. 15: The Siliguri votes that CPM candidate Jibesh Sarkar had got in the Lok Sabha elections deserted the Left in the civic polls, four months on.        
	The reason: Gorkhaland.        
	Political observers said the CPM had been under an illusion that the residents of the town were with the party ever since the Lok Sabha voting pattern became known. But the leads Sarkar had got from all the 40 wards of the Siliguri civic body under the Darjeeling Lok Sabha constituency were apparently because the plains had united against the demand for Gorkhaland in the hills.         
	The contest for Darjeeling was three-way, with the CPM, Congress and the BJP in the fray. Once the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha backed the BJPs Jaswant Singh, voters in the plains had only two options left, according to some.        
	The Congresss Dawa Narbula allegedly supported the call for a separate state while campaigning in the hills and walked a tightrope in the plains. So, Siliguri united behind Sarkar. The CPM had emerged as the only party that could steer the anti-Gorkhaland co-urse against the Morcha. But it was established today that the people here, too, want change, an analyst said.        
	The CPM should have got a hint of what was coming in the polls to the mahakuma parishad  the equivalent of the zilla parishad for Siliguri subdivision  in June when the Congress took control of three of the four panchayat samitis and almost snatched the parishad.         
	The CPMs Siliguri strongman, Asok Bhattacharya, admitted that Gorkhaland had taken a back seat during the civic polls. That issue did not work this time. We accept our defeat, he said.

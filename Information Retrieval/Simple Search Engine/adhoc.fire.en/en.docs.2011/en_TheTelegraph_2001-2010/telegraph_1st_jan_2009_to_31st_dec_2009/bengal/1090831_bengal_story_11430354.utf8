          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Midnapore, Aug. 30: The Congress has called a 12-hour bandh in Chandrakona on Tuesday in protest against the police firing yesterday that killed a college student.         
	The police had fired eight rounds when a mob protesting the death of a motorcyclist attacked them.        
	Local residents were enraged after a truck, in an attempt to run away from bribe-thirsty policemen, mowed down the motorcyclist.         
	We have called the bandh in protest against yesterdays police firing at Ramjivanpur, said Nirmal Ghosh, the district Congress president who visited Soumen Des house.        
	Trinamul minister Mukul Roy also visited the Des house in Ramjivanpur and claimed Soumen was a supporter of his party.

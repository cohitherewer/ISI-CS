	Calcutta, March 13: The high court today said it would ensure that a Supreme Court bar on production of bricks within 1.5km of mango orchards between February and May was implemented in Bengal.        
	A division bench headed by Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar asked police to keep strict vigil and submit reports regularly. The order followed a petition last week by orchard owner Bablu Sarkar of Barasat, North 24-Parganas.

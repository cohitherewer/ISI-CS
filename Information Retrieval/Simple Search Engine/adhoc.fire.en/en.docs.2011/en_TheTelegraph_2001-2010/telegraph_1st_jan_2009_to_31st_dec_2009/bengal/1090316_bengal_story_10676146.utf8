The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Class for cadres on skirting land
                                                                                                               Class for cadres on skirting land
          BISWAJIT ROY                              
	Calcutta, March 15: The CPM held workshops across south Bengal today to educate its campaigners on how to focus on national issues and skirt the row over land acquisition, a day after Mamata Banerjee vowed over a pot of Nandigram soil to make it her poll plank.        
	Industries minister Nirupam Sen, Calcutta North candidate Mohammad Salim and senior leaders Gautam Deb and Raghunath Kushari addressed 500 leading campaigners of the partys city unit.         
	State secretariat member Shyamal Chakraborty and ministers Surjya Kanta Mishra and Subhas Chakraborty spoke in North 24-Parganas and East Midnapore.        
	They educated campaigners about our stand on key national issues and how to deal with the Oppositions charges. It will help the rank and file reach out to the people with a clear understanding, said small industries minister Manab Mukherjee, in charge of campaign in the city.        
	His remarks underlined the CPMs keenness to avoid the one issue that has helped the Opposition dent the Lefts rural base. The Opposition may harp on land since they want the general election to be fought on local issues, but we will not. We will stress national issues like the economic crisis and the Centres policies on which the Opposition has failed to spell out its stand.        
	With the Third Front sp- ringing to life again and with it the possibility of the CPMs role as king-maker, the leaders asked the campaigners to stress the need to elect more Left MPs from Bengal.         
	According to the particip-ants, industrialisation, the partys main plank for the 2001 and 2006 Assembly elections, will be on the backburner in rural areas. The promise of rice at Rs 2 a kilo for the rural poor, and projects for minorities, Scheduled Castes, tribals, self-help groups and rural infras- tructure will be showcased as evidence of the states pro-people policies in contrast to those of the pro-elite UPA.         
	The need for industries and jobs will be stressed only in the cities. New industry is needed even more during a downturn, when people are losing jobs. We will urge the people to give their verdict on the Trinamul-led Oppositions destructive politics, which has hurt Singur and other projects, Mukherjee said.        
	With Muslims making up 27 per cent of the states electorate and a sizeable chunk of Mamatas Calcutta South constituency, Salim told the campaigners to harp on her links with the BJP. She had joined hands with the communal BJP when it had 10 per cent votes in the state. She started wooing the Muslims after the BJPs vote share plummeted, he told the meeting.         
	Basu to skip meet        
	The 94-year-old Jyoti Basu, whom the CPM has decided to present as a symbol of continuity, is unlikely to attend the Left workers meeting at Salt Lake Stadium tomorrow.         
	An aide blamed his failing health. A video of a speech by Basu will be played before the crowd.

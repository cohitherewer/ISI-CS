The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Puri victim found
                                                                                                               Puri victim found
          OUR BUREAU                                          Ranjit, Sayan and Arindam				                                 
	Nov. 1: The body of an engineering student washed away by the sea in Puri during high tide yesterday was found this morning.        
	Arindam Haldar, 23, was the third student of Kalyani Government Engineering College found dead since last night. The others are Sayan Barui, 21, and Ranjit Singh, 23.         
	Over 100 students of the college, about 100km from Calcutta, had arranged the trip taking advantage of the long weekend. They left for the seaside town on two chartered buses on Thursday.        
	Yesterday afternoon, almost all of them went to take a dip in the sea, said BTech student Deep Chatterjee.        
	We were wading through knee-deep or waist-high water when a huge wave crashed at a place where some of our mates were bathing. Seven students were sucked into the sea, said Chatterjee.        
	The nulias who were on the beach dived in immediately but they only got hold of four, he added.        
	Three of those rescued had to be hospitalised. However, Anirban Sengupta, Mukesh Singh and Subhadeep Sapuin were released by this evening.        
	Some of the students had told their families they were going on an educational trip, possibly because that would make obtaining permission easier. Principal Krishnendu Chakraborty said they had gone on their own. However, we had still asked them to give us in writing from where they hired the buses and where they were going to put up, said Chakraborty.        
	Had it been an educational trip, teachers would have accompanied the students.        
	The states director of technical education, Sajal Dasgupta, and another official went to Puri today to ensure the students did not have to face trouble in getting the bodies and arranging their transportation.        
	Trucks carrying the bodies left Puri this afternoon. Sayan was from Burdwans Katwa, Arindam from Burdwans Purbasthali and Ranjit from Kharagpur, West Midnapore.        
	Arindams sister Anindita said he had told them he was going on an education trip and would not venture into the sea. My brother never liked seawater. It made him nauseous, said Anindita, a first-year MA student.        
	The principal said four students had stayed back to accompany the injured home. The others left Puri by bus today.

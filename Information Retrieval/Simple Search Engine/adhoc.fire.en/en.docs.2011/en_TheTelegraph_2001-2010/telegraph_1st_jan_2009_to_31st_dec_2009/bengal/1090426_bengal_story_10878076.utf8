	Calcutta, April 25: Rahul Gandhi today said he had fond memories of Mamata Banerjee from his boyhood.        
	I met Mamataji when I was very small. She used to come and meet my father. I had also seen her coming to my grandmothers house. So I have fond memories of Mamataji and would like to meet her. I havent spoken to her of late. I admire her simplicity. She is a grassroots person who keeps contact with the people, he said in Calcutta.        
	A few months after Indira Gandhis death in 1984, Mamata won the Jadavpur Lok Sabha seat and debuted as an MP, defeating the CPMs Somnath Chatterjee. Since then, a port-rait of Rajiv Gandhi has adorned her Kalighat house.        
	Rahul said: There are lots of things that are important to many people but not important to her (Mamata). Thats why I appreciate her values. I consider her a lady of the people.        
	A Trinamul Congress leader said he was surprised by the praise given that Mamata had turned down a Congress proposal to spare the Krishnagar seat for a member of Rahuls youth brigade, Mohua Maitra. He has been extremely generous. When the Congress wanted to field Mohua following his wishes, Didi had gone ahead to name her own candidate for the seat. Its good to know Rahul doesnt bear a grudge against Didi, the Trinamul general secretary said.        
	Asked about Mamatas agitations in Singur and Nandigram, Rahul accused the state government of mismanagement. A balance between growth and the rights of people is required.... In Singur and Nandigram, the balance was mismanaged. If a government is sensitive, more than enough can be done. But if it is insensitive to the rights of the people, problems will occur.        
	If his praise for Mamata was sweet to Trinamul ears, the Congress scion also revealed his sweet tooth. I am very fond of mishti doi. I hope to have some today, he said.        
	Suman assets probe        
	Trinamuls Jadavpur candidate Kabir Suman is facing a probe for allegedly giving false information in his nomination papers. He can contest the polls but can be jailed for up to six months for claiming that his wife, Bangladeshi singer Sabina Yasmin, has no assets at all, an election official said.

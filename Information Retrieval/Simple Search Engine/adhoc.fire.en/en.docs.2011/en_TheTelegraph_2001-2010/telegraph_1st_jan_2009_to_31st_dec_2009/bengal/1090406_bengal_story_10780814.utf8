The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Cong, Left want more voting time in Purulia
                                                                                                               Cong, Left want more voting time in Purulia
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Purulia, April 5: The Congress and the Left have opposed the Election Commissions decision to reduce polling time in Maoist stronghold Purulia, saying most people prefer vo-ting after their daily chores and lunch.        
	On April 2, the poll panel slashed voting time in Joypur, Bagmundi and Balarampur by two hours, citing security concerns.         
	The normal time for voting is 7am-5pm. But in these areas, as well as in Bandwan and Binpur in Jhargram, West Midnapore, voting would close after 3pm, the poll panel said.        
	Forward Bloc candidate Narahari Mahato and the Congresss Shantiram Mahato to-day met Purulia district magistrate Shantanu Basu, also the returning officer, and asked him to revoke the decision.        
	District Congress chief Nepal Mahato has written to Basu and chief electoral officer Debashis Sen explaining the reasons why the party wants voting till 5pm.         
	We have seen in past that people prefer to finish their work in the morning, have lunch and then go to the polling booths to vote. If the polling ends at 3pm, many wont be able to vote, he said.        
	Nishikanta Mehta, a Bloc state secretariat member, said: If the rest of the state can vote from 7am to 5pm, we dont understand why these few Assembly segments should have less voting time. On behalf of our candidate Narahari Mahato, we requested the district magistrate to request the chief electoral officer to allow voting till 5pm.

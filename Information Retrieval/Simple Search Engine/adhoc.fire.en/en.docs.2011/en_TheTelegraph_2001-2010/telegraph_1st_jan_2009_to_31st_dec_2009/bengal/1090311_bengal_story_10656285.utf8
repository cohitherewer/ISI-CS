	Santiniketan, March 10: A motley group of jailed murderers and thieves are now in Santiniketan to perform two of Tagores most celebrated dance operas.        
	From Behrampore, Midnapore and Calcutta, they came driven by the desire to stage Tagore in his hallowed Visva-Bharati.        
	For Maharaj Pramanik, a resident of Bolpur who has been sentenced to life for murder, it was a homecoming of sorts. It was a great feeling for me when I performed at Gour Prangan last evening. As I hail from Bolpur, I have often seen students and artistes perform in Santiniketan. I never thought I will be there one day, said Maharaj, 27, tears rolling down his cheeks, eyes cast on the open-air stage on the university campus.         
	He played Jack in Tasher Desh (Land of Cards). It is ab-out a prince who, tired of life in his palace, goes in search of adventure, accompanied by a far more conventional travelling companion, a merchant. Their ship gets wrecked and the duo find themselves in the land of cards.         
	Among others in the cast was Chandana Mondal, 36, the queen of spades. The Malda resident is also a lifer.         
	The group, though, has found a new calling in stage shows. Chandana has performed in Rabindra Sadan. But per- forming in Tagores Santiniketan was different. I was overwhelmed, she said.        
	Tourists, here for Basanta Utsav, Visva-Bharati students and teachers, and Santiniketan residents watched in rapt attention.        
	I was impressed, said Maushumi Bhattacharya, a teacher of journalism and mass communication.        
	Unlike in most Tagore dance dramas, there were no separate groups to sing and dance. The dancers were singing as well in this case and Maushumi was among many who felt it was brilliant.         
	Jail authorities had approached Visva-Bharati for space to stage Tasher Desh and Valmiki Pratibha (The Genius of Valmiki)        
	Valmiki Pratibha was staged tonight, with 52 prisoners from Midnapore and Presidency jails, and the womens correctional home in Alipore in the cast.         
	The prisoners had requested us to organise a show in Tagores land. We approached Visva-Bharati and they readily accepted our proposal, said B.D. Sharma, additional director-general of prisons.        
	Vice-chancellor Rajat Kanta Ray gifted the performers a framed photograph of Tagore taking part in his own production of Tasher Desh.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Tribals free roads in Lalgarh 
                                                                                                               Tribals free roads in Lalgarh 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Midnapore, Jan. 8: The tribal group leading the agitation against alleged police atrocities in Bengals Lalgarh today announced it wouldnt dig up roads, but stuck to its stand of shutting out police.        
	Chhatradhar Mahato, the leader of the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities in the West Midnapore town, said the decision not to obstruct roads had been taken because common people are suffering.        
	Common people are suffering because of our blocking roads and digging them up. Also, the tribal festival of Makar Sankranti on January 14 is approaching. If we do not call off our agitation, the people will suffer economically. We dont want to create any inconvenience to people, said Chhatradhar.         
	However, he made it clear the boycott of the police, renewed after a committee meeting on January 6, would continue.        
	We found that despite our demand, the West Midnapore superintendent of police did not come to Dalilpur or any other place in Lalgarh and apologise. So we have decided to boycott the police, said Chattradhar.         
	No policemen will be allowed to enter the villages and those who do, will be confined, he said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                        
	Calcutta, Aug. 27: If Mamata Banerjee wants to do it immediately, Biman Bose prefers to do it in advance.        
	Before Calcuttans begin to grumble about another traffic-stopping rally  this time the Left Fronts  the CPM leader requested airport-bound residents to leave home early on August 31.        
	On Monday afternoon, at the Esplanade corridor that has come to be known as the Metro channel, the Left will hold a rally to commemorate 50 years of its food movement.         
	I request those going to the airport or Howrah or Sealdah station on August 31 to leave home with enough time to spare since they would have to make detours to reach their destination, Bose said.         
	The CPM state secretary said he knew that people would be a little inconvenienced since the rally would be held on a working day. But we hope people wont mind and bear with us as we have no other alternative, he said.        
	Fifty years of the historic day cannot be observed earlier or later. Even if we decide not to hold a rally on the road, the huge processions would cause problems in traffic movement, he said in justification.        
	Bose expects a footfall of at least five to six lakh.         
	The districts close to the city have been told to ensure a massive assembly of people to observe the historic day. Fifty years back, the then Congress governments police killed 80 demonstrators at Esplanade and adjoining areas. We will launch a new food movement as a food crisis is looming large again, Bose added.         
	There was a thoughtful touch, too, for the ailing and students. The rallyists would be asked to make way for ambulances and school vehicles.         
	I know it is exam time in schools now. Children attending morning session are unlikely to face much difficulty in reaching home. We would request the rallyists not to detain the afternoon students, Bose said.         
	Do it immediately was Mamatas catchphrase at her first meeting with industry captains on August 21 after taking charge at Rail Bhavan.        
	Bose and other CPM leaders had earlier denied that the decision to hold the rally in Esplanade was to counter the Trinamul Congresss annual rally ritual on its Martyrs Day on July 21 in the same area. But chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had made the politics of competitive mobilisation clear by referring to August 31 as our martyrs day and exhorting the front faithful to flood the city roads on Monday. Let the streets be the platform for our turnaround, he said.        
	Bose today said cooking and lighting stoves in the Maidan and adjoining areas close to the rally venue would be prohibited in view of the partys brush with courts and environmentalists. They (the rallyists) have also been asked not to enter into any clash with commuters.         
	All processions would be asked to follow designated routes and park their vehicles accordingly. No processions will pass through Park Street, the AJC Bose Road flyover, Strand Road and Bidhan Sarani.         
	The roads will show us the road, Bose said, forecasting a path to political recovery.         
	Rail regrets        
	Bose today regretted the CPM youth wing supporters rampage in Serampore station yesterday but blamed railway minister Mamata for triggering the youths anger.        
	The youth wing activists went on the rampage after be- ing told to clear out because leaflets they were distributing were littering the premises.

                                                                                                               Buddha gaffe on missing cops 
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 24: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees comment in Delhi that two constables ab- ducted from Lalgarh in July had been killed sent officials in Calcutta into a tizzy as there is no confirmation of their deaths yet.         
	Without naming Kanchan Garai and Sabir Mollah, the chief minister told a news conference: Earlier, they (Maoists) had kidnapped two constables and they were killed and then they killed two policemen in the police station in this incident (at Sankrail).        
	Ever since the two were reported missing on July 30, the state had maintained that it had no information on them.        
	Soon after Bhattacharjees comment, home secretary Ardhendu Sen said: There has been some misunderstanding. The chief minister might have been referring to some earlier incident because we have no information about them. But it is for sure that both Kanchan and Sabir were kidnapped by Maoists.        
	Chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti added: Our first effort will be to trace Kanchan and Sabir. We arent sure whether they are alive or not.        
	Hours later, on his return to Calcutta, Bhattacharjee said: Im sorry if there was confusion about my remarks... concerning these two policemen, Kanchan Garai and Sabir Mollah. They were kidnapped by the Maoists and the state is making all efforts to find them.        
	Before the clarification came, Mamata Banerjee said she would meet the Union home minister on Tuesday along with the missing cops relatives to clear the confusion created by the state government.        
	The chief minister made a statement and then changed it two hours later, Mamata said later. There is a deep-rooted conspiracy in this. It is not clear whether, if at all, they were murdered by the Maoists or by CPM cadres.         
	Sabirs elder brother Sharif, his wife Dalia and Kanchans parents Basudeb and Minati met the Trinamul Congress chief this afternoon.         
	Mamata said it was a great relief that Sankrail OC Atindranath Dutta had returned home, but added: The whole thing appears to be stage-managed and needs to be probed.        
	The chief secretary said the government was willing to enter into a dialogue with the Maoists to get the abducted constables back. If we are able to ascertain that they are alive we will make all sorts of efforts and hold talks with the Maoists to get them freed as in the case of Sankrail OC Atindranath Dutta, Chakrabarti said.         
	Lalgarh blast: Maoists detonated two crude bombs within minutes of each other on the Lalgarh-Ramgarh road this afternoon. They missed their target  12 bike-borne jawans.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Willing farmers unwilling after 2 years 
                                                                                                               Willing farmers unwilling after 2 years 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Durgapur, Oct. 2: Two years ago, over 1,500 farmers had volunteered to give up land for industry in Ausgram, Burdwan. Two days ago, officials who went to circulate a notice on cheque distribution there, were told to stay away.        
	About 60 farmers, believed to be Trinamul Congress supporters in an area that is still a CPM stronghold, ringed the land department officials for three hours, saying their multi-crop land cannot be acquired for industry.        
	On June 6, 2007, more than 1,500 farmers had offered the government 2,500 acres for an industrial hub in Ausgram and Kanksa blocks, 160km from Calcutta. They gave district magistrate Manish Jain a memorandum requesting the government to set up industrial units there. Besides compensation, the farmers had asked for jobs for a member of each family losing land.         
	On Wednesday, the script read different. I will not sell my fertile land for any industry. I had objected during the public hearing but I was not heard. Many are not happy with the land price, said Indrajit Konar, who owns over six acres in two villages.         
	Ashok Malakar, who has switched to Trinamul from the CPM, said the government should exclude double and multi-crop plots from the 500 acres it acquired in the first phase. The government should not take our double and multi-crop land. They should settle the price after talking to us and not CPM leaders.         
	District officials said there was little two-crop land in the area. Of the 500 acres we acquired in the first phase, only 75 acres is two-crop. The rest is single-crop, an official said.         
	The farmers would be given between Rs 8 lakh and Rs 10.8 lakh per acre according to the decision reached after several all-party meetings, only the first of which Trinamul attended. Additional district magistrate (land acquisition) Abhijeet Mukhopadhyay said: Trinamul attended only the first of the nine meetings. During hearings there were no objections from the 600 farmers owning the 500 acres.        
	But Trinamul is not ready to give up easily, given the mood in the ranks after a series of successes in elections. Prabhat Chatterjee, its working president in the Burdwan industry belt, said we want details of all projects to be set up but he failed to explain why no one came to the meetings.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Mamata stirs on Rajarhat
                                                                                                               Mamata stirs on Rajarhat
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Mamata at the rally. (Amit Datta)                                  
	Calcutta, Sept. 8: Mamata Banerjee today demanded the return of 10,000 acres taken from farmers at gunpoint in Rajarhat but later clarified she meant the land acquired for the IT township project scrapped yesterday.        
	The Trinamul Congress leaders clarification suggests that around 400 acres would be on the crosshairs, not flats and other residential property spread over the area.        
	In keeping with her newly acquired pro-industry image, Mamata also took care to say she was not blaming Infosys and Wipro, terming the two companies which were promised land in the abandoned project victims.        
	Infosys and Wipro cannot be blamed for the mess because they have become victims. I want the two IT giants not to leave the state. They can be provided alternative land elsewhere, she told a rally on a ground where a brawl that foll- owed a football match ignited the Vedic Village flare-up.        
	Mamata did not disappoint those familiar with her Singur rhetoric either. I have information that nearly 10,000 acres have been acquired at gunpoint from poor farmers for the New Town project. I want the land to be returned to them.        
	Later, the Trinamul leader said she wanted the land acquired near New Town for the IT project to be returned. So far, the private promoters have acquired around 400 acres which, according to the government, has not been formally transferred to either the state-run Webel or a joint venture that was supposed to build the project.        
	Mamata said she would form a panel on the lines of the Singur Save Farmland Committee to spearhead the Rajarhat campaign.        
	The Trinamul leader had been so far uncharacteristically muted on the Vedic Village controversy, drawing charges that she was soft-pedalling because of her partys associations with the land sharks in the region.        
	The CPMs Rajarhat strongman and housing minister, Gautam Deb, had also said that all political players were taken into confidence in Rajarhat, holding aloft his model of inclusive development.        
	Todays rally by Mamata is being seen as an attempt to address suggestions that Trinamul was also in cahoots with the CPM in helping with the land acquisition in Rajarhat.        
	Mamata asked her partys new labour wing leader, Naxalite Purnendu Bose, to work out the strategy for a sustained agitation by Saturday.         
	However, sources said she was unlikely to launch the agitation during the festival season.        
	She also slightly modified her earlier stand, adding a CBI probe to her wish list. Earlier, the Trinamul leader was stressing an inquiry by the newly formed National Investigation Agency to look into the arms cache found on the Vedic property  a demand she repeated today.

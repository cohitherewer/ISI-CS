                                                                                                               Poll observers
                            
	May 11: The Election Commission has decided to send eight additional observers to Bengal for Wednesdays polls.         
	Two observers will go to Barrackpore, two to Joynagar, two to Mathurapur, one to Diamond Harbour and one to Jadavpur, deputy election commissioner R. Balakrishnan said in Delhi.        
	Chief electoral officer Debashis Sen said in Calcutta the observers were being sent because the areas were perceived to be sensitive and not because of demands made by parties.

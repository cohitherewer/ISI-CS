          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Sahagunj, March 4: The government has called the Dunlop unions and the management to a meeting tomorrow to clear the confusion about the reopening of the Sahagunj factory on Friday with only a handful of its 1,189 workers.        
	Subdivisional officer Abhijeet Mitra said: I called the meeting because there is some confusion among workers about the reopening with only the maintenance staff, which needs to be cleared. We will hold the talks so that peace is maintained at the factory.        
	The Citu and Intuc unions at the plant said their leaders would attend the meeting, but sought talks in the presence of the labour minister or the industries minister.        
	Citus Dipankar Roy said the management had informed the union that work at the plant would resume with 229 workers. It said operations would gradually begin in other wings. We want the talks to ensure smooth operations and payment of arrears, Roy said.         
	Intuc leader Bijon Sarkar wanted a guarantee from chairman Pawan Ruia that the factory would not be shut again.

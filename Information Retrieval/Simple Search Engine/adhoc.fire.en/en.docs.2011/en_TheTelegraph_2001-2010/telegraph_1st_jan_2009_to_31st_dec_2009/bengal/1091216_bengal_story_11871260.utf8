	Beldanga, Dec. 15: Two RSP workers were stabbed and bombed early this morning by alleged Congress activists out to avenge the death of a party colleague in September.         
	The dead were identified as brothers Awal Hossain, 40, and Ataur Hossain, 24, who had been missing from their home at Mirzapur village in Murshidabads Beldanga, about 180km from Calcutta, since being named as the accused in the murder of Yasin Sheikh.        
	They were knifed several times, it seems. After that, bombs were hurled to ensure their death. Another RSP worker, who was accompanying them, managed to escape, a police officer said.         
	Awal, Ataur and Moni Khan sneaked into Mirzapur around 5.30am today. An RSP leader said they could not afford to stay away from home during the harvesting season.

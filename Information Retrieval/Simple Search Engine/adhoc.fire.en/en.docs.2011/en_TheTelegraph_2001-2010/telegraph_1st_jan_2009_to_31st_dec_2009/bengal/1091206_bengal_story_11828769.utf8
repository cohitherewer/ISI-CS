The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Singur prod to Bhel 
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Singur prod to Bhel 
          ANINDYA SENGUPTA                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 5: The state government has written to Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (Bhel) saying it would be economically unwise not to explore Singur as a site for its power plant.        
	We told Bhel that the state is ready with all infrastructure support required for a thermal power project in Singur, said Debashish Sen, the managing director of the West Bengal Power Development Corporation (WBPDCL), an arm of the power department. If Bhel opts out of Singur, it would be economically unwise of them.        
	Last month, in the letter to WBPDCL, with which Bhel was supposed to set up the plant, the PSUs general manager (marketing), S.C. Mittal, said it appears that the project is not feasible at the site.        
	The site was the 997 acres on which the Tatas had built their Nano plant in Singur.        
	Bhel had raised several concerns  of land being inadequate because it wanted 1,500 acres, the lack of a water source nearby, the low-lying nature of the land and the question of environment clearance as power plant byproducts such as fly ash are pollutants.        
	In its letter, WBPDCL said the project could come up on 1,000 acres. Technical teams from both sides could sit and work it out, Sen said. The letter cited a proposed power plant in Katwa, Burdwan, on 1,000 acres.        
	On the question of a water source, WBPDCL said Singur was just 18km from the Hooghly and a pipeline could be laid from Serampore. Bhel had said laying a pipeline would escalate costs and require more land.         
	The government also said the low-lying land could be raised, another option Bhel did not seem keen on because of costs.        
	But Sen said: In a joint venture project, the cost will be shared. For a project of the size that we are planning, the extra cost in laying the pipeline and raising the land level would be marginal.         
	Coal supply could be arranged for as Singur is well connected by rail, WBPDCL said.

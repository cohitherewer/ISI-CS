                                                                                                               Rebel trial under tree
                            
	Durgapur, Sept. 2: Maoists tried a forest officer in a kangaroo court last night and fined him Rs 25,000 for allegedly turning a blind eye to felling in the Ayodhya hills of Purulia.        
	We will return in a week, the money should be ready, a guerrilla leader shouted at beat officer Naresh Kumar Shit before ransacking his office and setting documents on fire.        
	Some of Shits juniors were also herded to the trial under a tree outside the Balarampur beat office and accused of irregularities in the distribution of pattas (tilling rights) for forest land, but only he was fined.         
	Fifteen armed men in olive green fatigues arrived at the single-storey office at the foothills of Ayodhya around Tuesday midnight. The guerrillas called a forest guard, Jawaharlal Majhi, by his name and asked him to wake up the others. They told us well be tried for our faults, said another guard, Rabilochan Hembram.

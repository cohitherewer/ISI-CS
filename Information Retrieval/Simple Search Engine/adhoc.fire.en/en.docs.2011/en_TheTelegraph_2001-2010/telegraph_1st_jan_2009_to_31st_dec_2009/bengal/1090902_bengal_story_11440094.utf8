The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Party factions fight over VC job
                                                                                                               Party factions fight over VC job
          MITA MUKHERJEE                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 1: Rivalry between two pro-Left teachers groups at Kalyani University has stalled the appointment of a new vice-chancellor, which had been cleared by the universitys highest policy-making body.         
	Current VC Aurobindo Das, whose term ended yesterday, was given an extension by the chancellor, governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi, following an appeal on August 26 by some members of the same panel that had recommended physical education teacher Alok Banerjee as his successor a fortnight ago.         
	Sources said Gandhi did not reject Banerjees candidature but granted a two-month extension to Das following an appeal against the former and charges of corruption levelled against him by a section of the universitys teaching and non-teaching staff.        
	Banerjee is a member of the CPMs Kalyani local committee. Das isnt a party member but is close to it.        
	Allegedly under pressure from a section of the party, Banerjee wrote to the chancellor later he was reluctant to accept the post.        
	The faction backing Das had demanded an assurance from the party that after being released from Kalyani, he would be able to return to Burdwan University, where he used to teach chemistry. But the other faction wanted Das replaced immediately, said a member of the anti-CPM All Bengal University Teachers Association.        
	According to Tarun Naskar, its general secretary, Das cannot rejoin Burdwan immediately because the university had not followed norms while granting him a five-year extension as a teacher after he reached 60 in 2007.         
	The Kalyani University administration will collapse if this dirty lobbying doesnt stop. Such an incident has never happened in its 49 years, said a senior teacher.        
	Das expressed surprise about the hue and cry. Im here because the chancellor has asked me to carry on for two months, said Das.        
	Banerjee said: The charges against me are false.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Blackout scare this summer
                                                                                                               Blackout scare this summer
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Jan. 20: Power minister Mrinal Banerjee today warned of power cuts after February if inadequate supply of coal persisted and also blamed deteriorating fuel quality for the rising cost of generation.        
	We get 40,000 tonnes from Coal India Ltd while we need 55,000 tonnes a day, he told an energy seminar organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce.        
	If the trend continues, the West Bengal Power Development Corporation (WBPDCL) will have to stall several projects planned this year, he said, adding that power shortage will go up after February with the onset of summer.        
	WBPDCL managing director S. Mahapatra said the corporation required 16 rakes of coal (each contains 3,500 tonnes, which can generate 200MW in a day). Against this, we are getting 12 rakes a day, he said, which, power officials pointed out, could lead to a deficit of 2000MW from the daily summer-time demand of around 4500MW.        
	Both Banerjee and Mahapatra blamed CIL for supplying poor quality coal. The coal we get from CIL contains as much as 45 per cent to 50 per cent ash, Mahapatra said.        
	Banerjee said the coal the WBPDCL consumed to generate one unit of power had gone up from 650gm in 2005-2006 to 900gm in 2008. This has increased the cost of production from Rs 1.26 to Rs 1.42 a unit, a consequence of deterioration of quality of coal, he added.        
	Fire at Santaldih        
	A fire broke out at the Santaldih thermal power plant, about 300km from Calcutta, forcing a shutdown. It took five hours to bring the blaze, which started at 1.30pm and spread through cables, under control.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Abductors arrested
                                                                                                               Abductors arrested
                            
	Durgapur, Jan. 31: Police today claimed to have busted an interstate gang behind many of the recent abductions in the region, including that of Durgapur businessman Shantanu Mukherjee last month.        
	Bijay Singh and his four associates were arrested from a Durgapur fuel pump around 12.30pm yesterday, Burdwan police chief R. Rajsekharan said. Today, we picked up seven others from an abandoned Eastern Coalfields (ECL) staff quarter near Kulti (close to Asansol) where Singh stayed.         
	Singh and Co have apparently admitted being involved in the abduction of local businessmen Naresh Maundia, Sanjay Bagaria and Mukherjee. All three had been freed after large amounts were paid as ransom, the police said.         
	A probe is on to find out how Singh, who had escaped from a Bihar jail in 2004 and allegedly masterminded at least 18 murders and kidnappings in Bihar, Jharkhand and Bengal, put up at the ECL quarters.

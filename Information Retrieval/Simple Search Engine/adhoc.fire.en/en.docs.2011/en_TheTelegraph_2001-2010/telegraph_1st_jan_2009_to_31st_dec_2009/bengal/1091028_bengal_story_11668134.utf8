          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Behrampore, Oct. 27: Two CPM supporters were killed this afternoon in a Murshidabad village rocked by clashes tracing their roots to a turf war with the Congress.        
	Todays incident in Saralakishorpur village in the Suti area of the district is being seen as the fallout of a clash on Saturday that had left two Congress supporters and the local CPM branch committee secretary, Pratap Mondal, injured.         
	The village is a stronghold of the CPM, which controls the local panchayat.        
	The murders of Dhojen Mondal, 30, and Jaifal Mondal, 35, came days before a peace meeting, called by the villagers, this Friday in an effort to defuse the tension.        
	Dhojen and Jaifal were in a tea stall around 12.30pm when about a dozen alleged Congress supporters hurled bombs. Jaifal was killed on the spot while Dhojen died on the way to hospital.        
	As word about their deaths spread, CPM activists stormed the houses of Congress supporters, dragged many out of their homes and beat them up. Seven Congress supporters were injured. The CPM supporters ransacked six houses, a police officer said.        
	Superintendent of police B.L. Meena said todays violence was a fallout of Saturdays clash. We have set up a picket in the village and are looking for the culprits, the SP said.        
	CPM leaders in Suti have threatened to block roads from tomorrow if the culprits are not arrested immediately.

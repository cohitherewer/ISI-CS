The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Seize guns: Mukul
                                                                                                               Seize guns: Mukul
                            
	Khanakul, Oct. 12: Union minister Mukul Roy asked police to seize arms stockpiled by CPM cadres in Hooghlys Khanakul and warned officers that they were under watch a day after at least three Trinamul Congress supporters were shot and injured in a clash.        
	Im asking the police to seize the illegal arms stockpiled by CPM cadres here. If they dont do their job... the future wont be happy for them. We are noting down everything. The activities of every police officer are being recorded, he said.         
	Alleged CPM activists had shot at Trinamul supporter Farid Midda yesterday morning when he was opening his sweets shop flouting a bandh call. Trinamul supporters from several neighbouring villages converged on the spot and the clash followed.         
	Roy, the junior Union shipping minister, visited the Balipur bazaar where Middas shop is located but held a rally a few kilometres away because prohibitory orders had been clamped.        
	He demanded deployment of central forces at Khanakul. If they can be deployed to combat Maoists in Lalgarh, why cant the same happen in Khanakul?        
	Roy accused the chief minister of planning yesterdays incident. Before leaving the state, he leaves instructions with the police and party cadres to do something brutal, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Cong adrenaline rush
                                                                                                               Cong adrenaline rush
          ANINDYA SENGUPTA                              
	Calcutta, July 16: State Congress leaders have spied a chance to return to the political centre stage seizing the Mangalkot flare-up instead of riding piggyback on the Trinamul Congress.        
	Since the 1998 Lok Sabha elections, the Congress has been on the sidelines while Mamata Banerjee has occupied the Oppositions space .         
	In todays protests, Congress state working president Subrata Mukherjee saw hope of a turnaround. Congress activists coming out on the roads, deflating bus tyres and setting them ablaze are things we had forgotten, particularly after Mamata took the centre stage. Todays protests in Calcutta and the districts show all is not lost for us. Mangalkot should revive the Congresss fortunes if we can use it to rejuvenate our party. It is time to go hammer and tongs at the CPM, he said.        
	The change of equations in Delhi could also aid the state Congress. During the previous UPA regime, the Left had extended support to the Congress. But after the last Lok Sabha elections, the Left ceased to be a key player in Delhi because of its diminished strength in Parliament and its falling out with the Congress over the nuclear deal.         
	Bengal leaders are free of the compulsions of national politics that may have hamstrung them earlier.        
	We sat tight when Mamata was touring the districts with her Nandigram and Singur campaign, a senior state Congress leader said. People were convinced of her argument  that the government was out to grab land from poor farmers. Similarly, the Congress should cash in on Mangalkot. People should be told about the breakdown of law and order and how the CPM is trying to kill Congress leaders with the help of the administration, he said.        
	Congress MP Deepa Das Munshi agreed. Party activists were suffering from disillusionment as the organisation had not been involved in any movement for years, but Mangalkot would bring them back to political attention, she said.        
	Three instances suggest the state Congress has been trying to carve out its own space after the Lok Sabha polls.        
	First, the party stayed silent when Mamata wanted central relief for Aila victims to be sent directly to the panchayats rather than the government.         
	Second, the Congress did not stay away from the all-party meetings for Aila relief called by the government. Trinamul boycotted them.         
	Third, wherever the party has a presence, it has co-operated with the chief minister during his weekend district tours.         
	We dont want to be seen as a party that refuses to co-operate. Even then incidents like Mangalkot occur. We must take this forward as workers have regained enthusiasm, said Manas Bhuniya, who was chased through paddy fields yesterday by the CPM mob.        
	A Trinamul general secretary said: Its true the Congress wants its separate identity though we have an alliance.... Mangalkot may give the Congress a chance to gain ground in some parts of the state.

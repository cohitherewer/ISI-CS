The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | SUCI split threat to Mamata
                                                                                                               SUCI split threat to Mamata
                            
	Calcutta, Jan. 20: The SUCI today threatened to snap its alliance with the Trinamul Congress if Mamata Banerjee forged a pact with the Congress.         
	SUCI state secretary Pravas Ghosh said the divorce would be painful but inevitable. We are fighting to ward off the tiger (CPM), not to invite the crocodile (Congress).        
	He praised Mamata but said some of her aides were fence-sitters having secret ties with the Congress and the CPM.         
	The Trinamul chief had over the past few days voiced her eagerness for an alliance of Opposition parties to avert a split in votes. Observers saw her as courting the Congress, which had been giving mixed signals on a possible deal.        
	Ghosh said: The CPM- Congress break-up over the Indo-US nuke deal was temporary as both need each others support to stay in power. We hope Mamata would not fall in the trap for a grand alliance.        
	To dissuade Mamata, Ghosh is ready to forgo his demands for Lok Sabha seats.         
	CPM state secretary Biman Bose refused comment, but he has reason to be happy. Sources said an SUCI-Trinamul split would ease the pressure on the ruling front in at least two South 24-Parganas seats.

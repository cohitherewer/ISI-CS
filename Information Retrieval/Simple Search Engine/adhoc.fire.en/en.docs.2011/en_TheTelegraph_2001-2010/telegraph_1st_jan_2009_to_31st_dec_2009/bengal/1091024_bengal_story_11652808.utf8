	Calcutta, Oct. 23: When Atindranath Dutta rang the doorbell at 2.15 this morning, his family could not believe it was him. They did not expect him so early.        
	Surprise melted into complete happiness the moment they saw him at the doorstep, clad in a loose off-white swe- ater, brown T-shirt and dark trousers, just the way they had seen him on TV a few hours ago.        
	We knew he was coming, but we did not expect him to reach so early, said the police officers brother-in-law Ranjit Dutta as he unlocked the collapsible gate to their home.        
	Then, as flashbulbs popped and police commandos gently pushed aside a horde of journalists, Dutta stepped inside and touched his mothers feet before clutching his wife Indranis hand.        
	It feels great to be back home, Dutta said. Its really so exciting to be meeting my family after the last couple of harrowing days.        
	Holding his wifes hand, Dutta stepped into the adjoining room where his two-year-old daughter was sleeping.         
	Let her sleep, dont wake her up, whispered Dutta, as his wife reached out to wake up Oindrakshi.        
	Then, after having a sandesh and a glass of water, Dutta settled down on the sofa with wife and mother on either side.        
	All that he can think of now, Dutta said today, is taking a break of about two weeks.        
	During this time I will also think about my future and whether I want to continue in this job, Dutta said. I am not saying that I will resign from my job. But instead of active policing, I will be happy if I am shifted to a department like the CID.         
	Finally, at 3.30am, Dutta retired for the night.         
	On waking up, the first thing that he did was play with his daughter. Oindrakshi had woken up earlier. Finding her father on the bed, she clambered all over him, overjoyed.        
	My daughter woke me up, Dutta said. It was so wonderful to have her sitting on my chest and playing with me. After the last couple of uncertain days, I was overjoyed to be doing so.        
	Indrani, too, looked happy as she along with her husband and daughter came to a first-floor verandah of her parents Joy Mitra Street home to wave at media personnel below.        
	These last few days I could not take care of my daughter as I was worried sick about my husband, she said.         
	Today, Im relieved and very happy.        
	I cooked rice, dal, three types of fried items and vegetable curries along and also gave him curd and sweets, Indrani said. We had a vegetarian fare as we visited temples at Ahiritolla, Nimtolla, Dakshineswar and Belur during the day. Dinner will be different.        
	Through the day, relatives and neighbours flocked to their home.         
	Its just a great feeling, Dutta admitted.

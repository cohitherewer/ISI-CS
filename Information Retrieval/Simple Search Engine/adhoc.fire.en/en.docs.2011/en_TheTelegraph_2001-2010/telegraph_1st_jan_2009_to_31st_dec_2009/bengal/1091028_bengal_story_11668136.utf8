	Sasan (North 24-Parganas), Oct. 27: A stray shot fired by an alleged CPM activist today killed a labourer said to be a Trinamul supporter in a North 24-Parganas village already caught in a turf tussle between the two parties.        
	Noor Ali Mollah, 45, worked in a bheri (fishery) in Magri village, under the Barasat II panchayat.        
	Around 7.30am, about 200 armed men, allegedly backed by the CPM, ent        
	ered the Magri, about 60 km from Calcutta, brandishing firearms, often firing in air. Mollah was then guarding the Aatmoholeyr Gora bheri.        
	According to witnesses, a bullet hit Mollah in the throat, killing him on the spot.        
	Two of Mollahs six sons, Muhammad Oli Mollah, 18, and Bablu Mollah, 19, came running when they heard the gunshots from a neighbouring field.         
	We were working near- by. On hearing the gun- shots we came running. From a distance and saw our father fall, said Bablu, also a labourer.        
	As villagers ran around trying to take shelter in tea stalls and huts, a mob set one of the stalls and several shanties ablaze.         
	The CPM is worried that Sasan, where Magri is located and which was once its stronghold, is slipping out of its grasp after the Trinamul Congress bagged 12 of 14 gram panchayats in last years rural polls.         
	Majid Ali, known as Majid Master, used to call the shots in Sasan as it was a CPM bastion. He is plotting the attacks on us after his party lost the panchayat polls, said Trinamul MP from Basirhat Nurul Islam. Sasan falls under the Basirhat parliamentary constituency.        
	State Trinamul president Subrata Bakshi said he had informed Mamata Banerjee, currently in Delhi.         
	In the evening, a group of Trinamul activists led by Gaighata MLA Jyotipriya Mallik and Islam demonstrated outside the police chiefs office at Moina demanding justice.        
	Islam blamed police inaction for the growing number of such incidents in Sasan. The police have remained inactive despite our several complaints.         
	A senior police officer said reinforcements had been sent to the area.

	Calcutta: The families of police personnel killed in Maoist strikes in West Midnapore, Bankura and Purulia will get their salaries in the form of grants till the day they were to retire, the government said today.         
	The compensation for the kin has also been raised to Rs 5 lakh from Rs 2 lakh, state police chief Bhupinder Singh said. The officers killed yesterday will be covered by the new decisions.         
	However, the insurance cover of Rs 10 lakh for police personnel killed by Maoists in the three districts remains unaltered, the DG added.         
	The government is also considering giving a risk allowance of 30 per cent of the salary to the police personnel in the three districts.

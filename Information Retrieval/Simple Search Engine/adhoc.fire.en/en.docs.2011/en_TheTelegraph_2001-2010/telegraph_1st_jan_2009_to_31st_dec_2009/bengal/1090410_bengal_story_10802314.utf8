The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Lalgarh talks on EC plate, govt waits 
                                                                                                               Lalgarh talks on EC plate, govt waits 
          OUR BUREAU                          Subhas,(above) Mahato: Tough talk                                 
	Calcutta, April 9: Subhas Chakraborty wants to thrash the Lalgarh resistance leader but a cautious state government and the CPM are leaving it to a one-time enemy, the Election Commission, to deal with the tricky issue.        
	Chief electoral officer Debashis Sen today told The Telegraph he would meet Chhatradhar Mahato, the leader of the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities, by the end of this week.         
	The committee of tribals, allegedly supported by Maoists, has declared the area out of bounds for police, which makes the conduct of elections untenable there. The area goes to polls on April 30.        
	Its true that I spoke to him (Mahato) and we are in touch through someone else. We will meet, hopefully, by the end of this week, Debashis Sen said from Delhi where he was attending a meeting of the Election Commission.        
	Mahato, who was in the city today, said: The election official called me up and wanted to meet me earlier this week when I was here. I couldnt because of other work. But now I am ready to meet him any time at a place convenient to him.         
	Mahato took exception Chakrabortys comment earlier in the day that if I (the sports minister) had my way, I would have thrashed him and sent him to jail. He is unconstitutional and undemocratic.        
	Mahato asked: How can a minister say this? Let him come to Lalgarh and say it.        
	Debashis Sen declined to disclose what his strategy would be but made two points. First, that there was no formal communication from the state government on this (Lalgarh) so far. Second, that law and order was a state subject and the government did not need the poll panels permission to send forces to Lalgarh.        
	He also said his dialogue (with Mahato) should be unconditional.        
	The government, which does not want a Nandigram-like conflagration before the polls, has said the onus of sending the police to Lalgarh lies with the poll panel.        
	Home secretary Ardhendu Sen said: As of now, the police wont move into Lalgarh. We had requested the Election Commission to send its officials there to find out what the condition is like now. The government expects the Election Commission to go there. Till the commission reaches Lalgarh and does a spot inspection, the police will not enter the area.        
	CPM leader Benoy Konar said: The party is worried that police action in Lalgarh may reopen fissures in the ruling Left Front.        
	Debashis Sen said he may travel to Lalgarh as the government and Mahato wanted him to do so. I dont have any concrete plans but dont rule it out. It depends on my talks with Mahato, he said.         
	Mahato said if Debashis Sen wanted the tribals to call off their movement, election officials would have to go to Lalgarh and speak to them. Whether it is the chief minister or the Election Commission, all have to go to Lalgarh and speak to the people there.

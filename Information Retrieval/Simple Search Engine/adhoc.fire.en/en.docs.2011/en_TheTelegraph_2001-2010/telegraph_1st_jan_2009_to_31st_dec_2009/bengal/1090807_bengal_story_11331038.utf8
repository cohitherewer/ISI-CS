The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Biman cautious of Subhas review
                                                                                                               Biman cautious of Subhas review
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Subhas Chakraborty                                  
	Calcutta, Aug. 6: The CPM may be anxious to appropriate Subhas Chakrabortys popularity and use it to boost the flagging morale of cadres, but the party is in no hurry for an official revaluation of its stand on him as it might open a Pandoras box.         
	Biman Bose, Chakrabortys senior comrade and friend since the late fifties, had wept inconsolably on August 3 while announcing the death.        
	But today as the party state secretary, Bose virtually ruled out the revaluation of his late comrade who was never a copybook communist.        
	I wont speak much on it. I recalled him in an article (in the party mouthpiece Ganashakti) reflecting on his popularity among the masses and massive turnout during his last journey. But there is no such history (of political revaluation) in the Indian communist movement, Bose told a Left Front meeting.        
	A large section in the CPM feels Chakrabortys maverick ways cost him his position in the party while peers Bose, Anil Biswas, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Shyamal Chakraborty outgrew him.        
	Chakraborty remained a CPM state committee member since 1972 and a cabinet minister since 1982 without a berth in the state secretariat or the central committee.        
	The leadership inducted him in the secretariat last year, 36 years after he became a state committee member, only after Jyoti Basu prevailed upon CPM general secretary Prakash Karat. Chakraborty was also refused a seat in the central committee.        
	The lakhs that gathered at his funeral procession, however, delivered the final stamp that he was a leader of the masses. Bose, too, in his article in Ganashakti, referred to him as the stormy petrel of mass movement.        
	But reminded that the party had revised its stand on senior leaders P.C. Joshi, P. Sundarayya and Nripen Chakraborty, Bose only said: Nripenda was not revalued as long as he spoke against the party. When he admitted his mistakes, the party changed its mind.         
	Former CPM MP Tarit Topdar, however, felt Chakrabortys revaluation was not unlikely as review and revaluation are part of the communist partys practice.        
	Minister Kanti Ganguly left the decision to the people. If nobody takes initiative, conscious common people will do Subhass evaluation. Let us have faith in history, he said.        
	The front today discussed rallies it would hold on August 14 and 31  the first to condole Chakrabortys death at Netaji Indoor stadium, the second at the Esplanade Metro channel to commemorate 50 years of the Left-led food movement.

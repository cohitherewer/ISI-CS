          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Krishnagar, Feb. 17: A six- year-old boy testified in court against his mother, who was held guilty today of smothering her husband.        
	The boy stood in the wit- ness box and told the judge he saw his mother and uncle kill his father. They should be hanged, said Tanmoy.        
	The Nadia district sessions judge pronounced Rebati Ghosh, 25, and her brother-in-law Manoj, 24, guilty.         
	The two had an affair in Nadias Murutia, about 190km from Calcutta.         
	Rebati had thought little Tanmoy was fast asleep when she put the pillow on her husbands face. Sribas Ghosh, 29, a farm hand, was killed on May 31 last year.        
	Tanmoy and his brother Srikanta were sleeping with their parents that night. Very close to his dad, Tanmoy had his arm around him as usual, said his grandfather Nandakishore, 65. Suddenly, he woke up and saw Manoj enter the room. Rebati picked up the children and laid them in a corner of the bed and the two smothered Sribas with a pillow and strangled him with a wire.        
	The elderly man was stunned by the way his grandson demanded death for the killers, one of them his son.        
	Initially, police started an unnatural death case in the absence of a complaint. But people who knew about Manoj and Rebatis relationship put them on trial at a village meeting. An FIR was lodged after they confessed to their crime, Nandakishore said.        
	He loved his eldest son very much. I also love Manoj. But I want him punished, said Nandakishore.        
	The sentence will be known tomorrow. The maximum sentence could be death.

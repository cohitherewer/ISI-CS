                                                                                                               Rural signal in CM note
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, May 28: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today circulated a note among cabinet colleagues that spoke of job creation through middle and small-scale industries, not big-ticket projects.        
	The Singur and Nandigram episodes have had a negative impact on the industrialisation process of the state, the chief minister said.        
	He added that the state government would have to develop a land bank by identifying unfertile land.        
	A cabinet minister who was at the meeting said: He (Bhattacharjee) said we have only a year and eight months before the Assembly polls. So, he wanted all of us to do some stocktaking in our own departments and focus on priorities, take up time-bound programmes and ensure implementation.        
	Bhattacharjee said the government would now gear up for post-land reform programmes, like distribution of surplus plots among the landless. His notes stress was on government support for development of agriculture, animal husbandry, horticulture and pisciculture  in other words a signal to the rural voter who seemed to have deserted the Left in the Lok Sabha polls.         
	The chief minister insisted on effective implementation of the rural job scheme.         
	On minorities, another vote bank the Left seems to have lost, Bhattacharjees note sought a level playing field. He said the minorities, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes should be included in the development process. He was ready to accommodate a demand for reservation for Muslims under the OBC quota.         
	Among those present were industries minister Nirupam Sen, finance minister Asim Dasgupta, rural development and panchayat minister Surjyakanta Misra, PWD minister Kshiti Goswami, water resources minister Nandagopal Bhattacharjee, agriculture minister Naren De, fisheries minister Kiranmoy Nanda and fire minister Pratim Chatterjee.

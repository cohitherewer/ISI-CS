The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Allies pinch govt on price rise
                                                                                                               Allies pinch govt on price rise
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                      
	Calcutta, Aug. 16: The CPMs allies today told a Left Front meeting the state government could not escape responsibility by blaming the Centre for spiralling food prices.         
	They are also unhappy over the states failure in reining in the Maoists in the Lalgarh region or resolving the impasse over the fate of the 70,000-odd would-be teachers whose degrees have been branded illegal by the high court.        
	With the allies seeking answers on the governments role, front chairman and CPM state secretary Biman Bose promised a meeting in the presence of the chief minister to discuss the crises.         
	Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee wasnt there today because he was unwell.         
	The front hopes to flood the city with people on August 31 for a rally to mark 50 years of the Lefts food movement. The chief minister had urged the party faithful to use the occasion to stage a turnaround following a series of poll debacles and regain popular support by nailing the Centre on issues like price rise.        
	However, while fine-tuning plans for the rally today, the allies reminded their Big Brother they could not absolve themselves of responsibility for the present food crisis.         
	Unlike in 1959, we are in power now. It wont cut much ice with the voters if we rail against the Centre but do nothing that is in our power to check the price rise, a front veteran said after the meeting.         
	According to sources, CPI state secretary Manjukumar Mazumdar was the most vocal. Both the Centre and the state have a responsibility. People want to know what we are doing here to arrest the exorbitant rise in the prices of essentials like pulses, sugar, oil and vegetables. The state government must act before the festival season, Mazumdar was quoted as saying. The other allies voiced support.         
	Recalling the Lefts Dum Dum dawai (medicine) of the late 60s, an expression for the thrashing of people involved in black-marketing essentials, Mazumdar wondered what had happened of the present governments promised anti-hoarding drive.         
	He also complained that the promise of distributing subsidised food items had remained unfulfilled.         
	Ironically, all the food-related departments are held by ally Forward Bloc. At the meeting, someone from the CPM pointed out that the ministers from that party should be answerable to Mazumdars charges, prompting Bloc veteran Ashok Ghosh to say the entire government must act to tackle the crisis and not one party.        
	The Blocs Hafiz Alam Sairani raised the plight of the would-be teachers. The allies also wondered if the Lalgarh crackdown was of any use if the Maoists could continue their killing spree in the region.        
	Amid the flurry of complaints, Bose said he would ask the chief minister to make things clear at the next meeting.        
	CM skips Delhi trip        
	Bhattacharjee will not be able to attend the chief ministers conference in Delhi tomorrow because of illness.        
	He is running temperature, said an aide. In the chief ministers absence, chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti and home secretary Ardhendu Sen will represent the state at the meeting on security and rain deficit to be addressed by the Prime Minister.

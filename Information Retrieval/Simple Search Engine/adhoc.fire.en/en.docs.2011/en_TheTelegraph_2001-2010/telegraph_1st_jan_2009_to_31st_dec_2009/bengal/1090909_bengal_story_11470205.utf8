The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Tech school flare-up
                                                                                                               Tech school flare-up
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Gangtok, Sept. 8: The Sikkim Manipal Institute of Technology near here was shut down indefinitely today after a series of clashes between boarders and day scholars but hundreds were stuck in the hostel because of a virtual siege of the area by local people.        
	The clashes, which began on Sunday over a volleyball match, led to a raging brick battle this morning, forcing police to burst tear-gas shells and chase students across the campus with batons. The police stormed a boys hostel after a brick hit one of the personnel.         
	Eight students needed first aid at the Singtam District Hospital.        
	The hostels on the campus have about 4,000 students and, according to sources, a third of them are from Bengal.        
	The institute said arrangements would be made to evacuate those wanting to go home.         
	A fourth-year BTech student from Lake Gardens in Calcutta said over the phone: We have been told that we will be escorted to Siliguri by the army at 4.30am tomorrow. I am in touch with my parents.         
	Personnel from the Sikkim Armed Police and the India Reserve Battalion have thrown a cordon around the campus, about 45km from Gangtok.        
	Bengal home secretary Ardhendu Sen said the state was ready to help the institute evacuate the students if it wanted.        
	A Sikkim police officer said talks were on with students to end the impasse.        
	The trouble broke out over a foul during the volleyball match. It was a trivial incident, but snowballed after day scholars accompanied by outsiders beat up three students  Ujjwal Kumar, Jitender and Gautam Jha. Instead of taking the injured to hospital, the police took them to Rangpo police station, said a fourth-year electrical and electronics engineering student.        
	We are being targeted by outsiders and the authorities are blind to this, he added.

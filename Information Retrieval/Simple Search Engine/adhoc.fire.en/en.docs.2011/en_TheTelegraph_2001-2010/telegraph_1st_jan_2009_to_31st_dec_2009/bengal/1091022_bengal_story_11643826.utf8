The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Crisis on CMs Delhi agenda
                                                                                                               Crisis on CMs Delhi agenda
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 21: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is likely to meet Union home minister P. Chidambaram during his three-day visit to Delhi from tomorrow and discuss the situation arising out of the Maoist attacks and abduction.        
	He will try to meet Chidambaram to discuss the Maoist attacks and abduction. He wants to get his next move to tackle the menace approved by the Centre, said an official in Calcutta.        
	According to CPM insiders, the states moves are going to be decided in close co-ordination with the Centre. They said though Bhattacharjee was going to Delhi for a CPM central committee session, his meetings on its sidelines would focus on the crisis in Bengal and the crackdown being planned by the Centre across the Maoist-hit states.        
	The chief minister will also brief the partys central leadership about the Maoist menace at the meeting, convened to finalise the CPM document on internal rectification.        
	However, party leaders said Bhattacharjee might skip the party meeting if the situation at home so warranted.        
	He was in touch with the Union home minister during the day.        
	To many in the CPM there is nothing new in Maoists abducting policemen, but the party and the government have been put in a spot by the guerrillas publicity blitzkrieg using the media to put forward their demands.         
	The Maoists now want to present a human face by shedding tears for innocent tribal women. Let them come out with the list of innocent tribal women who have been wrongly detained. The truth is their women cadres led the raid yesterday and killed and kidnapped policemen, said CPM state secretariat member Mohammad Salim.         
	It shows the Maoists desperation for public sympathy to mount pressure on the government for the withdrawal of the joint forces from the Lalgarh region. They fear being sandwiched between two operations after the Centre begins its offensive in other states, he added.         
	Unlike in the case of Sankrail officer-in-charge Atindranath Dutta, the Maoists had neither declared the other ab-ducted policemen prisoners of war nor put forward their demands in exchange for their release.         
	Although the family of the missing officer appealed to the Maoists for his release, no information was forthcoming on his whereabouts.         
	CPM state secretary Biman Bose again harped on the Maoist-Mamata (Banerjee) nexus and asked district party units to highlight it in their campaign for the 10 Assembly bypolls on November 7.        
	Mamata, muted in her response to the Maoist strike yes-terday, today said the Centre should investigate the matter. We are shocked at whatever is happening across the state. The Centre must investigate the matter and take steps to fight the hooligans.        
	The Trinamul Congress leader also questioned the need for the crackdown by the joint forces. We dont want anyone to be kidnapped. But the incidents that are happening during the ongoing joint operation raise the question whether it is fetching positive or negative results, she said.        
	Asked about the officers abduction, she said: I cant comment as conditions have been set for his release and Im part of a government.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Family left without a man
                                                                                                               Family left without a man
          PRONAB MONDAL                              
	Lalgarh (West Midnapore), Feb. 3: Golapi Mandi sits next to the earthen oven in the courtyard of her small hut, speechless. She is just 21, three months pregnant, and a widow.        
	Her husband, Lakhi Ram died in the firing in nearby Khash Jangal last evening.         
	All that Golapi can get herself to say is: The child in my womb will never get to see its father.        
	The child will also not see his grandfather. He is also among the dead.        
	No one in Gopalnagar village had told her yesterday that Lakhi and Raja Ram were dead. While the bodies of the two lay in a morgue, Golapi, her mother-in-law Shindi Rani and 20-year-old sister-in-law Tushi were told that they were being treated in hospital.        
	The news was broken to her when Golapi insisted on going to see her husband this morning.         
	The three women in the family waited for the bodies of their dead all day but they did not come. They were not released because no one from the family went to claim them.        
	We are poor, ignorant people, said Shindi, 50. How will we know the rules? We did not even know that they were dead till this morning.         
	Tushi said the family had nothing to do with the Lalgarh unrest. My father and brother had gone out to work in the fields as usual. We dont know what the Lalgarh agitation is about, what the Maoists want or the CPM.        
	Lakhi and his father were caught in the crossfire. Neighbour Dhani Murmu, a leader of the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities, said: They were working on their land when they heard the commotion and rushed to see what was happening. That is when the firing began.        
	Hit in the abdomen, Raja fell on the metalled road. Lakhi was hit while running through the eucalyptus trees.         
	The three women in their family are left with five bighas of land, but none to till them.         
	Even if cultivated, the land only provided sustenance for about six months; for the other six, Raja and Lakhi toiled as day labourers.        
	We are left with nothing now, cried Shindi. What will we do with our land? How will we feed the baby that is yet to be born?        
	Getting someone else to work on the farmland is a luxury the family can ill afford. There would be nothing left for us then, Shindi said of the fields where paddy, mustard and potatoes were grown.

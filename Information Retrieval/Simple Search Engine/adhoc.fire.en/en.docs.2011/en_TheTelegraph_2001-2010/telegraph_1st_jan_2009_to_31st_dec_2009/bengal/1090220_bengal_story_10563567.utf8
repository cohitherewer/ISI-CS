The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Workers flout Cong poll order
                                                                                                               Workers flout Cong poll order
          BARUN GHOSH                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 19: Grassroots Congress workers have kept away from campaigning for the Trinamul Congress candidate in Bishnupur West after the two parties decided on a united fight against the CPM in the bypoll.        
	The Congress withdrew its candidate, Mumtazuddin Gazi  the step is being seen as a pointer to an alliance with Trinamul before the Lok Sabha election.        
	The AICC has taken strong exception to the workers reluctance. The bypoll is on February 26. We want all our workers in Bishnupur West to campaign for the Trinamul candidate without delay. Non-participation of our workers ... might jeopardise the poll alliance with Mamata, said an AICC leader from Delhi.         
	We withdrew our candidate from the bypoll to pave the way for an alliance with Mamata. So the party workers reluctance is really disappointing and amounts to disrespect to the high command, the leader added.        
	All senior state Congress leaders have been told to share the platform with Mamata Banerjee when the Trinamul chief address a rally in Bishnupur on Saturday.         
	PCC working president Pradip Bhattacharya, now in Delhi, said: I had told party workers to campaign for the Trinamul candidate before I left for Delhi. I shall seek an explanation.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Chair or vote: Trinamul
                                                                                                               Chair or vote: Trinamul
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 16: The Trinamul Congress is keeping the option of contesting for the Siliguri mayors post open if negotiations with partner Congress fail, sources said.        
	The Congress bagged 15 seats in the Siliguri Municipal Corporation, the Trinamul 14. One seat was won by Independent candidate Ranjan Sil Sharma, who belongs to Trinamul but was denied a ticket for spitting at a school inspector. Trinamul, however, did not put up a candidate against him.        
	According to the Trinamul leadership, Sil Sharma is still with their party as he was not suspended or expelled but merely denied a ticket.        
	Hence, theres no reason to believe that Sharma will switch over to the Congress and help increase the latters tally to 16. Sil Sharmas response to our overtures has been good. So, with Sil Sharmas support Trinamuls tally will equal the Congresss. Given that, why cant we ask for the mayors chair? a senior Trinamul MLA close to party chief Mamata Banerjee said today.        
	If the Congress doesnt accept our stand and insists that their councillor should get the mayors post, we may go for an election in that case. Everything will be finalised in the next few days, the Trinamul leader added.        
	In such a case, the councillors will vote to choose the mayor.        
	The names that have cropped up in the Congress camp as the mayoral candidate are Gangotri Dutta and Nantu Pal, while Goutam Deb is being discussed in Trinamul circles as the likely nominee.        
	MLA Partha Chatterjee, the Leader of Opposition in Trinamul, today said Mamata was looking into the matter and hoped it could be settled through talks.         
	Theres no problem at all in settling this matter. Mamata will take the final decision on whether to stake claim for the mayoral office. She may talk to Pranab Mukherjee for an amicable settlement. But we do have a strong demand for putting our man in the Siliguri mayors chair, Chatterjee added.        
	Congress MLA and party general secretary Manas Bhuniya said: It has to be understood that our party has 15 councillors while Trinamul has 14. If the Independent candidate decides to abstain from the House in the event of voting for the mayoral office, we will still get through. However, we are having talks with the Trinamul leadership and an acceptable solution will emerge.        
	Bhuniya, however, refused comment when asked if the Congress would sacrifice the mayors office in favour of Trinamul. Precedents may be there. But I cannot speak about possibilities, he said.        
	Last month, the Congress had to withdraw its candidates in the Bowbazar and Sealdah Assembly seats after Mamata insisted on not allowing the ally to contest bypolls. Trinamul won both the seats.

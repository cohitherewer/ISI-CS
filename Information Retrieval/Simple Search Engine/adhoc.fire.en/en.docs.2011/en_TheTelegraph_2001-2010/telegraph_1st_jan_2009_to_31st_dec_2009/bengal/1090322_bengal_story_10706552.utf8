                                                                                                               Singapore business brain in city 
          SAMBIT SAHA                          Philip Yeo                                  
	Calcutta, March 21: Philip Yeo, the man who played a crucial role in turning Singapore into a global industrial hub, will land in Calcutta tomorrow to explore ties between Bengal and the city state.        
	Yeo, who from 1986 to 2001 was the chairman of the economic development board in Singapore, its apex business panel, will be accompanied by David Lim, the chairman of Jurong International that is preparing the master plan for the chemical hub in Nayachar.        
	Yeo will meet chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on Monday. Although only Haldia and Nayachar may be on their list, in industry circles the visit is being seen as the first step for greater involvement of the Singapore government in the state.         
	Yeos visit comes at a time the state government has received the nod from the Centre for setting up chemical hubs in Nayachar and Haldia.         
	Prasoon Mukherjee, the chairman of New Kolkata International Development that is building infrastructure for the hubs, is behind organising the visit.        
	The state government is also sending a team to Tokyo and Seoul to win investment for Nayachar and Haldia.        
	The team will be part of a larger delegation of the Union ministry for chemicals and fertilizers.        
	The Singapore governments involvement may boost the states pitch for investments abroad.         
	Yeo is now the chairman of Spring Singapore, a development agency that nurtures growing companies.         
	He is also a special adviser for economic development at the Prime Ministers Office there.         
	The largest chemical and petrochemical complex in Asia is located in Singapores Jurong industrial estate that falls under the jurisdiction of JTC Corporation, a Singapore government agency.         
	Jurong International is the global arm of JTC Corporation.         
	Nayachar is one river island but the Jurong island in Singapore is built by joining seven islets.        
	Jurong International chairman Lim is also a director of Ascendas India Trust, a Singapore company that builds IT and business parks.         
	Ascendas had earlier shown interest in setting up an IT park in Rajarhat but the project fell through as the company could not get enough land.         
	Sources said Lims visit might open up the possibility of Ascendas coming back to the city.

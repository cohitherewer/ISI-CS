          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Tamluk, Sept. 25: The body of a CPM supporter, who was a relative of slain Trinamul panchayat leader Nishikanta Mondal and was questioned about the murder, was found hanging from a tree in Sonachura.        
	Thirty-year-old Nabakrishna Mondal had fled Nandigram after the Lok Sabha elections and returned home a few days before Biswakarma Puja.        
	We cant say at the moment whether Nabakrishna committed suicide or he was murdered. We are waiting for the post-mortem report, said B. Baidya, East Midnapore superintendent of police.        
	Nabakrishna is a distant relative of Nishikanta Mondal, the Trinamul Congress pradhan of Sonachura gram panchayat, who was shot dead on Tuesday evening.         
	After Nishikanta was murdered, the police arrested three persons  the wife of a CPM supporter and two other supporters of the ruling party, Basudeb Mondal and Bhim Patra. Basudeb is also a distant relative of Nishikanta.        
	Yesterday morning, villagers  the area is now a Trinamul pocket  called Nabakrishna to a meeting to question him on the murder.        
	We asked Nabakrishna where he was and what he was doing on the evening of Nishikantas murder. He could not give us a satisfactory answer. So, we called him again for another meeting at night, said Amar Mondal, 50, a villager and Trinamul supporter.        
	But Nabakrishna disappeared after lunch yesterday afternoon. He was not present at the meeting last night.         
	Villagers told his cousin Pashupati that their family would not be allowed to attend Nishikantas shradh on Saturday.         
	When Nabakrishnas mother, Kamala, 70, went out of the house this morning, she saw the body hanging from a tree beside the house.

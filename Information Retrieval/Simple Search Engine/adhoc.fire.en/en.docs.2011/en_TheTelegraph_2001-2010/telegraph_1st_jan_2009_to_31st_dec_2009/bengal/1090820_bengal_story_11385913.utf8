The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Techie death natural
                                                                                                               Techie death natural
                            
	Aug. 19: Kazi Akhter, the software engineer from Birbhum found dead in a UK hotel, died of natural causes, said the coroner who held the inquest.        
	Police need not investigate the case further, he added.        
	Kazi, 24, had apparently suffered bleeding from the stomach. The condition is called acute erosive haemorrhagic gastritis, in which the innermost layer of the stomach bleeds because of injury caused by analgesics or other medicines, said a doctor in Calcutta.        
	The 24-year-old who worked for telecom giant Verizon in Hyderabad and was in Read- ing, UK, on assignment had apparently brought medicines from India for stomach ail- ments. His father Abdul Mokid, an engineer with the Bengal government, had wondered yesterday how a young man could die all of a sudden.         
	Kazis body is likely to reach Calcutta tomorrow.

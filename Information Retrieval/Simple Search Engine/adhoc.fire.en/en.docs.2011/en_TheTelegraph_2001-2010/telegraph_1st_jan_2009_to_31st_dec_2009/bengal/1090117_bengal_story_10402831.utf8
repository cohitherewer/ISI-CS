The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Rival unity alert in CPM 
                                                                                                               Rival unity alert in CPM 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Jan. 16: Biman Bose today told CPM state committee members to brace for a tougher fight in the Lok Sabha elections, keeping in mind the possibility of an Opposition alliance.         
	The CPM state secretary told district leaders to be ready for a direct contest between the Left Front and a united Opposition in most of the 42 Lok Sabha seats in the state. There may be hiccups in the alliance talks between the Congress and Trinamul, but we must prepare ourselves to face it, he was quoted as telling leaders gathered for the two-day session.         
	He reportedly blamed lack of proper public relations and a political campaign for Trinamuls near-40,000 victory margin in the Nandigram Assembly bypoll.         
	Although the state committee didnt discuss the bypoll results in detail today, one leader is said to have held Tamluk MP Lakshman Seths controversial behaviour responsible for the defeat in the land war zone.        
	CPI state secretary Manju Majumdar spoke to Bose today shortly before the CPM meeting began. According to CPI sources, Majumdar, too, complained that the irresponsible campaign by CPM leaders like Seth and Benoy Konar had helped Trinamul win Nandigram.         
	Seth, who was at the meeting, later said whatever he had done was not as an individual but as a party man. Some (leaders) may find fault with my style, but I stood for the party and the governments programme for industrialisation.        
	A section of the party wants him replaced as the candidate from Tamluk, under which Nandigram falls.         
	The CPM is apprehensive of losing at least 10 seats, mostly in south Bengal  particularly the two Midnapores, South and North 24-Parganas, Nadia and Hooghly.        
	Bose asked the district leaders to ensure that booth committees were formed for all 52,900 polling booths.         
	Worried over the Oppositions focus on Muslims, backward castes and tribals, he asked MPs and MLAs to ensure they spent from their development funds those portions earmarked for the weaker sections and the minorities.

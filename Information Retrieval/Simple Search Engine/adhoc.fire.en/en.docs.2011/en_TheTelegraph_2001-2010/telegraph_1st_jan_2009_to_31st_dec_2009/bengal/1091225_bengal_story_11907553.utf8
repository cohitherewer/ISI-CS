	Bolpur, Dec. 24: A first-year MA student of rural development in Visva-Bharati died in a hospital last night after consuming a poisonous substance in his hostel room.         
	Police said Khokon Ghosh, 22, drank something poisonous. We found a suicide note in his room. But the reason behind why he took this step is not clear to us from the note. We are talking to his friends and family to find out more, said a police officer.

	Preliminary investigation revealed that Khokon returned to his hostel in the evening as usual. Around 6.30pm, some of his hostel mates went to his room after hearing him groan. They rushed him to the nearby Pierson Memorial Hospital in an ambulance. He was later shifted to Sian Hospital, about 8km from the university, where he died around 10pm, said an official.         
	Khokon was a mediocre student and an introvert. He used to grumble about his studies to some of his friends. We dont know if he committed suicide out of frustration over his studies, said one hostel boy, on the condition of anonymity.        
	Khokons father Chandi Charan, a farmer, who arrived early this morning, was shocked. Khokon used to speak to me often about his studies. I dont know how I will overcome this shock.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, April 9: A Trinamul Congress activist and his sons were grievously injured when they were shot at and stabbed by an alleged CPM supporter over a quarrel related to wall graffiti in north Calcutta.        
	Jangbahadur Rai, 68, the Inttuc vice-president of north Calcutta, was shot in his right shoulder and left arm around 10pm. His sons, Binod, 22, and Gautam, 20, were stabbed.        
	Jangbahadur and others had painted the wall of an abandoned godown in Cossipore on Tuesday. However, a local CPM activist claimed the wall belonged to him and ordered us to erase the writing. When we refused, he threatened us and attacked Jangbahadur and his sons, said Imtiaz Hussain, a Trinamul supporter.        
	Jangbahadur is still not out of danger, a doctor at RG Kar Hospital said late tonight.        
	Gautam, who was discharged after first aid, said the CPM activist attacked him and Binod while they were returning home. Binod was seriously injured and we ran towards the nearby police station, he said.

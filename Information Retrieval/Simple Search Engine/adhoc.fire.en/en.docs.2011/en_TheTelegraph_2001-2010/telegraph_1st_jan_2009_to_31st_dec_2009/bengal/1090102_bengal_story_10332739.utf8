The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CM happy with Delhi stand
                                                                                                               CM happy with Delhi stand
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          A woman in Rohini stares at what had once been her house. Morcha supporters had burnt it down on Thursday. Picture by Kundan Yolmo                                  
	Calcutta, Jan.1: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is happy that the Centre has toughened its stand on the Gorkha Janmukti Morchas agitation for Gorkhaland.         
	Briefing Left Front allies today on the deliberations at the tripartite meeting on Darjeeling held in Delhi a few days ago, Bhattacharjee said the state was not alone and the Centre, too, had opposed arbitrary tax collection and forcible renaming of government offices.         
	Delhi endorsed what we have been asking Morcha leadership not to do  the illegal tax collection in the name of Gorkhaland or non-payment of state tax and electricity bills, smearing the number plates of cars carrying West Bengal registration numbers or changing the signboards at government office, Bhattacharjee was quoted as saying.        
	According to the leaders of the allies, the chief minister was happy that the Centre has asked the Morcha not to try to spread its wings in the Dooars and Siliguri in its bid to include those areas in the separate state that it is asking for.        
	 Delhi also felt that the efforts to spread the agitation to the plains and tribal areas would have serious repercussions and destabilise the entire region, a cabinet colleague of Bhattacharjee quoted him as saying.         
	The chief minister said both the Centre and the state were ready to concede more power to Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council but not separate state. He indicated that Morcha leadership would make some climbdown in view of the Union governments attitude.         
	They (Morcha) seem to have softened their stand as they have realised that prolonged anarchy in the hills would affect tourism and hit the common people. The Morcha has assured Delhi that it would not stop people from paying government revenues.         
	The ice seems to be melting and the chief minister hoped that more talks will pave the way for an amicable settlement, said the public works minister and RSP leader Kshiti Goswami.        
	In his recent public rallies, the chief minister made it clear that unlike the Maoists in south Bengal, he was ready to accommodate Gorkhaland or Kamtapuri separatists as much as possible to avoid further division of the state.         
	We are urging the Morcha leadership not to break the unity of the plains and hills. Why cant Siliguri and Darjeeling stay together? The state has delegated almost all power to the council and we are ready to give more. We want them to hold the council polls and win to run the hills, Bhattacharjee had said at a rally held recently in Siliguri.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CPM duo thrown out
                                                                                                               CPM duo thrown out
          OUR BUREAU                              
	July 17: Bandh supporters dragged out two CPM councillors from the municipal corporation in Siliguri and beat up a block development officer in Malda for defying the shutdown.        
	Around 11.30am, some 40 people went room to room in the civic body and asked the staff to clear out immediately. Those who protested were allegedly shoved and slapped.        
	Mayor-in-council Paritosh Das was pulled out when he refused to step out of his room, a witness said. Moushumi Hazra, a borough committee chairperson, was treated the same way in another building on the premises. A group of men caught her by the arm.         
	At this point, Das tried to intervene and a scuffle started. The demonstrators succeeded in getting the offices vacated and after that they left, an employee said.        
	Siliguri CPM leader and urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya admitted the incident has left us stunned and pointed a finger at the police. They have failed to discharge their duty, he said.        
	An assistant sub-inspector and three constables stood and watched when the CPM leaders were heckled. A large force arrived from the police station a kilometre away after the attackers had fled.        
	Mayor Nurul Islam said all 350 employees had turned up for work today. But some 40 of them left after the incident.        
	One of them said: We cannot recall another instance of Opposition supporters entering a CPM-run civic body and trying to force it shut. It has never happened.        
	The mayor alleged that Darjeeling district Congress president Shankar Malakar had led the attackers.        
	In Malda, the officer was thrown off his chair and then out of his office.        
	Over 200 Congress supporters raided the Harishchandrapur I block office around 11am and asked BDO Amiya Das why he had come to work on a bandh day. Das said: I told them I was there to tackle law-and-order problems and they pushed me off my chair and began beating me up. They slapped me as they pushed and shoved me out of the office.        
	Only a couple of home-guards were on duty there. Das said: Had the cops been there, maybe I would have been spared the harassment.        
	Zilla parishad member Abdul Kayem, who was accused of leading the assault, said: We requested him with folded hands not to open his office, but he threatened to get us arrested.        
	District magistrate Sridhar Ghosh promised stern action against the attackers and admitted more policemen should have been deployed at the block office. Malda police chief Satyajit Banerjee blamed local officers for the lapse.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Behrampore, Aug. 26: A 13-year-old girl was found dead and four others were hospitalised senseless after a group of suspected goons sneaked into a tribal girls hostel in Murshidabads Nabagram tonight and allegedly tried to rape some of them.        
	Police said four men took advantage of the darkness during a power cut and entered the hostel, in a secluded part of Itor village, about 230km from Calcutta, around 9.30pm.         
	People from neighbouring settlements came running when they heard the girls scream in panic.        
	Murshidabad superintendent of police B.L. Meena said Pratima Baskey, 13, was found dead with scars and scratch marks on her body. The cause of the death has not been ascertained, Meena said. She was a Class V student of the local Itor High School.        
	The four girls who have been hospitalised are between 13 and 15. Only one of them has external injuries, added Meena. All four were unconscious till late tonight.         
	Doctors said the girls probably lost consciousness in panic.         
	The states tribal welfare department runs the hostel, where schoolchildren from impoverished families from far-flung villages live. Boarding and lodging is free for the girls.        
	The hostel has a caretaker and some attendants but no security guards. The caretaker and the attendants generally leave the premises around 9pm to spend the night in their village. In the 10 year or so of the hostel, there has never been an incident like tonights.

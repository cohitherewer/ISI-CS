The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | 8 held, but not the accused
                                                                                                               8 held, but not the accused
          OUR BUREAU                          A bandh supporter stops a taxi in Howrah. (Pradip Sanyal)                                  
	Burdwan, July 17: In Calcutta, they cant stop bus vandals. In Mangalkot, they cant seem to find those who started it all.        
	None of the 10 people named in the FIR lodged after Wednesdays attack on Congress MLAs by alleged CPM activists in Mangalkot have been arrested.        
	Eight persons have been held, and the CPM has claimed all of them are its supporters. But the police say those named in the FIR, which includes two CPM branch committee members, are absconding.         
	CPM state secretary Biman Bose and Burdwan party secretary Amal Haldar had claimed no party members were involved.        
	Rabindranath Chatterjee, the Congress MLA from Katwa who required eight stitches on his head after being hit by stones, had lodged the FIR.        
	Burdwan additional superintendent of police Humayun Kabir said raids were on but the persons named in the FIR were absconding. We are searching for them and hope to arrest them soon.        
	But Chatterjee seems to see what the police claim they cant. He alleged that those named were still roaming around and one of them, Ashok Ghosh, today led a mob that torched a Congress supporters house at Dhanyarukhi, the scene of Wednesdays attack. These people arent being arrested because they are important CPM functionaries, Chatterjee said. Our supporters have seen them roaming around without a care, secure in the knowledge that no action will be taken against them.        
	Samir Basak, the circle inspector of Katwa, of which Dhanyarukhi is a part, said he was aware of todays blaze but tried to play down the incident by saying it could have been set off by a stove. We havent received a complaint, so we havent probed it.        
	Police sources, however, said there had been little progress in the attack probe, other than some raids on Wednesday night. After an incident in which nine legislators were chased and beaten up, massive police action was expected. Senior officers like the DIG and the SP should have visited the spot several times. But we did not find any such activity in Dhanyarukhi, said an officer.        
	Burdwan police chief R. Rajsekharan paid a brief visit after the attack on Wednesday evening. DIG (Burdwan range) Jag Mohan has submitted a preliminary report.         
	In Calcutta, IG (law and order) Raj Kanojia promised action against the cops present during Wednesdays attack if lapses are found. An investigation is on. If lapses are found on the part of any police officer, action will be taken.        
	District magistrate R.K. Sinha said an all-party meeting would be held in Burdwan town tomorrow to restore peace in Mangalkot.        
	Tribal belt bandh        
	The Peoples Committee Aga- inst Police Atrocities has called a three-day bandh in West Midnapore, Purulia and Bankura from Sunday. On Wednesday, the Maoists have called another bandh. The committee today sought the support of Left Front partners Forward Bloc and RSP for its agitation.

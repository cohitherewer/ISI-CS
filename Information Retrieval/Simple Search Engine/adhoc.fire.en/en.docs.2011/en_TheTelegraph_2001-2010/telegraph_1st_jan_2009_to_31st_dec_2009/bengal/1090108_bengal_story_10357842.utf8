	Siliguri, Jan. 7: Culling of poultry birds was completed last night in the Siliguri subdivision and the Rajganj block in the adjoining Jalpaiguri district where avian influenza had been detected on January 3.         
	Sarad Dwivedi, the Siliguri subdivisional officer, said 30,556 birds had been culled in both the places over the past four days.        
	After the completion of the culling, moping of poultry birds, eggs and the fodder commenced today and the process will end tomorrow, said Dwibedi.         
	The government had engaged 26 teams to destroy 43,111 eggs and 1,481kg fodder in the affected areas.         
	The official said the administration had kept 14 villages in Phansidewa and Matigara blocks and some wards of the Siliguri Municipal Corporation under surveillance to check whether anyone had contracted the disease.         
	A team of 20 health workers will monitor these places for the next seven days under the supervision of the child development project officers, said Dwivedi.         
	All hospitals have been put on alert for identification of suspected human cases and in case they find any such patient, he/she should be immediately referred to the isolation ward of the North Bengal Medical College and Hospital, said the official.         
	The poultry market here remained closed today with traders waiting anxiously to see the ban on the sale of poultry products lifted by the administration.

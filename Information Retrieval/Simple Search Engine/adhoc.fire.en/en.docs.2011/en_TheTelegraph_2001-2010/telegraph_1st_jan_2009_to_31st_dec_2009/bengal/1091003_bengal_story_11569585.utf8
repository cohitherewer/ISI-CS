          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 2: Criminal Investigation Department sleuths have arrested a zonal commander of the CPI (Maoist) from Chinsurah.         
	According to the police, Chandrashekhar Yadav alias Bhusan Yadav, has at least 10 cases, including murder, pending against him in Jharkhand.         
	The Maoist zonal commander, aged about 40, was arrested from Hooghly Station Road in Chinsurah this evening.        
	We have informed Jharkhand police and they will come here soon. We are yet to know the reason behind Chandrashekhars Hooghly visit, said Anuj Sharma, special inspector-general of police, CID.        
	The Maoist leader was staying at a sympathisers house in Sahagunj for the past three months. Today, we had information that he was supposed to go out to consult a doctor. We waited for him and arrested him, said a police officer. Chandrashekhar may have been hiding in Konnagar and Dum Dum for some time, the officer added.        
	Rebels kill two        
	Maoists shot dead a Jharkhand Janamukti Morcha leader in West Midnapore last night for being a member of a village vigilance squad.        
	Police said Panchanan Tudu, a 45-year-old resident of Binpur, was an organiser of the Santrashbirodhi Ganapratirodh Committee, an anti-Maoist vigilante squad in the tribal belts of West Midnapore, Bankura and Purulia.        
	The police said Panchanan was shot four times and left on the Jhargram-Purulia state highway.         
	The police suspect the murder was an act of revenge by the rebels, some of who were chased away by people near Panchanans village when they went to extort money from them.         
	This evening, the Maoists shot dead another leader of the Jharkhand Janamukti Morcha. Amalendu Patra, 40, was shot dead in Jamboni, West Midnapore.         
	He too was a vigilance squad member.

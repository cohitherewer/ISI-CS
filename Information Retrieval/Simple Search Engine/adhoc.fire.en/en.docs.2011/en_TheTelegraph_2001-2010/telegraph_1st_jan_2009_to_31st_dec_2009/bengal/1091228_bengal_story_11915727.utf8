The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Buddha blames towers
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Buddha blames towers
                            
	New Delhi, Dec. 27: Maoist leader Kishanji is a difficult person to track down because of the limitations of technology, the chief minister said.        
	He is talking to hundreds of journalists every day. We can identify the (mobile) tower, but it is difficult to pin-point his location in that area.         
	Unlike in cities, a mobile tower in the forested Maoist-hit areas covers several square kilometres.        
	A few days ago, the Maoist military wing chief was said to have called up the state environment secretary and complained about mining in the region. I have read it in the papers. I will have to talk to the officer, the chief minister said.        
	The Maoist threat was high on his agenda when he met the Prime Minister yesterday and briefed him about the joint security operations in Lalgarh. We need to enter deep forests and villages in the interiors, which have Maoist hideouts. We are facing problems in this, Bhattacharjee said, adding that talks were on with neighbouring Jharkhand for a joint operation.         
	Bhattacharjee said most people were fed up with the violence. But they are afraid to protest. Imagine how one would feel if a family member is picked up late at night and his body is found on the road the next day.

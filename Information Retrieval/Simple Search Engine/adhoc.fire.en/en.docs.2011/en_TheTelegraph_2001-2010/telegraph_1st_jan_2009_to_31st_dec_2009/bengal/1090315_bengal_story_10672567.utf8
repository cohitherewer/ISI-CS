The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Revolt in Trinamul ranks
                                                                                                               Revolt in Trinamul ranks
          OUR BUREAU                               
	March 14: North Dinajpur Trinamul Congress chief Abdul Karim Choudhury today revolted against Mamata Banerjees alliance with the Congress and floated his own outfit.        
	Choudhury, a former Trinamul Congress MLA who has been with Mamata since the partys inception in 1999, said: Our workers in the Raiganj parliamentary constituency had worked hard to build up a Trinamul base. We cant accept that a Congress candidate will walk away with the cake.        
	He said the district unit was told earlier by our leaders in Calcutta that Trinamul would put up a candidate against the Congress in Raiganj.        
	Sitting MP Priya Ranjan Das Munshi being in hospital, the Congress is likely to field his wife Deepa from the seat.        
	Choudhury said: Its impossible for me to campaign for Deepa, who has always tried to malign me in public. Ill contest as an Independent from Raiganj. He faxed his resignation to Mamata this afternoon and launched the Uttarbangla Vikasgami Mehanati Party.        
	Trinamul district working president Tilak Choudhury played down the revolt and said: We will jointly campaign with the Congress.         
	The CPM said the revolt reflected resentment in Trinamul and Congress ranks about the seat-sharing arrangement.        
	Choudhury is the first Opposition leader to voice his dissent in public since the tie-up. The CPMs Abu Ayesh Mondal and the Forwards Blocs Hiten Burman had quit their parties after being denied tickets.

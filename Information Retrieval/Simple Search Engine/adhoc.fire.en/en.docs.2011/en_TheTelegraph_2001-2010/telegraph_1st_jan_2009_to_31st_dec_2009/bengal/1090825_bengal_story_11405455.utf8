The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CPM leaders feel ignored, so cyclone aid has to wait
                                                                                                               CPM leaders feel ignored, so cyclone aid has to wait
          OUR BUREAU                          At Satilapur in East Midnapores Ramnagar II block, Amal Khamri tries to make sure the little that remains of his wall doesnt crumble. The farm labourer, who earns only around Rs 1,500 a month, is among thousands in the district who havent got a paisa to repair their houses in the three months since the cyclone struck on May 25. The Khamris live under a sheet of tarpaulin they got as relief from the government. Telegraph picture                                  
	Aug. 24: About 50,000 families in East Midnapore have been living under tarpaulin sheets since cyclone Aila ripped their homes apart in May, but their names havent even been reg- istered for compensation bec-ause of local CPM leaders.        
	To make the lists of beneficiaries watertight, the government had formed a four-member committee in each gram panchayat area comprising a representative of the rural body, the panchayat samiti chief, the block development officer and an Opposition member.        
	In East Midnapore, where the CPM was routed by the Trinamul Congress in last years rural polls, the party is in the Opposition in over 76 per cent of the 223 gram panchayats. And its leaders are refusing to approve the lists because they had allegedly not been consulted when they were drawn up.        
	Without the consent of all the members of the committees tasked to draw up the lists, the government wouldnt approve the compensation claims.        
	In most cases, the lists we have received do not have the signature of the Opposition party. That is why we could not send them to the government, district magistrate C.D. Lama said, adding: Of the 25 blocks, we have been able to send complete lists of damaged houses from only three.        
	No Aila victim in Bengal has yet received compensation to rebuild his or her house. However, victims at places where the lists have been completed will get the money sooner.        
	Usually, flood-hit families get between Rs 4,000 and Rs 6,000 for damaged houses. Aila victims are likely to get more because of the extent of damage, said an official. The government will decide the amount after getting the list of claim- ants from all the districts.        
	CPM leaders alleged that they were ignored when the lists were drawn up. Trinamul is deliberately ignoring us. That is why we did not sign the lists, said Ashok Guria, a district secretariat member.        
	Trinamul leaders denied the allegation. In every case, we consulted them, said Mahmud Hossain, the deputy chief of the East Midnapore zilla parishad.        
	In Calcutta, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had yesterday blasted Mamatas promise-a-day term as minister, apparently after feeling ignored at the flagging off of Metro Rails extended run. His outburst triggered allegations that the CPM was feeling unnerved by the Opposition march.        
	The partys actions in East Midnapore, which has spelled trouble for over two lakh suffering villagers, could lend credence to such allegations.        
	Dipak Dasgupta, the CPM state secretariat member in charge of East Midnapore, said he was not aware of what was happening in the district, which could serve as another pointer to the leaderships alleged alienation from the grassroots. I dont know what exactly happened there. The district secretary is supposed to look into all this, said Dasgupta.         
	Told that delaying compensation for the cyclone victims could further alienate the party from the masses, he promised to look into the matter.        
	The CPM has been increasingly cornered in East Midnapore following the land war in Nandigram in 2007. Not only did the party fare miserably in the 2008 rural polls, it also lost the two Lok Sabha seats in the district this year. In Nandigram and Khejuri, hundreds of panchayat and party functionaries have fled their homes.        
	In such a situation, observers said, the partys state leadership could find it difficult to convince local leaders to co-operate in the running of Trinamul-run panchayats.        
	In South 24-Parganas, too, Trinamul runs the zilla parishad and most of the rural bodies. But in the district worst hit by Aila, the CPM Opposition has co-operated with Trinamul in drawing up the list of beneficiaries.        
	Over 1.8 lakh families in 26 blocks will get damages there. Some of the rural bodies have yet to finalise their lists, district magistrate Khalil Ahmed said, but thats because many of the panchayat offices were washed away by the floods that followed the cyclone.         
	But why the non-co-operation in East Midnapore?         
	A CPM leader who did not want to be named attributed it to the humiliation party workers had had to face there. Thousands of them are still homeless. How can we help Trinamul draw up the lists? he asked.

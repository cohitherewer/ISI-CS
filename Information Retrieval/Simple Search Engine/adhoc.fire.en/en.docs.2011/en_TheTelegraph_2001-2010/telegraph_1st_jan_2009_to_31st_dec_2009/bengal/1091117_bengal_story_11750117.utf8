	Siliguri, Nov. 16: New industries in Siliguri and Jalpaiguri are being offered a 20 per cent rebate on land prices if they start production within 18 months of getting plots in what appears to be a last-ditch Left bid to get things moving on the ground before the Assembly elections.        
	Plots will be taken back and only 90 per cent of the money returned if a promoter fails to get work started within six months, said Avanindra Singh, the chief executive officer of the Siliguri-Jalpaiguri Development Authority.         
	If a company starts construction within six months of the date of the purchase of the plot, we will return 10 per cent of the land price. Similarly, if it starts production within 18 months of the purchase, another 10 per cent of the land price will be paid back, Singh said during a meeting with industrialists here on Saturday.        
	If an entrepreneur does not start work on his unit even six months after the plot is bought, we will deduct 10 per cent of the plot price, return the balance and take the land back, he added.

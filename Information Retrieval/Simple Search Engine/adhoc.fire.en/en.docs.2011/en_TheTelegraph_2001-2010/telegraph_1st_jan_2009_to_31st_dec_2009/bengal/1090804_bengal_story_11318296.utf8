	Calcutta, Aug. 3: A woman died and at least 60 people were taken ill after consuming the charanamrita and prasad at a Shiv temple in Burdwans Purbasthali this evening.        
	The month of Shravan on the lunar calendar is special for Shiv devotees and hundreds had thronged the temple at Jamalpur village. After a puja, the charanamrita (holy water) and prasad of cut fruits were distributed among the devotees. Around 7.30pm, they started throwing up.         
	Over 30, including seven children, were taken to a hospital in Nabadwip, 35km away. The others were admitted to a nearby hospital. Samples of the prasad and the holy water were sent for tests after Kanak Shil, 48, died.

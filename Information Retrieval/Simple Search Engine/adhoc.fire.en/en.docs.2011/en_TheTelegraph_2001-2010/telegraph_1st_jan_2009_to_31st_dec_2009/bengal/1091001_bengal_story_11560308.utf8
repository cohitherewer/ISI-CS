The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CPMs Rukhsana parallel 
                                                                                                               CPMs Rukhsana parallel 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 30: The CPM today hailed Kashmirs Rukhsana, who snatched a gun from a militant and killed him, to insist on the partys right to active resistance against the Trinamul-Maoist nexus in the state.        
	We all are celebrating the way Rukhsana had snatched the terrorists weapon and fought them. Everybody has the right to resistance. Our party, too, has the right to organise active resistance to protect our cadres, supporters and common villagers, Mohammad Salim, a CPM state secretariat member and former MP, said today.         
	Salim doubled as the CPM spokesperson today at the state headquarters, though state secretary Biman Bose was present in the office. This is being seen as part of the CPMs new media management policy after a section of the rank and file complained that some leaders were acting as loose canons.        
	His comments came against the backdrop of Mamata Banerjees demand that the Left government be dismissed on the ground of rising political violence. (The Congress in Delhi rebuffed Trinamul today, saying we dont think the Centre should intervene in Bengal.)        
	The CPM leader denied that the party was endorsing a soft version of the government-sponsored Salwa Judum campaign in Chhattisgarh in which tribal youths were armed to fight the Maoists.        
	Neither do we support Salwa Judum nor do we practise it. But we have the right to self-defence when we face armed attacks. The Enayetpur incident opened a new chapter, he said, referring to the West Midnapore confrontation in which armed CPM cadres fought back Maoist raiders.        
	Salim, however, denied that CPM cadres were being armed and insisted that the party was only helping the government enforce law and order.         
	He parried questions on whether the party would support army deployment in Bengals Maoist zones. We leave it to Manmohan Singh and P. Chidambaram to decide how to launch the crackdown. Right now, we want the Centre to start its operation in Jharkhand, Salim said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Marxists amp; models? Mollah is outraged
                                                                                                               Marxists amp; models? Mollah is outraged
          BARUN GHOSH                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 20: Land acquisition or khadi fashion, Abdur Rezzak Mollah cant be kept gagged for long.        
	The land and land reforms minister today criticised the CPMs idea of organising a fashion show, trashing it as erosion of ideals. I must say that the fashion show shows us in poor light across the state. We, Marxists, who always stick to ideals, should not stoop to organise such shows, regardless of its marketing potential, he said over the phone from his South 24-Parganas home.        
	I cant imagine that our Marxist leaders would sit cross-legged for hours looking at models walk on the ramp one after another.         
	The ministers criticism of yesterdays state-organised khadi fashion show came two days after he was warned by CPM state secretary Biman Bose not to send out the wrong message to the masses about the party.        
	Mollah, who has publicly criticised the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government for its land acquisition policy and proclaimed he is super clean, also spoke of Hope 86, a musical soiree that Subhas Chakraborty had organised.         
	When Hope 86 was organised by the late transport minister Subhas Chakraborty, it sparked sustained criticism in the party, Mollah said. Many of us took up cudgels against the late Chakraborty terming the show decadent. But today, we dont mind organising fashion shows.         
	Mollah has also coined a name for leaders who organise ramp shows and soirees. He calls them hybrids.         
	I have been isolated in the party these days because of being vocal about some hybrid leaders who openly disregard Marxist ideals. But we have been paying a heavy price for the loss of ideals, he said.        
	It is not known if Mollahs hybrid barb and charge about eroding Marxist ideals was meant for Mohd Salim, the West Bengal Khadi and Village Industries Commission chairman and one of the organisers of the khadi fashion show. They are not known to be the best of friends.        
	Salim refused to react to Mollahs statement.         
	But CPM state secretariat member Benoy Konar found nothing wrong with the fashion show. We have to cope with changing times. If such a show is done in a decent manner, why criticise it? he asked.

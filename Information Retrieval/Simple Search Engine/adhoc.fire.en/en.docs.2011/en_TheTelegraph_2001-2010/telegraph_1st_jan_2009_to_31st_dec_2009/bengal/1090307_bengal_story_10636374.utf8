          OUR BUREAU                              
	March 6: The Dunlop factory at Sahagunj opened today with 84 maintenance staff in attendence after suspension of work for over three months.        
	Today, Dunlop started operations with 84 maintenance staff, said Ashok Singh, manager (administration) at Dunlop factory.         
	The Dunlop management had earlier said the factory would open with 229 maintenance staff.         
	Asked why only 84 workers had joined, Dipankar Roy, the general secretary of the Citu-led Dunlop Workers Union, said: The attendance was low today because many workers have gone to their home states and may not have got the news of the reopening on time. We expect all 229 on the premises in two or three days.         
	The Dunlop factory suspended work in November last year citing financial crisis and poor market conditions.         
	Industries minister Nirupam Sen today urged workers to co-operate.Nobody should pose obstructions, he said.

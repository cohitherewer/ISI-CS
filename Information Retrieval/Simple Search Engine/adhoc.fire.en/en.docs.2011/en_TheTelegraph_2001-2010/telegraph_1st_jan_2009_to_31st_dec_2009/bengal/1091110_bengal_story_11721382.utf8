          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	Calcutta, Nov. 9: Mamata Banerjee today said chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees irresponsible remark about Maoists yesterday afternoon had led to the slaughter of four policemen last night.        
	We are very sorry for those who are being killed almost everyday. They are someones children, too. But I feel Buddhababus daityagyanheen mantabya (irresponsible remark) is the reason why the EFR (Eastern Frontier Rifles) jawans were killed, the Trinamul Congress chief told a rally to protest the CPMs terror.        
	The chief minister had told a rally in West Midnapores Debra he would drive the Maoists out of Bengal. Hours later, the rebels gunned down the four jawans at a bazaar about 110km away.        
	Reluctant to blame the Maoists for the bloodshed, Mamata said: A probe should be ordered into who killed the jawans. Is it the Maoists or CPM cadres?        
	What is the proof that CPM cadres are not killing policemen and others in Maoist guise? In Nandigram, we have seen CPM cadres in police uniform kill our men, she said.         
	She warned the police to be on their toes because, like the Maoists, the CPM cadres may rob you of your weapons, too. You have to protect yourself, she said.        
	The Maoists and the Mar-xists are in the same boat, Mamata alleged. They held a secret meeting in Junglemahal recently.        
	The chief minister had levelled the same charge against Trinamul yesterday. He had also accused Mamatas party of helping the Maoists identify their CPM targets. Trinamul is showing them the way. They are working hand in hand.         
	Mamata said: Trinamul is opposed to the killings and the Maoists. But the CPM cadres are using the Maoists to regain control of turf they lost because of the peoples mandate in successive elections.        
	She blamed the chief minister for the spurt in killings. Buddhababu, it is because of you that atrocities are rampant. Why cant you bring peace? Why cant you dump your terror tactics? she asked.        
	Citing the arrest of four Trinamul supporters for showing black flags to the chief ministers convoy on Saturday, Mamata accused Bhattacharjee of intolerance towards the Opposition.         
	It is good that you arrested my supporters for showing black flags and shouting slogans. But did you arrest any of your cadres for blocking my way in Arambagh when I went to address a rally on Wednesday. They not only obstructed me but hurled abuses at me. Is this democracy?        
	In Mamatas next round features Lalgarh. The Trinamul chief said she would soon go to the Maoist-hit areas of West Midnapore for a padyatra.

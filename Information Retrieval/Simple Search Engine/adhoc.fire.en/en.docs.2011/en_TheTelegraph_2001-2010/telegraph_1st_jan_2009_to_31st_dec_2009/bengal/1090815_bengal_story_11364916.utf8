	Calcutta, Aug. 14: Buddha- deb Bhattacharjee today said there may have been some anyay (wrongdoing) on the governments part, an admission his critics in the party had wanted to hear in the wake of the Lefts successive electoral setbacks.        
	We are facing a tough situation in Bengal. Which way to proceed? We have committed some mistakes (bhul). Perhaps, done some wrongs (anyay) too, Bhattacharjee told a rally to remember Subhas Chakraborty.         
	The chief ministers push for industrialisation was held by many as responsible for the partys alienation from its traditional rural support base and the drubbing.         
	His polices firing in Nandigram, which left 14 people dead, and defence of party cadres armed recapture of the area in 2007 had taken away from the Left the support of a large section of the intelligentsia.         
	However, Bhattacharjee asked: Did the Left only commit mistakes all these years? Was it only the Left that made errors? If we make mistakes and commit wrongs, we always rectify ourselves and we are amending our ways.        
	The chief minister had apologised for the firing days before the 2009 parliamentary polls, but it didnt appear to have worked with the people.         
	Today, he urged party supporters to emulate Chakraborty, whose populist politics he had often treated with disdain but whose connect with the people the party now hopes to use as a tool to turn around its fortunes.         
	We have to reach out to all those who had misunderstood us or felt confused or left behind. Comrade Subhas Chakraborty had the unique skill and power to get close to all sections of people. Let us make a turnaround by emulating his bright example, he said.         
	Bhattacharjee recalled his association with Chakraborty during the tumultuous 60s and their shared belief in socialism despite the fall of the Soviet Union.         
	The Left is facing a peculiar alliance of Opposition for- ces. What do they want in the name of change? A shift tow- ards the Right wing? There is no alternative to the Left, he said while urging the ranks to hit the streets for a rally on August 31 to mark 50 years of the Lefts food movement. Let the streets be the platform for our turnaround.         
	State party secretary Biman Bose spoke of Chakrabortys fearless fight against semi-fascist terror in the 70s. But neither Bose nor Bhatta- charjee touched on what many felt were the leaderships injustices towards Chakraborty.         
	The official condolence resolution prepared by the partys state secretariat lauded the late leaders many qualities that had earned him peoples love and respect almost as a mass leader.         
	It also admitted that his presence was most needed at this complex and tough time.        
	To Chakrabortys loyalists, it failed to explain why the party took 36 years to offer him a berth in the state secretariat and why he was never inducted into the central committee.        
	In an apparent reflection of the top party leaderships disapproval of Chakrabortys disregard for its dogmas, general secretary Prakash Karat came to Calcutta en route to Tripura this morning, went to the late leaders home, but skipped the condolence meeting.         
	Party sources claimed the programme in Left-ruled Tri-pura had been planned in ad- vance. But Chakrabortys admirers may not accept that.         
	It was left to the CPMs allies to highlight the wrongs done to Chakraborty. He created history even in death. The massive turnout... on his last journey proved his worth as a peoples leader, said Forward Bloc leader Ashok Ghosh.         
	Subhas didnt tread the beaten path. He was denied recognition as a mass leader when he was alive. He got it after his death, said the RSPs Kshiti Goswami.         
	Although invited, Mamata Banerjee did not turn up. But a Congress team led by its state working president Subrata Mukherjee and Assembly leader Manas Bhuniya was there.

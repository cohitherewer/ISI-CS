The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | To the funeral, bearing guns
                                                                                                               To the funeral, bearing guns

	Lalgarh, Feb. 4: Another funeral in Lalgarh under the shadow of the gun  but this time tribal youths, not CPM cadres, wielded the weapons.        
	Around 200 youths, all armed, formed a protective circle around 1,500 people who thronged the site of the funeral in Khas Jangal, the spot where three fellow villagers were shot dead on Monday in a clash with CPM supporters accompanying the body of their slain leader Nandalal Pal.        
	Some youths were carrying small arms, others bigger guns, but all improvised country-made weapons. Some guns had their nozzles wrapped in cloth, with the butts jutting out, others were tucked into hips, their shapes noticeable from under their clothes.        
	We never knew we would see a day like this when we would have to attend the funeral of three of our villagers killed by bullets fired by CPM goons, said Hariram Murmu, a 32-year-old villager. Today, we are prepared. Let them (CPM supporters) come and then we will see the blood flow. It is going to be their blood that will flow today.        
	As villagers cut trees from the forest to build the three pyres, the bodies of Raja Ram Mandi, his son Lakhi Ram and Gopinath Soren lay in a van parked nearby.        
	Murmu said that through the day yesterday they had been preparing to form the protective ring to guard against any attack from CPM cadres.        
	The accounts of the Lalgarh villagers suggested that the preparations were being aided or supervised by outsiders.         
	Dharmesh Hembrum from nearby Kamaldanga village said people had been arriving from Purulia, and some even from Jharkhand, to organise the resistance movement. Hembrum said he did not know who the people were. His version was corroborated by many others.        
	Intelligence reports received by police also pointed to the presence of outsiders. They are possibly Maoists who have slipped into Lalgarh after Mondays firing, said an official. Along with them have also come the arms and ammunition.        
	A few hours before the funeral, this correspondent saw a young man carrying six rifles on a motorcycle. The nozzles were wrapped, but the rifle butts were visible. He is from Kamaldanga, a villager told The Telegraph. He has been ferrying arms all morning.

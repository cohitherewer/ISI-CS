          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chinsurah, Nov. 28: Three CPM activists were arrested last night and charged with murder for their alleged involvement in violence in Khanakul two days ago, a step police sources claimed was taken because of Writers pressure.        
	A police officer said on the condition of anonymity that there was pressure from Writers Buildings to arrest the culprits.         
	According to Trinamul Congress supporters in Khanakul, Hooghly, about 200 CPM activists with firearms had descended on two villages  Chandravan and Hiyadpur, about 120km from Calcutta  in a Nandigram-style recapture attempt on Thursday.        
	Some villagers working in the fields tried to drive them away with bamboo sticks, iron rods and axes. In the violence, Trinamul supporter Ananta Dolui, 40, was shot dead.        
	Hours later, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is said to have sought the arrest of those involved, irrespective of their party affiliations. The CPM, though, has not condemned the violence publicly.        
	Sources said Bhattacharjee was also critical of some party leaders in Hooghly for engineering the clash with Opposition members when he spoke at the CPMs secretariat huddle the same day. He stressed the need for fighting the Opposition politically.         
	All three CPM activists were arrested on charges of murder on the basis of an FIR lodged by Anantas widow Manika. She had named 38 CPM activists in her complaint, including the trio, Samir Ranjan Lala, the inspector in charge of Arambagh police station, said.         
	Nagen Roy, 69, Basudeb Chowdhury, 59, and Balaram Majhi, 56, are members of the CPM-controlled Arandi II gram panchayat under which Chandravan and Hiyadpur fall. Basudeb is upapradhan of the gram panchayat. An Arambagh magistrate has sent them to jail for 14 days.        
	Our men picked up the trio from their houses in Chandravan and adjoining villages following raids through last night. They have confessed to having led the mob. We are interrogating them, a police officer said.        
	Benoy Dutta, the CPM MLA from Arambagh, alleged that the trio were framed by the police on Mamata Banerjees directive.

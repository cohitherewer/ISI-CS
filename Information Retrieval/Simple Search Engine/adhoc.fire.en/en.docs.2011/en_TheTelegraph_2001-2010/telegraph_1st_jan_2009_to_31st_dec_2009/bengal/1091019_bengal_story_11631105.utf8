                                                                                                               Sonia call to Mamata
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Sonia and Mamata                                  
	Calcutta, Oct. 18: Sonia Gandhi called Mamata Banerjee yesterday to convey Diwali greetings, but Trinamul Congress sources said their leader took the opportunity to highlight the prevailing lawlessness in Left-ruled Bengal.        
	Trinamul sources said Mamata had tried to explain to the Congress president what forced some of its leaders to lay siege to the chief ministers office on the eve of Diwali. After the four were arrested on Friday afternoon to end the three-hour protest, Trinamul supporters paralysed Calcutta in the evening.        
	Mamata briefed Soniaji on how our MLAs, including leader of the Opposition Partha Chatterjee, were manhandled before being arrested from Writers, said a key Trinamul functionary. She also requested Soniaji to be present in Jammu and Kashmir on October 28 for the flagging-off of a new train.        
	Congress leaders said it was a courtesy call Sonia made to all allies and Opposition leaders. She even called the BJPs L.K. Advani, who had launched a personal attack on Congress prime ministerial candidate Manmohan Singh before the Lok Sabha polls.        
	While talking to reporters this evening, Mamata refused to divulge what she discussed with Sonia but revealed that the Congress leader and the Prime Minister had agreed to be present with her on October 28 to flag off the train between Anantnag and Qazigund.        
	However, for once tomorrow, Mamata will have a more pressing engagement than highlighting Bengals misery.         
	She will be cooking for her brothers on the occasion of Bhaiphonta. All my six brothers and other relatives will be at my home. I will have to prepare some good dishes for them. I am skipping tomorrows cabinet meeting (in Delhi), the Trinamul Congress leader whom supporters call Didi (elder sister) said while distributing prasad of the Kali idol she had worshiped at home last night.         
	On Wednesday, Mamata will be back doing the usual  staging a sit-in to protest the the state governments terror. Tuesdays Esplanade rally will be the launch pad for a sustained movement that we have planned till next years elections to 82 municipalities.        
	The Congress today distanced itself from Trinamuls Writers siege. Asked about it, the party general secretary in charge of Bengal, K. Keshava Rao, said: Trinamul may be our ally but the party carries out political programmes independently. The Congress has no comments on the agitation by Trinamul legislators inside Writers Buildings.

          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                           Policemen rest at Bhimpur Santhal High School. Picture by Amit Datta                                                    New Delhi, June 19: Union home minister P. Chidambaram today charged the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government with dereliction in tackling the Naxalite menace and exhorted the state government to ban the outfit.         
	Since the chief minister was attacked on November 2 last year, the state government has done nothing, Chidambaram told The Telegraph on the eve of his meeting with Bhattacharjee. It is inexplicable why Bengal has not banned the Maoist party. We feel it should be banned in Bengal as it is banned in other states.         
	Under the unlawful activities (prevention) act, Naxalite groups and all their front organisations are banned by the Centre and by all states affected by Naxalite violence. However, Bengal has dithered even after a near-fatal attack on the motorcade of the chief minister and then Union steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan. Since law and order is a state subject, it is not obligatory for states to follow the Centre.        
	A home department official in Calcutta said the Bengal government wants to fight Maoists politically.        
	A CPM state committee leader added: We believe dialogue and not ban should be the process of seeking solutions in a democracy. If the state bans Maoists, how will we defend our stand against such action when Indira Gandhi clamped Emergency and banned many organisations?        
	The CPM has blamed the Trinamul Congress for being hand-in-glove with the Maoists. But Chidambaram stood by the UPA ally at a media briefing on cabinet proceedings. He said it was wrong to insinuate that the CPI(Maoist) are supported either by the Trinamul Congress or the Congress.... I have seen Mamataji condemn Maoist violence on television.         
	Chidambaram advocated a more comprehensive strategy to tackle Maoists, hinting at a larger effort that would go beyond Lalgarh. These cannot be ad hoc measures, there has to be a comprehensive plan, he said.         
	He also cautioned against expectations of a quick flushout in Lalgarh. This will take time, he stressed. But he also hinted that it was well possible that as security forces proceeded, armed Maoists may stage a tactical withdrawal.         
	At the same time, the home minister endorsed Bhattacharjees appeal to the Naxalites to come to the talks table. The CM told me he had made an appeal to Maoist leaders and tribal leaders that the state government is willing to talk. I endorse that appeal. The central government would be happy to facilitate such talks, he told reporters.         
	There is little likelihood, though, that a dialogue is on the cards. Talks with Maoists have failed in Andhra Pradesh and security strategists believe they used the time to regroup.        
	Chidambaram later dismissed too much speculation on a possible dialogue: I am not saying there will be a dialogue with Kishanji or someone but we are saying the tribal leaders (who support Maoists) can talk.         
	Chidambaram advised caution in the use of words such as war to describe the Lalgarh operation. A government does not go to war with its own people. These are Indians and they have grievances, in a democracy there are established ways of seeking redress, taking to arms is not one of them. But the word war should not be used, he said in answer to a question.

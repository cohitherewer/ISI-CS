The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Buddha balm for cop kin
                                                                                                               Buddha balm for cop kin
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at the unveiling of the police memorial. (Amit Datta)                                  
	Calcutta, Sept. 13: The compensation for police personnel killed on duty is soon going to be raised, the chief minister promised today amid increasing complaints from those posted in the Maoist belt.        
	The police have to work under odd circumstances. We should think of a cops family after his death, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said after unveiling a monument on Red Road to policemen killed on duty.        
	Now we are paying Rs 2 lakh (to the next of kin). The amount will be increased soon, he added.        
	Senior officers said they had sent several proposals to the chief minister, which include special privileges for personnel fighting insurgents.        
	Naxalite-hit Andhra Pradesh offers special life coverage and allowances to those taking on the guerrillas. We suggested that the police deployed in West Midnapore, Bankura and Purulia be provided similar benefits, said an officer.        
	Around 50 personnel have been killed on duty in the Maoist belt in the past five years.         
	A policeman in Lalgarh or Belpahari has to fight gun battles frequently. But a cop on Calcuttas fringes hardly has to pull the trigger. But now, the families of both are entitled to the same compensation, said a senior officer.         
	Special privileges for war zone personnel will greatly help motivate them, he added.        
	Two police constables have been missing from Lalgarh since July 30. A West Midnapore officer said the duo would be considered dead only after seven years, but an exception could be made. The compensation may be given if they remain missing for a year. If they return, the money will be deducted from their salary.

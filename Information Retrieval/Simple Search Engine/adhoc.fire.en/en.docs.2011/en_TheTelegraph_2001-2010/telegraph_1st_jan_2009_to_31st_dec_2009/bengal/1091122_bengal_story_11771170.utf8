The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Stop strike, govt tells Morcha
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Stop strike, govt tells Morcha
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 21: The state government today made it clear that contract workers of the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council would not be made permanent if the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha kept calling strikes in the hills.        
	Home secretary Ardhendu Sen said: If the hill agitation continues and normal work is disrupted, whats the use of making casual staff permanent? We will not tolerate such acts. The more they agitate, the more will be the delay in their absorption.... How can we proceed with the absorption process if a district magistrate is gheraoed for 12 hours?        
	On Thursday, Morcha activists and DGHC contract workers had held Darjeeling district magistrate Surendra Gupta and several other senior officials hostage for over 12 hours.         
	The Morcha said the state had assured it in September that 3,742 contract workers would be regularised and 3,000 posts created by November 15.        
	Sen admitted this. We did talk about speeding up regularisation work of 3,500-odd contractual staff. We also told them that the question of creating 3,000 more posts would be reviewed after ascertaining the volume of work, he said. But he added: They are creating problems and not allowing development work.

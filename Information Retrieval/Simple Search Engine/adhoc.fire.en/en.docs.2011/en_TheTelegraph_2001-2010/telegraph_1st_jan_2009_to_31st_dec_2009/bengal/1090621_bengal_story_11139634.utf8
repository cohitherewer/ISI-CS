The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Worried villagers wonder what next
                                                                                                               Worried villagers wonder what next

	Lalgarh, June 20: The only thing that changes in the lives of Lalgarhs villagers is who has got them by the throat.        
	Yesterday it was the CPM, tomorrow it may be the police, wholl take revenge on us, says the old man in Barapelia.        
	Today, its definitely the Maoists and the Peoples Committee against Police Atrocities from whom the resident of the liberated zone must take his orders.        
	Which is why, in his 70s now, he is on the Pirakata-Lalgarh road this morning, carrying a bow and a quiver full of arrows. He is headed for Kantapahari where the battle-ready from all Lalgarh villages have been asked to report. Each family must send at least one person. I left my three sons, their wives and my grandchildren at home, says the frail man in a lungi.        
	Does he want to fight the police and paramilitary?        
	Stealing a glance at his bow, he seems about to say something but stops at the sight ahead. Some 10-15 men, bristling with bows and arrows, axes, bamboo sticks, choppers, swords and sickles, are guarding the entry point to Chhotopelia, 7km from Lalgarh town.         
	The old man clams up. Suddenly, a woman in her 20s  wearing a torn sari and carrying a baby  comes running as she spots the outsiders (journalists). Do you think we can fight the police and army? The only thing we can do now is ask forgiveness. We only followed the committee leaders instructions she screams. The men look on silently. They look afraid.        
	Many villagers are fleeing to Jhargram. If we dont fight for the committee, well be in trouble. Then the police will come and create more problems, says a young man. He left his home in Madhabpur this morning, he says, after the police entered Lalgarh town and prominent committee and Maoist leaders went underground.        
	We could not do anything without their permission. Our lives were more or less the same during CPM rule. But the Maoist and committee leaders didnt beat us up the way CPM leaders did, says a resident of Dimla village.        
	The CPM had turned Lalgarh police station into its party office. Anyone opposing them was brought there and beaten up, he says, adding the committee and the Maoists have one thing in common with the CPM  an aversion to any form of opposition.        
	A choppers drone breaks the silence in Dimla. A sign of impending assault? The men look up nervously. No, its a shower of leaflets asking them not to let the Maoists use them. The government should realise we cant go against these peoples wishes, the young man says.

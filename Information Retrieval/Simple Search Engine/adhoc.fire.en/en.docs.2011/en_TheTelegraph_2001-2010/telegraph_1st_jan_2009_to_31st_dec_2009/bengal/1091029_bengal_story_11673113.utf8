The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Maoists split over killer Kishanji
                                                                                                               Maoists split over killer Kishanji
          BISWAJIT ROY                               
	Calcutta, Oct. 28: A section of Maoists disapproves of the politics of indiscriminate killing unleashed by Kishanji, a Bengal leader of the outlawed CPI (Maoist) said today.        
	Indiscriminate killings are counter-productive and turn public opinion against us, he said.         
	Some in the outfits state unit have even questioned Ki-shanjis way of dealing with CPM sympathisers. Besides the apprehension of losing the support of vocal urban pressure groups such as writers and artists, the Bengal leader insisted the opposition was ideological.         
	Mao had called for the blossoming of a hundred flowers. Murder of political rivals and denial of their right to spread their views will turn us into an undemocratic force in the public eye and help the ruling classes. How can we oppose the CPM elsewhere if we impose our armed hegemony on others in Lalgarh, he said.         
	The Maoist leader complained that Kishanjis excessive dependence on armed squads had turned friends into foes.        
	Several Naxalite and Jharkhand Party factions that were earlier part of the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities in Lalgarh have publicly accused the Maoists of imposing a one-party rule by maiming all opposition.         
	Kishanji, the man who runs the guerrilla organisation in Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand and Orissa, has justified the killings, branding his targets police moles. He said they were tried in peoples courts.         
	However, not all Maoists agree. What happens if CPM cadres take me to their stronghold and hold a kangaroo court? Even police moles deserve a proper defence, the Bengal Maoist said.         
	Kishanjis methods, he added, have undermined the genuine mass movements of Nandigram and Lalgarh. In Nandigram, he had floated the Matangini Mahila Samiti and the Ganapratirodh Mancha to propagate radical politics when we preferred to work under the popular Save Farmland Committee, which had all anti-CPM forces under it, from the Trinamul Congress to the Jamait Ulema-i-Hind.         
	According to the Bengal leader, the high point of the Lalgarh movement was the demolition of CPM leader Anuj Pandeys palatial building by a mob. It underlined their pent-up anger against corrupt and degenerate CPM leaders. But (Kishanjis deputy) Bikashs exhibition of weapons and crowing about his role in the movement in front of TV cameras undermined the peoples participation and helped the government unleash the forces.        
	He accused Kishanji of being intolerant and authoritarian even with his comrades.         
	His promotion of personal authority above the party is evident from his frequent sound bites to the media.         
	But nobody at the state level dares contradict Kishanji. The Bengal Maoist said: After all, the armed wing dominates our partys activities and he is considered a genius in military affairs.

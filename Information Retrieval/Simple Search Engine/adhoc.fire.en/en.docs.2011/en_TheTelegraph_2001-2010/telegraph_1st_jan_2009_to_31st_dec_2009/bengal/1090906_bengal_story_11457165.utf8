          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 5: A man from Uttar Pradesh has been arrested at Calcutta airport for trying to take nine people on tourist visas to Singapore with a promise to get them jobs.         
	Jayprakash Yadav of Gorakhpur was caught during immigration checks. The victims of the 44-year-old Yadav are also from the same district in Uttar Pradesh.        
	The 10 arrived at the Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International airport last night to catch a Singapore Airlines flight. Immigration officials had prior information about Yadav. All of them were carrying tourist visas but were actually going to try and get work there, said an official.         
	Yadav, detained with his nine victims, admitted during interrogation to taking money from people and promising them jobs in Singapore. He admitted to taking Rs 30,000 from each of them, the immigration official said. Yadav said he had taken people to Singapore earlier.         
	He was handed over to the airport police station. His nine victims were not allowed to board the flight but were released.         
	The nine were in their twenties and thirties, the police said. After speaking to them, the police said, the nine did not seem well educated.        
	The kind of jobs they had been promised were of waiters and cleaners that dont require much education, a police officer said. They were not carrying papers relating to their educational qualifications.        
	The police said they had got suspicious about Yadav because he had made several trips to Singapore from Calcutta in the recent past. Each time he travelled with a group but returned alone.        
	The police then made enquiries about him and decided to quiz him this time.

	New Delhi, May 6: The Elec- tion Commission today said 13 more observers had been sent for Thursdays polls in Bengal and ticked off candidates from both the CPM and the Trinamul Congress for personal tirades against rivals.         
	The poll panel has reprimanded Trinamuls Kalyan Banerjee for his remarks on the chief minister, and the CPMs Prasanta Pradhan for his jibes at Mamata Banerjee.

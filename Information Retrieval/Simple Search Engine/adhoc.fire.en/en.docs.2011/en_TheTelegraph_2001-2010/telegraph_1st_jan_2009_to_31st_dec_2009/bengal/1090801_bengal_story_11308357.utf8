The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Hooch in hospital
                                                                                                               Hooch in hospital
                            
	Tamluk, July 31: Illicit liquor is selling in the district hospital here, two months after it killed 33 and blinded 50 in the area.        
	Most of the victims in May had been treated at the Tamluk hospital, the fringes of which have turned a liquor den.         
	The shops, in the heart of the East Midnapore district headquarters, had apparently been running for months but neither the hospital nor police acted against them.        
	On a surprise inspection of the health facilities in the hospital, district magistrate C.D. Lama had a bigger surprise in store for her. She saw plastic pouches being sold from stores the hospital had built to generate more revenue.        
	Lama stood in front of one of the stores  empty by then  and dialled the district police chief. How is this possible?         
	Hearing about the visitor, chief medical officer Rabikinkar Nayek rushed out of the hospital. A police jeep screeched to a halt minutes later and a force led by additional superintendent Rabindranath Sarkar removed the liquor and demolished the shanties nearby where the liquor was consumed.        
	Sarkar blamed the hospital for the liquor trade on its premises. Madam, we had no information about it, he told the DM.         
	The chief medical officer passed the buck back to the police. The police should have noticed the liquor dens as their officers regularly visit the hospital, said Nayek.

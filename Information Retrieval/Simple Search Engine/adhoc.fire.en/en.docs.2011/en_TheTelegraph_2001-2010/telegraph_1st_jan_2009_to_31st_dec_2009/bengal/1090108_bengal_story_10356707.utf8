The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Body to monitor blood banks
                                                                                                               Body to monitor blood banks
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Siliguri, Jan. 7: The Centre will sanction Rs 950 crore to form the National Blood Transfusion Authority, an autonomous body for monitoring and extending financial assistance to blood banks in the country.         
	The proposal (to form the body) will be placed in the budget session of Parliament and probably will be implemented after April, said Apurba Ghosh, the chairperson of the National Task Force on Augmentation of Voluntary Blood Donation Programme, today. The authority will be an umbrella organisation to bring all private and government blood banks under one banner.        
	The task force under the Union health ministry coordinates the activities of the blood banks in the country.        
	Currently, blood banks in the country are under the National Aids Control Organisation (Naco). The proposed body will look into all issues relating to blood transfusion and will be assisted by state-level bodies.        
	Except for India, a national-level body for monitoring the blood banks has already been set up in all countries. Blood banks are of prime importance but so far we are functioning just as a wing under the Naco, Ghosh added.        
	Ghosh was speaking at the inauguration of a state-sponsored internal blood safety programme. The three-month-long campaign, to be held in 19 districts of Bengal, will create awareness on safe blood transfusion and motivating blood donors.         
	We will collaborate with NGOs to educate people on the safety and hygienic sense of blood donation. Workers will also be trained on technical aspects of blood transfusion, the chairperson of the task force said.        
	According to Ghosh, the programme targets to replenish stocks by 50 per cent in north Bengal, considering the blood shortage in the region. We intend to encourage voluntary donors so that blood stocks increase considerably, Ghosh said.         
	However, health officials working at the grassroots level expressed concern over a group of people roaming around in different health camps and boasting of donating blood without caring for their own health.         
	It is not just about blood donation but rather about safe blood donation. Donors should be aware of their health conditions before giving blood, said A.N. Mukherjee, the deputy director of Rajya Rakto Sanchalon Parishad, a state-run body.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chinsurah, March 12: Five seven-year-olds were injured when a large chunk of concrete fell on them today in a Hooghly school building constructed only three months ago.         
	Police said the chunk came off and fell when the Class III students, including a girl, were in a room on the ground floor of the two-storey building at the Beruipediti primary school near Dadpur. The condition of the girl, Bhiva Sharma, is serious.        
	Bhiva has suffered deep wounds on her head. We shall run a scan on her tomorrow, said Tarashankar Sahu, superintendent of Chinsurah Imambara Hospital, where the kids have been admitted.         
	Another kid, Mahendra Malik, recalled the incident occurred during their Bengali class around 11am.         
	We felt everything become dark when something fell on our head with a thud, he said from his hospital bed.         
	Headmaster Asit Paul, who rushed the children to the hospital, apologised to the guardians and promised a probe.         
	The two-storey building was constructed only three months ago from the MLAs development fund, Paul said.        
	Angry parents and villagers locked up the school, around 50km from Calcutta, after allowing its three teachers and 300 students to go home.         
	The local MLA, the CPMs Asutosh Mukherjee from Bansberia, visited the school and assured the guardians the school authorities wouldnt be spared if the probe showed negligence.

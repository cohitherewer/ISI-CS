          DEBASHIS CHATTERJEE                              
	Calcutta, March 22: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today attacked the Congress for surren-dering to the Trinamul Congress and called it a sinking party clutching at a straw to save itself.        
	The chief minister, whose party had lent support to the UPA government for four ye- ars, said the Congress was in such a state that a leader of Pranab Mukherjees stature had to strive for an alliance with Mamata Banerjees party.        
	This is what happens before a party sinks  it tries to save itself by clutching at a straw, the chief minister told a CPM gathering at Mathurapur and Diamond Harbour in South 24-Parganas.        
	He asked whether the Congress leader could guarantee that Mamata would not cross over to the BJP-led alliance after the polls. Pranabbabu has said he would take action against Congress workers who act against the alliance. But can he guarantee that the Trinamul would not join the NDA?         
	In Calcutta, Mamata vowed to stick to her new ally. We have struck an alliance with the Congress to fulfil peoples aspirations. So, I want to clarify that wed back our alliance partner if it is voted to power, Mamata said, adding: I am optimistic about our alliance partner forming the government in Delhi.         
	A day after Mukherjee wielded the iron hand, several Congress leaders were seen at a Trinamul workers meeting at Deshapriya Park in south Calcutta this evening.        
	The chief minister lamented that the Tata Nano would roll out from some other sta- te while criticising Trinamul. The factory was ready and the car could have rolled out of Singur. Around 6,000 people from the villages there would have got jobs. Today, the area is engulfed in darkness. Who is responsible for this?

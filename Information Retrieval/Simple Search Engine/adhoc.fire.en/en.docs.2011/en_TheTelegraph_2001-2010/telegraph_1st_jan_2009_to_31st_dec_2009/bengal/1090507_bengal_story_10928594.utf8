The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Holes in factory drive

  - Burdwan party report laments neglect of social sector        INDRANIL SARKAR                                    
	Burdwan, May 6: The CPM has admitted that its overzealous focus on industrialisation led to poor progress in the social sector, including education and health, in Burdwan, a traditional bastion and industries minister Nirupam Sens home district.        
	In an internal report prepared in the run-up to the polls, the partys district committee has expressed its worries about the possible adverse impact of the dismal performance in mass literacy, primary education, healthcare and rural infrastructure on its votes.        
	While supporting the decision to prioritise industrialisation, it must be said that major projects related to education, health and self-employment were not given proper importance and peoples expectations were not met. Had it been done, our relations with the village poor would have been better, says the document released last month.        
	The CPM had won all four parliamentary seats in Burdwan in 2004. Leaders hope to retain all three  the number came down after delimitation  this time.         
	Last years panchayat and municipal polls had first underlined the erosion in the rural base and the party has been banking on its organisational muscle to fix the social sector malaise.        
	The hopes may be too high: the report says the leaders are losing grip on the rank and file and failing to change the cadres power-hungry mindset.        
	The Sarva Shikhsa Abhiyan was cited as an example of how things went wrong. The report holds the zonal committees responsible for the lack of cadres involvement in the scheme.         
	It says the leadership felt shame and pain in noting the failures, given the goal of bringing all children to school by 2010 and containing the rate of dropouts up to Class VIII. The number of children out of school and the dropouts couldnt be controlled in this district, declared fully literate in 1991.        
	The document highlights a similar state of affairs in rural healthcare. Most health centres have no doctors. Basic medicines are not available. The peoples grievances are justified. Roads and power are also suffering from neglect, it adds.         
	The report also contains a veiled criticism of chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees claims of improved work culture at Writers, saying government employees recently given hikes hadnt lived up to peoples expectations. The government announced (the) pay hike despite acute financial constraints. But people didnt find a sense of responsibility among a section of these professionals. In this situation, it cant be said that work culture has improved.        
	The report doesnt lose sight of industrialisation, saying the drive has brought benefits, particularly in the iron and steel industry.         
	It holds up the reopening of the IISCO unit at Burnpur as a major political success and the reopening of three other public sector units (PSUs) in Durgapur.

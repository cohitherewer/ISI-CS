The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Party is cut off from people, says Somnath
                                                                                                               Party is cut off from people, says Somnath
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	Calcutta, May 19: Somnath Chatterjee has said the CPM should sincerely and genuinely introspect on the causes of its poll debacle, not just in Bengal but in Kerala as well.        
	The CPM should deeply introspect why it has got alienated from a section of the people, the former Lok Sabha Speaker and expelled CPM leader said in an interview broadcast on STAR Ananda tonight.         
	There have been lapses on the part of the party, there has been complacency. It must introspect why people have moved away. The party leadership should accept responsibility for what has happened, admit their mistakes, if there have been any, and convey this to the people.        
	Chatterjee said that the results could be seen as punishment for the lapses.        
	In 1977 (elections), Indira Gandhi had been wiped out from the country for imposing Emergency, but she made a comeback, Chatterjee said, adding the CPM could also do so.        
	This (the poor showing in Bengal) could be something temporary. Everyone in the CPM should try (to win the electorate back). If this does not happen, if this does not yield results, the party has to accept the people are not with them.        
	Chatterjee said the situation would not have come to such a pass had the party not withdrawn support to the UPA government over the Indo-US nuclear deal. The polls (in Bengal) have been fought on non-national issues like Nandigram and Singur, not the deal, Chatterjee said.         
	But he added: It would have made an aakash paatal (heaven and hell) difference today (had the CPM had not withdrawn support to the UPA).        
	He insisted that the results were more a negative vote (against the CPM) than a positive one (for the Congress and the Trinamul Congress).        
	Left parties should not sit in offices and do politics but go out and reach out to the people, Chatterjee said. I feel bad that there is so much of alienation from the people.        
	Asked if the party leadership was to blame, Chatterjee said without naming anyone: Accountability is the most important thing. No leader should think he is always right. This is Narcissistic.        
	But resignation, he said, was not a solution. If someone has committed a mistake and admits it and moves forward, it is more beneficial than resignation.        
	He denied calling for the resignation of party general secretary Prakash Karat. I have been misquoted. I did not name any individual, I was talking about the leadership, of which Karat is a part.        
	He also hoped Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee would not quit.

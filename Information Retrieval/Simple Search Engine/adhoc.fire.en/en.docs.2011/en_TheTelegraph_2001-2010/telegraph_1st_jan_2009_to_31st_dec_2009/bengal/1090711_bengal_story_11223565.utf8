The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Teachers stop kids meal
                                                                                                               Teachers stop kids meal
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Albandha (Birbhum), July 10: Midday meals were stopped at over a dozen schools in Birbhum over the past week because teachers felt organising them was a bother.        
	Most of the 2,500 children who study in the 13 schools about 210km from Calcutta come from families to whom the free meal is a major draw. Many stopped going to school after the teachers suddenly decided to stop the meal from July 1.        
	The official excuse: organising lunch was hampering academic activities.        
	The 40-odd teachers of the schools at Albandha have formed a union and told the district primary school council it better organise self-help groups to do the job.        
	The no-lunch protest was called off yesterday with the threat that the meal would be stopped again if the teachers were not relieved of the responsibility.        
	A headmaster, P.K. Singha, said that to arrange for the meals, teachers had to go to the bazaar at least thrice a week. Our schools start at 7am and it becomes difficult for us to attend classes and do the shopping at the same time. The classes go on till noon and if we go shopping after that we dont get fresh vegetables.        
	Teacher Asim Bhattacharya said: Besides buying provisions, we have to maintain accounts. When do we teach?        
	But a school education official said hundreds of teachers in Birbhum and thousands across Bengal were balancing the two, however difficult.        
	District primary school council chairman Goutam Ghosh said that according to rules, primary school teachers had to organise midday meals. They cant stop organising them one fine morning.        
	The scheme, drawn up to check the rate of dropouts, ensures for children a lunch of rice, dal and vegetable curry every day and fish or egg once in a while.

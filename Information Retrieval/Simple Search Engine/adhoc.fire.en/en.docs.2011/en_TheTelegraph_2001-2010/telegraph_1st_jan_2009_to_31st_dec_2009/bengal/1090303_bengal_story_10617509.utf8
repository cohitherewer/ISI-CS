The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Hurdles greet alliance
                                                                                                               Hurdles greet alliance
  - Thursday talks only first step towards sealing deal        BARUN GHOSH                                              
	Calcutta, March 2: Within hours of the joint declaration by the Congress and Mamata Banerjee that they would fight together in all the 42 Lok Sa- bha seats in Bengal, leaders from both sides sounded cau-tious, saying yesterdays talks were merely a first step towards forging an alliance.   
	Last nights discussion was merely a first step towards forging an alliance with the Congress. We shall have to cross many a hurdle before clinching the deal because problems are bound to crop up over seat-sharing, Trinamul Congress state president Subrata Bakshi said this evening.        
	Last nights meeting was hastily arranged by senior Congress leaders to send a message to their high command: that they had been able to persuade Mamata to firm up an alliance, he added.        
	Bengal Congress president Pranab Mukherjee was guarded today. Talking to reporters on the sidelines of a programme in his Jangipur constituency in Murshidabad, he said: Talks were held with Mamata last night. The talks were good. I shall report the out- come of our discussion to the AICC leadership, which will take a final decision. This is what I also told the media yesterday.         
	What was perhaps missing from Mukherjees statements was last nights enthusiasm. After last nights meeting, the foreign minister had patted Mamata on the shoulder and said: An alliance is necessary to make sure that the division of anti-Left votes is stopped.         
	Mamata, however, was more categorical today about the alliance taking shape. The alliance with the Congress is taking place. So the number of our candidates and the seats we shall contest will be lower, she said.         
	A Trinamul leader said Mamata had completed her preliminary talks with ally SUCI, which had earlier threatened to break away from the Trinamul-led Progressive Democratic Front if she tied up with the Congress.         
	We are confident that the SUCI, which will get one seat, will soon fall in line realising that preventing the division of anti-Left votes alone can oust the CPM from Bengal, said a Trinamul leader.         
	Congress sources said both Mukherjee and the AICC general secretary in charge of Bengal, K. Keshava Rao, had last night requested Mamata to spare more seats than the dozen she had decided to offer to the party two months ago. The duo urged the Trinamul leader to raise the number to at least 18, including the six already represented by the Congress.        
	Pranabda had also insisted on quality seats. We should be offered those seats in which our candidates have a fair chance of victory, a state Congress leader said.         
	Mamata, however, did not make any promise and said she would give her opinion after talking to her party functionaries and allies such as the SUCI, Party for Democratic Socialism and Somen Mitras Pragatishil Indira Congress.        
	In the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, Mamata had offered 13 seats to the BJP when she tied up with the NDA. Mamata will have to take into account the fact that the Congress is a bigger force in Bengal than the BJP. A request for 18 seats is justified, a state Congress general secretary said.         
	At the state election committee meeting yesterday, Congress leaders had urged Mukherjee to ensure Mamata did not offer insignificant seats to the party.        
	We must not be offered such seats as Burdwan East, Purulia, Bankura and Cooch Behar where the Left has a stranglehold. We want seats where our candidates have a fair chance, a Congress leader said.

	Durgapur, March 29: In a sea of election graffiti, banners, buntings and festoons, a neighbourhood in Durgapur stands out.        
	Its walls are clean and corners free of clutter with no flags or banners.        
	At Karangapara, it has been like this for, residents say, 50 years, because they were bent on not allowing politi- cians to grab their space. Generations have passed but the tradition has lived on and political parties have been forced to oblige.        
	Local Trinamul Congress councillor Biswanath Padial said: We are into politics and have to deal with common people. We have to respect their sentiments.         
	A lesson perhaps for many who feel scared to protest when political parties come for house owners signatures with pre-dated consent forms after defacing their walls. It also shows that what may not be easy for an individual may be possible for a group.         
	In Calcuttas Lake market area, too, a citizens body has managed to keep walls graffiti-free by threatening not to vote for any party that defaces the walls.         
	The Congresss Nargis Begum is contesting the Burdwan-Durgapur Lok Sabha seat, a new one created this year after delimitation. Her main contender is the CPMs Saidul Haque.        
	The CPM asserted the importance of colourful graffiti and festoons to draw voters attention but also said it could not afford to put off people.         
	We dont go against tradition and write graffiti or put up festoons or banners at Karangapara, said Naren Sikdar, secretary of the partys zonal committee and campaign manager for Saidul.        
	The Karangapara Gramonnayan Samiti was set up 50 years ago to look after drainage and drinking water problems in what was then a village. Karangapara, about 200km from Calcutta, has ceased to be a village now, having been made part of the Durgapur Municipal Corporation and housing over 2,000 families.         
	Elderly residents said the resistance to wall-writing was as old as the Samiti.        
	Anuradha Banerjee, who came to the area after getting married in 1954, said: There was an election soon after my wedding but there was neither any graffiti nor slogan-shou- ting as was common in the place I came from. I told everybody about it when I visited my parents at Gopalpur (in Kanksa, Burdwan).        
	Her doctor husband Krishnapada, 82, regretted that the poll panel had bowed to political pressure and allowed wall-writing with house owners permission.         
	Please tell me how many ordinary people will be able to summon the courage to raise their voices against political parties? But we are very determined in Karangapara. We will not allow defacement of walls or any kind of visual pollution, he said.        
	The first thing lawyer Debabrata Sain flaunts when he has guests at home is his spotless boundary wall. They are all amazed, he said.         
	Surya Kesh, 55, who owns a nursing home, heads the Samiti now. He said: We have supporters of various political parties in our locality but, on this, we are united. Candidates visit our houses to seek votes in small groups, without processions and slogan shouting.

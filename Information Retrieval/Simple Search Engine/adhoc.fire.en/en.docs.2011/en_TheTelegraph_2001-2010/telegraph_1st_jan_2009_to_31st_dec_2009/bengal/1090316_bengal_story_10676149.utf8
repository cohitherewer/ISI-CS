          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Krishnagar, March 15: A group of villagers beat to death a man who tried to rescue a neighbour from their blows in Nadia last night.         
	Narayan Biswas, 63, was sleeping when Kamal Biswas knocked at his door for shelter around 10pm .         
	A group of tribals had descended on Kamals house in Fulia, 90km from Calcutta, to avenge the death of a labourer working on his land.        
	According to police, Kamal, 50, had engaged three residents of tribal village Ramlakshmitala to dig out soil from a pit. He sold earth from his plot to brick kiln owners.        
	Around six last evening, a portion of the pits wall caved in on Rakesh Sardar.         
	Around 10pm, some 25 youths armed with sticks and rods called out for Kamal, who had just finished dinner. When he saw the mob from a window, he fled through a back door, said a police officer.        
	Some in the mob saw Kamal sneak into Narayans house and headed in that direction. After they banged on the door repeatedly, Narayan stepped out and tried to pacify them. But the tribals attacked him instead. Narayan slumped to the ground as the youths rained blows, the officer said.         
	His brother Krittwibas raised the alarm. Neighbours rushed out and caught hold of four of the attackers.         
	A well-to-do farmer, Narayan had a reputation as a Good Samaritan. Neighbours said Kamal thought he would be safe in Narayans house.        
	The four caught have been arrested.

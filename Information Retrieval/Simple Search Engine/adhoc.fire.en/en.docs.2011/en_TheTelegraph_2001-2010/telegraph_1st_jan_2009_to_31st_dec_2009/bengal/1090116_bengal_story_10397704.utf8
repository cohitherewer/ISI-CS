	Calcutta, Jan. 15: Information technology companies in the state will hire fewer people than last year because of the economic downturn, IT minister Debesh Das said today.        
	Das was speaking on the sidelines of Infocom 08-09, the IT conference and exhibition organised by Businessworld of the ABP Group that also publishes The Telegraph.        
	Das, who inaugurated the event, said companies may hire around 10,000 people, which is 5,000 less than last year and half of what the state had earlier projected for IT recruitment.        
	After the warning, came the good news. Das said: We have managed to bring in 30 firms engaged in IT and IT-enabled services so far in the current fiscal.        
	The minister said his department was hopeful about bringing to the state many more IT companies, but he did not give names.        
	This is the time for Bengal to act, Das said. We need to play our trump card  a world-class talent pool at a lower cost compared to other parts in the world  to bring important IT companies here.        
	He lauded the role played by Infocom in highlighting the states IT potential before the global business community.        
	D.D. Purkayastha, ABP Group managing director amp; CEO, said Infocoms mission was to develop a platform for the IT companies, for better networking and better opportunities. The events aim, he said, was to pave the way for more IT companies to come to Bengal.         
	This years theme at Infocom is Innovate to Integrate, but in the season of meltdown innovate or perish was, perhaps, on the minds of IT executives. The current situation is innovate or perish, said Sam Banerjee, director, corporate business development, Texas Instruments India.         
	Roopen Roy, MD, Deloitte amp; Touche Consulting India, asked IT companies to go to the masses. Reach the masses with world-class services faster was his advice.         
	Venture capital fund        
	The state government may register its venture capital fund, the West Bengal Venture Capital Trust Fund for Information Technology, Telecom and Electronics, with the Securities amp; Exchange Board of India.         
	The fund was floated by three state agencies. The government will also increase the corpus of the fund to Rs 6 crore from Rs 2 crore. Initially, the fund was aimed at assisting small IT units keen to set themselves up in the state. Since the fund may invest in equities, we need to register with Sebi, Das said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Villagers chase away Maoists in Lalgarh
                                                                                                               Villagers chase away Maoists in Lalgarh
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          A CPM supporters house in Salboni after being ransacked by Maoists on Sunday night. (Samir Mondal)                                  
	Midnapore, Sept. 7: A group of armed Maoists was chased and three of them were caught in possibly the first instance of villagers resistance to the rebels since the Lalgarh agitation started last November.        
	Over 40 villagers went after the five rebels, at least two of whom were carrying guns, with sticks and scythes at Nepura village, about 10km from Lalgarh town, forcing them to scoot and abandon plans of targeting a senior CPM leader.        
	Finding themselves outnumbered last evening, the Maoists fired in the air but could not scare away the villagers. A pipe-gun and other crude weapons were found on the trio caught. They were beaten up and handed over to police.        
	The Nepura chase was an unfamiliar event in Lalgarh where the Maoists have been hounding adversaries out of the area or eliminating them.        
	Five people have been killed since Saturday. A CPM branch committee secretary was the last of them. He was killed in Salboni late last night.         
	The turning of the tables at Nepura is being attributed in part to the villagers anger over the rebels trying to target Durga Tudu, 65, former CPM MLA and now a member of the partys West Midnapore committee. Tudu is a respected man and almost the CPMs tribal face in the area.        
	A dozen farmers returning from their fields first saw the five heading towards Tudus house and challenged them. The rebels, keen to avoid casualties among ordinary tribals for the fear of alienating them, did not open fire immediately. Even when chased by over 40, they mostly fired in the air.        
	Some signs have also emerged suggesting that the people of Nepura may have buried political differences and struck an informal understanding since seven Jharkhand Party (Aditya) and Jharkhand Party (Naren) workers were killed by the rebels recently.        
	They are all victims now, whether from the Jharkhand Party or the CPM, said CPM local committee secretary Chandi Karan.        
	The three caught have been identified as Kebla Pati, Sahadeb Baskey and Moktar Baskey. The police said Kebla had various charges against him, including murder. The backgrounds of the two others are being investigated. The five Maoists had come to the village to murder a CPM leader, said West Midnapore police chief Manoj Verma.        
	Governor concern        
	Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi today expressed his deepest concern about the violence in the Lalgarh region and some other districts.         
	The murder of people for their political affiliation in the Jangalmahal areas... and political violence in some other districts are matters of deepest concern. They pose a challenge to all those who believe in the democratic path, he said in a statement.        
	The governor called upon the people of Bengal and all political formations to strengthen the hands of the law-enforcing authorities as they strive to end this negation of democracy. Leaders of public opinion, regardless of their ideological or political affiliation must, therefore, meet this challenge together, he said.

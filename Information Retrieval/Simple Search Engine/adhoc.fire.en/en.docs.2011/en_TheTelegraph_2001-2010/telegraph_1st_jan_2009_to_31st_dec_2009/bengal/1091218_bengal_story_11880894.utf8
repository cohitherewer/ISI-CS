The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Transport hire right to owners
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Transport hire right to owners
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 17: Calcutta High Court today ruled that only owners of commercial vehicles should appoint drivers and transport unions should play no role in the matter.        
	Trade unions do not have the right to dictate terms to the owners of commercial vehicles regarding the appointment of drivers. Only the owners have the legal authority to appoint drivers of their choice, said Justice Pranab Kumar Chattopadhyay.         
	Todays order is significant because it sets a precedent in cases where trade unions often pile pressure on owners of private buses to take drivers of their choice.         
	On all bus and minibus routes across the state, the drivers, conductors and helpers of the vehicles are appointed from a list sent by the unions, a transport department official said.         
	Legal expert Sailendu Rakshit said: Todays order will become a precedent for similar cases across the state.        
	Justice Chattopadhyay also observed that transport unions had no right to stop owners from plying their vehicles if they didnt recruit drivers chosen by them.         
	The high courts order came on a petition moved by the owners of trekkers plying between Tentultola, Khejuri and Nandigram in East Mindapore.         
	The petitioners alleged that Intuc, Citu and Aituc leaders were not allowing their vehicles to run as they had refused to recruit drivers chosen by these unions.

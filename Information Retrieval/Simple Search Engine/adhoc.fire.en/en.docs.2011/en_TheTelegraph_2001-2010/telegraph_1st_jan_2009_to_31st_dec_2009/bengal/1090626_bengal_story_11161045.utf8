The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Buddha firm on ban
                                                                                                               Buddha firm on ban
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, June 25: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today made it clear at a Left Front meeting that he would enforce the central ban on the CPI (Maoist).         
	Officially, the front deferred a decision and decided to discuss it in the cabinet core committee on Monday. But the allies got a clear impression that Bhattacharjee had made up his mind to deal with the Maoists with an iron hand.         
	Despite our protests, he didnt commit on not arresting suspected Maoists under the UAPA (Unlawful Activities Prevention Act). He is in total agreement with Chidambaram, an RSP leader said, referring to the Union home ministers prod to Bhattacharjee to ban the Maoists in Bengal.        
	Bhattacharjees remarks suggested as much. There is a huge difference between the time when we opposed central acts such as Misa (Maintenance of Internal Security Act), Tada (Terrorist and disruptive Activities Prevention Act) and now. We need a strong law to deal sternly with Maoists and other terrorists, a front leader quoted him as saying when they reminded him of the Left legacy of fighting Draconian central laws.         
	After the Centres inclusion of the CPI (Maoist) on the list of terrorist outfits, we cant ignore it, Bhattacharjee reasoned while explaining his three-pronged strategy  administrative, political and development-oriented  to contain the guerrillas.        
	State CPM secretary Biman Bose did not defend the chief minister, inside the meeting or outside. No decision has been taken. How can I comment? said Bose, also the front chairman.         
	Instead, he iterated the front resolution that had opposed a ban on Maoists and stressed on a political battle to isolate them.         
	Bose criticised the rebels for trying to kill the chief minister and asked for administrative actions to restore normality in Lalgarh but parried questions on whether the use of the ban would be part of such actions. Since the law is applicable to the entire country, the chief minister said the state would decide how to implement it here. The core committee will discuss it, Bose said.        
	Party veteran Benoy Konar defended Bhattacharjee at the meeting. The heavily armed present-day Maoists cant be countered like the Naxalites of yesteryears, he said.        
	The allies accused Bhattacharjee of taking a unilateral decision. There is a clear dichotomy between your stand and the fronts. The front had ruled out the ban but you followed the Centres line. How can we reconcile the two? asked Kshiti Goswami, RSP leader and PWD minister.         
	We wont be in power forever. Then your decision will boomerang on us, said Kiranmoy Nanda of the Socialist Party. The CPIs Nandagopal Bhattacharya questioned Maoist spokesman Gaur Chakrabortys arrest. Only a few Maoist handbills were found on him. Did he really pose a danger to the state?         
	The chief minister said: He was involved in more serious offences.        
	When the Blocs Hafiz Alam Sairani said the Congress-led Centre would now pressure the state to accept a unified command over Maoist-hit states and make room for MNCs in the mineral-rich tribal belt, the chief minister shot back. The Maoists have paralysed the mines in Jharkhand. Is it in national interest?         
	As heated exchanges continued, the Blocs Ashok Ghosh suggested that the issue be sent to the core committee.

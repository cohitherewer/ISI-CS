The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Lalgarh boycott
                                                                                                               Lalgarh boycott
                            
	March 27: A Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities meeting in Lalgarh today formalised its decision to boycott the general election if its resistance to poll police failed.        
	We have decided to boycott the polls if we cant prevent the security forces from entering Lalgarh for election duty, said Chhatradhar Mahato.        
	The tribal leader threatened to block and dig up roads after the polls if the police entered Lalgarh.         
	In neighbouring Purulia, the tribals of Chhapragera on the Ayodhya hills held policemen looking for a man with suspected Maoist links hostage for almost six hours.         
	Pratik Kit, the officer in charge of Balarampur police station, had to apologise to the villagers for the raid. The blockade was lifted after after the police went away.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Asim claims advance from Delhi 
                                                                                                               Asim claims advance from Delhi 
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY AND CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                              
	New Delhi, June 2: The Bengal government today said the Centre had agreed to release a Rs 100-crore advance to help the state cope with the fallout of the cyclone.        
	On the other side of the aid divide, the Trinamul Congress said the first trickle of cent- ral relief materials had started reaching Bengal. The claim was backed by central government officials.        
	The assurance on the advance was announced by finance minister Asim Dasgupta after he met Union home minister P. Chidambaram, whom he called an old friend, and a very responsive and helpful finance minister Pranab Mukherjee.        
	The Rs 100-crore advance is not related to the Rs 1,000-crore grant the Bengal government today formally requested from the Centre.         
	Aid to the state government has been opposed by Mamata Banerjee who feels that any money should be given directly to local bodies in the affected zones, most of which fall in Trinamul Congress-controlled areas.        
	The advance Dasgupta referred to comes from the ann-ual calamity funds meant for the state. Usually, the amount  around Rs 175 crore  is given out in quarterly instalments. But given the impact of the cyclone, the Centre has decided to offer the advance, officials said.        
	The final decision on the request for the Rs 1,000-crore grant will take more time. The submission of the formal re- quest is one of the early steps in seeking central grant.        
	Dasgupta stressed that the 12th Finance Commission had laid out a system, which both the Centre and the state had to follow. The rulebook says we have to ask for money from the central calamity fund and only then can the Centre send an assessment team (and the money) is sent to the state government.        
	Mamata had met Mukherjee and Chidambaram separately after a cabinet meeting on Saturday and extracted a promise that relief would be sent even before a central team left to assess the states needs.         
	Dasgupta today said he had received the Union home ministers assurance on a central team, which would visit Ben- gal as quickly as possible to decide the demand for more money, and Indian Navy engineers to help rebuild dams before the monsoon goes into full swing.         
	Mamata said she had not heard of any promise made by the Centre to advance Rs 100 crore to Bengal and, therefore, could not comment.         
	However, sources close to Mamata iterated that the Trinamul chief had not diluted her demand that central aid should be sent directly to local bodies.        
	Our demand is based on 32 years of experience that any aid to the government in Bengal is gobbled up by CPM cadres, an aide to Mamata said.         
	Trinamul leaders and government sources said seven truckloads of materials had reached the state disaster mitigation secretary.        
	The materials sent include baby food, oral rehydration solution, medicines, water, tarpaulin sheets, saris and dhotis, the Mamata aide said.

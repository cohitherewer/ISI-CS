                                                                                                               Tit for tat exodus in Nadia 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Behrampore, Oct. 5: The Ranaghat municipality chairman has said he and 15 other councillors would switch from the Congress to Trinamul in protest against their partys move to take the Lefts support in Siliguri.        
	It is difficult to face the people after what happened in Siliguri. People have already started calling us the CPMs B team. Thats why we have decided to join Trinamul. Along with me, 15 other councillors have decided to cross over to Trinamul, Parthasarathi Chatterjee, the municipality chairman, said.        
	Nadia Congress president Shankar Singh said he was aware of Chatterjees plan to cross over to Trinamul but he denied knowledge about the 15 other councillors planning to leave. We know that Parthasarathi Chatterjee is planning to switch over to Trinamul but I have no report that others will follow, he said.        
	State Congress working president Pradip Bhattacharya said the Ranaghat councillors decision was a sad development.         
	Nadia Congress chief Singh said that he had called a meeting of the councillors tomorrow. But, I havent invited the municipal chairman, he added.

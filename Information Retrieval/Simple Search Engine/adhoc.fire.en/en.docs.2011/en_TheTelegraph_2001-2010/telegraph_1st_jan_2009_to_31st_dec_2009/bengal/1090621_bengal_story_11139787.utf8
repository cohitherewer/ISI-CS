The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CRPF manna for cops 
                                                                                                               CRPF manna for cops 
          OUR BUREAU                               
	June 20: Hunger has proved a tougher opposition than Maoists for state police so far.        
	Some of them had nothing to eat today until CRPF personnel took mercy and served them khichuri.         
	Our bosses are only there to pass commands. They are not bothered about our food. We got something to eat because the CRPF is around, said a constable waiting in a queue outside Lalgarh police station.         
	This was around 4.30 in the afternoon, hours after the forces had entered the police station. A CRPF vehicle had just rolled in and scores of constables had queued up. Two CRPF officers were handing out the khichuri on sal-leaf plates.         
	The CRPF has a camp in Lalgarh, where they have all the arrangements, including a cook. Why cant we have one? a RAF constable asked.         
	At Bhimpur Santal High School yesterday, the cops got neither lunch nor dinner. The Telegraph had reported how discontent was brewing.         
	You are doing the most important thing  serving us food. Duties cant be performed on an empty stomach, a constable told a CRPF jawan.         
	In Calcutta, the police brass said they were trying to address the issue. A team of nearly 80 personnel, including six cooks, were sent today. The team leaders have been given cash to buy daily rations, said DC Jawed Shamim.

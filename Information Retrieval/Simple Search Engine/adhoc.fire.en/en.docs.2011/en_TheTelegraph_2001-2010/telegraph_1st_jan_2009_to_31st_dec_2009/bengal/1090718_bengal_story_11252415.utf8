The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Cong celebrates, Mamata sulks   Allies in limelight tussle
                                                                                                               Cong celebrates, Mamata sulks
   Allies in limelight tussle
          BARUN GHOSH                          Shoot at sight: A man hurls a stone at a bus on Hill Cart Road in Siliguri. (Kundan Yolmo)                                        
	Calcutta, July 17: In a dramatic turn in Opposition politics in Bengal, the Congress today shot into centre stage with its hugely successful Bengal bandh, pushing the Trinamul Congress into the background and forcing Mamata Banerjee to an unusual retreat.        
	Congress supporters and activists roamed and ruled the streets across the state to enforce the bandh, aided by shows of violence. The Trinamul Congress chief, despite being in Calcutta through the day, took a rare step of avoiding to meet the media at her Kalighat house or even commenting on the bandh to which her party had lent moral support.         
	She wont meet you today to give her reaction to the bandh, party MLA Madan Mitra told waiting journalists.         
	The fact that the Congress could pull off such a successful bandh without much of an organisation or any high-profile leader also added to the partys jubilation and Mamatas discomfort.         
	The contrast in the reactions of the two parties to the success of the bandh was evident: while the Congress leaders were ecstatic, Mamata was either sulking or complaining about her allys tactics.         
	Although Mamata yesterday extended moral support to the bandh as a gesture of friendship, she had numerous complaints about the Congress on Mangalkot, said a Trinamul general secretary.         
	According to him, Mamata did not like the way Congress supporters resorted to violence by setting buses ablaze and damaging them with stones and rods.         
	Second, she was opposed to Congress legislature party leader Manas Bhuniyas hush-hush meeting with the chief minister on Mangalkot in the latters Assembly chamber yesterday.         
	The third sore point was the Congresss silence on the chief ministers alleged attempt to humiliate Trinamul in the Assembly by not mentioning the incident in which its leader Partha Chatterjee was prevented from reaching Mangalkot last month.        
	Fourth, the Congress allegedly did not discuss floor co-ordination with its ally before raising Mangalkot in the Assembly yesterday. My MLAs were caught unawares when Congress legislators suddenly began shouting slogans. Manas (Bhuniya) should have discussed the matter with Parthada before raising it in the House, Mamata was quoted as telling a party MLA today.         
	State Trinamul president and MLA Subrata Bakshi said Mamatas grievances are quite genuine.         
	We are not happy about the Congresss desperation to hog the limelight using Mangalkot, he added.        
	Congress MLAs led by Bhuniya were chased across paddy fields and stoned by alleged CPM supporters when they went to Dhanyarukhi village in the Mangalkot area of Burdwan on Wednesday. The area has witnessed clashes since alleged Trinamul goons killed a CPM leader in mid-June. The Congress team had taken with them relief materials for Opposition supporters.        
	So will the acrimony between the two parties take its toll on the alliance that was firmed up before the Lok Sabha elections? The question has been doing the rounds in political circles.         
	While Congress leaders felt that the efforts to win peoples sympathy on the Mangalkot issue would help the beleaguered organisation rejuvenate itself and at the same time further tighten the alliance, their Trinamul counterparts differed.        
	The Congress may feel rejuvenated by cashing in on a stray incident like Mangalkot, but it would affect the alliance if the party wants to steal the limelight ignoring Trinamul, warned a Trinamul MLA from south Calcutta.         
	The Congress general secretary in charge of Bengal, K. Keshava Rao, said over the phone from Delhi he would talk to Mamataji to find out if she had any grievances about the Congress.         
	In an apparent bid to hu- mour the Trinamul chief, Rao iterated that Congress leaders, including Union finance minister and state party chief Pranab Mukherjee, would attend Mamatas rally at Esplanade on July 21.

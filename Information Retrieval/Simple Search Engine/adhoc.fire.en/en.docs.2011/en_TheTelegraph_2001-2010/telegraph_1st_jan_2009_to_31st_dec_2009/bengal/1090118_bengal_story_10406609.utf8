The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | 2 years less, thanks to pollution
                                                                                                               2 years less, thanks to pollution
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Jan. 17: The average Calcuttan loses at least two to four years of his life because of the citys polluted air, a government hospital doctor said at a discussion organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry today.        
	At the discussion  Doctors Roundtable on Pollution and its Effects on Human Life  Santanu Guha, a cardiologist from Medical College and Hospital, said: The level of air pollution is reducing the life expectancy of the average city dweller by at least two to four years. He said the possibility of heart attacks increased at least two-fold in people continuously exposed to harmful emissions.         
	The Telegraph has been running a campaign against polluting two-stroke autorickshaws that use katatel, a toxic cocktail of petrol, kerosene and naptha, the fumes of which affect the central nervous system, the lungs and the heart  findings all doctors on the panel agreed with.        
	Pawan Agarwal, a chest specialist associated with a private hospital, said there had been a sharp increase in lung-related diseases in the city, while paediatrician Jaydeb Roy said children were the most vulnerable.        
	Children spend a lot of time outdoors, have a higher breathing rate, but a narrower respiratory passage.... Moreover, they remain closer to the ground. All these add to their vulnerability, Roy said.        
	The issue of secondary effect of vehicular emissions on the human body was also raised. Urologist Amit Ghose said the kidneys were sometimes affected as a result of medicines people take to counter the primary impact on the heart and lungs.        
	Santanu Banerjee, an ENT specialist, spoke of his findings linking vehicular pollution to deafness. Close to 60 per cent of Calcuttas residents suffer from partial to significant deafness because of the noise pollution, the primary source of which are vehicles. We look up to the government... but get little response, he said.         
	After failing to crack down on two-stroke autos, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said earlier this month that auto drivers could not be asked to change to LPG one fine morning.

	Sahagunj, Feb. 6: Workers affiliated to the Trinamul Congress-controlled Dunlop Banchao Committee today fenced off 30 acres outside the Sahagunj factory premises and announced the land would be distributed among employees of the closed unit.        
	Around 300 workers led by Tapan Dasgupta, the working president of Trinamul in Hooghly, planted pegs on the land that belonged to Dunlop.         
	Dasgupta said the land would be divided into two-cottah plots and distributed among the 1,000 jobless workers.        
	The Dunlop management has refused to comment. It has not lodged a police complaint yet.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Cong set to call up Mamata
                                                                                                               Cong set to call up Mamata
          BARUN GHOSH                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 16: The Cong-ress general secretary in charge of Bengal, Mohsina Kidwai, today said she would soon talk to Mamata Banerjee to firm up an alliance for the Lok Sabha polls.        
	I shall talk to Mamata in a day or two to finalise our alliance. Weve already sent a message to her on the proposed alliance by withdrawing our candidate for the Bishnupur West Assembly bypoll, Kidwai said over the phone from Delhi.        
	The Congress leader, who was here with veteran Union minister and state party president Pranab Mukherjee on Saturday to seek the views of state leaders, said she was made to understand that the Congress-Trinamul Congress alliance would emerge as a viable alternative to the ruling Left Front. I was told by the PCC leaders that Bengal wants a change of guard at Writers Buildings and that is why stitching an alliance with Mamata is the need of the hour.         
	Asked if Sonia Gandhi would speak to the Trinamul chief, Kidwai said: Our central leaders will definitely talk to Mamata. But as a general secretary overseeing Bengal, it is my duty to first discuss the proposed alliance with her.        
	Without naming the Congress, Mamata today urged the party to speed up the deal.         
	How long will you keep sleeping? For 32 years, you have done nothing. Wake up and get ready to work out an alliance to oust the CPM from Bengal, she told a rally at Esplanade.         
	People want us to get united against the CPMs misrule. Dont spoil their aspirations.        
	She had declined any comment on the possible alliance last night.        
	Trinamul sources said Mamata had deliberately stayed away from the budget session of Parliament to avoid sharing a platform with the BJP.        
	Didi is sending a message to the Congress: that she wouldnt share any platform with the BJP-led coalition, a Trinamul general secretary said.        
	A party MLA said Mamata was in touch with the Congress brass. That is why she has asked us not to attack the Congress at meetings.        
	In Burdwans Katwa, farmers unwilling to give up their land for a proposed power plant today renewed their agitation, led by Trinamul and Naxalite leaders. The authorities, however, said land acquisition for the project would continue.

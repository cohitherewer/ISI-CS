The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Elections in the shadow of guerrilla ultimatum
                                                                                                               Elections in the shadow of guerrilla ultimatum
          OUR BUREAU                                            
	April 29: Hours before polling in Bankura, Purulia and West Midnapore, the Maoists who roam the tribal belts of these districts came out with a chilling message: boycott the polls or pay for it.         
	Pay, in Maoist parlance, means with ones life.        
	We will try our fullest to stop the polls tomorrow, Kanchan, the head of the CPI (Maoist)s Bengal unit, said in a message released today.         
	Police and the CPM should not try to bring people to the polling booths. If they do, they will have to pay for it.        
	The administration has got reports of Maoist plans to disrupt polling. We are apprehending attacks on polling booths, home secretary Ardhendu Sen said this evening after a trip to the three districts.         
	The Maoists could set off explosions, much in the manner that the Maoists in Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh did during the elections there.        
	Some of the governments apprehensions were reflected in an incident in Bankuras Barikul this afternoon when about a dozen policemen and an equal number of polling personnel were prevented from proceeding to Ranibandh.         
	The trouble started around 1.30pm when some BSF jawans accompanying the poll personnel went to a shop at Poradia for cigarettes. The owner refused to sell them any, saying a social boycott of the police was on.        
	An argument followed and a jawan allegedly threw around some of the goods stocked in the shop. In no time, about 200 tribals surrounded the policemen and the polling personnel and blocked the road.         
	Among those who rushed there were supporters of the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities, which, though born in Lalgarh, has started a wing in Bankura as well. Maoists are believed to be guiding the committee.        
	Some people alerted the Barikul police station and a force was despatched to negotiate with the tribals. Even while this was on, another team of polling personnel arrived there on the way to Ranibandh and got stuck.        
	The blockade was lifted at 9.30pm after the Khatra subdivisional police officer gave a written undertaking assuring the tribals that such an incident would not happen again.        
	This incident (blockade) is most undesirable, the home secretary said in Calcutta.         
	I dont know why the polling personnel are being prevented from carrying out their duties. On Monday, we had to wind up a police camp at Kalaimuri (in Salboni). Yesterday, BSF jawans were gheraoed on the outskirts of Lalgarh. And now this.        
	Around 1,000 tribals gheraoed 20 paramilitary jawans on night patrol at Laljal village near Belpahari.         
	Although all eyes are on Lalgarh, the government fears Maoist strikes in Belpahari in West Midnapore and Bandwan in Purulia. From records, we find that the maximum number of explosions and murders of CPM members and policemen has taken place in these places, said a police officer.         
	Polling personnel will set off for these places early to- morrow. Many of the areas are not motorable, so the teams may have to walk 10 to 12km to reach their destinations. The roads may also be strewn with improvised explosive devices.        
	In some places, the polling personnel will be taken by helicopters, said an official.

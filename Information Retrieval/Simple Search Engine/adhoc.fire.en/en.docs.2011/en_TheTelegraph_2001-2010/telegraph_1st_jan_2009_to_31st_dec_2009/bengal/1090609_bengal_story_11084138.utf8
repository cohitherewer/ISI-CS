	Haldia, June 8: Around 600 casual workers at the Tata Chemicals plant in Haldia went on strike today accusing union leaders and contract- ors of pocketing half the money meant for them.     
	The Citu union denied the charge and the company called it an internal matter between the contractors and their labourers. The striking workers were engaged in loading and unload-ing operations.        
	Calcutta: Pranab Mukherjee wants to be relieved of the everyday work of the Bengal Congress and consulted only during crises. The state Congress president has formed an eight-member committee for the day-to-day job, a move, sources said, would undermine the role of the two working presidents who share the responsibility now.        
	Bankura: Supporters of the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities and the CPM clashed with guns near Lalgarh on Monday evening, capping a day of blockades by the tribal outfit in Bankura and West Midnapore to protest the arrest of some of its men.        
	Behrampore: Over 6,500 detonators were found on a duo in Sagardighi, Murshidabad. They were apparently on the way to Assam.

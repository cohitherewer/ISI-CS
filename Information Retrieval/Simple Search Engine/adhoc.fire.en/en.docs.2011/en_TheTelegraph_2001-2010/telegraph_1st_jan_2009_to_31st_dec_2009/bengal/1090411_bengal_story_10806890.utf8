                                                                                                               Load of bamboo kills girl
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Nadia, April 10: A three-year-old girl and her grandfather out for a morning stroll were killed today when a heap of bamboo sticks fell on them from a tilted truck whose wheels had got stuck in a hole.        
	Along with Nagendran Ghosh, 68, and little Sreyashi, their neighbour, 46-year-old Goutam Ghosh, who was standing at the side of the road, was also killed on the spot. Goutam was a clerk at the panchayat office in Nadias Bethuadahari, about 145km from Calcutta.        
	A police officer said: The trucks rear wheels went into a big hole created by soil erosion at the base of a banyan tree. The vehicle tilted and the bamboo sticks fell on the three standing on the side of National Highway 34.        
	Raghupati Ghosh, a resident, said: The branches of the banyan tree beside the highway have overgrown and they come in the way of trucks and buses. This morning as I was passing by, I saw the bamboo-laden truck lose control while giving way to another truck from the opposite direction. The rear wheels fell into the hole and the truck tilted. The bamboo poles fell on the three.        
	Nearly 500 residents put up a roadblock. They demanded that the tree be felled or its branches be chopped off. When Nakashipara BDO Subal Mahajan reached the spot, the villagers beat him up. He got two stitches on his forehead in hospital.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Clean chit to CPM B-team
                                                                                                               Clean chit to CPM B-team
          BARUN GHOSH                              
	Calcutta, April 28: Mamata Banerjee told her aides to forget those days when we called the Congress the CPMs B-team, a day after Sonia Gandhi said she was happy to share the dais with her again.        
	Dont bear any malice towards them. Forget those days when we called the Congress the CPMs B-team. Now they are co-operating with us in every respect to oust the CPM from Bengal, a Trinamul Congress leader quoted her as telling a closed-door meeting.        
	The meeting was held to review whether the two parties had acted as partners in the 14 constituencies going to the polls on Thursday. Of the 14, Trinamul is contesting six and the Congress eight.         
	Mamata was told that Congress and Trinamul workers had jointly campaigned in all 14 seats. We even campaigned for Deepa (Das Munshi) in Raiganj, though she had been critical of Didi after the alliance with the Congress was struck, a Trinamul leader said.         
	Trinamul, however, has been accused of backing an Independent against Deepa to scupper her chances.        
	Mamata told her managers to ensure that the camaraderie with the Congress extended to all 42 seats in the state.        
	She wanted an impressive Trinamul presence at Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs rally in Howrah on Friday. Singh will canvass for Trinamuls Ambika Banerjee and Sultan Ahmed, contesting from Howrah and Uluberia.

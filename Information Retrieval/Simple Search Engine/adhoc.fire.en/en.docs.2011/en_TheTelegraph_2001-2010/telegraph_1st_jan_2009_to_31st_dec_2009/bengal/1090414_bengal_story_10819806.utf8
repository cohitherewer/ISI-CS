The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Leader quits CPM for fear
                                                                                                               Leader quits CPM for fear
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                        
	Midnapore, April 13: A CPM leader of Belpahari put up posters in a village bazaar yesterday to declare she was no longer with the party following alleged Maoist orders.        
	I am quitting the CPM as I cant accept the partys objectives and activities, Benuka Mondal, 42, said in the posters.        
	However, the party said the guerrillas had forced her hand in an area known to be Maoist-infested. The rebels had apparently asked her to distribute leaflets or put up posters saying the CPM was corrupt.        
	Benuka was scared after she received the threats. She panicked after the murder of party member Asim Mondal at Bhulabheda on Friday, a Belpahari CPM leader said.        
	Benuka was the deputy chief of the Bhulabheda gram panchayat.         
	A party source said Benuka and her husband Joydeb, who owned a cloth store at the bazaar, had seen Asim being killed. The couple were panic-stricken since then.         
	A CPM branch committee member, Asim had quit the party three years ago because of a threat to his life but rejoined. He was sipping tea in a shop next to his footwear store when he was shot. Asim did not get a chance to take out the gun he carried for self-defence.        
	Today, Benuka said she did not want to talk about her decision. I am already in enough trouble.         
	The Jharkhand Party (Naren) runs the gram panchayat, winning seven of the nine seats in last years rural polls, but Benuka became the upa-pradhan (deputy chief) as the post was reserved for women.        
	The secretary of the CPMs Belpahari zonal committee, Amiya Sengupta, said Benuka had snapped all links with the party. She isnt contacting us. Her phone is switched off.        
	Bhulabheda became a trouble spot after the unrest began in Lalgarh, 35km away, last year. Suspected Maoists killed ration dealer Ashok Haldar in November. Two CPM members were shot dead last Month.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                                The woman in hospital   after being rescued from Behrampore station. Telegraph picture      
	Behrampore, Dec. 30: A woman begging for a living for the past two years was rescued from Behrampore station last evening after she claimed to be the widow of a former district medical officer.        
	Doctors from the Behrampore New General Hospital took her away after being alerted by a hawker about the plight of a government doctors widow.         
	Moujhuri, 40, has been admitted to the hospital.         
	She said she had got married to Surajit Ghosh in 1993 and that he died of a cardiac arrest three years later when he was posted at Balurghat Hospital in South Dinajpur.        
	She alleged that she had not got her husbands statutory dues or her widows pension. I have run from pillar to post and was preparing to file a case when I suffered a serious injury in my spine in a bus accident, said Moujhuri.        
	She cant walk and virtually crawls on her hands and feet and has been living in the waiting room of the station for two years.        
	Sources at the Balurghat hospital said Ghosh had indeed been the district medical officer (DMO) there when he died an unnatural death.         
	When he came to Balurghat, Ghosh was a widower with a seven-year-old son, said an official who has been in the hospital since the 90s.         
	Subsequently, he said, the doctors sister-in-law started living with him. He could not confirm if they had got married.        
	Moujhuri claimed that she was Ghoshs second wife. Surajit was first married to my elder sister Ellora. With Ellora, Surajit had a son, but he doesnt maintain any contact with me. Surajit was originally from Asansol, but his relatives, too, dont keep any contact, she added.        
	A Howrah-based lawyer, Benoy Bhusan Acharya, said he had with him photocopies of Moujhuris marriage certificate. She had contacted him to help her get her pension, but did not file a case because she had no money. Instead, I drafted some appeals for her to file at Writers and the health department, the lawyer said.        
	Moujhuri said she used to live at a rented house in Calcuttas Belgachhia after her husbands death. She apparently came to Behrampore  250km from Calcutta  two years ago to approach a relative for shelter but was turned away.        
	Doctors said she was very weak because of undernourishment over a long period. We have to keep her under observation for some time, said orthopaedist Nirmalya Das, under whose care she had been admitted.

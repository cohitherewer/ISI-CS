          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 13: The Bengal government is shutting the stable doors after the horses have bolted.        
	It will issue a circular on Monday to improve work culture in Writers Buildings when an exit from office is almost looking imminent with the Trinamul Congress flogging the Left in successive elections.         
	Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had begun his tenure with a do-it-now slogan but it took his government a battering to realise after three-and-a-half-years that his promise had been defeated in his backyard.        
	Finance minister Asim Dasgupta insisted that it would now be done. In the past few weeks, we have got reports of poor or late attendance in government offices and files piling up. I had a talk with the chief minister about it. We have decided that the work culture will have to be improved in government offices and governance made faster. So, we will bring out a circular on Monday, he said.        
	Dasgupta stressed that employees would not be allowed to be happy go lucky.        
	They cant be slack. They should gear themselves up. Ministers will have strict supervision on the work of their staff. The higher-ups in the administration will also ensure the improvement of work culture. We will monitor work regularly and, if possible, at seven-day intervals. There will be no room for complacency.        
	All earlier attempts to enforce work culture at Writers have come a cropper. Employees supposed to come by 10.15am and leave after 5.15 in the evening walk in and out at will.         
	For supervisors who dont bother to check attendance registers, monitoring performance every seven days will be a very tall order.        
	Rallies and processions by employees opposed to the CPM-backed union have become a new feature of Wri-ters.         
	Asked about todays announcement, the president of the Trinamul-dominated State Government Employees Federation, Mangalmoy Ghosh, said: The government and the CPM have destroyed work culture over the years. Co-ordination committee (the CPM union) members do not lift their fingers, let alone work.         
	He also suggested that a government which had not cleared DA arrears had no right to issue such directives. The government is talking of improving work culture after not paying our DA arrears. We will respond appropriately by intensifying our movement against it.        
	The leader of the CPM union, Ananta Bandopadhyay, said his organisation had always wanted work culture in government offices.        
	Salaries have gone up. So, government employees must work to earn.        
	He refused comment on the alleged pressure that his union brought upon officials whenever they tried to crack the whip.

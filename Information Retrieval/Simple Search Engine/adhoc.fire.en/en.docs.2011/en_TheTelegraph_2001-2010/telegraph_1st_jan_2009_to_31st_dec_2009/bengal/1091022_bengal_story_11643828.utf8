          OUR BUREAU                            Swapan Roys daughter Barnali and Dibakar Bhattacharyas son Dipankar at the Midnapore police lines. (Samir Mondal)				                                 
	Oct. 21: Police bugles played the Last Post for slain sub-inspectors Dibakar Bhattacharya and Swapan Roy at the Midnapore police lines this afternoon.        
	Eyes welling up, Dipankar Bhattacharya, 21, and Barnali Roy, 23, stood in a corner of the camp during the guard of honour for their fathers.         
	After the bugles stopped, seven policemen raised their rifles to their shoulders, aimed at the sky and fired three volleys as a mark of respect to their colleagues who fell to Maoist bullets yesterday.        
	West Midnapore district superintendent of police Manoj Verma was among those present during the guard of honour. He spoke to Dipankar and Barnali.        
	Dipankar, the eldest of Bhattacharyas two sons, and Barnali, the eldest of Roys two daughters, went to the Midnapore Medical College and Hospital before that to receive their fathers bodies.         
	The state police chief, Bhupinder Singh, had visited their quarters in the towns police lines, said Barnali, 23, an MA in history from Vidyasagar University.        
	Her sister Rinki, 21, is a third-year BA student in Midnapore Womens College. We told the DG to ensure a job for us sisters. We told him we are even ready to be in the police but without a job our family will be ruined, said Barnali.        
	Her father had joined the Sankrail police station only last month. Immediately after his posting, my father told us that it was scary there because even the doors and windows of the police station were broken, Barnali said.         
	At their Contai home, her mother is still losing consciousness frequently out of shock. She could not make it here, the young woman said.        
	Dipankar said he was struggling to come to terms with the sudden turn of events. I still cant believe it, he said, his downcast chin weighing heavy on his hand.

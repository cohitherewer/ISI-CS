The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Water overturns bus
                                                                                                               Water overturns bus
                            
	Durgapur, Sept. 6: At least five people were feared killed when the swirling waters of the Kangshabati flowing over a makeshift bridge overturned a bus in Bankura this evening.        
	Thirty passengers had been rescued till late tonight, while nearly 20 others were perched on the overturned bus, waiting for help.        
	The bus, going to Bandwan in Purulia from Bankura, is believed to have had around 55 passengers, including some on its roof. When it reached the 200-metre long Bailey bridge  about 45km from Bankura town  amid blinding rain, the passengers apparently asked the driver not to push ahead, but he did not listen.        
	Mid-bridge, the bus started to lose its balance because of the current. The driver stopped the engine as passengers started screaming and then a surge of water overturned the bus. It fell on its door.         
	As the windows had no grilles, about 20 passengers clambered out and got down on the bridge but were washed away. Local residents rushed to the rescue.        
	Some like Santi Chakraborty, in his 30s, swam to safety.         
	Chandana Mondal saved herself by holding onto a railing on the side of the bridge until being rescued.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Mausam Benazir Noor                                  
	Malda, Nov. 17: Mausam Benazir Noor is getting married to a former law school mate.        
	The groom for the lawyer, La Martiniere alumnus and MP is Mirza Kayesh Begg, who now practises in Calcutta High Court.         
	Mausam broke to us her marriage plans today and the family is very happy, her uncle Abu Naser said in Malda.         
	The wedding will be held at the Kotwali residence of the Khan Chowdhurys in Malda on December 5 and a reception will follow in Calcutta on the 13th. We are arranging for the reception at our Beck Bagan house, where Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi will be among the invitees, added Naser.        
	Kayesh had met Mausam in 2004 while studying law in Calcutta University. I practise under my senior at the high court. I will be in Malda on December 5, he said today.         
	Sources at the Kotwali said Kayesh was from Asansol. His father is a lawyer and mother a schoolteacher.         
	A Mausam kin said they had smelt something between the two when the young man accompanied her during her Lok Sabha poll campaign.         
	Mausam, who loves swimming, can play tennis and had been an associate in a reputable law firm, was not available for comment. She is the youngest of late MLA Ruby Noors three daughters. The eldest, Sonia, is a doctor in the UK.         
	Uncle Naser said they were all the more happy because the wedding was to take place at the family home. My brother Ghani Khan renovated the house in 1982 and there hasnt been a wedding since. Sonia got married in Calcutta and we are making grand plans for Mausam, he said.

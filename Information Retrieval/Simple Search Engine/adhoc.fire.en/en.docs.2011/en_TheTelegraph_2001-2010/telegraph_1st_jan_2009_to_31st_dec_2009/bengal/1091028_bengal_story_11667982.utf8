                                                                                                               Deploy army against Maoists, says Mamata
  -   Minister against police role 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          A broken windowpane of the Rajdhani Express (below) and a jawan near the train gets ready for a possible encounter. (PTI)                                                 
	New Delhi. Oct. 27: Mamata Banerjee today asked the Centre to deploy the army against Maoists instead of a joint operation with Bengal police in Lalgarh, the change of stand coming on a day a Rajdhani Express was blocked by a Maoist-backed outfit.        
	The Trinamul Congress chief, who is the railway minister, said she had told Union home minister P. Chidambaram: Dont use the assistance of the state government to combat Maoists. Only use the army for the task.         
	Trinamul had opposed joint operations by central paramilitary forces and Bengal police in Lalgarh from the very beginning, arguing that the offensive would lead to human rights abuses. The security forces are torturing villagers in the name of a joint operation, Mamata had said in July.        
	Sources in Trinamul said the change in stand was triggered by Mamatas realisation that the partys current position on Maoists was indirectly drawing the Congress, which is her ally, and the CPM, her arch-enemy, closer.         
	The Congress and Trinamul have had differences over seat-sharing in several local-level elections over the past few months. Last month, the Congress tied up with the CPM to bag the mayors post in Siliguri when Mamata refused to give up claim to the post         
	The tension between the allies was evident today, too. Mamata suggested that the home ministry was deliberately turning a blind eye to the crimes by alleged CPM cadres in the state.         
	I asked the the home minister... where else in India does such violence occur? If these things had happened in Gujarat, the Centre would have intervened. Then why not in Bengal? Mamata said.         
	The CPM and the Maoists are brothers, she said. I dont know how much of the violence in Bengal is thanks to the Maoists and how much because of the Marxists. But they are brothers.         
	She added that she had repeated her partys demand for the imposition of Article 355, a warning, followed by Article 356, Presidents rule, unless the state government corrects itself.         
	The Trinamul chief asked why the home ministry was was not agreeing to the demands when her party leaders were receiving complaints everyday of violence against ordinary people and her workers. Is Bengal an exceptional child (among the states)? she asked.        
	Mamata also suggested that the CPM may have a role in railway mishaps. They (the CPM) are creating all these problems for the railways. Why do you think I ordered a CBI probe into the Mathura accident? she asked, referring to the crash of two trains near Mathura last week.         
	Relatives of two constables, Sabir Mollah and Kanchan Garai kidnapped by Maoists three months back, accompanied her when she spoke to Chidambaram.         
	The home minister, Mamata claimed, told her and the relatives of the constables that the Centre had no information to suggest that the duo had been killed.         
	She also criticised chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who inadvertently said the cops had been killed.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 21: The West Bengal State University in Barasat has announced it will give photocopies of answer scripts to examinees dissatisfied with a review of their results. The concession is possibly a first by any state university.        
	At least four colleges on the northern fringes of the city  Bidhannagar College in Salt Lake, Motijheel College in Dum Dum, APC College in New Barrackpore and Rashtra Guru Surendranath College, Barrackpore  have said that over half their BA, BSc and BCom Part I examinees were dissatisfied with the results.        
	This was the first examination the university, which is about a year and a half old, had conducted for the stud-ents of the 57 colleges affiliated to it.         
	Over 30,000 students appeared in the examinations five months ago; the results were declared on Thursday.        
	Kamalesh Bhaumik, the university registrar, today said: Aggrieved examinees will first have to apply for a review of their answer scripts. The results of the review will be declared within a month. The students will be given photocopies of their answer scripts if they are not happy even with the review.         
	If necessary, the university may ask the colleges to show the students the answer scripts of internal examinations.        
	Many students have complained they received poor marks in the university examination after scoring much higher in the college tests.        
	A student from APC College has alleged he scored almost 90 per cent in the internal assessment but his score in the university examination was less than 50 per cent.        
	Anil Bhattacharya, a member of the universitys executive council and a leader of the CPM-controlled West Bengal College and University Teachers Association (WBCUTA), said: We have tried to keep the results free of error as much as possible. The results have been prepared with adequate care given to accuracy.        
	Since some students have claimed there were lapses, we will give them copies of their answer scripts if they are not satisfied with the reviewed results.         
	He claimed the university was the first in the state to give answer scripts to aggrieved students.        
	Registrar Bhaumik said: Our university is just over a year old and we have held a major undergraduate examination for the first time.        
	We are trying to maintain as much transparency as possible in our examination system and that is why we have decided to give copies of answer scripts to aggrieved students.

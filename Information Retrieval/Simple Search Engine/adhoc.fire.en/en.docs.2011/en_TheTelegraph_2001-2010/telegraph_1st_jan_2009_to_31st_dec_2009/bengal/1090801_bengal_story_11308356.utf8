The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Karat to party: Admit errors 
                                                                                                               Karat to party: Admit errors 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, July 31: CPM general secretary Prakash Karat today urged his Bengal comrades to admit the mistakes made by the government and the party to stage a turnaround following its worst ever poll performance.        
	We have to go back to the people and admit our mistakes, overcome our shortcomings, and eliminate wrong trends in the party. We have to learn from E.M.S. Namboodiripad, who was modest and always admitted his mistakes, Karat told a programme to mark the birth centenary of the first communist chief minister.         
	He didnt elaborate on the mistakes and shortcomings as chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and state party state secretary Biman Bose listened to him grim-faced. But the party chief urged the state government to tune its moves to peoples expectations.        
	In a way reminding the government of its failures, Karat spoke of emulating EMSs success in universalising education and building an effective public distribution system. We have to improve the standard of peoples lives.        
	The partys powerful state committee will meet for two days from tomorrow to discuss course correction in the presence of Karat and politburo member Sitaram Yechury.        
	In its review of the poll debacle, the CPM central committee had listed land acquisition and the Trinamul Congresss success in driving a wedge between the party and sections of the peasantry among the main reasons.         
	It had asked the govern-ment and the party to rework its industrialisation strategy and restore links with the alienated farmers.         
	Failures in other areas of governance, particularly health, education, roads, irrigation, rural electrification and lacunae in list of below-poverty-line people, also featured on the list along with the bureaucratic attitude and arrogance of leaders.         
	Although Bose today thundered against self-serving party members and threatened to purge them, not many were convinced.         
	As he urged cadres to emulate the selfless Namboodiripad, a middle-aged leader was heard telling a fellow comrade: Who will rectify our leaders? EMS would have turned in his grave had he seen the lifestyle of some of them.         
	While urging course correction, Karat also spoke of the usual CPM conspiracy theo- ry in which anti-communists gang up against the party for opposing the Congresss neo-liberal policies and strategic partnership with the US.

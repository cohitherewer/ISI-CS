The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | State nod must for top cop trial: HC
                                                                                                               State nod must for top cop trial: HC
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 9: The high court today said the CBI had no authority to prosecute any cop of the rank of subdivisional police officer or above without the states approval.        
	The order would act as a precedent in the case moved by former detective department deputy commissioner Ajoy Kumar, charged with abetting suicide, criminal conspiracy and intimidation in the Rizwanur Rahman case. Kumars contention has been that the CBI cannot prosecute him without the state governments sanction. A deputy commissioner is higher in rank than an SDPO.        
	Allowing a petition by former Kharagpur SDPO Jayanta Mukherjee, whom the CBI had indicted in a custody death case, Justice Arunava Basu today said he had performed his duty and the central agency could not prosecute him without the state governments sanction.        
	Soumendu Mondal of Kharagpur was picked up from home on July 7, 2004, and accused of committing robbery and possessing arms. The next day, the police said he was dead.         
	Kharagpur police station refused to accept the Mondals FIR accusing the police of murder and Soumendus mother Biva approached the Midnapore chief judicial magistrate. The 70-year-old widow moved the high court after the police refused to act on the magistrates arrest warrants. In June 2005, the high court asked the CBI to probe the death and start criminal proceedings against the policemen if found guilty.        
	The CBI said: Soumendu was brutally tortured in custody. It accused the police of tampering with papers and chargesheeted 13, including Mukherjee.         
	The officer then argued in the high court that the CBI had no authority to initiate proceedings against him. The government has refused the CBI permission to put Mukherjee in the dock.        
	Bivas lawyer Alok Mitra said they would challenge todays order.        
	Jail for proposal to BDO        
	A 45-year-old guard of the Andal block development office near Durgapur was sent to jail for a week today for texting a marriage proposal to BDO Mohua Das.

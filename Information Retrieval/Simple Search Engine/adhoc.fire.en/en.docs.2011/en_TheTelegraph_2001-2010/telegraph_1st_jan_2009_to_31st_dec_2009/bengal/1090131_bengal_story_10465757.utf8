	Calcutta, Jan. 30: The Congress legislature party wrote to the Speaker today, requesting him to disqualify MLAs Somen Mitra and Sudip Bandopadhyay, who had not resigned even after quitting the party.         
	Mitra, the Congress MLA from Sealdah, had floated his own party in July. Bandopadhyay, the legislator from Bowbazar, joined Mamata Banerjees Trinamul Congress two months ago.         
	Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim said the House would serve showcause notices on the former Congress men before disqualifying them.

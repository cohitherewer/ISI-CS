The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Sticky point: Tata damages
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Sticky point: Tata damages
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 9: The compensation to be paid to Tata Motors would be the key issue before the state government gets the Singur land back and works out a deal for a joint venture with the railways.        
	Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee, now the railway minister, had proposed the joint venture for a coach factory on the Singur land.        
	In such a case, the state governments equity would be the land, while the railways equity would be the cost of setting up the factory, she said.        
	For the government, which will have to pay the Tatas compensation, the valuation of the land would include the actual cost paid for acquiring the 997 acres (around Rs 130 crore) plus the compensation to the company for the losses it suffered.        
	Also, the valuation would have to be acceptable to the railways.        
	If the Tatas seek a steep compensation and the government shells out the money, that would also be its equity in the rail project. In such a case, chances are that the states equity would be higher than the railways, which Mamata may not like.         
	If the state leases out the land to the railways, such issues would not arise. But then the compensation would be a drain on the exchequer. It is unlikely that the state would be able to charge a higher lease rate from the railways than it did from Tata Motors.        
	First, the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation would have to write to the Tatas on cancelling the lease. But observers expect a detailed dialogue first to fix the compensation.         
	The Tatas and their vendors have lost between Rs 300 crore and Rs 500 crore. Apart from the money spent on land filling and development of infrastructure such as roads inside the factory, the company may seek damages for the lost opportunity.        
	A senior chartered account on condition of anonymity said the state could ask the Tatas to share the loss. There is no certainty that a business venture will only result in profits. It may be a loss too and the company should be asked to share that with the state.        
	The damages the Tatas would depend on the interest the company paid on the money borrowed to build the Nano plant. Since the plant remained idle, the interest was wasted.

	Lalgarh, June 28: Prasanta Sahash Roy stooped as he ste-pped out with his bag of 12kg rice collected from the block office in Lalgarh town, having waited his turn in a queue of around 3,000.        
	There was a look of disbelief on the villagerss faces as they saw the 70-year-old, a descendant of the over 250-year-old Lalgarh zamindar family, trudging home, his face gleaming with sweat.         
	Prasanta wasnt there alone. With him was younger son Bhargab, 27, holding seven-year-old nephew Rajdeeps hand.         
	The father and son were carrying voter identity cards, like the others, for the rice. A crisis knows no elite.        
	The Lalgarh trouble has reduced the family that once fed thousands of villagers to collecting government relief.         
	Till the zamindari system was in place, our family used to provide relief to thousands of people in 26 mouzas during floods and droughts. During the Rath festival, 5,000 to 7,000 villagers used to be fed for days, Prasanta said.        
	Bhargab said the family had run out of cash. Because of the police operation since June 18, banks in Lalgarh town arent opening. Foodgrain, too, is scarce in the market because of lack of supplies.        
	Prasanta, who has thrown feasts for distressed villagers in the past, despairs at the turn of events. The authorities didnt give us the rice meant for my wife and daughters-in-law as they couldnt be present in person.        
	Prasanta owns 10 acres and puts all the money from crop sales in banks. His two sons, Bhargab and Kaushik, 30, work in private firms and the familys daily expenses are met from their incomes. Kaushik is based in Kharagpur. Bhargab stays with his father.        
	Local jeweller Nirmal Dutta, 53, also in the queue, said: They are a revered family. We have seen Prasantababu donating money and distributing blankets and saris to the poor.        
	Sambhu Mandi, 42, a farm labourer from Pathardanga village, was also amazed. We have worked on their land for generations. Through the year we have worked in their homes, clearing the garden or whitewashing walls. But fate has forced him to stand with us.        
	After collecting the rice, Bhargab scoured the Lalgarh bazaar but could not find a single egg. Finally, he bought seven at Rs 4 each from a resident who owns a small poultry.         
	Truckers are reluctant to carry provisions to Lalgarh because of the intense checking by the forces. Whatever we are getting are coming on cycle vans from Jhargram town, said grocer Jyotirmoy Das.         
	The Roys middle name is Sahash  courage in Bengali  a title Prasanta said they had got from Nawab Alivardi Khan along with vast tracts of land as gratitude for their valour in fighting off Maratha invaders.         
	His ancestors  brothers Ram Chandra and Lakshman Chandra Sahash Roy  had also been awarded the title Raja in the 1750s, Prasanta said.        
	While Ram Chandra built his palace in Ramgarh, naming the area after him, his brother Lakshman Chandra built his palace in Lalgarh (the name comes from the reddish soil of the region). At present, Prasanta lives in his sprawling ancestral house with around 50 other relatives.

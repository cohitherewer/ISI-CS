                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Mamata embarrassed and humiliated     Ally seeks PM balm
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Mamata Banerjee: Very unhappy                                        
	New Delhi, Dec. 3: Mamata Banerjee has told home minister P. Chidambaram that she is extremely unhappy that a central team that visited Bengal to assess law and order restricted itself to discussions with the state government.         
	An angry Mamata told Chidambaram that by choosing not to visit any of the trouble-torn spots identified by the Trinamul Congress, the central team had reduced its visit to a mockery, party sources said.         
	The Trinamul chief, the sources said, felt embarrassed and humiliated that a team sent because of the partys intervention chose to base its assessment of Bengals law and order on the views of state officials.         
	Mamatas comments also reflect a growing sense of frustration within Trinamul over the home ministers approach to their complaints against the Left government.         
	Trinamul MPs are scheduled to meet the Prime Minister tomorrow noon to air their grievances against the home ministry team for ignoring their concerns.         
	There is a growing sense in the party that appealing to the home minister  as we have been doing  may no longer yield us returns. Thats why we will appeal to the PM for his intervention, an MP said.         
	Mamata did not broach the issue at tonights cabinet meeting because she wanted to take it up personally with the Prime Minister.         
	Earlier today, her MPs forced a n adjournment of the Lok Sabha accusing the state government of genocide.         
	Although they did not raise slogans against the government or the home ministry, they refused to allow proceedings to continue despite repeated requests from junior parliamentary affairs minister V. Narayanasamy. Bengal sarkar ki tanashahi nahi chalegi (the dictatorship of the Bengal government is not acceptable), shouted Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar, her right fist raised.         
	Accompanied by fellow MP Kalyan Banerjee, she stormed into the well even as other party MPs led by chief whip Sudip Bandopadhyay shouted slogans from their seats.         
	Mamata, the railway minister, stood up from her seat  two columns away  walked into the well and feebly tried to cajole Kakoli to return to her seat. By then, Speaker Meira Kumar had adjourned the House for an hour and a half.         
	As members melted away, Mamata loudly told Narayanasamy  who was trying to placate the Trinamul MPs  that they were only fighting for justice.         
	We are not even demanding Article 356 (Presidents rule, which Trinamul has been demanding) right now. We are just demanding justice, Mamata told Narayanasamy as other members, including environment minister Jairam Ramesh, gathered around her.

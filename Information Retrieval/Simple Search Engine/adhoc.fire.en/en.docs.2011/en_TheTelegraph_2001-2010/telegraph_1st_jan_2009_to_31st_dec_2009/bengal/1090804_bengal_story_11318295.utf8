The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Maoists hit CPM 
                                                                                                               Maoists hit CPM 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Midnapore, Aug. 3: Maoists have shot dead two CPM sympathisers in Belpahari, apparently to protest police raids launched after the crackdown began in Lalgarh, about 70km away.        
	A Maoist leader said that emboldened by the presence of the paramilitary in Lalgarh, the local police had conducted a series of raids in Belpahari and tortured innocent villagers. We couldnt focus on Belpahari then because we were busy with Lalgarh. Now, we will hunt down those who had tipped off the police.         
	West Midnapore superintendent Manoj Verma, who was among the officers leading the Lalgarh assault, admitted the series of raids but denied the torture charge. We had arrested some people for their links with the Maoists. But there has been no incident of any torture.        
	Police torture is an emotive issue among the tribals  the Lalgarh agitation had begun after a series of police raids last November and alleged atrocities  and the Maoists could be trying to fan rumours and cash in on them, an officer said.        
	At Nishchindipur, a man who had apparently snapped his ties with the rebels and joined a CPM-backed outfit opposing the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities was dragged away from his home last night and shot.        
	Nagen Singh Sardar, 40, was also once a member of the Jharkhand Party (Naren), which has often been accused of being in cahoots with the Maoists.         
	Police sources said resistance to the Maoist-backed Peoples Committee had been strong at Nishchindipur.        
	Gurucharan Tudu, 45, was killed while he was working on his field, not far from Nishchindipur, around one this afternoon.        
	A former CPM gram panchayat member, Tudu was the nephew of Pelaram Tudu, a party zonal committee member murdered by the Maoists in 2007. Gurucharan had campaigned intensively against the Maoists, said party district secretariat member Dahareswar Sen.         
	A couple of dozen CPM leaders have been killed in West Midnapore and adjoining Puru- lia since the operation to flush out the rebels from the Lalgarh region began in June.

                                                                                                               Rage after murder bid
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 1: Ghola on the northern fringes of the city erupted today following a bid to gun down two Trinamul Congress supporters involved in the construction business.        
	Police tear-gassed Trinamul supporters who blocked the Madhyamgram-Sodepur Road to protest the law-and-order situation in the state and turned the stretch in front of Ghola police station into a battlefield, pelting cops with stones and damaging their vehicles.        
	The police stations windowpanes were smashed.        
	Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjee, who was holding a meeting at the party headquarters at Topsia in Calcutta, rushed to Ghola alleging that the police had opened fire on her supporters.         
	The CPM has unleashed a reign of terror in Ghola but the police fired on our supporters. They are partisan. The Centre has to intervene immediately. I have informed the Union home ministry about the incident, she said.        
	Her supporters across the state will wear black badges tomorrow to protest the CPMs terror tactics.         
	A senior police officer said three rounds were fired in the air to scare away the stone-throwing mob.         
	Three of our men were hit by the stones, said additional superintendent P.K. Tripathi.        
	Building material supplier Harabilas Paik, 53, and his manager Shyamal Bhadra, 50, were shot at by motorcycle-borne youths around 7.45am.        
	Paik took a bullet in his posterior, while Bhadra was hit in the upper abdomen. Doctors at RG Kar Hospital said Bhadras condition was critical.        
	The protests against the attack, however, began only around 3pm with the arrival MLA Jyotipriya Mullick.        
	A local Trinamul leader said Paik was a CPM supporter who had changed sides a few months before the Lok Sabha polls.        
	Mamata went to Bhadras house this evening and promised his wife Chhanda that the guilty would be punished.         
	In South 24-Parganas Ca-nning, a Congress supporter and a Trinamul supporter were shot dead last night.

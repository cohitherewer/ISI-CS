The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Ministers leave in face of flood flak
                                                                                                               Ministers leave in face of flood flak
  - Hooghly recce ends in 15 minutes        OUR BUREAU                          A chopper airdrops food in Pursura, Hooghly. (Ananda Das)                                        
	Sept. 10: Around 500 angry residents of a flood-hit Hooghly village circled two state ministers today, prompting them to hurry to their cars and leave.        
	Relief minister Mortaza Hossain and civil defence minister Srikumar Mukherjee had gone to Deulpara in Pursura, an area that has been under chest-deep water for three days now.        
	The ministers plan was to survey the area and take stock of the relief work  helicopters had airdropped food this morning  but they had been there for barely 15 minutes when a crowd of angry villagers gathered.         
	They started complaining about the lack of food and tarpaulin sheets.        
	We are angry as no relief has reached us. A helicopter came with relief this morning but the food packets were dropped in the water. We demand immediate relief supplies, said Joydeb Bera, a villager.                           Mortaza Hossain (top) and Srikumar Mukherjee      
	The villagers anger, similar to the rage villagers vented in the Sunderbans where cyclone Aila destroyed thousands of homes, may have made the ministers a trifle worried.        
	Eyewitnesses said the two ministers, who had a convoy of six cars, got into their vehicles and left as soon as they realised the locals were angry.         
	Karna Pandit, a villager who was in the crowd, said they had gone to the ministers to demand food and tarpaulin sheets. But the ministers did not listen to us. They made some hollow promises and hurried to their cars, he said.        
	In June, MLA Gopal Gayen was made to walk in the muck when he went to Hingalganj, his constituency in the North 24-Parganas that was devastated by the cyclone Aila. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee also faced tough questions and slogans from villagers during his tour of Gosaba in South 24-Parganas.        
	When Mukherjee was contacted later today, he claimed that Hossain and he had spoken to the villagers for 15 minutes. I heard their grievances and the crowd gradually cooled down after I assured them that relief and medicines would be sent, he said.         
	The floods in south Bengal have claimed four lives since last night, taking the total number of deaths to nine.        
	Embankment land        
	The government will purchase 14,000 acres directly from villagers to construct embankments damaged by cyclone Aila in the Sunderbans.        
	The decision was taken at a meeting attended by land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah, Sunderbans affairs minister Kanti Ganguly, irrigation minister Subhas Naskar, finance minister Asim Dasgupta and chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti.         
	The matter will be placed at a cabinet meeting this month.

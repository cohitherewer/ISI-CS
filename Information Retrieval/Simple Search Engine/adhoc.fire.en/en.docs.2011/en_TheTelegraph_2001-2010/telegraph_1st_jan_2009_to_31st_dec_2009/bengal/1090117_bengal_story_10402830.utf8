	Jan. 16: The Dooars and Darjeeling shut down today after clashes between Gorkha Janmukti Morcha supporters and those opposing its demand for Gorkhaland left over a hundred injured.        
	One of them, Rajesh Mahato of Malbazar in Japlaiguri, took a bullet in his leg. It was not clear who fired but a Morcha leader armed with a gun was among 10 people arrested.        
	The anti-Morcha Akhil Bharatiya Adivasi Vikas Parishad has called an indefinite Dooars bandh from tomorrow.         
	Darjeeling, too, shut down after hearing about the clashes. Morcha general secretary Roshan Giri said the bandh would be on till Saturday evening, when the outfit will decide whether to continue.        
	Party supporters blocked roads across the hills. Hund-reds of tourists trying to come down were stuck because of the rush and the roadblocks.        
	The Adivasi outfit, which has been opposing the Morcha demand to include the Dooars in the state it wants, had called a strike in the Dooars today to thwart the hill outfits public meeting at Nagrakata. They also set up roadblocks at the two main entry points to the Dooars despite prohibitory orders under Section 144 that were in force since last night.        
	The clash started when Morcha supporters, who marched on flouting the Section 144, came face to face with the Adivasis.         
	Police said they had taken tea garden routes to escape its barricades.         
	Tear gas shells had to be lobbed when the two groups started throwing stones at each other.        
	In Nagrakata, about 20km from Malbazar, an anti-Gorkhaland mob attacked two Morcha members on a two-wheeler and set the vehicle on fire. They also torched four makeshift shops and a Morcha dais.         
	A heavily-bandaged Nirmal Kumar Dey alleged that a Morcha supporter had beaten him up. At the Gorubathan health centre, where 104 people were treated, Abhinash Gurung, 18, said he was struck by a stone. Eight people were admitted to the centre and 26 were referred to Kalimpong, Darjeeling and Siliguri.        
	Morcha leader Giri accused the police of using the Adivasi community to attack us.        
	Inspector-general K.L. Tamta said: A police jeep was set on fire and 25 policemen were injured.        
	The Morcha youth wing leader from Kalimpong, Sunil Pradhan, has been booked under the Arms Act.        
	Adivasi leader Rajesh Lakra, too, held the police responsible for the clashes. They should have prevented the Morcha from entering Jalpaiguri.

	Falta (South 24-Parganas): Some 15 people forced themselves onto a dais when a CPM rally was about to begin here on Sunday night and beat up party MLA Chandana Ghosh Dastidar and seven others.     
	The Falta MLA was taken to the Rabindranath Tagore hospital with head injuries. The CPM alleged that the attackers were from the Trinamul Congress.

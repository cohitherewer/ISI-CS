The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CPM sees PC succour
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      CPM sees PC succour
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 3: The CPM felt reassured today that the Congress-led Centre would not oblige Mamata Banerjee further after the Union home ministers renewed stress on political consensus for his planned anti-Maoist offensive, though he had sent his officials to visit political violence-hit Bengal under her pressure.        
	The CPM state secretariat met in the presence of chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee this evening to take stock of the situation and decide the Lefts plans on the Centre.         
	P. Chidambaram has made his priority for anti-Maoist operations clear in Parliament and hinted that there is no difference with the state on it. He didnt say anything against the state or us in the House, a secretariat member said.         
	According to some CPM leaders, neither the Congress-led Centre nor the state government and the CPM can afford confrontation despite the railway ministers provocations, given the convergence of priorities.         
	The chief minister aired a similar understanding at the meeting, based on feedback he had got from the officials who met the central team. Secretariat members said Bhattacharjee told them he had asked state officials to present before the Delhi team the information they had about the Trinamul-Maoist alliance and how the Opposition party was instigating violence.         
	Our officials had the impression that the central team was satisfied with our information, a member quoted the chief minister as saying.         
	State CPM secretary Biman Bose was evidently happy that the team left Bengal without having visited the places Trinamul wanted it to. Its now proved that the team had come to assist the state government and not to assess the law-and-order situation as Trinamul had claimed, he said.         
	It is another matter that Chidambaram has dismissed in Parliament the possibility of Mamata having a nexus with the rebels, but CPM leaders appreciated his compulsions. We know he cant do it (admit an allys connivance with the rebels) as it will land the Centre in the soup, a central committee member said.        
	The party has stepped up efforts to organise a meeting with the Prime Minister before he leaves for Moscow on December 6 so that it can submit evidence of the nexus and mount pressure on the Congress to pre-empt Mamata lobbying for central intervention before the 2011 state elections.         
	However, it is advantage Mamata now as she has got an appointment with the Prime Minister tomorrow to inform him about the lawlessness in Bengal. The CPM, which had enjoyed the same privilege of prompt prime ministerial attention when it was a UPA ally, grudgingly admitted the changed situation.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Blame game begins 
                                                                                                               Blame game begins 
          ABHIJEET CHATTERJEE AND INDRANIL SARKAR                              
	Burdwan, July 16: The chief minister today pointed fingers at police for the Mangalkot incident but officers in the force said CPM leaders had assured them there would be no trouble.        
	The police could not assess that the situation would flare up in such a dangerous manner, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee told the Assembly today.         
	But a police officer who was present at Dhanyarukhi yesterday in a 50-strong contingent said: Our intelligence officials stayed in constant touch with the district CPM leadership. We were told there would not be trouble if the MLAs kept the visit short. We were not prepared for any attack. We were taken by surprise.        
	The allged police inaction has raised many questions. Why did the police not lob tear gas shells? Why did they not call for reinforcements? Why did they not fire in the air?         
	Officers who were in the Dhanyarukhi, about 175km from Calcutta, said they did not have tear gas, only sticks and rifles. We did not have tear gas with us. We only had lathis and rifles. The mob could have been dispersed if we had fired shots in the air. But we did not fire because we were asked not to fire under any circumstance, said a police officer.        
	But why the police did not ask for reinforcements is not clear. The police instead scooted with the MLAs.        
	Officers said their intelligence failed because the CPM activists did not obey their leaders. Even 10 minutes before the MLAs reached Dhanyarukhi, local CPM leaders assured us there would be no trouble.... We had got the same assurance when Congress leader Subrata Mukherjee visited the area a few days ago. This only proves that the leaders do not have control over their supporters, another police officer said.        
	Yesterday afternoon, the Congress MLAs led by Manas Bhuniya headed for party supporter Amar Pals house, which was set on fire on June 15, the day CPM leader Falguni Mukherjee was murdered.        
	Suddenly, some villagers approached Katwa MLA Rabindranath Chatterjee and told him to leave the place immediately.        
	They told me there were two persons with us who were accused in the murder of Falguni Mukherjee. I asked them to identify the two. They did not reply, said Chatterjee, who got stitches on his head.         
	By then the mob had swelled to about 400 and ringed the MLAs. Bricks began raining on them.        
	The 50-odd policemen present first rushed to rescue the MLAs but after seeing the size of the mob, they too ran.

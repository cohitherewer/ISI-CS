The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Mamata rolls out dharna
                                                                                                               Mamata rolls out dharna
                            
	Calcutta, Oct. 16: Mamata Banerjee will hold a day-long dharna at Esplanade East on Tuesday and her party will lay siege to district magistrates offices on Wednesday to protest the states lawlessness.        
	We are opposed to blockades that inconvenience people. But we cant sit idle when the government unleashes terror, the Trinamul Congress chief told a news conference.        
	She added an apology to the people for this evenings inconvenience. I apologise for the blockade on the eve of Diwali. But Parthada (Chatterjee) was manhandled. Such treatment of the leader of the Opposition is unacceptable.         
	Brothers and sisters might rejoice as Mamata has spared bhai-phonta Monday a protest programme.        
	Trinamul workers are being framed and arrested, she alleged. In Hooghly, our supporters were arrested at the behest of a CPM leader.        
	The police said the duo were held on specific charges.         
	Mamata demanded the governments dismissal. Our lives are at risk. It is time the Centre dismisses the government, she said.

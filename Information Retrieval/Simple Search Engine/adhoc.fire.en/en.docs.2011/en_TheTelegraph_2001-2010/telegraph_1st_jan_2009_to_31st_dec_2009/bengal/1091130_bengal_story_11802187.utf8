          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 29: A political party should not resort to violence if people do not vote for it, Somnath Chatterjee said today in a veiled criticism of the CPM from which he has been expelled.        
	People can bring a political party into power or throw it out of power after some time through ballots. But why should there be political vendetta endangering the lives of ordinary people? Chatterjee asked, in an apparent reference to the clashes across the state since the Lok Sabha elections.         
	Chatterjee, who had been invited to the launch of the Jana Chetana Manch, promoted by another former CPM leader, Saifuddin Chowdhury, skipped the event citing personal reasons but sent a CD where he spoke about the political vendetta.         
	People can do politics according to their choice. But for this, why should there be violence and clashes? he asked.        
	The party expelled Chatterjee last year after he refused quit his Lok Sabha Speakers post following the CPMs withdrawal of support to the Congress-led central government over the Indo-US nuclear deal.        
	Although I could not make it today I have spontaneous support for the Manch and its causes, the audio CD said.        
	Chowdhury, who had floated the Party for Democratic Socialism in 2000 after being accused of anti-CPM activities, today said he launched the Manch to create awareness among people against partisan politics and promote tolerance in public life.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CPM murder blame on rival 
                                                                                                               CPM murder blame on rival 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Abu Ali Mondals wife cries in Baruipur. (Pradip Sanyal)                                  
	Baruipur, Sept. 3: A group of alleged Trinamul Congress supporters shot dead a CPM activist and his nephew in South 24-Parganas today after sniffing their plan to bring home some members of the ruling Left party who fled after the general elections.        
	Police said around 3.30am, over 500 armed people surrounded the house of Abu Ali Mondal, 40, and his 35-year-old nephew Hasem in Rajgora village of Baruipur.        
	Residents of Rajgora  it falls under the Sankarpur gram panchayat run by the CPM  said around six persons who were part of the mob dragged out Abu from his house into the courtyard after slashing him with some sharp instrument. As he lay bleeding on the ground, they fired at him twice, said Mohsin, Abus brother, whose house is just across Abus courtyard.         
	I saw the attacks peeping through a half-shut window but was scared to protest as they could have targeted me next, he said.        
	As Abu lay groaning in pain, the six entered his nephew Hasems room and fired twice at him.        
	Before leaving, they warned the villagers they would meet the same fate as Abu and Hasem if they took the duo to hospital.        
	The murders today are a continuation of a tussle for turf control that has often led to deaths after the Lok Sabha elections.         
	Trinamul activists murdered a CPM man in Taldi Canning, also in the South 24-Parganas, in a bid to take over a village panchayat controlled by the CPM. In Khejuri, East Midnapore, Trinamul activists smashed CPM party offices, broke furniture and set them ablaze last month.        
	Todays killings also seem to have their root in a struggle for panchayat control. Except Rajgora, where the murders took place, Trinamul is at the helm in the four other adjoining gram panchayats  Narayanitala, Nabagram, Thakurdaha and Dhabdhabi.         
	The 500-strong crowd that had circled Abus house mainly consisted of people from these villages, it is believed.         
	Trinamul activists targeted Abu and his nephew because they tried to bring back eight of our party supporters who had fled homes after our defeat in the Lok Sabha elections in South 24-Parganas, said former Jadavpur CPM MP Sujan Chakraborty, who visited the area this morning.        
	The Trinamul activists also set ablaze six houses, a tractor and a barn belonging to a CPM activist.        
	The CPMs South 24-Parganas district secretary, Santimoy Bhattacharya, said the party had called a 12-hour bandh tomorrow in Baruipur, on Calcuttas outskirts, to protest the murders.        
	Additional superintendent of police Nishat Parvez said a murder case has been started against the persons named in the FIR after a complaint from Abus widow Noorjahan Bibi. We have so far arrested five persons, he added.        
	Abu and Hasem were rushed to a Baruipur hospital by villagers. Both were declared dead on arrival.        
	The Trinamul leadership said the murders were an outcome of CPMs internal bickering. We have nothing to do with the murders, said Arup Bhadha, a former Trinamul district president.

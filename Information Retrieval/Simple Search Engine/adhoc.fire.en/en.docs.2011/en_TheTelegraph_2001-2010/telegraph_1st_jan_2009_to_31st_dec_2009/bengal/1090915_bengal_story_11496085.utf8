The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Allies wait to hear Buddha on Vedic
                                                                                                               Allies wait to hear Buddha on Vedic
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 14: The Vedic Village controversy is likely to rock the Left Front huddle on Wednesday and the CPM state committee meeting the day after where the chief minister is likely to break his silence behind closed doors.         
	The CPMs partners said they would like to hear from Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on the alleged land grab by the Vedic promoters with help from patrons across the political divide.         
	CPM state secretary and front chairman Biman Boses decision to call the front meeting on the eve of the party session is aimed at gauging the partners mood, front leaders said.         
	According to them, Bhattacharjee had kept mum so long because of his government and the partys earlier close relations with R.K. Modi and the other promoters of the Rajarhat resort.         
	Modi is in jail custody now for his alleged links with criminals and murky land deals whose lid was blown off following a flare-up triggered by a bout of shooting after a football match near the resort.        
	The CPM state secretariat, likely to meet after the front meeting to fine-tune Thursdays agenda, will want the committee to pull up land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah for omissions and commissions in his out-of court settlement with the resorts promoters.         
	Mollah had claimed legal compulsions but admitted leasing out 44 acres of government land to the promoters at a throwaway price. He even admitted to having visited the resort for free ayurvedic treatment.        
	We expect members to question his decision to lease out vested land to the Modis without consulting the chief minister and party leadership, said a secretariat member.         
	The IT department had entered into a joint venture with the same promoters to set up a tech township, which stands scrapped following the Vedic fiasco.         
	However, insiders said that the leadership was unlikely to take any action against Mollah for fear of opening a can of worms.         
	According to them, many leaders and ministers from North and South 24-Parganas were close to Modi and his former associate Kamal Gandhi.         
	In public, the CPM has so far denied its ranks connivance in the alleged land-grabbing. Instead, it has trained its guns on the Trinamul Congress MLA from Bhangar, Arabul Islam, and his brother Khude, now a fugitive, for being hand-in-glove with Modi and his henchman Gaffar Mollah, also in custody.        
	Mamata Banerjee has stood by Islam and tried to distance him from his brothers activities.         
	Among the CPMs allies, the Forward Bloc has demanded a CBI inquiry, while the RSP and the CPI have asked for a proper probe.         
	Whoever is behind these land sharks should be punished, said Bloc leader and former minister Hafiz Alam Sairani.         
	The allies are also likely to raise questions about complaints of forcible land acquisition by the Housing Infrastructure Development Company (Hidco) under housing minister Gautam Deb, who had earlier claimed to have accomplished a peaceful acquisition based on political consensus for New Town, Rajarhat.         
	This model of development is fraught with possibilities of coercion, corruption and irregularities, the RSPs Manoj Bhattacharya said.        
	Officially, the front meeting has been convened to finalise the next phase of the Lefts campaign against price rise, food crisis and unemployment and preparation for another rally in the city in November. Tomorrow, Bose and industries minister Nirupam Sen will address a rally at Esplanade.

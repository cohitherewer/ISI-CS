	Alipurduar (Jalpaiguri), Aug. 12: If you see the sweet little leopard cub pottering around all by itself, dont feel compelled to rescue it. It could mean trouble for days to come.        
	That is the forest depart- ments advice to tea garden workers in the Dooars who come across the little ones and their angry elders every now and then.        
	Ideally, they should use a beating party, which creates a din to scare animals away, to make sure a leopard isnt lurking in the area where they are working.        
	The tips to avoid conflict with animals were necessitated by increasing incidents of leopard attacks in the region. Seven people have been killed and at least 60 mauled by the animal here between April 2008 and July 2009. Two of those killed were children.         
	Seven leopards have also been killed during this period, most of them being beaten to death by villagers.        
	Chief conservator of forests (north) S.B. Patel said the need of the hour was an awareness drive because lack of knowledge about animal behaviour was the prime reason behind the increasing attacks.        
	Leopards like to litter in drains in the gardens where they feel secure. But very often the workers find cubs and hand them over to us, infuriating the mother, leading to attacks. We will ask them not to touch the cubs but to inform the nearest wildlife office.        
	Garden workers and residents who venture out alone in the bushes early in the morning and evening are especially prone to animal attacks.         
	We will hold a series of meetings with the tea gardens and involve local NGOs in the campaign, Patel said. The fo-rest department has already printed leaflets and banners in local dialects for the drive.        
	The chairman of the Dooars branch of the Indian Tea Association, N.S. Thapa, welcomed the initiative. Well do the needful and instruct workers to follow the guidelines so that both man and animal are safe, Thapa said.        
	Six-year-old Abhisek Oraon was killed by a leopard on May 15 this year and eight-year-old Shibani Nayek five days later at Good Hope Tea Estate in the Mal area.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Trinamul threat: pack up or get fried

	Khejuri, June 15: Over half the policemen deployed in Khejuri were withdrawn today after Trinamul Congress supporters threatened to torch their camps, another instance of the state government ceding control of a trouble zone.        
	We dont want to take a risk following their threat to attack our camps, a senior officer said, hours after a band of 80 Trinamul supporters stood outside the Khejuri police station and threatened to burn them down.         
	Trinamul wants the 13 party activists held for allegedly torching CPM offices and ransacking homes last Tuesday released, and has enforced a social boycott of the police. Today was the third day of the boycott.        
	The 120 policemen removed this afternoon had been staying in the camps at Khejuri College and Hedia. There had been 200 personnel in all, spread across seven camps and the police station.         
	Contai subdivisional police officer (SDPO) Bhaskar Mukherjee, stationed at Khejuri police station since the trouble started last week, suggested the removal was not a pullout, saying the personnel sent away had been assigned to Khejuri only till today.         
	Most of them were requisitioned five days ago after the law-and-order situation got bad. They had been assigned this job till Monday and we have to send them back.        
	But Mukherjees denial appeared to fly in the face of reality: a group of Trinamul supporters barged into the college camp and asked the policemen there to flee the area or face the consequences.        
	The cops at the police sta-tion, with a much larger force, also appeared just as helpless as they watched the demonstrators lob threats from right under their noses.        
	The police camps should be removed immediately or we will remove them ourselves or set them on fire. These policemen were hand in glove with CPM cadres during their Nandigram recapture (in November 2007). The police never stopped the cadres from unleashing terror against Trinamul supporters and now they are trying to save them, bellowed one Trinamul demonstrator over a microphone, within the hearing of Mukherjee and additional superintendent Rabindranath Sarkar.        
	Later, the demonstrators marched to Khejuri College and requested principal Asim Manna not to allow the police to stay there.        
	The forces morale, already at a low, seemed to have sagged further. Its dreadful here. We dont want to stay any more after the threat. The administration is keeping mum on our fate, said Manoranjan Hazra, a constable who came from Durgapur five days ago.         
	Anger against the government is rising. One officer at the police station said the government had been using them as guinea pigs since the March 14, 2007, police firing in Nandigram.         
	We are paying for the governments blunders. Now we are caught between the devil and the deep sea, he said while instructing his men not to get into any confrontation with the Trinamul supporters.         
	Jedikey hawa cholchhe, oi dikey aamader jete hobe (We have to sway according to the breeze),  he said.         
	The social boycott has meant that Hazra and his colleagues cannot buy provisions from the area, use tube wells or hire vehicles for emergencies. Stocks in the police station, from where food is being cooked and sent to the camps, are running low.        
	Two CPM panchayat functionaries from Khejuri went to the block development office this afternoon to submit their resignations, citing threats from the Opposition camp.         
	Satyaranjan Guchait, 57, of Khejuri block 2 panchayat samiti, and Ram Hari Mondal 46, of Haloodbari gram panchayat, did not say if they also wanted to shift loyalties.

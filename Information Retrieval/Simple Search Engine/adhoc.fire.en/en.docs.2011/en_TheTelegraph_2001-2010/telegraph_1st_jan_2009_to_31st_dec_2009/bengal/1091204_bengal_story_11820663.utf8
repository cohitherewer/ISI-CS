	Calcutta, Dec. 3: Calcutta High Court today asked the state police chief to ensure protection of an IPS officers elderly mother who had accused him of trying to snatch her house in Salt Lake and not taking care of her.        
	The courts registrar-general has been asked to send 65-year-old Bela Bhattacharyas allegations against her son to the chief secretary for necessary steps.        
	Her son Champak is now the Nadia superintendent of police.        
	The widow had moved court alleging that she was feeling insecure and sought adequate protection from the judiciary. She said she had made repeated representations before chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and police chief Bhupinder Singh but in vain. They did not take any action against my son.         
	In her petition, Bhatta- charya claimed that her son had not been looking after her and was trying to force her to hand over to him the rights of her Salt Lake home. Her husband had built the house, she said.         
	The accused officer said: I am not aware of the complaint. I find it hard to believe that my mother has made such allegations against me.         
	Champak added that he had been living with his wife in Nadia for the past four months. I didnt find time to go to my house in Salt Lake. He also claimed that his elder brother Dipak and his wife lived in the Salt Lake house with their mother.         
	Justice P.K. Chattopadhyay has asked director-general of police Bhupinder Singh to provide the widow adequate protection so she could live in her Salt Lake house in peace.

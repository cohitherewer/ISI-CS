The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Talks on hill state? Not exactly
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Talks on hill state? Not exactly
          OUR BUREAU                          Morcha supporters sing bhajans praying for the health of those on fast. (Suman Tamang)                                  
	Dec.16: Bengal home secretary Ardhendu Sen said in Delhi today that the Gorkha Janmukti Morchas statehood demand will not exactly be discussed at the tripartite meeting in Darjeeling on December 21.         
	Sens statement, after a meeting with Union home secretary G.K. Pillai, made it clear that the state government was firm in its stand of not bowing to the Morchas only demand  Gorkhaland.         
	Emerging from the meeting, Sen said: There are many issues that can be discussed which they (Morcha) think are important, but we will not exactly be discussing Gorkhaland.         
	At the tripartite meeting, Sen said, efforts will be directed at trying to find other ways of solving the problem.        
	The state home secretary was in Delhi for preparatory talks before the fourth round of negotiations against the backdrop of renewed unrest in the hills since Union home minister P. Chidambarams promise to start the process of granting statehood to Telangana.        
	The Morcha reacted angrily to Sens statement. The state government cannot set terms and conditions for the talks, central committee member Amar Lama said. They are only one of the three parties in the talks. We have only one agenda for the talks  creation of Gorkhaland.        
	Sources in the Union home ministry indicated that the Centre, too, was not in a mood to yield to the Gorkhas statehood demand, more so in the wake of the Andhra Pradesh backlash after the Telangana promise.        
	Sen indicated that the Morchas only agenda did not figure in the governments.         
	Appealing to the Morcha to call off its indefinite hunger strike that started on Friday, he said the December 21 meeting would essentially be a follow-up to the third round of talks. Issues like development and panchayat elections will be discussed in Darjeeling, he added.        
	The Morcha appeared to be in no mood to end its fast, though two of the protesters had to be hospitalised today from Darjeeling and Kalchini, in the Dooars.         
	Home minister Chidambaram had appealed to the Morcha yesterday to end its supporters fast unto death.        
	Morcha general secretary Roshan Giri, now in Delhi, said any decision (to withdraw the fast or not) would be taken by president Bimal Gurung. For now, the hunger strike is on in Darjeeling and at Jantar Mantar (Delhi).        
	In Calcutta, the state chief secretary said the hunger strike and the shutdown enforced on government offices in the hills were spoiling the talks atmosphere.        
	A Left Front meeting decided to hold a rally at Brigade Parade Grounds on February 7 to oppose the demand for Gorkhaland. The CPM alleged that there was a conspiracy at the Centre to divide Bengal and that all Left parties would be mobilised at the national-level to oppose such a move.        
	The Centres flip-flop on Telangana is sending a wrong message, a CPM leader said. A pragmatic decision should be taken to ensure the divisive ripples do not spread.

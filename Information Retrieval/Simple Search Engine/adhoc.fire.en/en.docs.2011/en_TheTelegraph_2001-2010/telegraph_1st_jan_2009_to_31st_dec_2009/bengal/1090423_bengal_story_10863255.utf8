The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Back-to-back blasts scare away police
                                                                                                               Back-to-back blasts scare away police
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Some of the jawans who beat a retreat from the Salboni village. (Swarup Mondal)                                  
	Salboni, April 22: Suspected Maoists today triggered four blasts in five minutes in the path of a police contingent going to a Salboni village to probe yesterdays murder of two CPM activists.        
	The 250-strong force, including some from the CRPF, beat a retreat after the 8.30am blasts on the fringes of Nadaria village, where suspected rebels had gunned down the two CPM members and injured a third.        
	A senior Salboni officer said the personnel could not proceed after the blasts as they were scared, suggesting the rebels might have succeeded in their objective of instilling fear ahead of the elections in the area on April 30.         
	Apprehension that the route could be riddled with crude bombs held the force back from returning to the village.        
	A decision on whether or not to go to Nadaria, 180km from Calcutta, will be taken tomorrow, the officer said.        
	Another West Midnapore pocket could be becoming out of bounds for the authorities after Lalgarh  where the rebels are suspected to be guiding a tribal resistance against the police. Lalgarh is only 5km from Salboni.        
	The police said at least a dozen roads connecting Nadaria with Salboni and nearby Goaltore and Lalgarh had been dug up or blocked with logs to prevent security forces from entering the area. The suspicion is on the Maoists.        
	We have brought the matter to the Election Commissions notice and sought its intervention, the officer added.        
	The blasts  improvised explosive devices set off with detonators  in the Kadamdiha forest area put a question mark on the polices capabilities. Paritosh Manna, a member of the CPMs Salboni local committee, sniggered that he felt nothing but pity for the force. We feel pity for the police. If they cant enter our village because of blasts, how will they give us (CPM members and villagers) protection?        
	District police chief Manoj Kumar Verma said the team going to Nadaria was carrying bomb detectors but suggested the frequency of the explosions took the personnel by surprise. Our men were carrying mine detectors but the blasts occurred within a span of five minutes, he said.        
	Villagers had cremated the body of Saktipada Sen, one of the two men killed yesterday, last night. The last rites of the other victim, Hambir Mandi, were completed after this mornings blasts. The body had started decomposing when the villagers located it today without police help.        
	We had to cremate Hambirs body immediately as it had started rotting and we didnt know if the police would be able to reach our village at all, said Ram Dhulia, 25, a neighbour.         
	Ranjit Singh, who was shot at last night, is in hospital.

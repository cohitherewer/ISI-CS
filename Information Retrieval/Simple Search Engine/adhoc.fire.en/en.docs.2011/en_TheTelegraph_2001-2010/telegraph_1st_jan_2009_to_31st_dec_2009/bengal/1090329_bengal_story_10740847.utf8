The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Killer charge for death in tyre burst
                                                                                                               Killer charge for death in tyre burst
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Calcutta, March 28: Police have slapped a non-bailable charge carrying a minimum 10-year term on the owner of the bus whose tyre burst killed a passenger yesterday.        
	The Behala resident who owns the 17A is in hiding. So are the driver and the conductor.         
	The bus has been sent for a mechanical test and the victims body for a post-mortem. But the owner was obviously aware that the tyre was not in the right condition, said Raj-esh Subarno, deputy commissioner of police, south.        
	Anita Mondal, 52, was killed while travelling to a hospital where her ailing father was to meet a doctor. The worn-out rear tyre burst, ripping off a footrest that slammed into Mondals head. She was sitt- ing next to the rear gate, on a row reserved for women.         
	A traffic sergeant rushed the Bijoygarh resident to the same Dhakuria hospital where her father was waiting for her. The mother of two died in the hospital. Preliminary reports suggested she also suffered splinter injuries in the head and neck.        
	Earlier, the police would use the milder charge of death due to negligence after road deaths. But public outrage at drivers and owners of killer buses being let off with a bailable offence that can at best lead to two years jail has forced a tough stand.        
	The owner of the 17A has been charged with both dea-th due to negligence (Section 304A of the IPC) and culpable homicide not amounting to murder (Section 304).         
	Another recent exception to the polices alleged leniency was the case against the driver of the bus that plunged into a canal off VIP Road last April, killing 20 people.        
	Following a media glare on lax police action, the government had been contemplating making it mandatory for the police to charge drivers under Section 304 after fatal accidents. But it has gone slow after massive protests from CPM labour arm Citu, which controls drivers unions.        
	The minimum penalty for culpable homicide not amounting to murder is 10 years in jail and the maximum is life.        
	The police brass today ordered traffic guards across the city to scan tyres and slap charges of negligence on bus owners immediately. The officers in charge have been asked to carry out the checks during lean phases, when there are not too many passengers. If a bus is running on resoled tyres or the condition of the tyres is poor, they will book the owner, said additional commissioner, traffic, K. Hari Rajan.

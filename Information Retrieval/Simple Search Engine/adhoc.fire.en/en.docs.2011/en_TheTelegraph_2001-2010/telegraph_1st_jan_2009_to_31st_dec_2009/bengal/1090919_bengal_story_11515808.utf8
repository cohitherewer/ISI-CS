                                                                                                               Big school meal for girl with appetite of 7 
          SOUMI BHATTACHARYA                          Suman Khatoon. (Mona Birbonshi)                                  
	Matiala (Birbhum), Sept. 18: School officials have decided to serve a five-year-old girl mid-day meals large enough to feed seven children after they came to know she had a rare eating disorder that left her hungry.         
	Suman Khatoon, who weighs 75kg, dropped out in Class I because she felt extremely hungry.         
	She needs 750gm of rice twice a day with proportionate quantities of pulses and vegetables to satiate her appetite  the midday meal quota for a child is 100gm of rice.         
	Paediatricians who heard her case said the girl in Dubrajpur, Birbhum, could be suffering from a genetic disorder called Prader-Willi Syndrome.        
	The Birbhum district primary school council has decided to serve as much food Suman wants. We have heard from her teachers that the food she got for the mid-day meal was not enough for her. We have decided to giver her as much food she needs, said Goutam Ghosh, the chairman of the district primary school council.        
	Ghosh said the necessary instruction would be sent to the school soon. If she gets enough food in school, she may return to class, he said.        
	Sumans father Jalal Khan is a labourer earning just Rs 2,000 a month and finds it difficult to buy so much food for her. He has also not been able to get her treated. Jalal said he had taken Suman to a doctor in Burdwan town two years ago. The doctor asked for some tests to be done but we could not afford it. We never went to any other doctor, the father said.        
	Apurba Ghosh, the director of Institute of Child Health, Calcutta, said: It appears the child is suffering from Prader-Willi Syndrome and needs anti-appetite drugs and change in behavioural mode.         
	Prader-Willi Syndrome or PWS is a rare genetic disorder. It causes poor muscle tone and a constant feeling of hunger. The part of the brain that controls feelings of fullness or hunger does not work properly in people with PWS.         
	PWS patients need anti-appetite drugs to control body weight but these are expensive. A months treatment will cost over Rs 1,000, said a paediatrician at a government hospital in Calcutta.         
	Suman first told a classmate, Nilu Khatoon, about how hungry she felt in school. She told me one day that she felt hungry even after eating. She said she ate much more at home and was unable to follow the lessons because she felt so hungry, said Nilu.         
	Sumans mother Bela Bibi said her overweight daughter cannot stand the hunger for more than 10 minutes. We understand her difficulty in school because the food served is not enough for her, she said.        
	Suman has five rotis and tea for breakfast. For lunch, there is 750gm of rice and dal and vegetables to go with it. She has two packets of biscuits for snacks in the evening and 750gm of rice for dinner.        
	Father Jalal said: My neighbours help me a lot. They give us rice, cooked food, biscuit packets and chocolates.

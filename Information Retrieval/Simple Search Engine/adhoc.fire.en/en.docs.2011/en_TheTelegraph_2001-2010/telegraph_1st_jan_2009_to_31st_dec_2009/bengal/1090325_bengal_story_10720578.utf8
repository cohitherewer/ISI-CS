The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Institute points finger at delay
                                                                                                               Institute points finger at delay
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, March 24: IIT Kharagpur has not accepted responsibility for Rohit Kumars death in a report submitted to the Centre.         
	Rohit died because of de- lays in providing medical assistance, not because of any negligence by the administration as alleged by students, the IITs report to the human re- source development ministry suggests.         
	The institutes first official statement on the incident also suggests that director Damodar Acharyas resignation may not have been voluntary. He had resigned claiming moral responsibility for the incident after angry students attacked his bungalow on the campus and damaged his car.         
	The report says that nearly 5,000 students had gathered outside Acharyas bungalow, threatening violence unless he resigned. It does not mention forcible resignation, but the language of the report suggests that the directors resignation was forced, not voluntary, an official said.         
	The ministry is yet to accept Acharyas resignation. Some officials here are considering asking him to return to the post once tempers on the campus cool down. HRD minister Arjun Singh has to accept Acharyas resignation before he can be replaced.   
	The ministry wrote to IIT registrar D. Gunasekaran yesterday, asking for a detailed report on the death and expressing concern over law and order on the campus, sources said.         
	The report, which reached the ministry late yesterday, details the sequence of events preceding Rohits death but has not held any one responsible for the incident.         
	Students have alleged that he was left unattended at the campus hospital for over three hours and that they had petitioned Acharya in vain over concerns that the hospital was ill equipped.         
	Classes resume        
	Classes resumed at IIT Kharagpur today.        
	We are still in grief. But we are students and have to move on, said Sourav Bhati, his classmate.         
	Friends hoped that Rohits death and the demonstrations that followed would act as an eye-opener. Hopefully, we will get a good hospital now, said another classmate.

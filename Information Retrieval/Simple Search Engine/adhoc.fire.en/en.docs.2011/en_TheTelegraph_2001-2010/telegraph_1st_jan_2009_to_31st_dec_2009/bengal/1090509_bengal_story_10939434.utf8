  - Parties gauge clash impact 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Sanyara Bibi, the neighbour of Aleya whose two-year-old daughter was shot dead in Nandigram. She alleged that the killers came looking for her and fired at random not finding her. (Pradip Sanyal)                                        
	Calcutta, May 8: Violence since the second phase of polling in the state yesterday has made the CPM a tad nervous about its impact on the results and the Opposition optimistic.         
	The Opposition sees this as further confirmation of the peoples defiance of the CPM and an extension of its campaign against land acquisition for industry.        
	A CPM state committee member said both sides had anticipated trouble during this phase because the contest was close and the areas that went to the polls had all felt the impact of Nandigram and Singur. In Hooghly, Nadia, Murshidabad, Howrah, East Midnapore and Burdwan districts, the land issue had much to do with the prospects of both the ruling party and the Opposition. Trouble was likely as these places had been tense and the contest was close.        
	The turnout of 83 per cent isnt a surprise, he added, as Bengal voters have higher political awareness but an element of nervousness always remains with a high turnout.        
	According to the Trinamul Congress, the violence occurred because the elections were no longer a one-sided affair and the Opposition had been able to muster the courage to take on the ruling CPM on the day of the polls.         
	It is a fallout of the ten sion that the land row had generated, leading to an outright confrontation that Bengal has been witnessing since the Singur and Nandigram agitations, said Trinamul general secretary Mukul Roy.        
	The turnout, which has left the CPM nervous has given a boost to the Opposition. Overt or covert CPM terror did not mar the enthusiasm of the electorate who felt inspired by Mamata Banerjees land agitation and came out in large numbers to vote for her party. It was the electorates defiance of the ruling party. The clashes show that our men are there on the streets to counter the CPMs terror. That was also the reason for a high turnout, which makes us optimistic about the results, Roy added.        
	Before the second phase, Bengal CPM secretary Biman Bose had expressed concern about the possibility of trouble. And Mamata had asked voters to come out with their haata-khunti (spoon and ladle) to vote, sending the message that they should be tough with the CPM.        
	According to CPM MP Mohammad Salim, there can be skirmishes around the day of the polls if the rival camps are too charged up. Violence isnt desirable, but its human instinct. I cant say whether the violence in the second phase can prompt the Opposition to dream of winning Lok Sabha seats. But seats that are too close to call do lead to an adrenaline rush in the rival parties.        
	Some government officials blamed lack of central paramilitary forces for the poll-day clashes. For the 2006 Assembly polls, the state had got 600 companies. This time, the figure is 220, a home department official said.        
	Ten people have been killed in clashes since yesterday. Five of them  from the CPM, Trinamul and the Congress  were killed today in Howrah, Burdwan and South 24-Parganas.         
	The CPMs Bose accused the Opposition of spreading violence. As Trinamul is losing ground, they have become more belligerent and so people should be on guard against the Oppositions design to spread more violence before the last phase (on Wednesday).

                                                                                                               Citu bungs job spanner in Tata works
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Kharagpur, July 13: The CPM and CPI labour arms today planted red flags and stopped work at an under-construction Tata project in Kharag- pur demanding that each landloser family be given jobs at the plant when completed.        
	The Rs 600-crore excavator-manufacturing unit, expected to be operational from October, is coming up on 250 acres acquired in 2006.        
	On Saturday, Telcon Construction Equipment Company issued a notice offering free vocational training to a member of each of the 300 landloser families, but not jobs.        
	The two unions claim that at the time of the acquisition, the government had promised jobs to the landlosers.         
	The government denied this today. There was no such assurance from us, subdivisional officer S.B. Sarkar said. How can we give such an assurance when we are not setting up the plant?        
	The company made it clear it had made no such promise. It has been decided to provi-de free training to one member per family of those families who held plots in the 250 acres given to Telcon, a release said today. The course is aimed at enhancing employability in the area.        
	It added: Should Telcons customers require operators and mechanics and approach Telcon, it will provide the list of successful trainees to its customers. It is up to the customers to decide whether the trainees meet their requirements.        
	The July 11 notification had also stipulated the criteria for the training: education till Madhyamik and age between 18 and 25.        
	The company has employed local hands for the construction. But they were among the Citu and Aituc supporters who assembled at the project site around 9am, shut its gates and stopped work.        
	District Citu leader Mihir Pahari said: The government had said at least one member of each landloser family will get a job. Jobs will have to be provided to each family.        
	He also rejected the companys eligibility criteria for the training. There will not be more than 20 Madhyamik pass youths among the landlosers and many are past 25. So the education criterion has to be brought down to Class VIII and the age limit extended.         
	If the demands are not met, the union will not let work resume. Aituc echoed Pahari.        
	In Calcutta, state Citu secretary Kali Ghosh denied halting work at the site and stressed the right to demonstrate if demands are not fulfilled.         
	Work did not stop. Members of our union and Aituc had blocked the project gates demanding jobs. They have a right to do so, he said.        
	However, SDO Sarkar said work had come to a standstill.         
	A Tata official said if the stalemate continued, the project would fail the deadline and hundreds of jobs would be put on hold.

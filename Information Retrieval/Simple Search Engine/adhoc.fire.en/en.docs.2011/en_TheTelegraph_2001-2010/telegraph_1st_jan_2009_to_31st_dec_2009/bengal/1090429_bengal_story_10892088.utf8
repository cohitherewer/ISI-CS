	Midnapore, April 28: Tribals armed with bows and arrows held jawans carrying automatic rifles hostage when they went to inspect polling booths on the fringes of Lalgarh barely 48 hours before the area goes to the polls.        
	Returning on foot from the booth at Sirishboni this morning, the BSF personnel stopped some 20 tribal youths armed with bows, arrows and axes and asked why they were carrying arms so close to the polling day. An altercation ensued and within no time hundreds of young men and women led by a leader of the Peoples Committee Against Police atrocities surrounded them.        
	Committee leader Chhatradhar Mahato alleged that the jawans had roughed up villagers carrying traditional weapons at Mahultala village. We have repeatedly said we wont allow police to enter Lalgarh except on polling day, he thundered.        
	The jawans made frantic calls to their colleagues in Midnapore town, 70km away. But fearing the situation might spin out of control, the administration desisted from sending reinforcements. The inspector in charge of the local Goaltore police station, Gautam Banerjee, went to negotiate a settlement with the agitators.         
	The 35 BSF jawans were released three hours later. Chhatradhar claimed that the police gave them an undertaking that security forces would not step into the area before polling day. West Midnapore police chief Manoj Verma denied any such guarantee.        
	The committee, resisting the entry of security forces into Lalgarh since last Novem- ber, had forced the administration to bring down the number of polling booths there to four from 40. The BSF team went to inspect booths that are on the fringes of Lalgarh and not those covered by the agreement.        
	Yesterday, the police were forced to shut down a camp in Salboni, 13km from todays trouble spot. Local tribals had pushed the 90 personnel there to near starvation preventing them from buying provisions for days.

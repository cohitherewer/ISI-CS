The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Police custody snub to govt 
                                                                                                               Police custody snub to govt 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Chhatradhar Mahato                                  
	Jhargram, Oct. 10: A court in Jhargram today turned down the state governments plea for further police custody of Chhatradhar Mahato and put him in judicial remand.        
	The additional chief judicial magistrate of the Jhargram court, Vishal Mangrati, said no further police custody of the leader of the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities was required because the case diary did not mention any fresh development during the last three days that Mahato was in police remand.        
	The judge rejected Mahatos lawyers plea that he be released on bail. The charges that the government had brought against Mahato were very serious in nature, the judge said. He has been put in judicial remand till October 23.        
	Public prosecutor Ashok Bakshi prayed for 15 days police custody for Mahato. He argued that the Maoist-affected area was huge and Mahato needed to be taken to several places to uncover the extent to which the Maoist menace had spread.        
	The judge, however, said Mahato had been sent to police custody thrice and in the last instance, there was no fresh development so there was no need to send him to police custody again.        
	A senior police officer said the government would appeal against the judicial custody order in the sessions court. Unlike the last time when Mangrati had said: I am not convinced that the provisions of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act are applicable to the accused since the committee was not a banned outfit, he made no such observation today.

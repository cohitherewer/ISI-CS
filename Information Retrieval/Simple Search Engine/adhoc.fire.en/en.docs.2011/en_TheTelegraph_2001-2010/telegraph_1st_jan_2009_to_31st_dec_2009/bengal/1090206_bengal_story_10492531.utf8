	Darjeeling, Feb. 5: The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha today took their case to the governor but ignored his suggestion to call off an indefinite fast.        
	Bimal Gurung, the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha president, and eight other leaders of the outfit called on governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi at Raj Bhavan a day after the partys talks with the state government drew a blank.        
	The Morcha wants to hold a rally in the Dooars, where tribals are opposed to the Gorkhaland demand, but the state government has denied permission because it fears an escalation of tension.        
	After nearly hour-long talks with the Morcha delegation, the Raj Bhavan said in a media release: The governor indicated to the visitors his distress over the fast that was being undertaken outside Gorubathan police station. The governor appealed to the fasting persons, through Shri Gurung, to give up the fast as he was taking up the issues raised by Shri Gurung at the meeting.        
	However, Morcha general secretary Roshan Giri said: We heard out the governor and his request, but we are going ahead with the indefinite hunger-strike.        
	Twenty-two Morcha supporters have been on an indefinite fast in front of the police station since January 29 to press for several demands, including permission to hold meetings and rallies in the Dooars and Terai regions. The rejection of the demand yesterday had prompted the Morcha to call a 24-hour bandh in the region and in the hills on Saturday.        
	The Raj Bhavan release also stated that the governor impressed upon Shri Gurung the need to maintain an atmosphere conducive to the ongoing and important tripartite rounds of discussions.        
	The Morcha claimed that the governor had assured them that he would speak to the Prime Minister, home minister and the chief minister.        
	Giri said: We raised the demand for fulfilment of the six issues. The governor has assured us that he would speak with the Prime Minister, the home minister and the chief minister to find a solution.         
	The governor also said he was well aware of the situation in the closed tea gardens of the Dooars as he himself had visited some of them, Gurung said.         
	Bandh to be total        
	Binay Tamang, press and publicity secretary of the Morcha, said: The strike on Saturday will be total and we have decided to close even the tea gardens, construction work at the NTPC and NHPC project sites and the cinchona plantations. Only emergency services will be exempted.        
	Tamang also appealed to the Akhil Bharatiya Adivasi Vikas Parishad to extend support to their strike. The strike is to highlight the atrocities on the Adivasi community and also for their betterment of the community, said Tamang.

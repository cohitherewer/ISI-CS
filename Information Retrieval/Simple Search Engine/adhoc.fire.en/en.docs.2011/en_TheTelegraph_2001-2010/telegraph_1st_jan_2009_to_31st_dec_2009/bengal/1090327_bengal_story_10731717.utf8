The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Rural leaders attack BDO
                                                                                                               Rural leaders attack BDO
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Behrampore, March 26: A Congress sabhadhipati and her supporters today assaulted a block development officer for apparently listening more to CPM leaders in the area.        
	This evening, around 20 Congress supporters led by Bilkiswara Begum, the sabhadhipati of the Beldanga II block, went to BDO R. Shainis office to submit a memorandum demanding that he act according to instructions of officials from the Congress-run panchayat samiti.        
	He has been acting on the instructions of CPM leaders, said Bilkiswara. When we went to meet him, the BDO told us to leave without hearing us out.         
	An altercation started when Shaini allegedly refused to listen to the sabhadhipati and her supporters.         
	They then beat up Shaini, broke his table and some chairs in the room. The injured BDO called up police for help.        
	Around 5pm, about half and hour after the fight broke out, a police contin- gent arrived to rescue the official.         
	The BDO later lodged an FIR naming Bilkiswara Begum, her assistant Sunirmal Ghoshal and zilla parishad member Humayun Kabir.         
	The police arrested all three on the charges of assaulting a government official and destroying government property.        
	As news of the arrests spread, around 300 Congress supporters surrounded the BDOs office demanding that the Congress leaders be released immediately.         
	The police baton-charged to disperse them. We had to lathicharge to disperse the mob and have made a few arrests, said B.L. Meena, the superintendent of police.         
	Shaini, an IAS officer, declined comment. He had been posted as BDO barely a month back.         
	District magistrate Perwez Ahmad Siddiqui said: Some Congress supporters had heckled and beaten up the block development officer, who complained to the police. The police did its job.        
	The Murshidabad district Congress has said it will block roads and obstruct rail traffic for an hour from 10am tomorrow.

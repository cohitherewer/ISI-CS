The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Govt letter insult to Nanda
                                                                                                               Govt letter insult to Nanda
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 15: Fisheries minister Kiranmoy Nanda today said he would personally appear in court if needed to explain his allegation that a water body had been filled and given to an educational foundation.         
	On Tuesday, the government issued a statement saying the land given to Mani Bhaumik Foundation was never a water body or fishery  which would have meant the area was under the watch of Nandas department  but a layek (bushy) jungle and vested land.        
	Nanda, however, is not convinced. A press statement has been issued by the information department headed by the chief minister saying no water body or fishery had been given to Mani Bhaumik (Foundation). This is a direct challenge to my authority as the fisheries minister and an insult to my position, he thundered at Writers Buildings.        
	I still maintain that 15 acres of a water body was given to this foundation. The matter is sub-judice. If the court asks me to explain my stand, I will do that by making a personal appearance.         
	Nanda, who is a member of the Socialist Party, added: I will not take any lawyers help. I will fight my case. For this, I wont seek the permission of the chief minister. I dont care for anybody.         
	Asked if chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee was involved in issuing the statement, he said: I think the chief minister was misled. He was wrongly told the land belonged to the land reforms department, not fisheries. He could have called me to find out.

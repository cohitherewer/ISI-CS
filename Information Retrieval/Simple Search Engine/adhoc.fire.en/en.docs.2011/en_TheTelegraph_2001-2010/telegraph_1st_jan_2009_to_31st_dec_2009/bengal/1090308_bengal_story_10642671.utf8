          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, March 7: Three men who police said were part of a countrywide racket that extorts money from iron-scrap dealers were arrested in north Calcutta this morning.        
	Kallu Singh alias Dilip, Dipu Sharma and Siaram Sharma were allegedly in the city to wrench Rs 3 crore out of the partners of an iron trading firm in Howrah.         
	Rajeev Kumar, special additional commissioner of the special task force, said Kallu and Siaram were picked up from the Vivekananda Road-Bidhan Sarani crossing. From them, we came to know about Dipu and got him on Aurobindo Sarani, he said.        
	Joy Ispat Traders Jawaharlal Jaiswal had told the police about threat calls from Kallu and Dipu. Jaiswal was the highest bidder in an auction at Rourkela on March 3, 2007. He had bought scrap worth Rs 33 crore from SAIL. The extortionists demanded a 10 per cent cut and prevented him from taking the scrap to his godown, said Kumar.        
	Kallu was said to be an associate of Amit Chowdhury, a fugitive Jharkhand mafioso. Dipu is allegedly based in Orissa. Siaram was in jail for seven years for raping a Bangladeshi in Yatri Nivas at Howrah station in 1998.        
	Chowdhury and Dipu are said to be rivals who had joined hands for this job.

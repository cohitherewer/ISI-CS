The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Horror on TV after lunch
                                                                                                               Horror on TV after lunch
          OUR BUREAU                          The abducted OCs daughter, Oindrakshi. (Sanat Kumar Sinha)                                  
	Oct. 20: Two families were grieving today and another clinging to hope and holding back tears.        
	Sub-inspectors Dibakar Bhattacharya and Swapan Roy were killed by the guerrillas and their boss, Atindranath Dutta, was taken hostage.        
	Two years shy of retirement, Bhattacharya was desperate for a transfer to neighbouring East Midnapore where his family stays. My mother was always scared and wanted him to take a transfer to a safer place. Her worst fears came true, said Dipankar, 21, who is yet to get a job after having completed his BSc.         
	His brother Anirban, 19, is in college, studying law.        
	Their mother Alaka, 51, collapsed on a sofa when she saw her husbands name flash on TV. I tried to call my father, but his phone was off, said Dipankar. Around 5pm, an of- ficer called up their home in the Contai police quarters to confirm the death.        
	Roys wife Rekha, 45, and their two daughters, Barnali, 23, and Rinki, 21, live in the police lines in Midnapore town.        
	At Roys ancestral house in Murshidabad, brother Uttam said: He came here almost a year ago but we spoke to each other every week. He would have been here in November for our mothers death anniversary.        
	Officer-in-charge Duttas family last saw him when he visited his ancestral house in Belur during Durga Puja.        
	An MSc in economics from Calcutta University and a Don Bosco Liluah alumnus, Dutta was serious about his social commitments. He would always be here for Puja. He touched my feet on Vijaya Dashami. I dont know what to say, said Anit Dutta, his uncle.         
	The officers father Ashok Dutta, a retired bank employee, lives in Ariadaha on Calcuttas northern fringes. My son is very honest. His nine-year career with the police is spotless. I pray to (Maoist leader) Kishanji to let him go, he said.        
	A friend who has known him since school said he was always a gentleman, who chose the profession because he thought it was honourable.         
	The officers wife Indrani, 28, spoke to Kishanji through a TV channel. He assured her that her husband wont be harmed, said her brother Sanjib.        
	Indrani is at her parents house in north Calcuttas Ahiritolla with their two-year-old daughter Oindrakshi.         
	The Duttas were casually watching TV after lunch when suddenly the name came up. We could not believe what we were seeing, said father-in-law Rajen Dutta. We dont know what to do.

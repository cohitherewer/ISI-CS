The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Poll babu in campaign mode
                                                                                                               Poll babu in campaign mode
  - Officer pleads with villagers not to boycott but to vote        AMIT UKIL                          Chief electoral officer Debashis Sen tells Kuilam primary school headmaster Rashbehari Soren that a poll boycott may not usher development in the region.

	Ranibandh, April 1: In the remote jungles of Ranibandh in southern Bankura, chief electoral officer Debashis Sen was pursuing a very different trail this morning. Far removed from reading out the Election Commissions diktats from his office in Calcutta.        
	He was listening to the complaints of villagers in this Maoist-infested pocket of south Bengal and subtly persuading them not to boycott this years general election to protest lack of development in their area.         
	The region, which includes adjoining Purulia and West Midnapore, will go to the polls on April 30.         
	Boycott of polls is not uncommon here. Many villagers in this tribal belt had not voted in the 2006 Assembly elections either.        
	Before stepping out this morning, Sen discussed his itinerary with Bankura district magistrate Sundar Majumdar. And the first item on the menu was no appetiser: the residents of Kuilam, about 10km from Ranibandh and having around 1,000 voters, had decided to shun the elections two weeks back.        
	Sen asked village representatives why they had decided not to vote. When told it was because of lack of development work, he explained that they should discuss it with the state government. The district magistrate and the block development officer are with me, you can ask them, he said.        
	The villagers, led by the headmaster of the local school, Rashbehari Soren, went into a rare huddle with the officials, who promised that their grievances  from lack of electricity to poor road connectivity  would be looked into.        
	Confident that the officials had made some headway, Sen stepped in and clarified that development work in the tribal areas of the three districts had been exempted from the election code of conduct at a recent meeting with the chief election commissioner at Raj Bhavan. I hope you will vote now.         
	Soren and his co-villagers nodded, OK, well see.        
	With this assurance, Sen went to remote villages like Kamo and Dhanjhar in the dense jungle and hilly terrain surrounding Jhilimili.         
	At Kamo, he showed a tribal woman how the electronic voting machine worked. All polling stations will have these machines and you will be shown how to use them, he told the villagers.         
	The convoy of 10 vehicles also stopped at the CRPF camp at Saren Sokra, where Sen discussed deployment of forces.         
	The long line of vehicles, with Sens red Tavera in the middle, had high entertainment value for the rural folk al- ong the route. Gun-toting jaw- ans in camouflage gear had lined up along the route on the Maoist turf.        
	A meeting with the seven block development officers of Khatra subdivision in the afternoon discussed logistics and other issues related to the polls.         
	The chief electoral officer, who stayed overnight at Mukutmanipur, will tour Purulia tomorrow.

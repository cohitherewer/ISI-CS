                                                                                                               Rebel threat real: Singh
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                           Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in Srinagar. (PTI)                                  
	Srinagar, Oct. 29: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today refused to be drawn into a controversy over Mamata Banerjees comments on the Maoists or allegations of her partys links with the guerrillas.        
	Asked about the railway ministers remark that there were no Maoists, but only the CPM, the Prime Minister said in Srinagar: The Maoist threat is a reality and the Government of India will deal with it in an effective manner.        
	Singh denied knowledge of a purported letter sent to him alleging collusion between the Trinamul Congress and the Maoists in Tuesdays Raj-dhani hijack. Ive only read about it in newspapers.        
	He stressed the need to operate on two legs to deal with the Maoist menace. Enforce law and order and... pay attention to development.        
	PC slams CPM        
	Home minister P. Chidamba- ram today hit out at the CPM for trying to link the railway minister with the Rajdhani hijack. (The) CPM seems to know more about what is happening in Trinamul than what is happening in Bengal. I think these are baseless charges, he said when asked about Prakash Karats insinuation that the outfit which held up the train enjoyed Mamatas patronage.

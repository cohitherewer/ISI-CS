                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Hill liquor ban off for Christmas
          VIVEK CHHETRI                              
	Darjeeling, Dec. 22: The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha today relaxed its liquor ban in the hills till Christmas, possibly buoyed by what it saw as a moral victory yesterday in the tripartite talks.        
	The Morcha had banned the sale of liquor to deprive the state government of excise revenue.        
	Today, the Morcha said the Centre would have to agree in principle to the demand of Gorkhaland for the talks with Delhi and the state government to move forward smoothly.        
	Morcha leaders said in the coming months, at least till the next round of talks, which they want at the political level, it would grant occasional concessions  like the liquor relaxation  but at the same time keep up the pressure through agitation to be renewed from December 26.        
	All government offices, state and central, which reopened today, would be forced shut from December 26.        
	Asked about the duration of the fresh phase of agitation, Morcha spokesperson Harka Bahadur Chhetri said: In an agitation, sometimes unseen circumstances determine the course it takes. So, it will be premature to say when the announced agitation will end.        
	Chhetri said the Morcha wanted to send a message to the Centre through the agitation.         
	The Centre must be serious about our demand, he said. We might relax the agitation and the talks can move forward smoothly if they come up with a declaration stating that they agree in principle to the demand for Gorkhaland, said Chhetri.

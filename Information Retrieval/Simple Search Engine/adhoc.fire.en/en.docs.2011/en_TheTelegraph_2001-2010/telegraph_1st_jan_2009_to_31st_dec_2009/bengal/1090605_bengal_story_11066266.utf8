The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Marriage off for dark skin, nurse kills herself
                                                                                                               Marriage off for dark skin, nurse kills herself
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Durgapur, June 4: A young nurse hanged herself in Durgapur on Tuesday after her wedding fell through because of her dark complexion.        
	Ratna Banerjee, 23, worked as a trainee nurse in a private hospital in Durgapur and was from a well-off farmers family in Ausgarm, Burdwan.         
	Her wedding had been fixed with a teacher from Birbhum. The date was June 1 but a week before, the grooms family returned the dowry of Rs 80,000, saying the girl was too dark, Ratnas elder brother Tubai said. His sister hanged herself a day after what would have been the wedding date.        
	The grooms family came to our house last week to return the money. Ratna was at home and broke down. We tried hard but could not find a groom for her because of her complexion, Tubai sobbed.        
	Ratna had faced marriage rejections more than once, her colleague and flat-mate in Durgapur said. She once told me she had grown up facing taunts from schoolmates who called her Ma Kali. She also said that one after another, her marriage negotiations were falling through because she was dark, the nurse said on the condition of anonymity.         
	On Tuesday, Ratna was on morning shift. She returned home after 8pm. I was on night shift so I left around 9pm. When I returned yesterday morning, the door was locked from inside, the colleague said.         
	Police, who broke the door open, said Ratna had left a note. It said she chose to commit suicide to free her parents and elder brother from worrying about her marriage. She also mentioned that the grooms family cancelled the wedding because of her dark complexion, said Aniruddha Sarkar, the officer-in-charge of New Township police station.

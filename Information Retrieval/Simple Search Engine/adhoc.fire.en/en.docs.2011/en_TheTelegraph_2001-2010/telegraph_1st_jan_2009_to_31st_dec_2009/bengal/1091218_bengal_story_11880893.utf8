                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Thieves empty Salt Lake home 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 17: A Sahara executives house in Salt Lake was cleaned out of all furniture and electrical fittings by robbers while he was away in Lucknow.        
	Abhijit Sarkar, the owner of the two-storeyed BF 296 house in the satellite town returned to the city around 8pm today to find his house empty.         
	I came back from Lucknow to find the house empty. Everything has been taken, said the director of corporate communications of Sahara.        
	Antique furniture made of Burma teak and mahogany, kitchen and bathroom fittings, even the tube lights and ceiling fans on both floors have been stolen.         
	I cannot estimate the worth of the stolen things. Most of the items were priceless, Sarkar said.        
	Sarkar and his family live in Lucknow and drop into the Salt Lake house occasionally.        
	The last time someone visited the house was in July, the Sahara executive said.        
	The family had entrusted a security agency, called Sainik Security Agency, with the job of taking care of the house for the past year and a half.        
	The guard told me that for the last three months that he had been here the main lock was open. He said that he had told the head of the agency but the owner is denying that he was told, said Sarkar, who suspects the agency is involved in the theft. How is it that everything from every other room was taken except the security guards room? There was no sign of a break-in either.        
	He lodged a complaint with the Bidhannagar (North) police station and the cops reached the spot immediately.        
	We are investigating the matter and have arrested a couple of people, said a senior police officer.        
	According to Sarkar, the police have arrested the security guard, Kamal Chandra Dey, and the owner of the agency, Kumaresh Hore. We had hired the agency in February, said Sarkar.        
	Driver hits woman        
	A woman, who was hit by a tanker near Ultadanga and protested, was assaulted by the driver of the vehicle around 8pm on Thursday. Kabita Gupta has lodged a complaint in the Ultadanga police station.

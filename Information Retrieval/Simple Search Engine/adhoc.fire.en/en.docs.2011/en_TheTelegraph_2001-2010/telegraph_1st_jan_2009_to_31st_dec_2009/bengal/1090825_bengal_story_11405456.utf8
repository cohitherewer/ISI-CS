	Burdwan, Aug. 24: A first-year student of a Siliguri polytechnic who had refused to tell his parents why he returned home to Burdwan all of a sudden three days ago committed suicide last night.        
	Anirban Dutta, 18, of Siliguri Government Polytechnic College was found hanging. Father Atanu, a diploma engineer and contractor, said his son had returned home soon after admission about a month ago and alleged that he was being mentally tortured by some seniors. But, Atanu said: I and his mother had persuaded him to return.        
	I met the principal and informed him about the incident, he added.         
	Principal Pujan Sarkar denied any ragging complaint.

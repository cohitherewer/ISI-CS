	Darjeeling, Jan. 7: Gorkha Janmukti Morcha president Bimal Gurung today met senior BJP leaders L.K. Advani and Rajnath Singh in New Delhi, in what the hill outfit said was a goodwill gesture, coming as it does before the Lok Sabha elections.         
	 It was more of a courtesy call. After the BJP helped us shelve the Sixth Schedule bill, we had not thanked the party. We did that today, Morcha vice-president Pradeep Pradhan said over the phone from Delhi.         
	The Morcha leaders had yesterday met S.S. Ahluwalia and Ananth Kumar.         
	Advani reportedly told the delegation that he was aware of the Gorkhaland demand and after the elections it would be discussed at the political-level.        
	 Till then, secretary-level discussions are important, he told us, said Pradhan.         
	The delegation, which is expected to stay in Delhi for the next three-four days, has fixed an appointment with Sushma Swaraj tomorrow. Efforts are also on to meet external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee, Congress president Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi.                         Advani (top) and Gurung: In touch      
	Political observers in the hills said the Morcha trip had been organised to feel the pulse of the national parties on Gorkhaland.        
	 The meeting largely centred on the Gorkhaland demand and the importance of a separate state, to not just the Gorkhas of Darjeeling, but those scattered across the country also, a source said.         
	He hinted that the Morcha was trying to sell the idea that many seats could be influenced by Gorkha voters. It has also been learnt that Gurungs trip to Delhi was pre-planned and was not as sudden as it had seemed.        
	The trip was discussed even before the tripartite meeting (held on December 29) and the delegation was expected to visit Delhi between January 3 and 6, another party source said. The visit was delayed because of the violence in Rohini.        
	As of now, the Morcha has kept its options open. At one hand it is trying to stitch up a rapport with the BJP.         
	On the other hand, it is eyeing the lone Congress MP from Darjeeling, Dawa Narbula.         
	Instead of just seeking support for Gorkhaland, the Morcha would be satisfied if the demand crops up in the official manifesto of any national party, an observer said.

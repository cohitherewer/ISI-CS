The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Despot-busters face despot charge
                                                                                                               Despot-busters face despot charge
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          An AK-47 slung on his shoulder, Maoist Bikash speaks to journalists on June 16, a show of might that many Naxalites believe invited the crackdown                                  
	Calcutta, June 28: Maoists waging an armed battle against the CPMs despotism are being accused by other Naxalites of perpetuating the same one-party rule in Lalgarh.         
	While opposing the ban on the CPI (Maoist) and the crackdown in Lalgarh, many of the guerrillas ideological cousins have blamed them for inviting police repression by imposing their agenda of armed struggle on the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities, initially a joint forum of all anti-CPM forces.         
	The Maoists, in turn, accused some factions that had fallen out with them of joining hands with the CPM to neutralise the rebels and pulled up others for being soft on the social fascists and harmaads (their description of the CPM and its collaborators).         
	A recent exchange of charges between the CPI (Maoist) and the PCC (CPIML) gives an inkling of the rancour among the fellow travellers.         
	In an open letter to Santosh Rana of the PCC (CPIML), CPI (Maoist) spokesman Surya recently accused the Jharkhand Janmukti Morcha of killing four Peoples Committee cadres and Maoist supporters between January and March. He complained that the CPM had been using local outfits to run an anti-Maoist militia on the lines of the state-sponsored Salwa Judum in BJP-ruled Chhattisgarh and rebuked Rana for having close relations with the Janmukti Morcha and the Jharkhand Party (Aditya), which hobnob with the social fascists.         
	Rana denied the charges and said: Your (Maoists) problem is that you want to establish your one-party rule in the area. To achieve that, you want to wipe out other organisations. You label people whose politics differs from yours as reactionaries.         
	We dont believe political differences should be settled by killing opponents. The killing of corrupt panchayat leaders cant trigger a peoples movement against corruption.         
	He mentioned the lynching of CPM supporter Gopinath Murmu, the way his wife was forced to go to the committees rally and the blasts that left a doctor, nurse and polling officials dead.         
	Sniggering at the fascist slur on the CPM, Rana pointed out the Maoists bonhomie with the ruling party when it was fighting the Trinamul Congress-BJP in the late 1990s.         
	Other Naxalites, too, disagree with the way the Maoists deal with their opponents. In the 1970s, we had not stopped the CPI and CPM from doing their politics when we were dominating Midnapore. The Maoists must be able to differentiate between the ordinary CPM supporter and the hated oppressor, said Pradip Banerjee of the CPI (ML) State Organising Committee.         
	The CPI (ML) New Democracy complained that the Maoists had bypassed the others in the Peoples Committee to impose their decisions.         
	Many were annoyed with their brash show of armed might in front of TV cameras while committee supporters ransacked CPM leader Anuj Pandes home at Dharampur.         
	No doubt the Maoists have popular support among tribals. But their impatience in projecting their supremacy and imposing their own political agenda has put the entire committee in peril, Banerjee said.        
	These so-called Maoists are anarchists. They cant depend on the mass movement and rely more on arms. Their show of armed power only gave an excuse to the state to crush a genuine peoples movement, said CPI (ML) Liberation state secretary Partha Ghosh.         
	The Maoists and their sympathisers defended themselves. We have been fighting for the rights of the poor in Jungle Mahal long enough for them to trust us. The Lalgarh resistance cant be sustained unless a zone of peoples power is developed, a leader said.         
	As the CPM and the state machinery had deserted Lalgarh, it was high time to upgrade the resistance to a revolutionary offensive, he added, a reminder of Mao Zedongs axiom: Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.         
	He denied indiscriminate killing, claiming that the death penalties were awarded by the peoples court in the presence of villagers after the accused failed to mend themselves despite reminders.         
	We have regretted the unintended killings of the doctor and nurse and the poll personnel, he added.         
	Many supporters of the Lalgarh agitation blame the Maoists for underestimating the states power as the security forces have advanced almost unhindered in their so-called stronghold.         
	But their sympathisers are hopeful that the fugitive guerrillas would turn Lalgarh in- to a trap for security forces and bleed the state through hit-and-run operations, making it a festering wound for the CPM-led government.

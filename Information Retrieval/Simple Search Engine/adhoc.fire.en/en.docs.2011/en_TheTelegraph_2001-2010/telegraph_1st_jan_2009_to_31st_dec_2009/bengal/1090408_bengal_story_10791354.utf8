	Bankura, April 7: About 400 Lalgarh villagers allegedly dragged away nine CPM supporters this morning from a neighbouring area in Bankura but freed them in the evening after talks between district officials and the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities.        
	At 6am, an hour after police had left the picket at Bejdanga in Bankura, about 10km from Lalgarh, the tribals entered the village. Many were armed with bows, arrows and swords.        
	Bankura superintendent of police Vishal Garg said the tribals took away nine people whom they suspected of molesting a family member of Sudam Bag, a general secretary of the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities. The police picket had been put up in Bejdanga after the alleged molestation.        
	CPM local committee member Aswini Bishoi, whose son Apurba was among the nine abducted, said: Around 400 people came at 6am. They knocked on the houses of the CPM supporters. They dragged out my son and eight other party supporters and beat them up.        
	After a tense morning, the district authorities held a meeting with Chhatradhar Mahato, the tribal committees leader, in a field near Bejdanga.         
	He agreed to the unconditional release of the CPM activists. The nine returned home later in the evening.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Maoists: In or out
                                                                                                               Maoists: In or out
          PRONAB MONDAL                              
	Lalgarh, June 20: Sporadic firing at police between Pirakata and Bhimpur and a gun battle in Goaltore for most of the day punched holes in the governments claim that the Maoists had fled Lalgarh.        
	Home secretary Ardhendu Sen had claimed yesterday that Kishanji, the leader of the Maoists armed squad, had fled to Jharkhand.         
	But today, Sagar, a Maoist leader operating in Lalgarh, told The Telegraph over the phone that Kishanji was very much in Lalgarh and directing operations.        
	This is just an attempt to malign Kishanji and our organisation, Sagar said. Kishanji and all members of the central committee of the CPI (Maoist) are here. They are directing all operations and no one has fled.        
	Kishanji, too, said: I am very much in Lalgarh. The police can ascertain I am here by the position of the cellphone tower. We will try and stop the police at any cost.         
	This evening, a group of journalists returning to Jhargram, were stopped by armed Maoists at Kuldiha, a kilometre from Bhimpur.        
	Till this morning the state and central security personnel had their base camp in a Bhimpur school. As soon as they moved out, the Maoists came back.        
	They blocked the road with boulders and were patrolled the area, guns slung across their shoulders. They occasionally fired in the air in a show of authority.        
	Eventually, the Maoists allowed the journalists to continue towards Jhargram but after extracting a small donation for their cause.         
	Yesterday, they had blocked the Pirakata-Lalgarh road at five places when the police were still in the Bhimpur camp in large numbers, just 2km away. The Pirakata-Lalgarh road is one of the supply routes for the police but the Maoists have blocked it at will.         
	Sagar, the Maoist leader, said they wanted to send out the message that the outfit could strike whenever and wherever it wanted. Hence, the firing yesterday aiming at the Lalgarh police station. Our firing at the Lalgarh police station last night was symbolic, Sagar said. We just wanted to send a message that we can strike where we want, when we want.        
	Maoist sources said Bikash, the action squad leader, had moved to Barapelia, a stronghold between Lalgarh and Ramgarh. A source said the outfit had dug trenches in villages on the route.

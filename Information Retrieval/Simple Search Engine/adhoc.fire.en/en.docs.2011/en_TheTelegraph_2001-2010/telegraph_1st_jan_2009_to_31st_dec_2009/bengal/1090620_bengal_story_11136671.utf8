          NARESH JANA                                            
	Midnapore, June 19: If the Maoists want to flee Lalgarh, they are likely to take one of three routes to Jharkhand through vast stretches of jungles and hills, according to police sources.         
	The shortest route would be to move a kilometre south of Lalgarh to a footbridge across the Kangshabati, cross over to Amkola and trek to Paluidanga off State Highway 9.         
	The guerrillas could then enter the dense Kushboni jungle  where three election officials were killed in a blast on May 7  for a 20km journey.         
	Entry into Jharkhand would most likely be near Chakulia in East Singhbhum district. By this route, Jharkhand is only 28km from Lalgarh.         
	But being the most likely route, the Maoists might encounter the police here. Motorcycle-borne vigilantes assembled by the police are also likely to be there.        
	The longest route is likely to offer lesser resistance. From a point between Kantapahari and Ramgarh, the extremists could move westwards to Murar village and cross the river before entering Bankura near Bejdanga. Trekking for a short stretch through Bankura, they would re-enter West Midnapore and proceed towards Belpahari. From Bhelaidiha village, they would move south towards Dhangikusum in Jharkhand.         
	Sources said top Maoists used this strenuous, 40-45km route passing through four jungles and hilly terrain.         
	However, it is pockmarked with police camps. The vigil on the Bankura border would also be stiff.         
	The most likely retreat would be to cross the Kangshabati west of Lalgarh and move north towards Belatikri. The Maoists could then cross the highway south of Silda and enter the dense Malaboti jungles while moving southwest towards Jharkhand.         
	In this case, the distance to Jharkhand will be some 35km. It appears to be the safest route as it is less populated and most of it goes through dense forests, a police source said.         
	The jungles comprise Sal, Mohua, Kendu, Palash and Segun trees, which provide the cover of dense foliage.        
	The authorities in Jharkhand said its officers on the Bengal border were on a state of alert since Wednesday. The border along West Midnapore  Ghatshila subdivision in Jharkhand  has been sealed.        
	However, the rebels are more likely to use dirt tracks through forests that they know better than the police instead of conventional routes.         
	It is not necessary that all of them would move together or take the same route, a police officer said. Whichever route they take, theyd be laying booby traps to deter pursuit, he added.

          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 12: The Supreme Court has acquitted a man from East Midnapore of abetting his first wifes suicide after he married and brought home another woman because the victim took her life three months too late.         
	From the period of three months which lapsed in between the incident of the appellant (man) bringing Anita (the second wife) to his house and the deceased (first wife) committing suicide, it can be clearly inferred that it was not the act of the appellant which instigated or provoked the deceased to commit suicide, a two-judge bench said.         
	If the deceased had been so perturbed by the act that she felt impelled to commit suicide then she could have done so on the very day when Anita had come to stay in his house, as naturally at that point of time her annoyance or dismay with life would have been at its pinnacle.         
	The court convicted him under Section 498A for subjecting the first wife to cruelty. A trial court had awarded him three years imprisonment on this charge. The apex court asked him to immediately surrender and serve the full term.         
	Amalendu Pal alias Jhantu escaped the harsher sentence of eight years rigorous imprisonment for abetting suicide, a charge the prosecution had levelled against him. Both sentences would have run concurrently.         
	Amalendu and Dipika, who married in 1977, were happy in the first few years of their marriage. Pal stayed in Calcutta in connection with his work, while Dipika stayed in Contai, East Midnapore, with their two sons.         
	During his stay in Calcutta, Amalendu married Jyotsna alias Anita. Dipika came to know of it and objected to the relationship. Amalendu sought Dipikas permission to marry Anita. She refused.         
	After that, Amalendu started torturing her physically and mentally, the prose- cution said. He also allegedly told her to drink poison or hang herself. Anita also allegedly assaulted Dipika the night before she killed herself.         
	She was found hanging from the ceiling on the morning of September 27, 1991.         
	The trial court acquitted seven others, including Anita, who were also accused with Amalendu. The high court upheld the trial court order.         
	The Supreme Court noted the fact that the couple had lived happily for the first five to six years of their marriage. The problems cropped up only after Amalendu developed an extra-marital relationship.         
	In cases of abetting suicide, there must be proof of direct or indirect acts of incitement, the court said. Merely on the allegation of harassment without their being positive action proximate to the time of occurrence on the part of the accused, conviction under Section 306 (abetment) was not sustainable, it said.         
	The apex court considered the allegation that the day before Dipika killed herself she was tortured.

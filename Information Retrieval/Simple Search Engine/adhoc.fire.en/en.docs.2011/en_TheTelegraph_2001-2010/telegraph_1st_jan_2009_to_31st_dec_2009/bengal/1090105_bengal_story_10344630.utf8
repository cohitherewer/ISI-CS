          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Alipurduar (Jalpaiguri), Jan. 4: Eleven men were arrested today after their bid to abduct a woman failed as she managed to break free and their attempt to flee came unstuck because of their cars flat tyre.        
	The head clerk of the Falakata block office was part of an office team that had come to the bank of the Jainti for picnic.         
	They were getting ready to pack up around 4.30pm when the men, between 25 and 30, arrived in a Tata Spacio. The vehicle stopped in front of the 37-year-old woman, standing at some distance from the others, and the men tried to drag her in.         
	There was little help around as many picnickers had already left the spot and it was fast getting dark.But she managed to give them the slip and run.         
	We saw her coming. When she came nearer, we realised she was screaming, said Priyanka Dev, the Falakata block development officer who was there with her juniors. We saw the men trying to reverse the vehicle, but one of the tyres burst. We caught three of them.        
	The trio were bundled into one of the buses that the picnickers had come in and taken to Kalchini police station.         
	When a police team reached the spot, 26km from Alipurduar town, the Spacio had vanished. The police lay in wait at Damanpur, 21km away, where the road bifurcates into two  one going towards Assam and the other to Alipurduar town  and the Spacio was not difficult to spot. Its flat tyre had been replaced.        
	We knew they either had to come to Alipurduar or go to Assam, said subdivisional police officer Ujjwal Bhowmik.         
	The 11 were from Dinhata, Cooch Behar. Some of them work with the local cable operator and some with jewellers. A court sent them to a fortnights jail custody.

                                                                                                               Mob fury on doctor for maid death
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Serampore, Sept. 21: A gynaecologist from Behala was beaten mercilessly by a mob that was apparently misled into believing he raped and murdered a young domestic help found dead in his home-cum-chamber in Hooghly.        
	A post-mortem has ruled out rape of the 22-year-old Rozina Khatoon, who was suffering from tuberculosis, police said.        
	But before that, mob justice had unfolded in its full fury  at least 1,000 residents pouncing on a suspect with a history of teasing the girl, who apparently told them that she was raped and killed by the doctor and his driver.        
	The mob ransacked the Serampore chamber and beat up the 50-year-old doctor, Mihir Saha, so severely that he suffered a fracture in the skull.        
	The police took the doctor and the driver away  probably to pacify the crowd that was demanding the duo be tied up and paraded  and released them late tonight. The initial suspect, sweetmeat shop owner Manasa Ghosh, was also allowed to go home at night.        
	The post-mortem was held and it was found that the girl was not raped and she was suffering from tuberculosis, said Ajay Thakur, the sub-divisional police officer in Serampore.        
	Saha, a gynaecologist who hails from Behala, had gone to his Serampore rented flat  it doubles as his home and chamber on weekdays  at 9am. Saha said he found Rozinas blood-splattered body in the bathroom. Rozina had been cooking and washing clothes for Saha on weekdays for seven years.        
	Saha informed Rozinas brother Asgar Mullick who said he found his sister lying on the floor with a lot of blood on her and foamed at the mouth.        
	I ran out and informed my mother. She told me to catch hold of Manasa Ghosh, who often teased my sister, Asgar said.        
	Asgar and around 1,000 residents rushed to Manasas shop and beat him up. It was then that Manasa is thought to have pinned the blame on Saha, who works in the Serampore Walsh Hospital, and his driver Ashish Sapui.        
	The mob, armed with sticks, rushed to the doctors chamber. They kicked and beat Saha and Sapui with sticks, a police officer said.         
	The mob also set fire to the doctors car.        
	When the police arrived, the mob demanded that Saha and the driver be paraded. Unable to pacify the mob, the police called for reinforcements.         
	We have started a rape and murder case against the doctor and his driver and charged the sweet shop owner with assisting them. We are yet to make a formal arrest, said Thakur, the police officer.         
	Saha said he was innocent. I stay in Behala during the weekends. Rozina had a duplicate key as she cleaned the chamber every day, said Saha.

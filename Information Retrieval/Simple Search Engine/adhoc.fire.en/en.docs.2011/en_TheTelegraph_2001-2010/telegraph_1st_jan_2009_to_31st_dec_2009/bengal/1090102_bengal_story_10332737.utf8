                                                                                                               Gogoi pins peace hope on Hasina 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Guwahati, Jan. 1: Assam is pinning hopes on Sheikh Hasinas resounding victory in the Bangladesh general elections to help curb cross-border terrorism.         
	Chief minister Tarun Gogoi today said the Awami Leagues landslide win and Hasinas assertion that Bangladesh soil would not be allowed to carry out terror acts against its neighbours was indeed a positive development for India and Assam.         
	Her statements after the win to dismantle all terror camps and flush out militants, including that of the Huji, are good signs for Assam. She has always been friendly with India and I am very happy for her. It is a good sign that the Bangladeshi people have rejected the fundamentalist forces, he told journalists        
	Gogoi said he preferred to lead a delegation to Dhaka and seek Bangladeshs help to tackle terrorism.         
	I have taken up the matter with external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee about the developments and he said things could improve and we should wait for Hasina to assume charge, he said.         
	Gogoi said besides Hasinas victory, the huge turnout in the Jammu and Kashmir polls have also raised hopes of defeating the fundamentalist and separatist forces.         
	This only shows that all problems can be resolved in a democratic way, he said.         
	Ulfa and the NDFB should take lessons from the Jammu and Kashmir elections. People in Assam have time and again shown that they believe in democracy. I appeal to both groups to come forward for talks, he said.

                                                                                                               Flip-flop by CPMs Nandi man 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Tamluk, March 25: The only CPM zilla parishad member from Nandigram has joined the Trinamul Congress.        
	After switching sides, Nanigopal Kayal said he had always been associated with right-wing politics and joined the CPM six years ago by mistake.        
	When Trinamul routed the CPM in Nandigram last May, former Congressman Kayal won from Reyapara.        
	Till the rural polls, the region had been a CPM stronghold and backyard of the partys Haldia strongman Lakshman Seth. We had picked Kayal because we were not getting a suitable candidate for the Nandigram zilla parishad seat. Now we realise we committed a mistake, said Ashok Guria, a district party leader.        
	In 2003, Kayal crossed over to the CPM after being denied a ticket. Today, he said: I couldnt adjust with Left politics.        
	Although I was an elected zilla parishad member, I was not made a party (CPM) member. They did not give me any importance, he added.        
	Cong support        
	The Nadia Congress chief, who had earlier complained about dissent in the party over the deal with Trinamul, today stood behind Mamata Banerjee at a rally in Ranaghat.        
	Ajoy De turned up with supporters and promised full co-operation to the Trinamul candidates during campaigning for the Lok Sabha polls.        
	The Congresss other Nadia rebel, general secretary Shankar Singh, was missing.

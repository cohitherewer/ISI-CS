          OUR BUREAU                          Kishanji takes off the PoW label stuck on the police officer. (Amit Datta and Samir Mondal)				                                       
	Oct. 22: His Maoist abductors lined up behind him, faces covered and guns slung on their backs, Atindranath Dutta spoke about his co-operative captors after CPI (Maoist) leader Kishanji released him before cameras in a West Midnapore forest.        
	I feel relieved. I want to tell my family that there is nothing to worry about, said the Sankrail officer-in-charge after over 50 hours in Maoist captivity. Standing before journalists at Bhulagera in Lalgarh, about 30km from Jhargram, the officer recounted the kidnap, stay and release, often referring to the Maoists as onara  a term of respect generally used while speaking about elders.        
	Before the interview started, Kishanji took off a red cloth that was hung from the officers neck with a paper stuck on it, saying: Juddha bandir mukti sammelan (a meeting to release a prisoner of war).        
	Recounting Tuesdays kidnap, Atindranath said: I was not at the police station during the incident (when bike-borne Maoists attacked the police station) but I heard gunshots. I was returning to the police station after lunch at my quarters when a woman pointed a 9mm pistol at me. Before I could react, others blindfolded me and put me on a motorcycle and drove me to their den.         
	He said: Initially, they were aggressive but when I reached their den blindfolded, they became co-operative. No one tortured me. No one told me why I was kidnapped but I heard from those who captured me that they have demanded release of some women.         
	Asked about his stay, he said: I ate whatever they ate. They gave me rice, dal, vegetables and puffed rice.         
	Did he know where he had been kept?         
	I was with them but I am not sure where I was. In captivity I was taken to several locations, Atindranath said.        
	After over 50 hours with the Maoists, had his attitude towards them changed?        
	The officer again said the Maoists had been co-operative, then added, but I cannot predict how much aggressive they will become later.         
	I want to say that the government should think about development in tribal areas. I will tell the government to sit for talks with the Maoists.        
	Asked about his area of operation  Sankrail  the officer said the Maoists were not so active in the area but at the same time security was inadequate.        
	Would he continue as a police officer?         
	The officer said he would take a call after talking to his family.        
	When his slain colleagues, sub-inspectors Dibakar Bhattacharya and Swapan Roy, were mentioned, Atindranath said he was sad that they had been killed. I feel deeply sad for the death of my two colleagues. I worked with them for so long. They were very co-operative, he said.         
	Earlier in the evening, speaking to his wife Indrani through STAR Ananda, Atindranath said he was safe and in good health. I will return tonight. But I will have to go to Jhargram police station first to report there.         
	Indrani then gave the cellphone to their two-year-old daughter Oindrakshi but the line got disconnected.         
	After the line was reconnected, Atindranath told his family: I know you are anxious about me. I will return soon.        
	Late at night, he set off from Jhargram for Calcutta.

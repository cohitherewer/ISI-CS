The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Nano-scarred Singur votes to prove point
                                                                                                               Nano-scarred Singur votes to prove point
          KINSUK BASU                          Two Singur voters on their way to a polling booth walk past a banner lamenting the Nanos exit. (Amit Datta)                                  
	Singur, May 7: Biswanath Maity, 42, said there was nothing for him to vote for.        
	What is the point in voting? The future doesnt seem to hold much for us, Maity said, standing on the potholed Gopalnagar road, a couple of kilometres from the now abandoned Tata Motors plant.        
	Maity had given up nearly two bighas for the Nano project in the hope that his sons, 15 and 8, would find employment there when they grow up.        
	But now, what hope is left for me? asked the employee of Oriental Jute Mill in Rishra and CPM supporter who had organised many processions in favour of the small car plant.        
	But vote he did, after all.                   
	The Nano has gone, and hope seems to be dying every day, but I will prove a point by voting, Maity said. After all, what harm has the CPM done? I will definitely vote for the CPM.        
	Over 80 per cent of Singurs electorate voted today.         
	Amit Maity, 24, was one of them. He had travelled all the way from Mumbai to vote. Had the Tatas not moved from Singur to Sanand, Amit would have been working here. Recruited by Tata Motors, he worked at the Singur plant for four months but had to leave for Pune and Pantnagar after the project was scrapped. He is now with a company dealer in Navi Mumbai as part of training.        
	We have handled the Nano engine in Pune and have even seen the diesel version taking shape. Its a strange feeling when you realise that you are from Singur, where the dream was about to come true, Amit said.         
	You have to see the automobile majors and their workshops in Pune to feel the burning desire to get back such a plant in Bengal. I heard about a Chinese truck manufacturer planning to arrive in Singur. Is it true?        
	Amit was referring to officials from Chinas FAW having told the government it was interested in setting up a small car, truck or bus factory in Singur after an inspection of the site.        
	He quickly corrected himself: Of course, the Tatas still have the land with them. We dont know what will come of it.        
	What will become of the land  and of them  is a question people on the other side of the Nano divide are also asking.        
	Shyamapada Samanta, 71, has not collected the cheque for his seven bighas that were acquired by the government for the factory.        
	The Trinamul Congress had promised to get our land back or get us more money for our land, he said. But nothing has happened so far and nothing seems to be there for us on the horizon either. Even if that land were to be returned to us, it would be of no use as it is no longer cultivable. I am now considering collecting the money as that, at least, would be of some use to us.        
	Samanta, too, queued up to vote.        
	As did Nishikanta Ghosh, 38, a farmer whose five bighas were acquired by the government and who too has not taken his cheque.        
	Ghosh is disappointed that Mamata Banerjee did not come to Singur for a single day to campaign.        
	All interest in Singur seems to have disappeared after the Tatas pulled out from here, he said. Our land is gone, I have not collected my cheque and lost out on the extra 10 per cent for not giving my consent. And now I see that no major Trinamul leader turned up to campaign here. I might as well collect the money for my land now.        
	Would the disappointment translate into a vote against Mamata?         
	Ghosh wasnt telling.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Villagers allege ransack in resistance revenge
                                                                                                               Villagers allege ransack in resistance revenge
          ZEESHAN JAWED                          A villager in his ransacked house at Koima. (Amit Datta)                                  
	Lalgarh, June 19: Residents of Koima village, 13km from Lalgarh, alleged that some policemen went on the rampage last night to teach them a lesson.         
	The villagers said a team of 100-odd policemen entered Koima, 165km from Calcutta, around 11pm and vandalised nearly all the 100 houses in the village with a population of over 1,100.         
	Dulal Rana, 32, was a happy man on Thursday. Rana owns a tea stall-cum-mobile recharge outlet in the village, near which police and central forces marching to Lalgarh camped for the night.         
	Thanks to scores of media teams and policemen stopping by his shop through the day, he had made over Rs 4,000.         
	But as Rana sat behind the counter counting cash around 11pm, he heard a loud noise. He rushed out to see policemen breaking glasses and glass containers, and snatching biscuits and other items.         
	They threw my mobile recharge coupons worth thousands into a puddle nearby. When I tried to stop them, they thrashed me mercilessly, saying, Weve suffered a lot because of you people. Now its our turn to show you what we can do, said an injured Rana.        
	The villagers said the policemen wanted to teach them a lesson because they had supported the movement against police brutality. Many Koima villagers had attended meetings held by Chhatradhar Mahato, who heads the Peoples Committee against Police Atrocities, aligned with the Maoists.         
	Four central force jawans heard noises while walking past and stopped to look. Over 100 policemen were vandalising the village, beating people mercilessly. Where we come from, such things are unimaginable. We would have intervened but four of us stood no chance against 100, a jawan said.        
	Arindam Sarkar, the commandant of one of the police companies, refuted the charges. We are here on a specific mission. Why should we enter a village and beat up villagers? asked Sarkar.         
	But when The Telegraph visited Koima this morning, villagers came out of their homes to complain.         
	Noragor Manna, 75, was asleep beside his 70-year-old wife and his 26-year-old granddaughter. As some policemen kicked the door open, it hit Manna in the head, and he started bleeding profusely.        
	They held me by my clothes and flung me out, I landed several feet away. They pulled my wife and granddaughter by the hair and threw them out of the house, Manna wept. They smashed everything in the house with their lathis and razed our chulha to the ground, abusing us verbally. They kept saying You did not give us water or ration and boycotted us for such a long time. Now see how we pay you back in your own coin, he added.

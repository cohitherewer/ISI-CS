The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Diver trapped in reservoir
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Diver trapped in reservoir
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Purulia, Dec. 14: A technician from Mumbai who dived into a Purulia reservoir yesterday afternoon to repair a leak was stuck till late tonight under 150 feet of water where his foot got caught between pipes.        
	Efforts to rescue Mukesh Kumar, 35, by fellow divers failed several times since yesterday as the panic-stricken man lunged at them in desperation every time instead of allowing them to extricate his foot.        
	A team of divers from Calcutta reached the lake on Ayodhya hills tonight for another rescue mission.        
	Kumar, who was among three men who went down to mend the leak in the reservoir of a hydel power plant, is being fed oxygen through a pipe. Without food and water for hours, he is very weak and nervous, his teammates said.        
	The Purulia Pumped Storage Project, a Rs 3,200-crore Indo-Japanese venture built for the state power utility, was completed in 2007. Its four 225MW turbines are powered by water that is pumped up and released downstream.         
	The leak in the upstream reservoir was spotted in March. Our attempts to repair it were unsuccessful and we called experts from Mumbai, said Surajit Dutta, an official.        
	A seven-member team from Drafting Marine Engineering Company of Mumbai arrived here on Saturday with Kumar as its supervisor. Divers Gopal Bhuin and Gul Mehra preceded him yesterday and put up lights near the suspected leak. Apparently while inspecting a dam wall, Kumars foot got stuck.        
	Although he is wearing pressurised suit, the lack of nutrition and water is worrying the authorities. There is no way he can be fed, Dutta said.         
	Even after his foot is taken out, Kumar cannot be pulled out immediately. His body will need time to get acclimatised to the decrease in pressure after spending so long in such a depth, Dutta said.

                                                                                                               NSG land trip to Calcutta
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          The NSG chief in Calcutta. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                                  
	Calcutta, Feb. 20: The National Security Guard director-general was in Calcutta today to discuss the possible location of the hub it wants to set up in Bengal.        
	After a meeting with J.K. Dutta, home secretary Ardhendu Sen said: They are primarily interested in setting up an anti-hijacking unit, which will be part of the hub. The anti-hijacking unit has to stay close to the airport as it has to carry out drills there. A plot in Kaikhali has been shown to the NSG. The unit has also inspected few more places adjacent to the airport.         
	In December, the Union government had decided to station full-fledged NSG units in Calcutta, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Chennai.        
	The NSG director-general told Sen he was considering Kalaikunda in West Midnapore, Panagarh in Burdwan and Barrackpore in North 24-Parganas for the full-fledged hub.         
	We want a strong hub in this state, Dutta said.        
	Sen said the NSG had liked Barrackpore but nothing had been finalised.         
	Delhis decision to set up NSG hubs across the country came in the wake of the Mumbai terror attacks. The Black Cats took about nine hours to reach Mumbai from their hub at Manesar. They had to travel to Delhi by road and board a flight to Mumbai, a home department official said.         
	Ahmedabad, Bhopal, Guwahati and Bangalore were also considered, but the Centre felt Mumbai would cover the west zone while Calcutta would take care of the east. Hyderabad and Chennai are to handle the central and south zones. Manesar is in the north.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Burdwan, Dec. 7: A court here today asked police to reopen a suicide case and treat it as a case of murder after efforts by the victims father to make the force do so allegedly met with refusal.        
	Chief judicial magistrate Chinmoy Chatterjee ordered Burdwan police station to submit a detailed report on the death of Class XII student Mushtaq Ahmed, who was found hanging in his hostel room at CMC High School.         
	With the body, the police had claimed to have found a suicide note on November 9.         
	However, father Ehsaan Hossain moved court holding headmaster Biswanath Chakraborty, hostel superintendent Lalit Kumar Panja and three or four Class XII students responsible for the death.        
	The Burdwan inspector-in-charge is directed to treat the petition as an FIR, conduct a probe and submit a report at the earliest, the magistrate was quoted as saying.         
	The note with the boys purported signature had said: I had several secret things to say. But in this short lifespan, I couldnt do that.         
	According to Hossain, Mushtaq had objected to the drinking habits of some of his classmates which they did not like, particularly after it was brought to the notice of the headmaster and the hostel superintendent.         
	After Mushtaqs death, his father had approached the po-lice. I had also sought the SPs intervention, but none of my efforts fetched any result.         
	Burdwan inspector-in-charge Prasun Banerjee said: We had investigated the case and come to the conclusion that it was a case of suicide, not murder. So how could we lodge a murder case?        
	Headmaster Chakraborty said: Its unfortunate that my name is being dragged into this by his family. Im told that a case has been filed. Let the police initiate a proper probe.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Airport hits villager wall
                                                                                                               Airport hits villager wall
  - Andal residents want more, Trinamul fans fire        OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Durgapur, Feb. 10: All 71 landowners called to register their objections to land acquisition for the airport city in Andal today refused to part with their plots unless the Bengal government negotiated the compensation directly with them.        
	The owners boycotted the hearing after two of them were heard, saying their demands were the same, and filed a joint petition.        
	The first days hearing, which began around noon, was over within an hour.        
	Around 900 of the 19,000 landowners involved in the acquisition plan have objected. Mamata Banerjees Trinamul Congress is leading them, with support from the Naxalite CPI(ML) and the SUCI.        
	Trinamul had boycotted all the all-party meetings held by the Burdwan district administration earlier to fix the compensation.         
	All other mainline parties had welcomed the offer of Rs 7.5 lakh to 11.24 lakh an acre and a land-for-land scheme, a first in the state. The promoters had promised a cottah (60 cottahs make an acre) inside the project area for every acre acquired. Members of landloser families were also supposed to get vocational training so they became job-worthy.        
	An airport, a city around it, an IT park and an industrial and logistics hub, have been planned across 3,500 acres of mostly single-crop land in Andal, 200km from Calcutta.         
	The government has issued acquisition notices for about 2,364 acres in the first phase.        
	Led by Trinamul, the villagers demonstrated outside the Andal block office today, accusing the government of grabbing their land to set up malls, hotels, golf courses....         
	How can shopping malls, hotels, golf courses and other amusement items be of public interest? asked Raju Roy, a Trinamul member of the Andal panchayat. We are also not happy with the price being offered for our land. He would not sell his 3 acres for less than Rs 18 lakh an acre.         
	Anwarul Haque, the land acquisition collector of Burdwan, said: All of them filed petitions demanding a revised compensation and rehabilitation package drawn up in consultation with them.        
	District magistrate Manish Jain ruled out any change, saying the rate had been fixed at all-party meetings.

                                                                                                               Train heat on MLA
                            
	Malda, Sept. 9: The railways have filed an FIR against a CPM MLA from north Bengal for squatting on the tracks and leading frenzied supporters who held up many trains for over 10 hours till early this morning and ransacked a station.         
	Railway officials said the department would pursue the case filed against Kaliachak MLA Biswanath Ghosh by Khaltipur station manager S.K. Kanth. It is on the instigation of the local MLA that the demonstrators went berserk. Passengers of 30 trains were harassed, divisional railway manager M.K. Mathur said.        
	The agitators led by Ghosh squatted on the tracks from 4pm demanding a stop for long-distance trains at Khaltipur  about 35km from Malda town  computerised ticket counters and a flyover.        
	At 1.30am today, police resorted to a baton charge after they ransacked the station managers office and smashed the glass panes of the ticket counters and glow sign boards.        
	At least five pairs of express trains, including Kamrup, Saraighat, Trivandrum and Kanchenkanya, and Darjeeling Mail were stranded at stations, some of which did not even have drinking water.

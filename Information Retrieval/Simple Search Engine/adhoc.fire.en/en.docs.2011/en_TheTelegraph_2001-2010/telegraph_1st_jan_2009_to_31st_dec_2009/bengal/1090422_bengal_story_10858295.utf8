The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Cong date tussle for Gandhis 
                                                                                                               Cong date tussle for Gandhis 
          OUR BUREAU                                              Who rsquo;s smiling? Deepa and Mausam      
	April 21: Rahul Gandhi will address a rally in Abu Hashem Khan Chowdhurys Malda South on April 24.        
	Mausam Noor, fielded from Malda North against uncles Abu Hashem and Abu Nasers wishes, has been told Sonia Gandhi may visit her area, time permitting, on April 27.         
	The Congress chief, however, has confirmed her presence at a public meeting that day in Islampur, part of neighbouring Raiganj where Deepa Das Munshi is in the fray.         
	Both the uncle and the niece had lobbied for Sonias rallies in their areas. Rahuls rally will be held at the district sports council grounds. Ive got a confirmation only for that, Abu Hashem said today.         
	Party sources said Mausam had been confident that Rahul would come to Ratua in Malda North.        
	But Mausam is not giving up yet, hoping at least for a road show with Rahul. I have requested the high command for a roadshow with him in Gajole. I have told Dalumama (Hashem) about it and Ill also approach Pranabmama (Pranab Mukherjee), she said.

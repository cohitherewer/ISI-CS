The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Girl with splinters for 3 days but no surgery 
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Girl with splinters for 3 days but no surgery 
          RITH BASU                                            
	Calcutta, Dec. 23: Little Priyanka is still waiting for surgeons to take out seven to eight bomb splinters in her shoulder  more than 72 hours after being caught in a fight she has no interest in.        
	Shifted from RG Kar Medical College and Hospital last night to an Ekbalpore nursing home run by a Trinamul Congress leader, the 9-year-old lay in a cramped 9ft-by-8ft room, sharing a bed with her mother Iti Goldar.        
	My daughter couldnt sleep last night because of the pain. I just want her to get some relief, Iti told The Telegraph today at Bellona Nursing Home and Diagnostic Centre, whose managing director is Trinamul leader M.A. Kasem.        
	Her daughter  hit when gunmen attacked a drawing contest-cum-blood donation camp in Habra on Sunday  may have got the relief had her family not allowed Trinamul leaders led by Union minister Mukul Roy to shift her from the state hospital to the less-equipped private facility.        
	We would have conducted the surgery by this afternoon after X-rays, blood tests and a precautionary CT Scan. A medical board led by the head of the orthopaedic department had been formed for her, RG Kar medical superintendent Lalit Kumar Vaid said today.        
	The VIP treatment had followed a personal intervention by finance minister Asim Dasgupta.        
	Kasem, a doctor himself, conceded that any surgery to remove the splinters could only take place after 10am tomorrow after results of medical tests come in. Moreover, a CT scan has to be done and the nursing home does not have the facility, in contrast with RG Kar.         
	We will take her across the road to CMRI after the surgery to make sure all the splinters have been removed, Kasem said.        
	Sumantra Thakur, an orthopaedist attached to a private hospital, said it was always better to be admitted to an institute where all facilities were available under one roof. At RG Kar, a CT scan would have been done before the surgery, which is always preferable. Taking the girl to another hospital for the scan after surgery can cause complications and expose her to infection.        
	This evening, after another day of agonising wait for Priyanka, Trinamul leader Roy said he had shifted the girl on instructions of Mamata Banerjee. I didnt know there was no CT scan facility there, he said. My mother died in that nursing home, Roy added, as if to emphasise his faith in the private facility.         
	At RG Kar, Priyanka would have had a CT scan done by now if she had not been shifted in the game of political one-upmanship in which she has become a tool.         
	I had seen the patient myself along with two assistant professors, Ananda Mondal and Niraj Dugar, said the head of the orthopaedic department, A. Bandyopadhyay, who had prescribed a CT Scan after an inconclusive X-ray. We were preparing for the scan when the family lost faith in us and took her away, said the doctor with 20 years experience.        
	The sudden loss of faith came within minutes of Roys visit. Priyankas parents, who had refused to shift her to AMRI Hospitals yesterday despite the offer of free treatment as they were comfortable with RG Kar, signed a risk bond hours later and took her away citing medical negligence.

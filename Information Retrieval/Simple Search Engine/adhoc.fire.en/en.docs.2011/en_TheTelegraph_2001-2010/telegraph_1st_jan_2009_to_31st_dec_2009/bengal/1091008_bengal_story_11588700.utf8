                                                                                                               Quit amp; vanish act before vote
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Behrampore, Oct. 7: The CPM sabhadhipati of the Murshidabad zilla parishad, in which the Left has just one member more than the Congress, has resigned and another party member is missing.        
	Purnima Dass resignation came two days before a no-confidence vote that the Congress had sought.        
	I have resigned from my post and I will say nothing more right now, Das said while emerging from the office of Murshidabad district magistrate Ahmed Siddiqui after submitting the resignation.        
	The zilla parishad in Murshidabad is run by the Left Front. Of the 63 seats, the Left Front had won 32 and the Congress 31 in the panchayat polls last year.        
	The Congress members brought the no-confidence motion against the Left-run board on September 30. The election through secret ballot is scheduled for October 9.        
	Adhir Chowdhury, the Murshidabad Congress president and MP, said the Left had made the sabhadhipati resign with a purpose. The resignation is aimed at creating a legal complication on the day of the vote of no-confidence. But all our 31 members will be present on that day, he said.        
	The Left, though, is not so sure if all its members will be present. Nurul Islam of the CPM has been missing for a week, triggering doubts about his intentions. Islams family has not lodged a missing complaint either.        
	The district CPM leadership is tightlipped about the matter, but a leader said: We are surprised at how Nurul Islam has gone missing. We are trying to trace him.         
	District CPM secretary, Nripen Chowdhury refused comment. I will not say anything today. Whatever I have to say, I will say tomorrow, he said.        
	According to rules, if the sabhadhipati resigns, the deputy sabhadhipati takes charge and conducts affairs till the next elections.         
	District magistrate Siddiqui, asked if the no-confidence voting would happen, said: I will have to find out what the law says in this regard.

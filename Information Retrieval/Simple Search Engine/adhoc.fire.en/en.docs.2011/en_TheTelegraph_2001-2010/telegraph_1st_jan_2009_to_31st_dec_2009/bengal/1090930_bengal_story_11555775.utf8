The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Rift hint in Mahato quiz
                                                                                                               Rift hint in Mahato quiz
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Midnapore, Sept. 29: Chhatradhar Mahato has told his interrogators that he had been sidelined in the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities by hardliners who want Maoist involvement, police claimed.        
	Chhatradhar told us that when the tribal agitation started in November last year, he wanted it to be peaceful and independent. But gradually he lost his earlier grip on the movement as some of the hardliners wanted militant action with the Maoists. Inner squabbles started. So, it was the Maoists who gradually got a greater hold on the movement, a police officer said.        
	The police have also come to know that he was against indefinite strikes in the tribal belt as it inconvenienced common people.        
	The tribal leader, however, has not given the names of villagers providing shelter to Maoist leaders Kishanji and Bikash.        
	The police are also asking him about local youths in the tribal belt of West Midnapore, Bankura and Purulia who have received guerrilla training from the rebels. So far, we have not been able to get much information from him, the officer said.

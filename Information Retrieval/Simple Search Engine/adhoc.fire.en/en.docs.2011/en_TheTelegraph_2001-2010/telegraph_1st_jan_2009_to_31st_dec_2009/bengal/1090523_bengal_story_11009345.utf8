	Dhanekhali (Hooghly), May 22: When Mamata Banerjee stepped into 10 Janpath on Wednesday clutching a gift-wrapped sari, she was representing Bengal, the Trinamul Congress  and the Dhanekhali Union Tantshilpi Samabay Samiti.        
	The white sari with a green-and-black border she gifted Sonia Gandhi came from the weavers co-operative in Dhanekhali, a two-hour drive from her Harish Chatterjee Street house in Calcutta.        
	The wrinkled fingers that had woven the sari  one of the many that Mamata has been sourcing for the past three years from the co-operative  belonged to Ramratan Pal, 66.        
	I could never have imagined that a sari made by me would one day be gifted to Sonia Gandhi, said Pal, 66, peering from behind thick glasses.        
	The Dhanekhali, named after the place in Hooghly where it is woven, is a taant sari Mamata swears by.         
	According to sources, she buys around 50 to 60 such saris every year from the Dhanekhali co-operative, some to wear and many to gift.        
	Storekeeper Ajit Kumar Nandi checked the books of accounts and said she had purchased saris worth Rs 15,000 from the co-operative last year.         
	The last order was in early May, when on an election campaign Mamata placed an order for six saris, paid an advance and got them picked up later, added Banamali Guin, the chairman of the co-operative.        
	The speciality of the Mamata sari is that it is 18 inches longer than the usual 18 feet.         
	She likes to wear white or off-white saris with fine white or grey checks and a dark green and black border. The saris are longer because she prefers it that way, said Pal, in front of a rickety wooden shaft.        
	What can the Mamata sari do for the Dhanekhali? A lot, feels weaves expert Nandita Palchoudhuri. Dhanekhali is generally not very popular; whatever popularity it enjoys is because it is cheap with prices starting from Rs 200. But the Dhanekhali is now in the spotlight because of Mamata Banerjee. It will increase awareness about the sari and help get it noticed.        
	If Mamata will make it popular, Sonia can give it snob value. I think common people will now give more respect to the Dhanekhali. The fact that it was presented to Sonia Gandhi will create an exalted status for it. Other weaves will also benefit by association. And if the demand increases, it will improve the condition of the weavers.        
	That is something a weaver with greying hair and fading eyesight in Dhankehali could do with.         
	Pal earns about Rs 1,000 by weaving a dozen saris a month. He earns another Rs 500 from the government as old-age pension for poor weavers.        
	It takes about two days to weave a sari but we get Rs 82 per sari. We would request her (Mamata) to ensure we get paid better, said the man who drapes the Trinamul leader.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Another tide stalks Sunderbans 
                                                                                                               Another tide stalks Sunderbans

	Calcutta, June 4: The government is scurrying to counter the spring tide expected to lash the cyclone-hit Sunderbans this weekend but an expert has warned of higher tidal waves between June 22 and 25.         
	According to the Calcutta Port Trust (CPT), which keeps track of the tides in the Hooghly, the rise will be more severe between June 22 and 25 than this weekend as the moon will be closest to the earth at that time.         
	The moon will be in perigee position (closest to the earth) coinciding with the new moon (amavasya). The tidal rise may top 5.6m, at least 1m more than the average water level, said Captain A.K. Bagchi, director, marine department of the CPT.         
	This weekend, the moon will be in the apogee position (farthest from the earth) coinciding with the full moon (purnima) and so the tidal rise in Sagar Island is expected to be 5m, about 0.5m more than the average water level. But the rise in the water level in the creeks of the Sunderbans could be higher, Bagchi said.         
	Near Sagar Island, the river is wide, so the rise in the water level is lesser than in the Sunderbans, where the width is lesser. Here, the level could increase by another 0.2-0.3m, said Bagchi.         
	On May 25, over 900km of 3,500km embankment in the Sunderbans was swept away by Cyclone Aila. The embankments were damaged the most in Gosaba, Patharpratima, Hingalganj and Sandeshkhali.        
	The government today decided to procure 15 lakh gunny bags from a private company in the next 48 hours to repair the breached embankments but a senior block official in Gosaba said it was too late in the day. The water level has already started rising and it will be difficult to continue repair work after Friday afternoon, he said.         
	The chief minister held a meeting at Writers Buildings with ministers and officials to firm up a plan for the weekend. We are trying to provide people with shovels and spades so they can dig up soil to repair the embankments. A barge will be procured from the CPT to extract soil from under water. The army has begun moving into Gosaba and Patharpratima, said irrigation minister Subhas Naskar.         
	The government will press into service 71 boats, four of them from the army, and a coast guard hovercraft.

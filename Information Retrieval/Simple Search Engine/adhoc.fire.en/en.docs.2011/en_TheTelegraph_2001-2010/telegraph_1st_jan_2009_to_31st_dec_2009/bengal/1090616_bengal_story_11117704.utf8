                                                                                                               IIT student hangs in hostel

	June 15: A student of the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, was found dead in his hostel room this afternoon.        
	Police said Manoj Kumar, a first-year student of ocean engineering and naval architecture, had probably died at least three days ago but it went unnoticed because the hostels were deserted during the summer holidays.         
	Construction workers got some foul smell from Room No. 114 of the Madan Mohan Malviya hostel today and looked up through a skylight.         
	Kumar, a resident of Gangapur in Rajasthan, was found hanging in his room.         
	It appears that he committed suicide by hanging himself three to five days ago, said V.S. Neskumar, the Kharagpur subdivisional police officer.        
	IIT Kharagpur shuts down after the semester examinations in April and opens in June-end. Kumar, however, had not gone home for the vacation.         
	According to institute sources, Kumar was an average student who had failed to clear one of the semester papers. It is possible that he had stayed back because he had a backlog to clear but his department has not been able to confirm it, said U.P. Singh, the security officer of the institute.         
	Kumars performance could not be confirmed with the institutes academic authorities.        
	The labourers spotted his body around 12.45pm and got in touch with the hostel manager. The vacations are on and there are very few students in the hostel. So it is not surprising that no one noticed the body before, said Bijon Mukherjee, the manager of Madan Mohan Malviya Hall of Residence.        
	Kumars suicide is the se-cond in the institute in two months. On April 24, fourth-year student Ramananda Rao K. from Andhra Pradesh was found hanging in his room in the Nehru hostel.        
	The IIT authorities said Kumars parents had been informed and they were on their way to Kharagpur.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Durgapur, Aug. 31: Around 15 youths today barged into a school and assaulted a teacher who, they thought, had beaten up a Class V girl, now in hospital.         
	Teacher Satyaprakash Pandey was admitted to Asansol subdivisional hospital with pain in the chest and head.         
	Inquiries by police revealed that the youths had thought Pandey was to blame for Monika Helas hospitalisation yesterday.        
	The trouble started on Friday when Pandey, a geography teacher of the Asansol Municipal Corporation-run Hindi medium school, scolded and punished two girls for fighting in class.        
	Monika and her classmate had punched, kicked and slapped each other.         
	Pandey scolded them and slapped them for fighting.        
	After returning home, Monika complained of abdominal pain and started vomiting. She told her family that she had fought with a classmate but word somehow spread in the neighbourhood that Monika was beaten up by the teacher.         
	Monika was admitted to the Asansol subdivisional hospital yesterday. Youths from her slum barged into the school around 11am today and beat up Pandey.         
	The youths fled when other teachers and students chased them and managed to catch two of them. They were later handed over to the police.         
	Headmistress Tripti Bhattacharya said she had spoken to Monika and learnt that she had fallen ill after her classmate kicked her in the abdomen. Satyaprakash Pandey cant be held responsible for it. He only went to stop them, she said. Todays incident is very unfortunate and we have lodged a police complaint.        
	Monikas mother Usha Devi also admitted that her daughter was not severely beaten up by the teacher.         
	I dont know why the local youths created trouble in the school and beat up the teacher. The teacher is not at fault, she said.

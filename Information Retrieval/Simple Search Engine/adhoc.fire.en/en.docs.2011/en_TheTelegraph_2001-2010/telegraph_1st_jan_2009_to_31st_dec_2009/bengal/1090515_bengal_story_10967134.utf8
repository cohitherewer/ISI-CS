          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Behrampore, May 14: A man who was pronounced guilty of murder today drank pesticide in court minutes after the judgment.        
	Aftabuddin Sheikh, 47, was convicted by a Murshidabad court for murdering a woman four years ago. The sentencing was scheduled for tomorrow. The judge pronounced him guilty and told police to take away Aftabuddin, a resident of Farakka in Murshidabad.        
	As soon as we took him out of the courtroom, Aftabuddin took out a bottle of pesticide from his pocket and drank it. We took him to Jangipur sub-divisional hospital where he died, a police officer said.

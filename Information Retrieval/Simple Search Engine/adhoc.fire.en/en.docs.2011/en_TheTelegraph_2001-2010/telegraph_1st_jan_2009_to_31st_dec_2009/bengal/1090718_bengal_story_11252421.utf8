The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CPM backs local unit
                                                                                                               CPM backs local unit
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, July 17: The CPM state secretariat took stock of the Mangalkot situation this evening on the basis of a report from its Burdwan unit.         
	It decided to defend the district units claim that no party workers were involved in the attack but censured the Burdwan leadership saying the incident took place because of its complacency.        
	The district leaders should have deployed responsible cadres to ensure no trouble for the visiting Congress MLAs. They didnt do it as there was no plan to stop the Congress team like the party had to stop Trinamul leaders earlier, said a secretariat member.         
	This indicated a possible distinction between the Congress and Trinamul that the CPM made. But party leaders alleged that the Congress team was accompanied by some of those accused of killing popular CPM leader Falguni Mukherjee and that angered the villagers.

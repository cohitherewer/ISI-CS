The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Cadres in guerrilla gunfight 
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Cadres in guerrilla gunfight 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          A villager flees home after the encounter. (Samir Mondal)                                  
	Salboni, Dec. 16: CPM cadres engaged Maoists in a gun battle in Salboni last night and claimed to have killed a rebel, a rare fightback by the party whose leaders the guerrillas have targeted for months.        
	The exchange of fire, which sources said was spread over Kashidora, Narasinghpur, Adnasuli, Belkunda and Beoncha villages and continued in bursts through the night, forced many to flee the area over fears the skirmishes would continue.         
	Our men retaliated after many of our leaders were killed and offices burnt down (in the past few months). The rebels are trying to capture the panchayat offices in Kashidora and Beoncha. At least one Maoist was killed in last nights encounter and some of them were injured, a Salboni CPM leader said.        
	West Midnapore police chief Manoj Verma said the security forces had no reports of any Maoist casualty or injury. He appeared to be justifying the armed resistance when he added: The Maoists are trying to make inroads into places like Kashidora, Adnasuli and Beoncha. If the attacks (by the rebels) continue, the villagers are bound to retaliate.        
	A Salboni officer replaced Vermas villagers with local CPM men. He said: The Maoists have set their eyes on the panchayats. Thats why local CPM men mobilised support and struck back.

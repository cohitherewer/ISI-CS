The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Kangaroo court trial
                                                                                                               Kangaroo court trial
                            
	July 22: Two CPM leaders and five activists were made to squat holding their ears at Maoist kangaroo courts in Salboni and give undertakings that they would sever all links with the corrupt party.        
	At Kolshibhanga village, nine armed guerrillas went door to door with a list of 36 CPM men, but found only five. They were dragged to the peoples court, in a field outside the village, a resident said.         
	This morning, another group went to Gadra, only about 10km from Lalgarh, where they got two CPM members.

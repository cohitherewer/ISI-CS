	Gosaba, June 8: The state government, which has sought Rs 1,000 crore from Delhi as Aila relief, has pegged the losses at over Rs 470 crore in one Sunderban block alone.        
	The South 24-Parganas administration drew up the estimate of losses for Gosaba, the worst hit by the May 25 cyclone that cut a swathe of devastation across Bengal, but some officials said it was a rush job with the singular objective of justifying the demand before Delhi.        
	The figure of around Rs 473 crore is excluding the cost of procurement and distribution of relief materials, said block development officer Amiya Bhushan Chakraborty.         
	Sources told The Telegraph that Gosaba block officials went into a huddle with representatives of several departments  irrigation, public health engineering and agriculture  and prepared the list.         
	They were also the first in the state to try and tabulate the financial losses caused by Aila, though the effort may have raised questions.        
	It is clear the entire exercise was done in a hurry to justify the demand for Rs 1,000 crore from the Centre, said an official, adding the process could result in both under and overestimation of the losses.         
	There is nothing wrong in estimation but a rider should accompany the report. Otherwise, the district administration will lose out in case they find out later that the losses were much higher, he added.         
	According to the estimate, breach of embankments along the rivers is the single largest component  Rs 162.73 crore  on the list of losses.         
	The others include cost of ravaged houses (Rs 151.76 crore), damage to fisheries (Rs 75.9 crore) and losses suffered by agriculture (Rs 30.11 crore) because of flooding.         
	According to the 2001 census, there are 46,000 families in Gosaba block. Out of around 2.5 lakh people, over 65 per cent live below the poverty line.        
	There is little doubt that Gosaba is a backward area and it suffered huge losses because of Aila, but the estimation was not properly done, said another block official.         
	According to norms, the figure should have been arrived at with the help of reports from all the 14 panchayats in the block.         
	Sujit Howli, the pradhan of Chhotomullakhali, one of the worst-hit islands, said he could not provide a report on the damage. The entire village has to be rebuilt. this is too early to tabulate losses, he said, standing outside the Gosaba block office, where he had come to ask for relief money.        
	Sources in the block office revealed that most of the panchayat pradhans had not filed any report. People in the block office did some back-of-the-envelope calculation and arrived at the estimate of financial losses, said the official.        
	BDO Chakraborty said the earlier the money arrived the better.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CM case for coal balance
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      CM case for coal balance
                            
	Raniganj, Dec. 20: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today said he would take up with Delhi the problems the state was facing over Coal Indias objections to new factories in the Asansol-Raniganj belt because of coal reserves and stressed the need to strike a balance.        
	Coal Indias objections to proposed factories on the plea that there is a huge coal reserve here is a matter of concern. A way out has to be evolved. The state government cant stop setting up industries in the Asansol-Raniganj belt simply because of its objections, the chief minister told a rally.        
	Coal and industry have to co-exist, he said. Something has to be worked out so factories can be set up despite the existence of coal reserves.         
	Two projects involving a total investment of over Rs 40,000 crore are in trouble because they are likely to make an estimated 200 million tonnes of coal inaccessible.

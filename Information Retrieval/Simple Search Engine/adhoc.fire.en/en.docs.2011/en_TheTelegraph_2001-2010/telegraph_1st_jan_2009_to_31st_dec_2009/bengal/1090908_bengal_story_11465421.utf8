The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Flood scare in south Bengal after dam discharge
                                                                                                               Flood scare in south Bengal after dam discharge
                            
	Sept. 7: Vast stretches of Howrah, Hooghly, the two Midnapores and Burdwan could go under water tomorrow as the DVC released 2.5 lakh cusecs today following heavy rain in Jharkhand and parts of Bengal.        
	Water is flowing above the danger level in the Kangshabati, Shilabati, Gandheswari and Damodar. In southern Bank-ura, villages in Ranibandh, Khatra and Mukutmanipur were waterlogged as the Kangshabati spilled its banks. The Damodar has already flooded villages in Burdwans Borjora and Mejia blocks.         
	After the heavy discharge from Maithon and Panchet, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee wrote to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, urging him to instruct DVC to control the release because of the flood-like situation in the five districts. The chief minister has requested the Prime Minister to ensure that the water is released in phases to avoid a flood, said finance minister Asim Dasgupta.

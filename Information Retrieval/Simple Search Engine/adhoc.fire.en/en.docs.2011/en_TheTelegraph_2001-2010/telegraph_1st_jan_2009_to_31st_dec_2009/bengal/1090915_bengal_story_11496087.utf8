The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Plan to call IIM to check dropouts
                                                                                                               Plan to call IIM to check dropouts
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 14: The Bengal government will take the help of the Indian Statistical Institute (ISI) and the Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta, to stem the dropout rate in state-run schools.        
	In our state, the enrolment rate is 99 per cent in Class I but goes down to 48 per cent in Class IX. The national average is 52 per cent, school education secretary Bikram Sen said today after a meeting to review the progress of the Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan in the state.         
	The scheme, 75 per cent funded by the Centre and 25 by the state, has the target of achieving 100 per cent enrolment in Class IX-X by 2017-18, but its progress has been hobbled by the high dropout rates.        
	The enrolment rate is the percentage of the population from that age group in schools.        
	The primary task of the ISI and the IIM will be to ana- lyse the reasons for low attendance and high rate of dropouts, Sen said.         
	The dropout rates, he added are high despite the mid-day meal scheme at the primary level.         
	The move to approach the institutes comes at a time Bengal has pushed back by five years the target in the primary education scheme, the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan.        
	This scheme, which also gets central funding, aims to put every child between six and 14 in school by 2010. Our government realised late last year that the target cant be met by 2010. So, we decided to make 2015 the revised deadline, an education department official said.        
	To achieve better results in the Madhyamik Shiksha scheme, todays meeting decided to set up two secondary schools in each of the states 18 districts barring Calcutta at a cost of Rs 190 crore. The Centre will bear 75 per cent of the expense.         
	At present, there are only 42 state-run secondary schools across Bengal.         
	A source in the education department said the new institutions were being set up because the central funds would be released only for state-run schools. The only way to access the money is to increase the number of such institutions, the source said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Power bill to burn hole in pocket
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Power bill to burn hole in pocket
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Calcutta, Nov. 27: Your electricity bill will go up by 12 to 22 per cent from this month depending on whether you are a CESC customer or that of the state-run power utility.         
	The regulatory authority has raised CESC tariff by 48 paise a unit and West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company Ltds by 78 paise a unit.        
	The various power producers and distributors in the state had proposed a hike in tariff as their fuel and power purchase costs had increased. As an interim measure, the West Bengal Electricity Regulatory Commission has increased the tariff, said S.C. Dutt, the commissions joint adviser (finance).         
	According to Dutt, the increased tariff will come into effect from November and will continue till the regulator comes out with its order for 2010-11 next year.        
	This July, when the commission announced its order for 2009-10, it had increased the tariff for state board consumers by a little over 4 per cent, from Rs 3.35 a unit to Rs 3.49.         
	CESC customers saw their rates go up by 4.87 per cent, from Rs 3.90 a unit in 2008-09 to Rs 4.09 a unit.        
	After the latest hike, the average tariff for state board consumers will be Rs 4.27 a unit and that for CESC customers Rs 4.57 a unit.        
	The reason being cited for the hike is the rise in coal prices. Coal India, the largest supplier of coal to the power companies, increased its rate by 11 per cent on an average. It had last revised coal prices in 2007.        
	According to a senior Coal India official, the coal price hike was unavoidable because the public sector company had had to increase wages and salaries by 15 per cent with retrospective effect from 2006. The new salaries would cost the company an additional Rs 4,000 crore, he said.         
	The increase in coal prices will help the central government company negate the additional burden for the salary hike. Our additional revenue from the coal price hike will be between Rs 4,200 and Rs 4,500 crore, the Coal India official said.        
	The state-run power utility is likely to earn an additional Rs 430 crore because of the power tariff hike. The CESC revenue is estimated to go up by around Rs 110 crore.        
	The commission was late in coming up with its order apparently as it had to do a lot of number crunching because of the complex mix of sources and grades of coal used by the power producers. Coal India has a separate fuel supply pact with each power utility.        
	According to Dutt, the regulator will examine the final impact of the coal price on the utilities next year when they submit their annual performance report and the fuel price and power purchase agreement.         
	If the current tariff hike is deemed excessive, the utilities will be asked to refund money to the customers.         
	CESC had had to refund money to customers in 2008-09.

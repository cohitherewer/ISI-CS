The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Flurry of Cong calls to calm Mamata
                                                                                                               Flurry of Cong calls to calm Mamata
          BARUN GHOSH                           Comforting hand: Pranab Mukherjee with Mamata Banerjee after the Congress-Trinamul pact was finalised on March 3                                  
	Calcutta, May 6: Congress leaders called up Mamata Banerjee today to clear her misgivings and keep the precious alliance intact following a perception that Rahul Gandhis comments on the Left yesterday had ruffled the Trinamul Congress leader.        
	Hours before Mamata was to fly to North 24-Parganas Basirhat on a Congress-sponsored helicopter, the party general secretary in charge of Bengal told her what Rahul said was in tune with the party line but there was no scope for misunderstanding.        
	I told Mamataji that what Rahulji said was in tune with the party line. (But) Rahulji did not categorically say the Congress would take Left support to form the government. So there is no scope for her misunderstanding. I told her that the Congress would form the government on its own after the polls and our pre-poll alliance with her would remain intact, K. Keshava Rao told The Telegraph.         
	Bengal Congress president Pranab Mukherjee, too, spoke to Mamata from his constituency Jangipur  which goes to the polls tomorrow  and assured her that taking CPM support was a premature proposition.         
	Rahul told a news conference yesterday that he was confident the Left would support a Congress-led government and Manmohan Singh as Prime Minister after the polls.        
	Sources said Trinamul found the timing of the statement disconcerting as the bulk of seats in Bengal, where the Left is the sworn enemy of the alliance, was still to go to the polls.        
	The Trinamul Congress chief apparently told her aides last night that she might have to rethink the pact with the Congress.         
	The phone calls today appeared to have assuaged her. A Trinamul leader quoted Mamata as saying before taking the copter: Pranabda called me to say taking CPM support to form a government at the Centre was too premature a proposition.         
	Mamata has maintained that she is opposed to the CPM backing the Congress. Her stand has been that she will not oppose or distance herself from the Congress if the other Left parties support it.        
	Observers said the Congresss drive to keep Mamata in good humour was imperative to take the alliance forward to the 2011 Assembly elections.         
	Trinamul youth president and MLA Madan Mitra said: There is no denying that Rahuljis statements had created some misgivings among our workers.         
	Rahuls rally in support of Trinamuls Barrackpore candidate Dinesh Trivedi on May 8 has been cancelled.         
	Trinamul general secretary Mukul Roy said Rahul was running short of time on that day but he might come anytime before campaigning for the May 13 polls closes at 5pm on May 11.        
	Buddha barb        
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said the Congress had deputed Rahul to woo the Left realising that its own boat was sinking.

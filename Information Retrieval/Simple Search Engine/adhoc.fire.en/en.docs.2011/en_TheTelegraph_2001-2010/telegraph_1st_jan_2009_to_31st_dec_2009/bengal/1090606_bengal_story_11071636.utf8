          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Tamluk, June 5: Yesterdays suicide by an East Midnapore farmer who couldnt sell a part of his plot to marry off his daughter because of a government embargo is snowballing into a larger land row.        
	Villagers in Tamluks Kulberia, where Samir Parui hanged himself, and Srikrishnapur today gave the district ma- gistrate three days to lift the freeze on 5,000 acres, imposed in 2004 to help the government acquire land for its offices.        
	Backed by local Trinamul Congress leaders, they threatened to gherao the land registry office in Tamluk town from Tuesday and block all transactions.         
	The government has acquired 89 acres and the takeover of 21 acres is stuck because the landowners are not happy with Rs 72,000 a cottah offered for plots along a highway. They want Rs 1 lakh. However, there is no word from the government on what it wants to do with the remaining 4,890 acres.         
	District officials declined comment.        
	Debkumar Kuila is desperate to sell a part of his fathers five bighas so he could be treated well for a cerebral attack. The suicide has been an eye-opener, Debkumar, 23, said.         
	Samir had wanted to sell a part of his one-bigha (20 cottah) plot.

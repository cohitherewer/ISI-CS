The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Lalgarh poll boycott threat
                                                                                                               Lalgarh poll boycott threat
          OUR BUREAU                              
	March 25: The tribal resistance group in restive Lalgarh today threatened to boycott the elections if police forced their way into the villages.        
	We have repeatedly said we wont allow security forces (for poll duty) in Lalgarh. But if the police or any other force make their way in and we fail to resist them, we will boycott the elections, said Chhatradhar Mahato of the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities.        
	The committee will hold a meeting on Friday to take a final decision on a plan to deploy forces for the elections, revealed to its leaders by the district administration yesterday.        
	We will hold a meeting on the administrations proposal. But we have already taken a decision not to allow the police inside Lalgarh at any cost, said Lalmohan Tudu, the president of the committee.         
	The committee had pledged to keep the police out last December after its demand for the apology of the West Midnapore superintendent for alleged atrocities committed by his force while searching for suspected Maoists were turned down.         
	Asked whether police ac- tion had resumed in Lalgarh, home secretary Ardhendu Sen said: The process of isolating the Maoists from villagers has already started. The task is difficult as the Maoists have strongholds in many villages.        
	Chief electoral officer De-bashis Sen declined comment. We are keeping a watch on the situation, he said.        
	A team of senior police officers led by inspector-general (western range) Kuldiep Singh today made an aerial survey of Lalgarh and neighbouring Belpahari.        
	We made the survey to work out the deployment of forces before the polls. We also wanted to assess the terrain and decide on the roads to be taken by the security forces, an officer said.        
	West Midnapore police chief Manoj Verma said the chopper survey, being carried out in the Maoist belt of West Midnapore, Purulia and Bankura, had revealed a shed made of hay and barricades made by piling stones, which looked like a guerrilla training camp from above.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Boycott for keeping son-in-law at home
                                                                                                               Boycott for keeping son-in-law at home
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bolpur, Feb. 15: Residents of a tribal village in Birbhums Rampurhat have ostracised a family for keeping the son-in-law in their house.        
	A village meeting earlier this month decided to punish Shib Tudu, a local CPM leader, for flouting tribal customs.        
	Shibs daughter Fulmoni, 19, and her son-in-law Moshey Mardi, 23, had been living in his house since their marriage six months ago despite some villagers opposition.         
	Things came to a flashpoint last month after one of Mosheys aunts taunted Fulmoni for staying with her parents after marriage and she hit back with a volley.        
	The elders of Kirtipur, about 290km from Calcutta, held a kangaroo court trial on February 3. The meeting decided to boycott Shibs family as well as Mosheys parents, Paul and Dhunia Mardi.         
	No one at Kirtipur is talking to them and the lone village grocer is not selling his stuff to the two families. They are also not being allowed to fetch water from any village tubewell. The boycott has been in effect from the evening of February 3.        
	Most villagers have stopped talking to us or visiting our house. We are buying essentials from Rampurhat town, about 18km away, said Shib, a former CPM panchayat member.        
	Som Hembram, who chaired the shalishi meeting, said: Fulmonis husband has been staying as a ghar jamai. It goes against tribal custom. She should also not have talked back to her in-law when she was criticised for doing something unacceptable.        
	Eight villagers continued to talk to them and supply drinking water. The others did not take that too kindly.         
	They were identified and fined Rs 200 each yesterday. These eight were not following the decision of the shalishi. So, we went to their houses and told them about the fine, said Hitu Mardi, 40, another tribal leader.        
	When Shib Tudu learnt about the fine, he went to Rampurhat police station.        
	A police team led by the Rampurhat inspector-in-charge went to the village, about 300km from Calcutta, and spoke to the tribal leaders, but they stuck to their point.        
	We told the police the boycott had been imposed because they broke tribal customs and we could do nothing about it, said Hitu.        
	Block development officer Shantiram Gorai, who went to the Kirtipur, said efforts to convince the villagers had failed. Ill submit a report to my boss and and wait for further orders, the BDO said.

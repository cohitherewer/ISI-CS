The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Governor turns lead singer in Assembly
                                                                                                               Governor turns lead singer in Assembly
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Gopalkrishna Gandhi asks MLAs to join him in singing the national anthem. (Bishwarup Dutta)                                  
	Calcutta, March 9: Speech in hand, the governor waited on the podium for the national anthem to play. It didnt. But Gopalkrishna Gandhi took it in his stride, motioned with his hands to the MLAs to join him and broke into Jana Gana Mana in the Assembly.         
	Veterans could recall neither another instance of such a snag nor a similar performance, when the governor led a chorus of ministers, MLAs, officials and outsiders.        
	On the opening day of the budget session, Gandhi walked in at 2.58pm with Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim leading him and a marshal carrying the mace. Members stood up to acknowledge the arrival but the tune traditionally played in the House was missing.         
	D.L. Roys Dhana Dhanye Pushpe Bhara greets the gov- ernor to the House. The national anthem and the opening speech follow.        
	Everyone stood still today. Then Gandhi broke the silence. I request all of you to sing the national anthem with me. Lets start, he said, signalling the start with his raised hands.        
	The Opposition members were the more enthusiastic singers. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, industries minister Nirupam Sen, health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra and sports minister Subhas Chakraborty preferred to play listener. But PWD minister Kshiti Goswamis energy almost made up for their abstinence.         
	I liked the manner in which the honourable governor started it off, Goswami said.        
	Asked about the goof-up, Speaker Halim said: I am told there was a technical problem with the music system. I have asked the Assembly secretary to inquire into this unfortunate incident.        
	After finishing his 19-page speech at 3.45pm, Gandhi said: Let all of us sing the national anthem again. His was the lead voice.        
	Our governor sang pretty well. He has a sense of music, said the Trinamul Congresss Sonali Guha, a singer herself.        
	There was music, though, as the governor left the House. A police band waiting outside played Saare Jahaan Se Achchha, according to custom.        
	An official said: The last one went well today because it was a live performance.        
	Asked whether a dry run had been held to ensure there were no glitches, an official said: Twice last week. Everything was OK. There was a check today as well, but something probably went wrong with the connections.

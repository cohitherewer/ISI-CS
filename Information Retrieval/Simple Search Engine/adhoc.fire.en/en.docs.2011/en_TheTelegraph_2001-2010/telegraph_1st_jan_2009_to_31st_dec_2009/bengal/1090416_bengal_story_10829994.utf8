The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Pro-poll pressure on Lalgarh leaders
                                                                                                               Pro-poll pressure on Lalgarh leaders

	April 15: The Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities may be against the entry of any police for the polls in Lalgarh but its leader today admitted that a significant section of the people there wanted to vote under the supervision of central forces.        
	At the committees meeting yesterday, the majority of the members were against the entry of the police, Chhatradhar Mahato said. But despite this, we did not adopt a resolution upholding it (the bar on the security forces) because a lot of people here, who are not members of the committee, want the polls to be held, even if it means allowing the police into Lalgarh.        
	The committee had yesterday decided to hold a more representative meeting, consisting of 118 members from across the tribal belt, on Saturday to take a final call.        
	The state government and the Election Commission have ruled out polls in Lalgarh without the police.        
	Mahato said many ordinary people, mostly supporters of the two factions of the Jharkhand Party  Aditya and Naren  did not want to be denied their right to vote. Besides, about 40 per cent of the people of Lalgarh are non-tribals and they want the elections. We have to take their views into consideration.         
	West Midnapore officials believe that Maoists suspected to be guiding the tribal movement against the police are bent on blocking the polls and are pressuring the committee to take a hard line by not allowing the police in at any cost.        
	In Calcutta, Sujato Bhadra, secretary of the Association for Protection of Democratic Rights, said he had advised the committee to agree to the poll panels proposal to hold the elections in the presence of central forces drawn from outside the state.         
	Bhadra was with Mahato when the committee leader met chief electoral officer Debashis Sen on Sunday.        
	Talking to Mahato on Monday, Bhadra had said the committee should not create a situation that could obstruct the polls as that would rob it of the civil societys support. I told him (Mahato) the poll panels suggestion was good and he should consider it with reason and not emotion. The elections should be held. If he decides against the conduct of the elections in the presence of forces from other states, the civil society will form an opinion against their movement. Nobody wants subversion of democratic institutions.         
	However, Mahatos hands may be tied by the Maoist guerrillas. I cannot take any decision on my own, he said when asked about Bhadras suggestion.

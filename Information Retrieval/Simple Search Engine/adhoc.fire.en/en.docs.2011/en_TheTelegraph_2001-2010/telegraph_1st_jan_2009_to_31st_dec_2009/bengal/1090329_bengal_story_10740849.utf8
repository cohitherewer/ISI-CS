                                                                                                               Naser fate in Sonia hands
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Malda, March 28: Abu Naser Khan Chowdhury, camping in Delhi to persuade the Congress brass to nominate him from Malda North instead of his niece Mausam Noor, was today told that only Sonia Gandhi could do something about it.        
	I produced the documents (to prove he was not a Swiss citizen) before (general secretary K. Keshava) Rao, but he told me it was too late and he could do nothing about it, Abu Naser said from Delhi. He (Rao) told me only Sonia Gandhi can change things if she wants to.        
	Abu Naser, whose brother is contesting from Malda South, said: I told Rao all party workers and leaders in Malda North want me. If anyone else contests, the CPM will benefit. I want to meet Soniaji.         
	However, Rao, in charge of the partys Bengal affairs, told a news conference the decision to field Mausam was final.        
	In Malda, Mausams other uncle, district Congress president Abu Hashem, stayed away from her campaign and said he hoped the high command would reconsider its decision.

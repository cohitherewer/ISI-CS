The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CPM duo in power theft
                                                                                                               CPM duo in power theft
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Burdwan, May 29: Two sons of a late CPM minister tampered the meter at their ice cream factory and paid just a fifth of the Rs 15,000 power bill every month for almost a decade.        
	Former animal husbandry minister Mehboob Zahedis sons Masood, a CPM zonal committee member and a Guskara councillor, and Mansoor are absconding. West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd officials said the duo owed them at least Rs 7 lakh.         
	Subhas Mete, the supervisor of the factory in Burdwans Ausgram, has been arrested.        
	The average should have been Rs 15,000-16,000 a month. But the bill came to Rs 3,000-3,500. They have been paying such low amounts for nine years, said an official of the state power company.        
	CPM leaders in Guskara claimed that the owners were not aware of any power theft as they had leased out the factory to the supervisor.         
	The incident has nothing to do with politics. The Zahedi brothers had given the factory on lease to the supervisor. So they cant be accused of the crime, said Achintya Majumdar, secretary of the partys Guskara zonal committee.        
	The police, however, said records showed the brothers were the joint owners of the factory. We have charged Masood, Mansoor and the supervisor with power theft, said Samar Pandey, the inspector in charge of Ausgram, about 160km from Calcutta.

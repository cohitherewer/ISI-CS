                                                                                                               BDO held hostage in airport city protest 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Durgapur, Jan. 28: Farmers led by Trinamul Congress and Naxalite leaders held a block development officer hostage for three hours today, demanding direct talks with the promoters of the airport city project in Andal and a higher compensation.         
	Around 2,000 farmers had assembled outside BDO Mohua Dass office demanding, among other things, Rs 500 a month as pension for farm labourers who would lose work following the land acquisition.        
	We had filed our objections to the notification on acquisition of our land at the collectorate in Burdwan and submitted a copy of our demands to the district magistrate. But they didnt show any interest in talking to us. So we gheraoed the BDO. If the administration doesnt heed our demands, we will gherao the subdivisional officer and the district magistrate, said Raju Roy, a Trinamul panchayat member in Andal.         
	District magistrate Manish Jain rubbished the demands. The compensation has been finalised at all-party meetings and will not be changed. We held 19 all-party meetings for a consensus, but Trinamul leaders did not attend them.        
	Around 3,500 acres are needed in Andal and Faridpur blocks for the project. In all, 929 villagers of the 19,000 whose land is to be taken have filed objections.         
	We dont want the project to be shifted, but that doesnt mean the CPM will fix the plot prices, said the CPI(ML)s Somnath Chatterjee.

	Haldia, Dec. 8: A Citu office outside the Mitsubishi plant in Haldia was ransacked today by alleged Trinamul supporters. Police said the attack followed a scuffle between two groups of workers. A Trinamul union had forced a days shutdown on the factory yesterday seeking wage hikes and permanent jobs.    
	Other side of coin: At the Hindustan Engine- ering Industry plant in Dankuni, Hooghly, the management suspended work allegedly because of Citus strong-arm tactics. The management of the unit that produces railway wagon chassis blamed Citu for the air of insecurity since it stalled work on Sunday.        
	Midnapore: As many as 40 students were taken ill after having locally-made chips on the way to school in Kharagpur. They complained of stomach ache and started vomiting in class. Thirty of them have been admitted to hospital. The rest were released.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Maoists deny triple murders
                                                                                                               Maoists deny triple murders
                            
	Midnapore, Aug. 7: Maoists have claimed that they had no hand in the murder of three Jharkhand Party (Naren) activists in Binpur on Wednesday night but neither police nor the party is buying that.        
	The police said the Maoists realised after killing the trio that the fallout could be far-reaching. In Binpur, the JKP (N) has quite a following among the tribals and the local MLA is from that party. So the murder of three young tribals would raise doubts among the people about the Maoists intentions. And they know they cant carry on without local support, a police officer said.         
	A Maoist statement issued late last night said: We have not killed the three... It is the handiwork of the CPM, which is keen to sour our relations.        
	However, a JKP (N) leader suggested the relations had already soured. We did not support the (Maoist-backed) Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities, he said. The Maoists had asked us not to fight the Lok Sabha polls but we did. Now, if its known that they killed our men, the banned outfit will face the music.        
	About 5km from Lalgarh, a group of armed Maoists led by Bikash held a rally tonight and told villagers not to be scared of them.

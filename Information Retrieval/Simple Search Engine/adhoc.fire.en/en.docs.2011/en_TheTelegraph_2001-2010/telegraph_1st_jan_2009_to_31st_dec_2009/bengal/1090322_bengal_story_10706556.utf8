	Calcutta, March 21: Christian missionary schools have told the national minority education panel that state officials are depriving them from exercising their special powers under the Constitution.         
	In a complaint lodged with the National Council of Minority Educational Institutions today, the schools said education department officials were forcing missionary primary schools to recruit teachers through the district primary councils. Only state-aided non-minority institutions are supposed to hire teachers through the state councils.         
	The panel has asked the schools to file individual complaints.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Minister cries foul over pond
                                                                                                               Minister cries foul over pond
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 12: On the instructions of fisheries minister Kiranmoy Nanda, his department has filed a police complaint against the alleged filling up of a part of an east Calcutta water body for an educational foundation.        
	According to the minister, the 120-acre water body is under his department and had been handed over to it by the urban development department in 1988. Nanda has alleged that of the 120 acres in the Magurdaha area of Tiljala (near Ruby Hospital), the South-24 Parganas administration had given away 15 acres to the Mani Bhaumik Educational Foundation four years ago.         
	However, district magistrate Khalil Ahmed contested the claim, saying the land given to the foundation fell outside the 120 acres. It does not form part of the water body, Ahmed said. It is jungle land that belongs to the land and land reforms department. Due permission had been taken from the department concerned before handing over the land.         
	After a meeting with his officials today, the fisheries minister said: The urban development department gave us the land for use as a fishing area, 120 fishermen have formed co-operatives and have been fishing there for 20 years. It has now come to our notice that the South 24-Parganas DM has given 15 acres from that big pond to this foundation.        
	Asked whether the police complaint amounted to bringing the district magistrate to book, Nanda said: The complaint has been lodged against those filling up water bodies. If the DMs complicity is found, the police will have to take action against him. A senior police officer said an official of the education foundation had been named in the complaint.        
	These 120 acres belong to us. If any change of use was contemplated by the DM, his responsibility was to appro- ach our department, get the permission to fill a water body and create a water body of similar size, the minister said.

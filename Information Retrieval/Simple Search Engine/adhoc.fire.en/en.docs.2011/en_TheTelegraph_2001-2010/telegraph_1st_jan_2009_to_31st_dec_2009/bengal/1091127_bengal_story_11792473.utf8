                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Test to hire 56000 teachers
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 26: Calcutta High Court today passed an interim order stalling appointment of primary school teachers but allowed the state government to conduct an examination on November 29 to fill around 56,000 primary school posts.        
	The courts decision came in the face of hundreds of petitions by candidates challenging the recruitment process.        
	Some of the teachers who petitioned are from primary teachers training institutes in the state.        
	The PTTI candidates said that in 2006, the government had issued a notification stating that those holding certificates from these institutes would get 22 grace marks in the recruitment test.         
	The PTTI students pointed out that the government had not cancelled the 2006 notification but issued a fresh one seeking job applications that did not give preference to PTTI certificate holders. This made the second notification invalid, they contended.        
	Another set of petitions came from primary teacher aspirants who had cleared the test in 2006 but had not yet got appointment.        
	Today, the court asked district primary school councils, which conduct the recruitment, to file affidavits stating what steps had been taken to appoint those who had cleared the test in 2006.        
	In the same order, the judge allowed the recruitment examination to be held on November 29 this year. But the appointment of teachers will be made on the basis of the verdict of the court, he said.

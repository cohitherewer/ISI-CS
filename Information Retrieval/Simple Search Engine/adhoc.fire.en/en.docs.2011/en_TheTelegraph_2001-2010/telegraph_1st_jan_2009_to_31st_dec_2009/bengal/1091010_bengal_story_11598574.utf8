          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 9: The Congress-Trinamul Congress alliance has hit a hurdle over Mamata Banerjees demand for the Kalchini seat in Jalpaiguri for the November 7 bypolls.        
	The Trinamul chief is said to have cited the Siliguri Municipal Corporation election success in north Bengal, a Congress bastion, to stake claim to Kalchini.         
	We want the Congress to part with the Kalchini seat along with Rajgunj in Jalpaiguri. Mamatadi has given us a go-ahead to contest both the seats, said Gautam Deb, the partys leader in the Siliguri Municipal Corporation, in which the Congress bagged the mayors post with Left support.         
	The Congress is not ready to give up Kalchini.

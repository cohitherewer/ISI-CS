The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Sunday of roadblocks
                                                                                                               Sunday of roadblocks
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Calcutta, Feb. 7: City residents would be wise to avoid the EM Bypass, its Park Circus connector and central Calcutta tomorrow unless the book fair, Lexpo or the Left rally at the Brigade grounds is on their mind.        
	The cumulative effect of the three events could tell heavily on traffic movement tomorrow.        
	The Left Front rally at the Brigade Parade grounds begins at noon but buses bringing in around 2 lakh supporters would clog the area in central Calcutta from morning.         
	Vehicle movement on the arterial Jawaharlal Nehru Road is bound to suffer, though there would be lighter traffic on a Sunday morning.         
	Tomorrow is also the last day of the book fair, being held on the Milan Mela grounds opposite Science City. Around 75,000 book lovers are expected to throng the venue.        
	Lexpo, the leather goods fair, too is being held nearby at the Salt Lake Stadium on the EM Bypass. The crowd here could swell to around 12,000.        
	We have told traffic police officers to ensure that vehicles heading for the EM Bypass from the Hudco intersection be diverted towards Central Avenue, a senior police officer overseeing traffic arrangements tomorrow said. We would urge drivers to stay away from the bypass and the Park Circus connector though arrangements have been made to ensure there is no major traffic snarl.         
	Today, the police worked on the deployment of men near the Park Circus seven-point crossing, the AJC Bose Road flyover and Syed Amir Ali Avenue. We want to keep these areas as free as possible so that vehicles entering and leaving the city do not face obstruction, said K. Hari Rajan, additional commissioner of police. For those heading to the airport, we suggest you leave early and take the Chingrihata flyover.         
	All officers on rally duty have been told that no vehicle should be allowed parking on Red Road, Outram Road, Kidderpore Road, Casurina Avenue, Hospital Road and AJC Bose Road, following a high court order. Around 4,000 policemen will be deployed to regulate rally-time traffic.

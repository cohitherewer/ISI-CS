The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | One Sonia rally, claimants two
                                                                                                               One Sonia rally, claimants two
          OUR CORRESPONDENT              FAMILY SOAP                        Abu Hashem, Sonia Gandhi and Mausam Noor                                 
	Malda, April 15: The Khan Chowdhurys of Malda are again locked in a war within the family, with Sonia Gandhi saying she will address only one public rally in Malda on April 27.         
	Where will it be? Mausam Noors Malda North or uncle Abu Hashems South?        
	Both Mausam and Hashem, who has brother Naser by his side, are said to be lobbying the Congress brass to get Sonia to their area.        
	The relations between the uncles and their young niece have been cold since she pipped Naser to the post in the race for the Malda North ticket.        
	Congress sources indicated today that the party president was in favour of a rally in Mausams constituency.         
	The partys district unit, which had backed Naser earlier, wants the election meeting to be held at a neutral place like Malda town, parts of which are in North and South.        
	Sources close to Mausam said she had requested Congress leaders in Delhi to persuade Sonia to campaign at Gaj-ole, 35km from the town and known to be the heart of her constituency.         
	The meeting, they added, could also be held at Samsi or Ratua, about 45km from Malda town.        
	Mausam was Sonias choice for the Malda North seat. So it is only natural that the Congress president would like to hold the meeting in her constituency, a Mausam aide said. And all the more so because of the manner in which she has been cold-shouldered by her two uncles. The high command has told us that Sonia wants to drive home the point that she is with Mausam.        
	Mausam refused to get drawn into fresh controversy, but only said: I am confident that Sonia Gandhi will hold the meeting in my constituency. I am also trying to get Rahul Gandhi in Malda North.        
	The uncles had earlier accused Mausam, elected MLA from Sujapur earlier this year, of keeping them in the dark about her Lok Sabha aspirations.        
	Sources in the district Congress said the venue of Sonias meeting would be finalised on Sunday, when Pranab Mukherjee is expected to be in Malda. The area goes to the polls on April 30.        
	Sources said Hashem was still hopeful of getting Sonias helicopter to touch down on his constituency, but all that he would say is: Let us wait and see.         
	On some prodding, he added: Let the party brass take a final call, but I have heard that Sonia Gandhi is in favour of holding the meeting in Malda South.         
	However, he wouldnt mind a neutral venue.        
	In 2004, Sonia had addressed a rally at Samsi. But in the last Lok Sabha polls, the area was part of Priya Ranjan Das Munshis Raiganj constituency. After delimitation this year, Samsi is part of Malda North.        
	Party sources said Mausam had told her uncle not to insist on Sonia campaigning in his Malda South constituency as it was a safe seat for the Congress.         
	The North seat is new and untested. A district Congress leader said: Mausam has told Hashem that she needs Sonia more than he does.

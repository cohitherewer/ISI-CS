	Behrampore, June 7: A 15-year-old boy was slapped to death here last night because he sold a bunch of tuberose at a Rs-2 discount in the absence of the florist he worked for. Somnath Haldar, who fainted while being hit repeatedly, did not regain senses.        
	Tamluk: CPM cadres fought police on Sunday after torching houses of Trinamul supporters in Panskura, East Midna- pore. Both parties had called a bandh in the area during the day protesting violence.

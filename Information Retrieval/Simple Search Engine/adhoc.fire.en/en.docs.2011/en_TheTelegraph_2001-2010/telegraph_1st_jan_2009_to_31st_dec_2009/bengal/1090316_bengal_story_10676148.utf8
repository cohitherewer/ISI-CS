The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Steel plants Citu hands on strike 
                                                                                                               Steel plants Citu hands on strike 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Durgapur, March 15: Citu supporters who work under contractors in Durgapur Steel Plant will go on strike from Monday to protest the authorities decision to bar the general secretary of their union from entering the plant.        
	DSP had asked Laltu Sengupta to surrender his entry permit. The union leader was accused of instigating workers to thrash five plant executives, including a deputy general manager, during a demonstration over recruitment of labourers on Friday.        
	The district Citu leadership has condemned such hooliganism, though Laltu insists that the officers were not beaten up.        
	Today, Laltu said the union had not announced a strike officially. But the workers have decided to stay away from work on their own. Work at the plant will collapse, but what can I do? he asked.         
	The plant has about 5,000 hands employed by contractors and all of them support the CPMs labour arm.        
	The management said the strike would not have any impact on production because of 12,500 permanent employees and around 1,700 officers.        
	Workers under contract-ors bind finished rods, remove slag at the blast furnace, prepare ladle and pour molten iron into them, among other things, said an officer. He added that work would be affected if the strike went on. Others can do their job, but only for a few days.        
	All officers have been told to report for work by 7.30am tomorrow.

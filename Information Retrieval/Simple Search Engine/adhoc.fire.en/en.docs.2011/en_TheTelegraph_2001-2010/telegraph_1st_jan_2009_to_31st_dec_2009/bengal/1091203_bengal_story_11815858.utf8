The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | 1-1 with Mamata, feels CPM
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      1-1 with Mamata, feels CPM
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 2: The CPM is happy that the central team has left without visiting any of the areas the Trinamul Congress wanted it to.        
	According to CPM leaders, if Mamata Banerjee had scored a point in the first round compelling Union home minister P. Chidambaram to send the team, the Left outsmarted her in the second by keeping the teams visit confined to Writers.         
	Admitting that the state government and the party were not sure about the exact brief for the central team, the CPM leaders said they had decided to oppose any visit without Writers concurrence and selective tours to areas where Trinamul wanted it to go. Realising that the team would not venture out of Calcutta, they crowed that the Centre was wary of further strengthening Opposition unity in Parliament against the central intervention in a state subject.         
	The BJPs L.K. Advani and the Samajwadi Partys Mulayam Singh Yadav had joined Left MPs on Monday to protest the teams visit, prompting Chidambaram to assure the House that his move was only to assist the state government in dealing with political violence.         
	As the central team flew back to Delhi, the CPM claimed that the focus of their visit was to gather information on Maoist violence and not CPM terror as Mamata had wanted. Some of the team members had gone to Maoist-hit Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand earlier, a leader said.        
	The Left took the opportunity of the central visit to submit evidence of anarchy unleashed by the Mamata-Maoist nexus and how the Trinamul leader had been trying to be the cause and beneficiary of the deteriorating law and order.        
	Some CPM state secretariat members were certain the Congress would not make the folly of turning the Bengal government a political martyr by imposing Presidents rule. Let us see the teams report and Chidambarams reaction. The next scenario will depend on how we can pre-empt steps arising out of the Centres coalition compulsions, a member said.         
	To mount counter-pressure on the Congress, the Left stepped up its campaign against the Centre on the Liberhan commissions report. The party circulated a 2002 statement by Jyoti Basu to buttress its allegation of political machination in the commissions clean chit to Prime Minister Narasimha Rao and the Centres evasive stand on the indicted BJP leaders. Basu had described the Congress as the largest non-communal party but criticised it for not being self-critical and sincere in fighting communal forces.

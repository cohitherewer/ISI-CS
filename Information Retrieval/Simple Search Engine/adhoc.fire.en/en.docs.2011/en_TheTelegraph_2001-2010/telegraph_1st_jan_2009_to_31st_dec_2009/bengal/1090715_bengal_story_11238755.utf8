The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Leash on Citu, Tata site opens
                                                                                                               Leash on Citu, Tata site opens
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Kharagpur, July 14: The Left unions that stalled work on a Tata project here yesterday have put off their agitation under pressure from their leaders in Calcutta.        
	Work on the Rs 600-crore excavator factory resumed around noon today following a face-saver: promise of talks on their demands.        
	Sources in the labour arms of the CPM and the CPI said there was a flurry of phone calls after news of the complete shutdown of the project reached Calcutta. Under instructions from the state brass, local Citu and Aituc leaders went into a huddle last evening, said a Citu source. It was decided at the meeting that the agitation would be called off if a senior government officer made such a request.        
	Kharagpur subdivisional officer S.B. Sarkar arrived at the Telco Construction Equipment Company (Telcon) plant a little before noon and told the leaders a tripartite meeting had been called on Thursday. Please withdraw your agitation. The unions agreed.        
	They had stopped work demanding that each landloser family be given jobs at the plant when completed. Plots from 300 families had been acquired in 2006 for the 250-acre Telcon project.        
	The company issued a notice on Saturday offering free vocational training to a member of each of the 300 landloser families, but not jobs.         
	The unions claimed yesterday that at the time of the acquisition, the government had promised jobs to the landlosers. They vowed not to let work resume till the demand was met. But both the government and the company denied having made any such promise.        
	It has been decided to provide free training to one member per family of those families who held plots in the 250 acres given to Telcon, a company release said. The course is aimed at enhancing employability in the area.         
	CPM sources said the Citu leadership was reluctant to continue with the agitation in view of the electoral drubbings the party had suffered since Tata Motors shifted the Nano plant from Singur. We are still smarting under the humiliation we suffered in Singur, a leader said in Kharagpur.        
	The projects administrative officer, Pancham Maity, said Telcon was again hopeful of making the plant operational within its October deadline.

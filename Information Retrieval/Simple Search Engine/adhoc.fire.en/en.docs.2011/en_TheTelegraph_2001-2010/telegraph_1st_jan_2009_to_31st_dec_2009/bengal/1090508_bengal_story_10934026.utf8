  Evening hunt after defiance
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Nandigram, May 7: A two- year-old girl died of bullet wounds in a Nandigram village amid allegations that the CPM was hunting down Trinamul Congress supporters for defying a diktat to stay away from polling booths.         
	A 45-year-old man also died in Satengabari, one of the few CPM strongholds in Nandigram, after he was beaten with iron rods.        
	The burst of violence in the evening belied the peaceful polling, barring a few stray incidents, in the volatile area during the day.        
	Aleya Bibi, 27, a resident of Sherkhanchowk in Khejuri who was visiting her paternal home in Satengabari, was shot in the stomach while her two-year-old daughter Shania Khatoun was shot in the leg.         
	Both were taken to a block hospital from where they were referred to a hospital in Tamluk town. Shania died on the way to Tamluk.        
	Yasin Mir, a Trinamul supporter, suffered fractures after he was beaten with lathis and iron rods. He was also taken to the Tamluk hospital where he succumbed to his wounds.        
	Last night, CPM supporters had ordered us not to vote. But we did not listen and voted today. As soon as polling was over, armed CPM men from Khejuri (once a CPM launching pad for attacks on Nandigram) entered every house, beating up people and vandalising. Then they started firing indiscriminately, said Raushan Ali, Aleyas uncle and an active Trinamul worker.        
	They were specifically aiming at the house. She was trying to close the door and her daughter was with her when she got shot, Ali added.        
	The district superintendent of police, Pallab Kanti Ghosh, confirmed that two people had been shot at and another had died of battery injuries in Satengabari.        
	Clashes also broke out in the evening in Keyakhali, Satengabari, Ranichak, Takapura and Kamalpur villages in Nandigram block II, all dominated by the ruling party. Six people have been admitted to hospital.

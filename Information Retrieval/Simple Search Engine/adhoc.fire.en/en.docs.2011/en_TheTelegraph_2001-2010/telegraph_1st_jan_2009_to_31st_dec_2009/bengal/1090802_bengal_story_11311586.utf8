                                                                                                               Sibal unfurls dream of varsity freedom
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Kapil Sibal                                  
	Calcutta, Aug. 1: The Centre wants to keep universities free from government control and political interference, Union human resource development minister Kapil Sibal said here today.        
	Addressing a gathering at Bengal Engineering and Science University, he also promised to implement soon the decision to set up an overarching autonomous authority in higher education and research subsuming regulatory bodies like the University Grants Commission, All India Council for Technical Education and the Medical Council of India.         
	The universities will have to function independently. They should be given the freedom to design their own courses and appoint their own teachers and heads in order to excel. The internal freedom is necessary to enable the institutions to focus on the disciplines they want to specialise (in) so that they can be among the best in the world, Sibal told the University-Industry Council Symposium organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry.         
	Starting 2010, a University-Industry Congress will be organised every year to take the partnership forward in a more structured way, the minister announced after launching the CII-Besu Industrial Research, Innovation amp; HRD Centre on the Shibpur campus.        
	At the symposium, Sibal said: State governments should allow state-aided universities to grow and help them become what they want to be.        
	Appointment of college and university heads in Bengal is believed to be controlled by the CPM headquarters.         
	The state government has been accused of trying to keep institutions like Presidency College fettered.        
	State higher education minister Sudarshan Ray Chaudhuri, and governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi, also Besu chancellor, were among those in Sibals audience.        
	Not that the Centre can unshackle state-run universities by just wishing to do so and Sibal did not suggest how he intended to go about it.         
	He promised more central financial assistance to the state-aided universities. The Centre has earmarked Rs 31,000 crore for them.        
	The HRD minister proposed an incentive for universities and teachers based on performance.        
	Every university must have their own official website where they will regularly post all data such as the number of teachers they have, who teaches what, the number of whole timers, number of ad-hoc teachers, their qualifications, how many of them have contributed to journals and so on. We should be able to know these details from every institution getting government funds, he said.

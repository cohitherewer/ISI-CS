	Calcutta, Nov. 20: A high court division bench today refused to stay the process of recruiting primary school teachers in the state but made it clear the government would have to abide by its verdict.     
	It was hearing a plea by teachers training institute students who had done two-year courses valid under a central law. The state has allowed even students with one-year diplomas to apply for the jobs. The petitioners said that since education was on the concurrent list, the national law should prevail.         
	Calcutta: A division bench has admitted a PIL demanding the re-opening of 16 schools occupied by security forces for the Lalgarh operation since July.        
	Purulia: Maoists shot at two CPM supporters in Purulias Arsha. They are in hospital.

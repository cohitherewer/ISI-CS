                                                                                                               Cop recalls dark lady
          NARESH JANA                          Patrol outside Sankrail police station on Wednesday                                  
	Sankrail, Oct. 21: Barely two hours before the Maoists struck yesterday, two couples who cops said were Maoists posing as villagers had visited Sankrail police station for reconnaissance.        
	A constable who declined to be named said he was bathing at the well outside the police station around 11.30am when he noticed a couple approach on foot. They walked through the gate and found officer-in-charge Atindranath Dutta standing on the verandah.        
	The woman, who was around 20, was in a sari, while the man, a few years older, was in trousers and shirt.         
	There were two things that struck me about the woman, the constable said today. One, that she was unusually dark and the second was the way in which she had wrapped the sari around her, almost as if she had something to hide.        
	According to the constable, the couple claimed they were from Nuniashole, 1.5km away. They said they wanted to lodge a complaint about their stolen ration cards. The OC told them they should first approach the ration office and the couple left quietly.        
	A while later, the constable said, another couple of around the same age approached the police station from the opposite direction. They entered the police station as the OC was inside and told him that they were from Purba Gobindapur, also 1.5km away, and wanted voter identity cards.        
	The OC told them they should go to the block office as the police station could not issue the cards. The couple left.        
	The constable claimed that even while fleeing in panic during the afternoon attack he saw the same dark woman. She was then wearing a salwar-kurta and was armed with a pistol. I realised in a flash that the sari she had draped around her in an unusual manner was hiding the salwar-kurta underneath.        
	An officer said it was evident that the four had come on a recce. When the first effort failed because the OC was on the verandah, a second batch was sent to scan the interiors of the police station.        
	A district intelligence officer said a couple with a flimsy complaint had come on Monday as well but, in the absence of the OC, no official here could corroborate this.        
	Ratan Khanra, 50, of Rangadigha village, said he was in the bazaar near the police station around 2pm yesterday when he saw the motorcycle-borne gang speed back into the forest after the attack. Two bi-kes stopped on the way and a woman got off and waved her dupatta at the forest, Khanra said.         
	The police said it meant more Maoists were waiting in the wings as possible reinforcements.         
	The authorities today revised the list of arms the guerrillas stole from the police station. Besides the forces six rifles and five revolvers, they took away 15 single-barrel guns that villagers had kept in police custody. A large amount of ammunition  180 rounds of .303 bullets, 72 revolver bullets and 24 rounds of ammunition for 9mm pistols  is also gone.        
	Circle inspector Debojyoti Ghosh today took charge of Sankrail. The State Bank branch looted yesterday has been closed indefinitely.        
	Local CPM MLA Rabilal Moitra, also the law minister, visited Sankrail today and said the police in Maoist-hit areas should be more cautious.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | At Cleverness Crossing, stains of a tool
                                                                                                               At Cleverness Crossing, stains of a tool
										      Sujan Dutta examines how violence  its use, its ability   to kill or maim, its ability to strike fear and threaten and, above all, its weapon-like quality as a   tactic  is   playing a role   in this election                                  
	In a bamboo grove in Nadariya, a writhing Shaktipada Sen drank four glasses of sharbat and died.         
	His last act was overseen by tribal women from his village who made him the drink to relieve his pain.         
	On the afternoon of Tuesday, April 21, he was beaten black and blue with lathis and kicked in the stomach. His killers were allegedly Maoists who raided his village.        
	They had a hit list, went house to house in search of CPM activists and traitors, summoned them for a meeting under a big tree, lectured villagers on 32 years of oppressive Left rule and called for a boycott of the elections.         
	A day earlier, in Keshpurs Baromessa, Trinamul worker Buddheshwar Mahato was hoisting a party flag in his village to which he had returned after nine years. His attackers came on motorcycles and fired from country-made 8mm guns. He fled inside his mud house, tried scampering up to the second storey but a bullet caught him at the waist.         
	The wall is still stained a dark brown. He is in the Sadar Hospital in Midnapore, a bullet that was also lodged in his right arm now extricated.         
	Baromessa and Nadariya (in Lalgarh) are west of Chalakir More, the curiously named junction that translates to Cleverness Crossing in West Midnapore.         
	The cleverness of the politics in these elections is as effective as a bludgeon. The attack in Baromessa and the killing in Nadariya  the first falls in Ghatal constituency and the second in Jhargram  have bestirred politics in the state in the run-up to the first phase of the polls in Bengal.         
	Ghatal, Jhargram, and Midnapore are scheduled to vote on April 30. But here, among the villagers, there is a pall of fear that they know they have to live with but just cannot get habituated to. This is unlike Kashmir or the Northeast where people are used to living with insurgents and the army, caught between guns as they are.         
	Although the fear is overriding, there is a difference in the way it operates in Baromessa and in Nadariya. Violence  its use, its ability to kill or maim, its ability to strike fear and threaten and, above all, its weapon-like quality as a tactic, is playing a role in this election. Baromessa and Nadariya illustrate just how.        
	Baromessa        
	Buddheshwar returned to Baromessa on Monday, April 20, with nine others.         
	The road to Baromessa from its police station at Anandapur is a ribbony black. Signboards mark it out as a giveaway from the Prime Ministers rural roads development programme, as are most of the roads in the district.         
	Along the road, every village is marked out as the Lefts. This is Keshpur. Baromessa is Keshpurs first panchayat area. Nine years back, it had a Trinamul panchayat member. Till 2001, the CPM dubbed the Trinamuls forcible ways in these parts as Mamata Banerjees Keshpur Line  a muscular political foray to eject the CPM from one of its traditional bastions.         
	Before delimitation, this was part of the Panskura Lok Sabha constituency. The CPIs Gurudas Dasgupta won the seat last time. Now, Keshpur has moved to Ghatal. And so has Gurudas. His main opponent is retired Justice Nure Alam Choudhury of Trinamul.         
	As far as recall value goes, Dasgupta is way ahead. Even in the police station at Anandapur, his name rolls off the circle inspectors tongue easily but he has to seek the help of an assistant before he can name the Trinamul candidate correctly.         
	In the 10 or so kilometres from the police station  and past Cleverness Crossing  every village is marked out as Left (actually CPM) turf.         
	Unlike in Calcutta, here, CPM or CPI flags actually identify the political domination of a party in a village. Or does it? Bullet marks on graffiti asking people to vote for Dasgupta give out the lie.         
	The writing is on the mud walls of Buddheshwars house in Baromessa.         
	His 22-year-old son Dukhuram Mahato points them out: Vote boom boom Gurudas rat-a-tat-tat Dasgupta boom boom on this rat-a-tat symbol.         
	The symbol is the CPIs  the sickle and ears of corn.        
	Why do you ask why they did it? asks Mohan Mahato, a villager in Baromessa and Trinamul sympathiser.         
	They just dont want that flag around.         
	He points to the party flag that Buddheshwar had planted. This is the first time in nine years, he says, that a Trinamul symbol  the grass and flowers  is visible in the village.         
	A police patrol is posted here now in a utility vehicle. The head constable is livid. They had moved in here at midnight. It is now past two in the afternoon the next day. No lunch. No relief. The head constable is yelling into a borrowed cellphone: You (expletive) you are sitting in an (expletive) thana and you (expletive) can ask us to (expletive) wait here for (expletive) hours. What the (expletive) you think I... and we have no food and the villagers give us (expletive) nothing except some raw mangoes.         
	Buddheshwars son Dukhuram says he can identify the attackers and reels off the names of the anchal pradhan (area chief) and his son among eight others. He says the attackers came in two gangs. One came along the tar road on motorcycles. The other from the Budhatola jungle along which is a cashew plantation.         
	A walk through a farm and the plantation and there are two huts. Two men say they are the guards for the plantation. The police came and found CPM literature on them. The police also took two motorcycles from them.         
	Baromessa and its sister village across the road, Bein- hasol, have about 40 households of tribals, all Santals. There are also 35 households of Mahatos.         
	When Dukhuram is organising a guided tour about his house, showing where Buddheshwar and his friends had tried to take refuge and how they tried to flee, he is alone.         
	His fathers bid to return home has outed Dukhuram and the other villagers do not want to join in easily. They have to live with the CPM even after the elections. The police patrol will leave soon enough.         
	Mohan Mahato and Dukhuram say they have been forced to participate in CPM processions. They have paid for petrol for CPM activists motorcycles. They say they were forced since Trinamul retreated from the village in 2001.         
	This was Trinamuls effort to return. Buddheshwar was seen by the CPM as Sheikh Rafiqs lieutenant when Trinamul was executing its Keshpur Line. There are police cases against him.         
	Dukhuram alleges they are foisted. Someone somewhere had betrayed and had informed the party that he was back, he suspects.         
	On April 30, when the polls are held, the Left Front has calculated that Keshpur will give Gurudas Dasgupta an unbeatable lead even if he trails elsewhere in the six other Assembly segments of the Ghatal parliamentary constituency.       TO BE CONCLUDED

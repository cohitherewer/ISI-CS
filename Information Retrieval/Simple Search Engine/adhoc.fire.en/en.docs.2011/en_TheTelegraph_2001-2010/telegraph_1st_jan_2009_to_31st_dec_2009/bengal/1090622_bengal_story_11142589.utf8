	Lalgarh, June 21: The buzz of the sewing machine at Ashwini Mahatos mud house in Amla village, around 4.5km from Lalgarh thana, has stopped.         
	He had sold off his two cows and spent Rs 5,000 to buy the machine, which could stitch up sal-leaf plates, cups and bowls much faster than human hands.         
	The mechanisation had increased productivity manifold and the Mahatos were earning almost Rs 4,000 a month till last November.         
	After Lalgarh became a liberated zone and the region was cut off from the outside world, his business and income took a dive.        
	I havent been able to sell a single bundle of plates for more than a month and I havent earned anything. Who will come here to buy? asked the 26-year-old head of the family of six.         
	For the Kurmi and the Santhal communities in Lalgarh, who comprise around 30 per cent of the 1.5-lakh population, trading in sal leaves or utensils made of the leaves is the major source of income. Till November, buyers  referred to as mahajans  from Jhargram and Midnapore frequented the villages.         
	They stopped coming after the unrest began. In the first few months, we managed to sell some of our produce and could earn around Rs 1,000 a month. But after the roads were dug up, the mahajans stopped coming, added Mahato pointing to the stacks of plates, bowls and cups in a corner of his house.         
	We dont have any space to stock them and so we have stopped production, he explained, adding that it could take up to six months after the return of normality for him to earn the same amount as he did till last November.         
	Mahato has never been to a school but the sudden drop in price of utensils made of sal leaves  from Rs 120 a bundle to Rs 50 within a month of the unrest has taught him how demand-supply mismatch can have an impact on price.         
	So many people here depend on sal leaves and none of them could sell anything in the last few months. If things return to normal, people will sell their produce at throwaway prices, he added.         
	Inaccessibility of Lalgarh has completely crippled the regions economy, which is heavily dependent on the metalled road that connects Pirakata with Lalgarh and runs into the interior villages.         
	As less than 20 per cent of the population owns cultivable land, most people in Lalgarh block  with a literacy rate of around 42 per cent  depend on physical labour for sustenance.         
	A lot of people from our villages used to go to Jhargram or Midnapore to work as day labourers. Now that Lalgarh is cut off and people are not allowed to leave the villages, our income has dropped drastically, said Chitro Murmu of Bhimpur.         
	As life has come to a standstill, opportunities have shrunk. Traders have shut shops for want of supplies and landless labourers do not have any work.         
	At Hariharpur, a day labourer said not a single construction  or renovation  work had taken place in Lalgarh block, which has 62-odd villages, in the past few months.         
	I havent got work for several months. Im begging for food from relatives and neighbours, added the middle-aged man.         
	The dip in income in the region is a big concern for Radhakanta Mishra, a Midnapore-based doctor, a member of an NGO that organises free medical camps in the villages.         
	Most people here are malnourished and so they are susceptible to various diseases and infections. If they are forced to cut down on their food intake, the problems will compound, said Mishra.         
	Hunger and poor nourishment for the kids has always been a problem in the remote villages of West Midnapore district, which has recorded starvation deaths, though the administration would not admit that.         
	But Mahato  who has had no income in the past few months  has no option. We eat only once in the afternoon, he said as his wife Anima looked on.         
	A senior Lalgarh block official, whose office has stopped functioning since November, pleaded helplessness. We have 10 tonnes of rice with us but we dont know how to distribute it among the people as the situation is tense here, he said.         
	Mahato mumbles a prayer for normal life, the only rescue from the clutches of hunger.

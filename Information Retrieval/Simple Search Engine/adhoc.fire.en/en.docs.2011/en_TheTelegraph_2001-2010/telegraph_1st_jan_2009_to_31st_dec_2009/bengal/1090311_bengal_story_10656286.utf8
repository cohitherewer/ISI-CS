	Durgapur, March 10: A 16-year-old girl was killed this afternoon when the balcony of a two- storey miners quarters caved in and fell on her in Asansols Jamuria.    
	After the incident, nearly 1,000 miners marched into the Shibdanga colliery office, about 240km from Calcutta, and ransacked several rooms. Eastern Coalfields general manager Harisadhan Mukherjee, civil engineer M. Dev and colliery manager R.R. Kant were held responsible for the accident and detained. Police and Central Industrial Security Force personnel rescued them. Several ECL vehicles were stoned.     
	The condition of our quarters is unthinkable. Every night, we sleep with the fear that the roof might cave in, said the dead Shahina Khatoons father Yunus.         
	Siliguri: A 75-year-old woman was found dead in her house in Jalpaiguri on Monday night.

The second, Sudhir, who works in a bank, lives in a rented house across the road. The other two live elsewhere. Neighbours heard Pramila crying for help around 9pm.

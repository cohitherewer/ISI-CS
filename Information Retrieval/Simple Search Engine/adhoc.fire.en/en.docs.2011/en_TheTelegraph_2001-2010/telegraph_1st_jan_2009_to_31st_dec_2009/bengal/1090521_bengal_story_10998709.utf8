The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Allies put state in dock
                                                                                                               Allies put state in dock
  - Partners blame Buddha industry drive for debacle        BISWAJIT ROY                                    
	Calcutta, May 20: The CPMs allies blame the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee regimes method of industrialisation for the Lefts rout here more than the pro-Congress wave that Biman Bose holds responsible.        
	At the Left Front meeting tomorrow, the RSP, Forward Bloc and the CPI are going to raise the state factors that they feel have pulled down their Bengal tally from 35 to 15.        
	We are not happy at the way the CPM state leadership is trying to escape the responsibility. Why did the (pro-Congress) wave fail to work in neighbouring Orissa and Bihar? Why did we fail when Naveen Patnaik and Nitish Kumar could contain anti-incumbency? asked an RSP veteran.        
	They accused the CPM of not taking lessons from the rural poll setbacks last year.         
	According to PWD minister and RSP leader Kshiti Goswami, the Left lost at least 7 per cent votes primarily because of the government and the CPMs failure to dispel farmers fear of losing their land. Despite many promises, the government lacked the political will to prepare a land-use map, a land bank and a comprehensive policy on acquisition and rehabilitation of landlosers. We paid the price for it.         
	He added that all investors should be asked to buy land directly with the government acting as facilitator in the industry-farmer negotiations.         
	The allies agreed that pe- oples pent-up anger at CPM leaders for their misbehaviour and corruption down to the panchayat level, and mistrust among Muslims since the Sa- char Committee pointed out how they had been deprived in Left-ruled Bengal also found a reflection in the verdict.         
	A CPI meeting put the governments handling of Rizwanur Rahmans death, post-Sachar discontent among Muslims, arrogance of CPM leaders and Singur-Nandigram in the same bracket. To attrib- ute the Oppositions success to a pro-Congress wave will be a half-truth, said state party secretary Manju Mazumdar.        
	The Blocs Debabrata Biswas mentioned the confusion over industrialisation, land acquisition and high-handedness of the bureaucracy.        
	According to him, the police firing in Nandigram on March 14, 2007, affected the Left governments image and gave the anti-Left forces an edge.         
	The CPM blame game over the so-called Bengal line  which blames the central leaderships withdrawal of support to the Manmohan Singh government and attempt to foist a rag-tag coalition as an alternative for the defeat  and the Prakash Karat line does not interest the allies. Karat and Bhattacharjee had survived on mutual support during the earlier crises, they said.         
	A front leader pointed out that Karat had defended the state unit when leaders in Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra had resented the double-speak on the firings in Khamman and Nandigram and after the cadres armed recapture of Nandigram.         
	A grateful Bengal leadership had no other option but to accept Karats position in national politics, he said.        
	Although Bose has refused to admit the role of discontent over land acquisition in the drubbing, many party leaders echoed the allies.         
	A North 24-Parganas leader said an internal assessment after the rural polls had cited the land discontent along with factors like nepotism, arrogance and corruption among party and panchayat functionaries as reasons for the setbacks. Nothing has changed since. Hardly any action was taken against the wrongdoers.

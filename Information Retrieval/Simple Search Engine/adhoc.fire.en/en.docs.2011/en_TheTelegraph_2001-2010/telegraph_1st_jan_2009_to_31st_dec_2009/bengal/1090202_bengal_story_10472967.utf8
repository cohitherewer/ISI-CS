The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Mamata ready for talks
                                                                                                               Mamata ready for talks
  - Trinamul chief wants to discuss deal with Cong brass        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Calcutta, Feb. 1: Mamata Banerjee today said she was ready for talks to work out an alliance with the Congress ahead of the general elections this summer.         
	At a Trinamul general council meeting this evening, she objected when Nandigram strongman Sisir Adhikari said the Trinamul Congress could fight the CPM on its own in the polls. Sisirda, that is your personal opinion, not the partys. Party workers do not agree with what you are saying, Mamata butted in.        
	After Adhikari was cut short, not a single Trinamul leader advocated the go-it-alone path. People want us to go for an alliance. So, I am ready for talks to work out an alliance, Mamata told the meeting.         
	The Trinamul chief later told reporters she would talk to central Congress leaders on the alliance. I shall talk to the Congresss central leadership since its state leaders have no powers, she added.        
	Mamata expects a response from the Congress high command in seven to 10 days. The Lok Sabha elections are knocking at the doors. I cannot wait indefinitely.        
	The Trinamul council  comprising MLAs, council- lors, zilla parishad members and panchayat pradhans  had met to specifically discuss the possible alliance.        
	Didi appeared very serious about the alliance, realising that a split in votes would jeopardise our prospects, a key Trinamul leader said.        
	Those at the meeting said there was a marked difference between what Mamata said today and what she had before. Earlier, she had simply given a call to anti-CPM parties to get together. Today, she looked prepared to take the initiative to forge an alliance, said a Trinamul leader.        
	State Congress working president Subrata Mukherjee, known to be pro-alliance, said he was very excited about the developments. I shall convey the good tidings to (state Congress president) Pranab Mukherjee, he added.         
	Another section of the Congress is opposed to any truck with Mamata, who has refused to formally sever ties with the BJP-led NDA.         
	A Mamata aide said she might call on Congress president Sonia Gandhi when she goes to Delhi next week.         
	Even while offering her hand to the Congress, Mamata appeared to be seeking an upper hand. Ours is the principal Opposition party and we shall not bow to anyone, she said.

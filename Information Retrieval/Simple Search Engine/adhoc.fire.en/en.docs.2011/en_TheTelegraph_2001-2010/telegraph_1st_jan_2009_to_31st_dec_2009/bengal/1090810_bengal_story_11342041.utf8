          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Midnapore, Aug. 9: The Maoists, who have denied murdering three Jharkhand Party (Naren) activists on Wednesday, shot dead a supporter of the party in Belpahari last night.        
	Puffed rice seller Manik Mondal, 48, had gone to a village 2km away to have his wheat ground. His body, with bullet marks on the forehead, back and abdomen, was found about 500m from his home today.         
	Maoist leader Bikash acknowledged responsibility, saying Manik belonged to the Peoples Committee Against Terror, formed to counter the Maoist-backed Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities.        
	Manik used to hawk puffed rice door to door, wife Kalyani said. He also sold puffed rice at police camps. He became friends with a jawan (of the state armed police), to whom we gave our daughter in marriage. The Maoists may have thought he was an informer.         
	Maoists also shot and injured Rampada Mondal, 37, a road contractor, at Pachapani village, about 5km from Chakadoba.         
	He has been admitted to SSKM Hospital in Calcutta. Around 8pm, three youths arrived on a motorcycle at a club at Pachapani where Rampada was chatting with friends. They forced him to walk about 200 metres at gunpoint before shooting him in the abdomen, leg and forehead.        
	Bikash claimed responsibility for the shooting of Rampada too and said he was a police informer.

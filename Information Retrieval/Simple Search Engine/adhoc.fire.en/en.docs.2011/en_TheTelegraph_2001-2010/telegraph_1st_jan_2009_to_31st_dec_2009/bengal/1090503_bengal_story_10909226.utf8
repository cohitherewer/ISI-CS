The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Give change a chance, says PM
                                                                                                               Give change a chance, says PM
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Howrah, May 2: The Prime Minister yesterday told the people of Howrah to give Trinamul and the Congress a chance to bring in change but not before Mamata Banerjee stood up to silence an extremely noisy crowd.        
	Its time for a change in Bengal. Please give a chance to the Congress-Trinamul Congress alliance to usher in change for the state. Our alliance will take Bengal to the path of development, Singh said yesterday at an election rally at the Domurjola sporting complex in Howrah.         
	This was Singhs first rally in Bengal this election and the campaign was for two Trinamul candidates  Ambika Banerjee and Sultan Ahmed  for the Howrah and Uluberia seats, respectively.        
	This was also the first time Mamata shared the dais with Singh after he became the Prime Minister in 2004.         
	The Trinamul chief had earlier criticised the Prime Minister for not visiting her dharna manch at Esplanade where she was on a 26-day hunger strike protesting the forcible acquisition of farmland in Singur.        
	But yesterday, after Mamata shushed the crowd, the Prime Minister did not disappoint her. Fertile land should be avoided for setting up industries, he said. Adequate compensation should also be given to those whose land is acquired, he added.         
	Singh also slammed the Left for joining hands with the BJP to withdraw support from the UPA government during the trust vote on the nuclear deal.

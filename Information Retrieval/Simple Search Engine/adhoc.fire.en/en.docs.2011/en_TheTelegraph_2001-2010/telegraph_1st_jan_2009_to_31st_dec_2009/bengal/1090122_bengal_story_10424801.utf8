The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Police post turns night school
                                                                                                               Police post turns night school
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Kandi (Murshidabad), Jan. 21: A police station in a Murshidabad village has started evening classes for children to foster friendly relations with residents.        
	Police have in the past organised football matches and fairs, but assistant sub-inspector Amal Kumar Chandra went beyond.        
	The man in charge of the beat office at Baghachra village in Kandi, about 245km from Calcutta, visited around 700 families there to try and convince them to send their children to the classes.        
	He got some able hands in Bidur Sarkar and four village youths  Parimal Dolui, Milan Dolui, Ashabur Sheikh and Lakshmiram Majhi.         
	All five take the classes that began last month.        
	Bidur conducts drills and parades to ensure physical fitness of the children. The rest of us teach them. We have about 300 students from Classes I to IV, said Chandra.        
	Under a bamboo structure with a polythene shed in front of the beat house, the children, who go to local primary schools during the day, learn letters, arithmetic, rhymes.        
	District police chief Basab Dasgupta, who went to see the school, said: The ASI has taken pains to convince the parents to send their children for the coaching.        
	Most adults at Baghachra are school dropouts who earn their living as labourers. About 200 youths are in the Gulf, said panchayat leader Mozammel Haque. The drive to help the kids with their studies will help them as most houses lack an academic environment.        
	Ratan Dolui, whose daughter Seema is in Class II, said the police had told him not to make her work. My daughter used to collect firewood and grass for our goat. But the policeman who came to our house asked me not to make my daughter do any work. She attends the coaching centre, she is taking an interest in studies, said the father.

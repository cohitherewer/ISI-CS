	Farakka, Dec. 7: The death of an 11-year-old girl on her way to school riding pillion on her fathers motorbike triggered a road rage here in which four police jeeps were torched.        
	Srijita, a Class IV student, and her six-year-old brother Soumyadip were going to school together when a truck hit the two-wheeler from behind at NTPC More, tossing them up in the air.         
	The girl died on the spot. Her brother and father Swapan Das, 40, were said to be in a critical condition.        
	A mob put up roadblocks across the town demanding speed-breakers on National Highway 34 and pelted police with stones and torched their vehicles when they tried to resist. The police had to fire eight-nine rounds in the air.

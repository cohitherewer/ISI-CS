                                                                                                               Trio on clean-up job die in Haldia Petro
   Police smell wrong gas 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          The Haldia Petro plant. File picture                                        
	Tamluk, May 24: Two men who entered a 40ft-high vessel at Haldia Petrochemicals for a clean-up and a third who went looking for them died this morning allegedly after inhaling nitrogen, released by mistake instead of oxygen.        
	A fourth person smelt the gas when he was about to en- ter the vessel and raised the alarm.         
	Subdivisional police officer Salil Ganguly spoke to employees at the mother plant, where the pipe-shaped vessels are used to process naphtha, inspected the pipes that supply oxygen, nitrogen and water, and said: We found that oxygen should have been released in the vessel before the workers entered it. But nitrogen was released by mistake.        
	Around 3,000 people engaged by a contractor are part of the routine maintenance job being carried out since May 8.        
	The dead were all employees of the contractor. They have been identified as Zakir Hussain, 36, a resident of Englishbazar in Malda, and Gopal Das, 28, and Pintu Pradhan, 30, who were from villages on the outskirts of Haldia town.        
	Police officer Ganguly said it was the responsibility of the plants safety officer to oversee which gas was being released. HPL has informed us that it has set up a committee to conduct a probe.         
	The company issued a rel-ease that appeared at odds with the police officers charge. It said: Contrary to some reports, there was no gas emission in the plant.        
	Asked about the officers statement, an HPL spokesperson said: A detailed investigation is on. One of the possibilities being looked into is whether workers without the mandatory permit inadvertently entered into a process vessel where air level was low.        
	Sources in the company said the contractor had to take the permit to ensure that the workers had the required skills for the job and ample precaution had been taken.         
	A police case has been started. East Midnapore superintendent of police P.K. Ghosh said: We have started an unnatural death case. Three people have died and someone must be at fault. We are carrying out a thorough investigation.         
	Some of the workers present at the time of the incident said Pintu was their supervisor.         
	Zakir and Gopal climbed 20ft up a ladder and went into the process vessel. When nothing was heard from their end in an hour, Pintu called for them, but there was no response. Then he, too, climbed down and did not come out in half an hour, said Subrata Samanta, their co-worker.        
	Amal Hazra sensed trouble and wanted to get inside but the smell sent him back. Amal shouted that something was wrong inside and employees of the safety department rushed in. Then the alarm bell went off, said Subrata.        
	Dressed in protective gear, the safety department personnel went into the vessel and brought out the three bodies.         
	The maintenance job, stopped after the incident, resumed after a factories inspector from the state government examined the site and gave the clearance.        
	Company sources said HPL had a group insurance cover and each bereaved family would get Rs 2 lakh over and above what the contractors are obligated to pay.

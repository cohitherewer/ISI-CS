	Jan. 21: The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha today virtually sought Buddhadeb Bhattachar- jees help for a foothold in the Dooars at a time the Adivasi community has stonewalled all its efforts.         
	Amar Lama, a member of the Morcha team that met the chief minister this evening, said: The meeting started off on a cordial note but the chief minister turned serious when we asked for permission to hold public meetings in the Dooars. He asked us why we wanted to hold meetings there. We told him we are a registered party and have every right to hold a meeting anywhere.        
	The Morchas Dooars foray did not get the nod.         
	Chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti said the chief minister had told the Morcha not to hold any rally in the Dooars or Siliguri. In view of the situation in the Dooars, Malbazar (also in Dooars) and Siliguri, the chief minister asked them not to hold meetings and rallies there.        
	They have promised restraint, Chakrabarti added.        
	For the Morcha, the Dooars and the Terai are crucial for it needs Adivasi support to press for Gorkhaland. The tribals have so far resisted the hill outfits attempts to hold meetings in the plains, triggering ethnic tensions.        
	The chief minister told us we should wait for the situation in the Dooars to normalise for permission to hold meetings there, said Lama.         
	The meeting did not discuss the demand for Gorkhaland as the chief minister made it clear it would have to raised in talks with the Centre. He said whether the Gorkhaland movement is legitimate or not should also be taken up at tripartite meetings in the Delhi, Chakrabarti told reporters. If the Morcha continues to agitate, that would only vitiate the atmosphere of the (ongoing) tripartite talks, he added.        
	The Morcha team led by general secretary Roshan Giri spoke to the chief minister for an hour and 45 minutes.         
	Bhattacharjee urged them to help restore normality in the hills and promised to pay for the treatment of their supporters injured in the recent violence. The government is also considering offering compensation for houses that were damaged. The allegations about false cases against Morcha supporters will be probed.        
	The chief secretary, however, also quoted Bhattacharjee as saying no criminal activity like arson and riots will be tolerated.        
	After the meeting, though, it was Gorkhaland that was on Giris lips. We have made it very clear that Gorkhaland will comprise Siliguri, the Terai and the Dooars and we will not budge an inch.         
	Told that the majority of Siliguri was Bengali speaking, Giri said: There are a large number of Bangladeshi refugees and immigrants in Siliguri. They should be tracked down and deported.        
	Lama said normality could return only if those creating trouble in the Dooars were arrested. The names of some leaders have cropped up in all places where there has been an ethnic clashes.         
	He claimed that Bhattacharjee had asked the chief secretary to note down the names. The chief minister will ask the police to report within a week, he added.

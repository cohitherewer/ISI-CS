The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Mamata calls off police boycott

	Khejuri, June 16: Mamata Banerjee today stepped in to end the boycott of police in Khejuri, apparently realising it had ensured a free run for goons in Trinamul Congress ranks and alienated cops, and grabbing the opportunity to play the responsible leader.        
	After a meeting with close aides that lasted several hours last night, Mamata dialled East Midnapore party chief and local MP Sisir Adhikari and told him to see that the four-day-old boycott was lifted. The agitation was being led by Sisirs son Subhendu, who is MP from neighbouring Tamluk.        
	The agitation had been launched demanding the release of 13 partymen accused of arson. Cops were not being allowed to buy provisions or use tube wells and local transport. Yesterday, Trinamul leaders threatened to torch police camps if they did not leave.        
	But party sources suggested the polices plight may not have been the only reason behind the turnaround. In the absence of any policing, it had been a free-for-all in Khejuri with Trinamul supporters looting and plundering at will.        
	The withdrawal will help Mamata improve her image as a responsible Opposition leader, a partyman said.        
	The Trinamul chief told a news conference in Calcutta she was opposed to a social boycott of policemen. The government may act irresponsibly, but as a responsible Opposition party, we must rise to the occasion and help those policemen who are in distress because of the social boycott.         
	A former IPS officer associated with the party told her last night the move would help her win the support of ordinary policemen. They will side with us if we help them live like everyone else, he was quoted as telling Mamata.         
	Relief streaked through Khejuri today.         
	Thank God sanity has prevailed, said Sudhangshu Chanda, 60, who switched his loyalties to Trinamul before the general election. Over the past few days, we saw Trinamul supporters raiding houses on the pretext of searching for arms and looting valuables.         
	His house at Kamardabazar was attacked on Sunday. They asked me to hand over the jewellery and left after I convinced them that I belonged to Trinamul.        
	Rashbehari Panda, who hadnt switched parties, was robbed of Rs 50,000 worth of jewellery and a motorcycle. They told us there were arms in our house and ransacked our rooms. When they got nothing, they took away the jewellery and my bike, said his son Uttam, 32.        
	The family did not have the courage to go to the police because of the boycott.         
	Trinamul supporters allegedly forced chemist Radha Das to pay Rs 40,000 as protection money.        
	Many of those now running riot in Khejuri were earlier with the CPM. They are using tactics that were once the CPMs, said an officer of Khejuri police station.         
	He said the police were aware of the looting in the villages but not a single complaint has been lodged for fear of a backlash.         
	According to Chanda, the leadership had no control over its supporters who continued to beat up CPM supporters and force them to switch loyalties. The CPM used to do much the same and that is why we voted against it. After Trinamul won, we thought the villagers will live without fear but they are behaving exactly like their predecessors, he said, shaking his head in disgust.         
	Subhendu said he would look into the allegations after The Telegraph conveyed to him some specific complaints from villagers. There are 400 villages in Khejuri and there may have been some stray incidents of looting, he added.         
	After the boycott was lifted this afternoon, the first police complaint in four days was lodged: about an epileptic villager who died last night allegedly after falling into a pond.         
	After Trinamul supporters went around Khejuri town declaring over loudspeakers that the boycott had been lifted, RAF jawan Bhaskar Bera stepped out of the police station to buy a packet of cigarettes. The tea-stall owner served a cup of tea to Bera and exchanged smiles.         
	Im very happy. I have had no business since Saturday, said Bapi Kamila.                     WITH INPUTS FROM BARUN GHOSH IN CALCUTTA

	Darjeeling, Feb. 23: School students looking for a perfect weekend getaway could start planning for a ride on the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway (DHR), along with a visit to the local rail museum and a trek along the deciduous forest of Sukna.         
	Starting March 15, the DHR, in collaboration with Travel Junction, a Siliguri-based tour operator, will be launching a special train christened Sukna Special Wildlife Safari. The focus of the joyride is to popularise the world heritage train among the people and the schoolchildren of the region. As of now, the train is largely used by foreigners and domestic tourists.        
	We will start two rides which will begin at Siliguri Junction and end at Sukna, after covering a distance of 8km. While students will have to pay Rs 300 for the two-way ride, others will be charged Rs 400, said Santosh Gupta, the director of Travel Junction.        
	Once the train rolls into Sukna station, the passengers will be given about one-and-a-half hours to visit the rail museum, which is housed inside the station, and the nearby wildlife museum.         
	People could also take a short trek and reach Madhubhan park situated in close vicinity, said Gupta.        
	While the first trip will begin at 10am, the second ones scheduled time is 2pm. We will soon open a booking counter at the Siliguri junction and approach various schools so that students can buy tickets, said Gupta.        
	To begin with, the rides will be organised on weekends and national holidays.         
	If any school books 30 tickets for a particular ride, the rest of the 15 seats will be kept for poor students.         
	We will also serve snacks and refreshment, the price of which will be included in the ticket fare, said Gupta.

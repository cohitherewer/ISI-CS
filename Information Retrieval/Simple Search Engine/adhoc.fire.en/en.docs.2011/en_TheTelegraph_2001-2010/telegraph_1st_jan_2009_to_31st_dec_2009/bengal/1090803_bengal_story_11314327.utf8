	Durgapur, Aug. 2: Hundreds of CPM supporters today ransacked their party leaders homes in Burdwans Pandaveswar, accusing them of misappropriating funds meant for the rural job guarantee scheme.        
	Some of the villagers had allegedly not been paid their wages under the central scheme for five months. With crowbars and shovels, they raided the houses of the Kendra and Baidyanathpur panchayat chiefs, who had fled. In their absence, zilla parishad member Bhakta Marandi was picked up from his home and thrashed before he fled.

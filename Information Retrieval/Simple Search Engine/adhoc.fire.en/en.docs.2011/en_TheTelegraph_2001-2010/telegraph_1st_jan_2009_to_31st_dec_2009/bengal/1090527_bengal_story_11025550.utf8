	May 26: Cyclone Aila set off as many as 40 landslides across the Darjeeling hills today, killing at least 20.         
	The toll in the storm and rain triggered by the dissipating storm in north Bengal stood at 23, with three deaths reported each from Malda, Cooch Behar and South Dinajpur.         
	A 12-year-old girl, hit by a flying branch, was among the victims.        
	The landslides started from 9.30am after the rain that lashed the hills all night continued in the morning, too. In two hours, there were at least 25 slips in and around Darjeeling and Kurseong towns.         
	Hundreds of tourists were stranded both in Darjeeling and Siliguri as Hill Cart Road and the bypasses leading to the hill resort getting clogged.        
	By evening, at least 20 people, including four children, got buried under the rubble, sliding off hill slopes.         
	Police, firemen and volunteers were on alert since last night but they had too much on their hands today.        
	I have never seen anything like this before. There are landslips all around and rescue work is getting hampered by the closed roads. We are having to clear rubble at one place and rush to another for search and rescue operations, a volunteer said.        
	Darjeeling district magistrate Surendra Gupta said in the evening that he had called in a team of disaster management specialists from Dhubri in Assam. These men have been trained by the National Disaster Management Institute and they will be of great help. We are having problems reaching remote areas like Rimbik, where we do not know what the situation is as the roads have been cut off, Gupta said.        
	If a few hundred tourists were stuck in Darjeeling, a few thousand were held up in Siliguri, waiting for an opportunity to go uphill.        
	Tashi Pencho, a Darjeeling hotel owner, was praying for an early end to the crisis. This is peak season in the Queen of the Hills.         
	For many like Richard Perriera of Mumbai, who is in Darjeeling with a group of 58, the damage has been done.         
	We had return tickets for this evening. I wonder how we will get tickets for all of us in one go, Richard said.        
	A handful of tourists made it to Sikkim from Siliguri after the block on the hill states lifeline  National Highway 31A  was removed late in the afternoon.        
	Most Siliguri hotels were packed tonight.         
	I heard that the road to Sikkim has opened, but I am with my wife and two children. We have to take a call on whether to proceed tomorrow. We have to return to Calcutta on Thursday night, said Debashis Dutta of Behala.        
	Vishal Tripathi of Indore has almost given up on Darjeeling. Maybe we should go to the Dooars, he said.

	Calcutta, April 25: Medical students at SSKM turned the undergraduate hostel into a war zone today when the college authorities called police to evict two final-year boarders accused of giving others a tough time.        
	The police arrested 28 MBBS students after a clash between supporters of the Democratic Students Organisation  an SUCI outfit that the two boarders were affiliated to  and rival SFI. They have been charged with rioting, a bailable offence that can lead to two years imprisonment.         
	The SSKM authorities had served a notice on the two final-year students, Kabir Hussain and Diptangshu Ganguly, asking them to leave the main hostel and move to another building after some 50 students complained that they held booze sessions in their rooms, inviting outsiders. They had also threatened some SFI supporters after the college union elections, the students said.         
	The DSO has won the elections this month.         
	Earlier, the two had misbehaved with the hostel superintendent in a drunken state. They had been asked to stay out (of the main hostel) for two to three days and put up in another hostel. After the complaint this time, they were asked to vacate their hostel for good and move to another building, said Pradip Mitra, the SSKM director.         
	When they did not, SSKM officials and a police team went to the hostel to evict the two around 1pm.         
	When the cops were dragging the duo out by their collars, a large group of students  all DSO supporters  blocked the gate. They alleged the charges were false and that no showcause notice had been served on the duo.         
	The DSO students ransacked the rooms of SFI supporters in the hostel, said a police officer.         
	The students, armed with chains and iron rods, smashed lights, windowpanes and door frames.        
	When the police intervened, they were attacked. One student was seriously hurt.         
	Kabir and Diptangshu have been removed from the main hostel.        
	The college authorities can cancel their (the arrested students) right to stay in the hostel or take other disciplinary action, said Mitra.        
	Rally for principal         
	College principals and students today came out in support of Gargi Nath, the Jogomaya Devi College principal, who was heckled yesterday.         
	Over 60 principals gathered at Ashutosh College to protest the attack on Nath, who had barred students without adequate attendance from appearing for the Part I exams of Calcutta University.

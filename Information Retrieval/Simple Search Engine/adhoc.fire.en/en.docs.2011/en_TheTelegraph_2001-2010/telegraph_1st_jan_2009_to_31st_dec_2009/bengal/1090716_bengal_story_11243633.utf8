The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | 400 pursue Cong House leader and other MLAs across paddy fields 
                                                                                                               400 pursue Cong House leader and other MLAs across paddy fields 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Burdwan, July 15: A team of Congress MLAs was chased across paddy fields by armed CPM activists this afternoon in a pocket of Burdwan rocked by political clashes since the Lok Sabha polls.         
	Hit by stones, Katwa MLA Rabindranath Chatterjee needed eight stitches on his head, and Kandi MLA Apurba Sar- kar had to be hospitalised. The others were treated for cuts and bruises.         
	Legislature party leader Manas Bhuniya had led the nine MLAs escorted by about 20 policemen who allegedly scooted during the attack at Dhanyarukhi village, about 175km from Calcutta.        
	The MLAs were there with tarpaulin sheets, clothes, rice and wheat to be distributed among Congress and Trinamul Congress supporters whose houses had been attacked during the clashes.         
	As they got down from their cars at the approach to the village and started walking, around 400 people armed with stones, sticks and sharp weapons confronted them.        
	According to Bhuniya, the policemen following them at a distance did nothing when the mob closed in and almost surrounded the MLAs. Sensing trouble, the leaders got off the metalled road and started running, through knee-deep mud in some places.        
	While crossing the many small irrigation canals on the way, Englishbazar MLA Krishnendu Chowdhury and Garden Reachs Abdul Khalek Mollah fell. Partymen pulled them up but Chowdhury had to be carried on shoulders for most of the 3km.         
	Stones hurled from behind hit Chatterjee, Sarkar and Nargis Begum, who had contested the Lok Sabha polls from Burdwan-Durgapur.        
	The mob was chasing us and it was difficult to run through the muddy fields. But if we didnt run, we would have been killed, said Chatterjee.        
	Immediately before the attack, Bhuniya had called the chief minister. I told him to intervene, or we might get killed, the MLA said. He (Bud- dhadeb Bhattacharjee) said hed look into it immediately.        
	It is not clear what the chief minister did after that.        
	Additional superintendent of police Humayun Kabir confirmed the attack was carried out by CPM activists. Well arrest the culprits, he added.        
	A 12-hour bandh has been called tomorrow in Katwa subdivision, under which Dhanyarukhi village falls, and Nadia and Murshidabad districts. We will decide on Saturday whether to call a Bengal bandh, said Bhuniya.        
	Congress supporters blocked roads at several places in Burdwan district and set fire to a Calcutta-bound bus in Murshidabad.        
	Asked why the police did not protect the MLAs, circle inspector Samir Basak, who was with them, said: We tried, but were beaten back. Three of our men were injured.        
	The Congress leaders rubbished the defence. We saw them retreating from the moment it became clear that we were under attack, said the district Congress secretary.        
	State CPM secretary Biman Bose strongly condemned the incident. Political leaders and workers should be allowed to go to any part of the state. What has happened shouldnt have happened.         
	He added: The CPM has nothing to do with it. However, if anyone from the CPM is involved, the district committee will take action against them. If the police were present, they should have intervened.        
	There have been frequent clashes in Dhanyarukhi and neighbouring villages since the murder of CPM district committee member Falguni Mukherjee by suspected Trinamul supporters in mid-June.        
	District CPM secretary Amal Haldar said: The villagers were angry because Mukherjee was a popular leader .         
	Mamata Banerjee sought central intervention. The time has come for the Centre to go through the Constitution and take appropriate steps. The CPM-led government has lost the moral right to rule.         
	Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi called up Bhuniya this evening and apparently told the MLA he would take up the issue with the government.        
	On the trip, Bhuniya (the MLA from Sabang) also had with him MLAs Abu Hena (Lalgola), Asit Mal (Hasan), Nepal Mahato (Purulia) and Ajoy De (Shantipur).        
	The chief secretary said a large police force had been sent to the area and Section 144 imposed in Katwa town.        
	Last month, CPM supporters had prevented Trinamul MP Sudip Bandopadhyay and MLAs Partha Chatterjee and Madan Mitra from going to the area. Later, Congress leader Subrata Mukherjee did reach the place with relief.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Krishnagar, April 2: The remixed kirtan that offended followers of Sri Chaitanya was lopped off the film Challenge before it was screened at a Nadia cinema hall today.        
	A Nabadwip court had yesterday ordered that screening the film  starring Dev and Shubhashree  with the song Bhaja Gouranga should be stopped till April 17, the date of the next hearing. Rathindra Nath Kundu, the owner of the Sriguru Talkies, said: We cut off the song from the film.         
	On March 28, the Nabadwip Nagarik Adhikar Raksha Committee and the Sadhu Sant Samaj, an organisation of monks, demanded that the screening be stopped as the film hurt the sentiments of Vaishnavites.

	Sept. 9: At least five people have died and over 1,000 villages across south Bengal have gone under water following heavy rain and discharge from reservoirs.         
	Hooghly appears the worst hit, with almost half of the estimated 15 lakh flood victims living in that district.        
	We have sought the air forces help to drop relief materials over the flood-hit areas of Hooghly, finance minister Asim Dasgupta said at Writers Buildings.         
	Parts of Arambagh, Khanakul, Pursura and Tarakeswar in Hooghly are under chest-deep water since three rivers  the Damodar, Dwarakeswar and the Mundeswari  spilled their banks. Traffic on several roads has had to be stopped.        
	In West Midnapore, 2.5 lakh people have been affected in Ghatal, Daspur and Chandrakona.        
	Dasgupta said the government had asked the Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) not to release more water than necessary from its Maithon and Panchet reservoirs. On Monday, it had released nearly 3 lakh cusecs. The figure was 1.1 lakh cusecs today.        
	A five-year-old girl and a man in his 30s were killed when an old tree fell on a pandal erected for Manasa puja in Murshidabad town, about 220 km from Calcutta. Two men drowned in rivers in Bankuras Indus and Howrahs Udaynarayanpur. The body of a man in his 70s was found floating in the floodwaters in Ghatal.

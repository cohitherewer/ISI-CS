The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CM storms out of Writers flop show
                                                                                                               CM storms out of Writers flop show
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 27: If Writers Buildings babus need an ego boost, they need look no further than the technology at their command: it may be rustier.        
	At 5 this evening, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee launched a vaunted mission to video-link Writers with all 341 blocks in the state. At 5.55, he left the conference room, not having any more time to waste.        
	The chief minister began by saying the system was essential for queries and quick feedback from the grassroots. We had been holding videoconferences with the district magistrates. Now, such interaction will be possible with officials of all our blocks. You will see how I interact with them, he told journalists assembled to see the Writers tech leap.        
	For nearly an hour, what he mostly got were long peri- ods of silence punctuated by beeps and gurgling sounds, and more silence. The video was slightly more exciting: it flashed mugs of officials, though not the ones the chief minister wanted to speak to.        
	I have lots of work to do. If you cant connect me to Burdwan, tell me, Ill leave, the chief minister said at one point.        
	Burdwan didnt come. Bhattacharjee wore a grin, though, while blaming the machines for the fiasco and walking out. What I asked for was not delivered. I think the problem was with the machines.        
	IT minister Debesh Das blamed the babus in Burdwan for the mess. The district set-up failed to access the server.        
	The first block Bhattacharjee wanted to connect to was Gosaba in the Sunderbans, about 150km from Calcutta. Officials told the chief minister Patharpratima was online.         
	Then connect me to Pathar, said Bhattacharjee.        
	After a few questions on the progress of the rural emp-loyment guarantee scheme, the chief minister wanted a north Bengal block, and the Dinhata subdivisional officers face appeared. Can you hear me? Why is your speech garbled? Bhattacharjee asked. Silence followed.        
	Whats wrong? OK, get me Burdwan. That is the only district where the videoconference system has been introduced at the panchayat level. I want to know the zilla parishad chiefs experience in videoconferencing with panchayat functionaries, he said.        
	Officials pushed every key possible and then went into a huddle. Sir, we are not getting any response. There is a server problem.        
	Chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti called up a district official. The honourable chief minister has been waiting nearly half an hour to talk to you. Please do something, he has other preoccupations.        
	But the phone proved more reliable than the array of hi-tech gadgets.         
	After several attempts to connect to Burdwan, the chief minister said: I asked for Gosaba and you connected me to Patharpratima. I didnt want to talk to Bankura but you linked me to the districts Chhatna block. I couldnt even talk to the official in Dinhata. Somethings wrong with the set-up you are using. Debesh has to look into this at the earliest.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Calcutta police now for Salt Lake 
                                                                                                               Calcutta police now for Salt Lake 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 7: Eighteen police stations on the southern and northern fringes of the city, including Salt Lake, will be brought under Calcutta police.         
	We have decided in principle to bring some police stations on the fringes of the city under the jurisdiction of Calcutta police. The matter will be referred to the cabinet for ratification on February 17, home secretary Ardhendu Sen said today.        
	Of the 18 police stations, eight are in the North-24 Parganas, including all three Salt Lake police stations, and 10 in South-24 Parganas.         
	Of the areas to come under Calcutta police will be Lake Town, Baranagar, Belghoria, Dum Dum, Barrackpore on the northern fringes and Sonarpur, Jadavpur, Thakurpukur, Maheshtala, Kasba, Behala, Tiljala, Garia, Metiabruz and Budge Budge in the south.        
	Director-general of police A.B. Vohra will discuss the matter further with the home secretary on Monday.        
	Officials said today that the government had proposed the step a decade ago for better policing. The proposal had not been implemented because of paucity of funds, said an official. But the Centre has now allotted Rs 36 crore for the year, home secretary Sen said.        
	Ajey Ranade, the superintendent of police, South-24 Parganas, welcomed the government decision. The decision to bring rural police stations under the city police will help us control criminal activities better. The city police commissioner has magisterial powers unlike district police chiefs. This would help in better policing, he said.        
	Ranade added that the functioning of Calcutta police is decentralised that also helps in operations. Calcutta police has several departments to deal with crimes of a certain kind. Like the detective department sees into murders and robberies, the traffic department manages road violation cases. But in a district, the SP has to oversee everything.

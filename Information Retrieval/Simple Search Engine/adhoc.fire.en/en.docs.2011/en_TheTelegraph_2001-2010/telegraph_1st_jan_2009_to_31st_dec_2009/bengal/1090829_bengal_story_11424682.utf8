The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Callousness crushes head
                                                                                                               Callousness crushes head
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          A woman with her hand stuck out of a bus in Suri on Friday. (Indrajit Roy)                                   
	Bolpur, Aug. 28: A fathers head was smashed in front of his four-year-old daughter when he stuck it out of a bus this afternoon.        
	Laltu Bagdi, an affluent farmer, was killed in Dubrajpur, Birbhum, days after three passengers hanging their elbows out in Calcutta lost their limbs.         
	Laltu had put his head out because he wanted to spit. He was sitting by the window on the left of the bus, about to take a turn. He did not see the truck coming from the opposite direction. He was killed on the spot, said Amar Mondal, 56, a co-passenger.        
	The incident took place on a national highway about 260km from Calcutta.        
	The father and daughter were returning home to Lokpur, about 30km from Suri, where they had gone to a relative.        
	The child, seated on her fathers lap, fainted after the accident. Doctors could not say for sure if it was out of shock or the physical impact of the crash. She is conscious now and under observation in hospital.        
	Birbhum district magistrate Bisweswar Maity said the Calcutta incident should have alerted passengers. We had asked bus owners to put up notices in vehicles warning people against sticking their bodies out. But awareness is still missing among passengers.        
	He added that a fresh initiative would be launched soon with the help of local schools.

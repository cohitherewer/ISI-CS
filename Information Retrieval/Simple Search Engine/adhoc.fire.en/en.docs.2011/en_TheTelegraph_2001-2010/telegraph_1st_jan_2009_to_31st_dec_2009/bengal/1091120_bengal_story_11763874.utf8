          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 19: Trinamul Congress MP Kabir Suman today said he did not know when he would attend Parliament and, even if he did, he would neither accept his salary nor his allowance.        
	I am not going to accept the daily allowance and the monthly salary of Rs 16,000 as a member of the Lok Sabha even if I attend the session. I had spoken out against some party leaders because I felt aggrieved. They have to be resolved first, he said.        
	Earlier, Suman had said he was seriously considering quitting the party and his post in Parliament.        
	Today, he again slammed a section of the party that is out to prevent me from carrying out development projects.         
	I know some party leaders who do not like me are spreading canards against me. This has to be stopped. I have my self-respect, he said.         
	However, he indicated it was important for him that Trinamul won the 2011 Assembly polls, saying: Aamar ijjat jemon aachhe, 2011 shalo aachhe (my self-respect is important and so are the 2011 elections).        
	Author Mahasweta Devi spoke to Suman today, this time over the phone, to persuade him to attend the Lok Sabha and promise that all his grievances would be looked into.         
	She had invited the Jadavpur MP to her house yesterday at Mamata Banerjees behest.        
	I again tried to convince Suman that he should attend Parliament. He said he did not want Mamata to be hurt. So I hope he would act in the right perspective, she said today.        
	Theatre person Bratya Bose, who emerged today as a potential trouble-shooter for the first time, said he along with others like Bivash Chakraborty would meet the MP tomorrow. After talking to Suman, I was given to understand that he would join Parliament once Mamatadi speaks to him. Didi will speak to him on her return to Calcutta, he added.         
	Trinamuls Lok Sabha chief whip Sudip Bandopadhyay said he got a text message from Suman last night in which he expressed his inability to attend Parliament today. He did not say he would skip the entire session. I consider this a positive gesture because Im convinced he would be here from Monday, he said from Delhi.        
	He will speak to Suman in a day or two so that he attends the session.         
	A Trinamul minister said he hoped Suman would change his mind once Mamata spoke to him.

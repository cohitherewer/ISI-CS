The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CM visits Basu after Writers replay
                                                                                                               CM visits Basu after Writers replay
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Calcutta, Oct. 17: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today visited Jyoti Basu at his Salt Lake home a day after Trinamul MLAs had laid siege to his Writers Buildings office.        
	Some party leaders called it as a courtesy visit. They said Bhattacharjee asked after Basus health and did not discuss politics.        
	Others said the visit today could be in connection with yesterdays incident when Trinamul leader of the Opposition Partha Chatterjee and other party leaders laid siege to Bhattacharjees chamber at Writers Buildings.        
	In 1993, Basu had faced a similar protest by Mamata Banerjee, who was a Youth Congress leader and a minister at the Centre then.        
	Basu had ordered the police to haul Mamata out of Writers Buildings.        
	Yesterday, too, Chatterjee and three other MLAs were forced out on Bhattacharjees instructions.         
	Although the CPM senior leader is no longer active in politics, Mamata has tried to play the Basu card more than once, visiting him at his home and lauding him as an elderly statesman during the Singur and Nandigram land agitation.        
	Then, Basu too reciprocated her gestures, inviting her for talks to solve the Singur problem but he failed to prevail upon her.        
	Bhattacharjees visit apparently was also aimed at galvanising party cadres before Assembly by-elections to 10 seats across Bengal.         
	The symbolism of the visit has gained more significance as the CPM today observed the 90th anniversary of the founding of the undivided Communist Party in India.         
	Although Jyotibabu was not among the founding fathers, he is the last of that generation. He is still our tallest leader and biggest rallying point for not only our rank and file but also for the Left Front partners. He is a source of inspiration at a difficult time. So it is natural that Buddhada felt like visiting him today, said a CPM state secretariat member.         
	Addressing party workers this morning on the occasion of the anniversary, CPM state secretary Biman Bose lamented that the Communist Party failed to spread beyond its traditional bases in the last 90 years.         
	He sounded concerned about the adverse situation that the ruling Left had been facing in the wake of successive poll reversals.         
	He exhorted the CPM cadres to pull up their socks and strengthen unity in the ranks in order to counter the fascist-like attacks led by the Trinamul-Maoists combine.        
	He said that all members should participate in party activities regularly.         
	Bose cautioned the rank and file to shun their non-communist lifestyle and attitudes.        
	The party had earlier admitted that public anger against corruption of its leaders and arrogance of power was one of the major factors behind its poll losses.

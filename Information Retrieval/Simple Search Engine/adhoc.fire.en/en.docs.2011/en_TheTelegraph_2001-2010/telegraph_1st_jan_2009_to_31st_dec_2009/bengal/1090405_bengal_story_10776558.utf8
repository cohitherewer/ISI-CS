The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Adhir choice against Cong nominee
                                                                                                               Adhir choice against Cong nominee
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Murshidabad/Calcutta, April 4: Adhir Chowdhury, the Murshidabad district Congress chief, has fielded an Independent against his own partys candidate Abdul Mannan Hossain, exactly a week after patching up with him.        
	Adhir, who is the Behrampore MP, was not available for comment but Mehdi Alam Mirza, the Murshidabad municipality chairman, said he was in the fray with Adhirdas blessings. I have taken permission from Adhirda to contest the Murshidabad seat as an Independent. I have already begun writing graffiti requesting voters to support me instead of Mannan, he said.        
	On March 28, Adhir and Mannan were said to have resolved their differences in the presence of an AICC observer. Adhir had opposed Mannans re-nomination from Murshidabad because he thought the MP had lost touch with the party rank and file.         
	But on March 28 he said: Once the AICC has given the nomination to Mannan, we should all work for him.         
	Party sources said Mehdis presence in the fray could jeopardise Mannans prospects.        
	Mannan does not think so. It hardly matters if he contests as an Independent. People will vote for the hand symbol, he said.         
	In Calcutta, state Congress working president Pradip Bhattacharya said: Mannan is our official nominee. If anyone in the party contests the same seat as an Independent, he will face disciplinary action.

	Tamluk, May 4: Trinamul Congress activists last night demolished a culvert across a narrow canal in Nandigram to block a route that CPM supporters took to enter their strongholds last year.        
	Local Trinamul Congress leaders said the supporters broke down the narrow bridge at Chanderpul after the murder of Trinamul activist Prasanta Mandal in Khejuri, a CPM area, on Friday night and the recovery of 30 crude bombs, again in Khejuri, yesterday.         
	 Nandigram falls under the Tamluk Lok Sabha constituency, which votes on May 7.         
	 Khejuri lies on one side of the Talpatti canal and on the other side are CPM and Trinamul areas divided by another narrow canal. The culvert the Trinamul activists demolished last night was on this smaller canal. The culvert leads to the Trinamul villages.         
	Last August, CPM cadres crossed it to enter Sonachura.        
	Today, CPM and Trinamul supporters also exchanged fire and hurled bombs at each other around 9pm at Satengabari in Nandigram.         
	There were no reports of injuries.

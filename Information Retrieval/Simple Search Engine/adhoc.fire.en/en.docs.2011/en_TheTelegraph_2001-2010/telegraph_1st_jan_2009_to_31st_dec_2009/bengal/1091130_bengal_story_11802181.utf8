The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CPM plans morality watchdog
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      CPM plans morality watchdog
          BISWAJIT ROY                          Nirupam Sen, Biman Bose, Prakash Karat and Sitaram Yechury at the meeting. (SK Sinha)                                  
	Calcutta, Nov. 29: The CPM has decided to set up a disciplinary authority to probe charges of corruption against members both at the central and state levels as it believes their immoral activities have contributed to the Lefts poll debacles in Bengal.         
	Addressing the first session of the CPM state committee meeting today to ponder internal rectification, party general secretary Prakash Karat referred to the need to set up such an authority.         
	According to some of the participants, he said the disciplinary body  whose name has yet to be decided  would investigate charges levelled by insiders as well as others and recommend disciplinary action. The body will have the authority to even probe elected representatives.        
	The move is part of the seven-point prescription that the party central committee approved at its last meeting to stem the rot, particularly in Bengal, Kerala and Tripura.         
	A state committee statement today quoted Karat as calling for unhesitating steps against deviations from party principles and political morality. Admitting that the partys rectification campaign in 1996-97 could not achieve complete success, Karat said non-communist values had made further inroads because of the neo-liberal market economy and lack of ideo-political training among new-generation members.         
	Although Karat did not mention it, the central committee had mooted another move to rein in vested interests: fixing the tenures of organisational heads at all levels, from the branch committee secretary to the general secretary. The principle was to be followed in the case of elected representatives too, from Parliament to panchayats.         
	The Communist Party of China also has an internal authority to rein in graft. The government there is known to have even executed party mandarins for corruption.         
	Although a dwarf in comparison to the CPC in size and power, the CPM has for the first time decided to emulate the Big Brother, albeit without the execution bit. The decision came as realisation dawned about the moral corrosion the party had suffered in its 32 years in power in Bengal and intermittent stints in Kerala.         
	A central committee member said graft charges and other complaints on moral and ethical grounds were piling against a section of the party.         
	The main (disciplinary) body will be under the central committee while the major state units will set up corresponding empowered committees, a member said.         
	The CPM constitution has no provision for such a body now but there are central and state party-controlled commissions that work as internal appellate bodies to hear members unhappy with disciplinary action.         
	Today, Karat himself stressed the public accountability and credibility of elected representatives and party mandarins.         
	He told the members not to hold extravagant conferences. He urged them go back to the people with collection boxes for funds instead of depending on moneybags who later lobby the party and government for favours. Karat also told them to desist from displays of wealth and power, evident in the lavish weddings in many leaders families.         
	Politburo member Nirupam Sen indicated the partys admission of how power had corrupted the Bengal comrades. Rectification is needed more when we are in power, he told reporters.         
	In a recent write-up in the CPMs Hindi organ, patriarch Jyoti Basu had asked for stern action against corruption and immoral activities.        
	After todays meeting, a veteran said: The leadership is making politically correct noises. But its too late. Taking strong action against the rotten elements is fraught with the risk of a backlash before the polls, given the factionalism.

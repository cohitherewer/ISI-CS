	Calcutta, Dec. 23: The cabinet today decided to adopt a policy which, if implemented, will make participation in sports compulsory at school level.        
	The objective is to develop sports facilities for every student, finance minister Asim Dasgupta said after the cabinet meeting. However, since many of the states 14,000-odd high schools do not have any playground, the focus will be on disciplines like kabaddi, khokho, carrom and chess.

                                                                                                               Mom for a Mamata
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Supriya and Ashis with their daughter. (Dipankar Chatterjee)                                   
	Burdwan, May 20: A Mamata Banerjee fan today took a Mamata home in her arms, tears trickling down.        
	The two-month-old, smug in Supriya Sens company, had been found in a roadside bush in Burdwan town.        
	On March 18, Supriya had stepped out of her flat for a look at the newborn she heard was wrapped in a piece of cloth and lying not far away.        
	There were many around the baby, but Supriya picked her up. She looked pathetic with several scratch marks on her body, the woman said.        
	Supriya took her to Burdwan Medical College and Hospital and returned there the next day with her husband to tell the superintendent she wanted the baby to be hers.        
	Supriya Sen, 38, and Ashis, 47, who are married for 20 years, were childless until this afternoon. The diehard Trinamul Congress supporters named their baby Mamata.        
	I had wanted to mother this girl from the time I saw her, Supriya said. Now that I have become a mummy after so many years, I am a little nervous. Im holding her tight.        
	Last evening, the couple went together to buy dresses, food and feeding bottles.         
	When they reached home this afternoon, about a hundred neighbours had assembled to greet the new Sen.        
	Ashis, who has a life-size cutout of Mamata Banerjee in his house, said: I was a Youth Congress worker when she was its state president. I went to her Kalighat house and saw how simply she lives. I feel proud that my daughter will be known as Mamata.         
	However, to be little Mamatas legal parents, the Sens will have to wait for at least a year. She will be in their foster care for the time being. The couple will have to apply to court for formal adoption. Well observe the child for at least a year to ascertain whether she is being cared for. Then we will give a report to the court and the certificate, said Madhumati Jajotia, head of the central governments child welfare committee in Burdwan.        
	The Sens took custody of the child at the committees office at a government-run home for destitutes.         
	They had applied to us in March. We interviewed them and enquired about their income and reputation in their locality. They are honest and respected by neighbours, said Jajotia.        
	Ashis, a typist in the Burdwan court compound, also gives private tuition at home and earns Rs 9,000 a month.

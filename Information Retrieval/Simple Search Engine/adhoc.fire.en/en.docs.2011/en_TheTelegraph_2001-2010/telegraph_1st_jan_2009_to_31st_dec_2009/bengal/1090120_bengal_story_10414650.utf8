	Calcutta, Jan. 19: An improvised gun-making unit being run by a bandit out on bail was unearthed in South 24-Parganas Joynagar today.        
	Six one-shotters, yet to be fitted with butts, and equipment like vice machines, a hacksaw and a heavy-duty drill were found in Giasuddin Lashkars 10ftX6ft factory with a tin shed.         
	Police said the handguns had a range of about 10 metres and were much in demand.        
	We had come to know about a unit in Joynagar, 55km from Calcutta, that was churning out guns in large numbers, said South 24-Parganas police chief Ajey Ranade.         
	Giasuddin, 40, had apparently engaged five workers.        
	Joynagar officer-in-charge Somdeb Banerjee led the raid around 4am today.        
	Guns have been used freely in political clashes in the Joynagar-Kultali area over the past few months. There also have been several clashes among villagers over land where guns were used. We had suspected a steady local supply, he added.        
	Giasuddin apparently told the police his one-shotters were in demand among political activists as well as criminals. We now are on alert as the Lok Sabha polls are close, an officer said.        
	This is the third gun factory unearthed in South 24-Parganas since the panchayat polls last May.

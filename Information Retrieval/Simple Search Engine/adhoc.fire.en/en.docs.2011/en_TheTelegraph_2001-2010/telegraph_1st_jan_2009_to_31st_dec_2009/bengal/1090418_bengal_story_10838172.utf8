The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Power cut alarm rings
                                                                                                               Power cut alarm rings
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, April 17: A power crisis stares Bengal in the face as state-run plants have been forced to bring down generation because of dwindling supply of coal.        
	The situation was further compounded today as a 250MW unit at Santaldih developed a snag.         
	The combined shortfall in Calcutta and the districts shot up to 625MW in the evening. If the deficit was 125MW in the city with blackouts raging from an hour to 90 minutes, the districts witnessed power cuts that were over four hours long.         
	State power plants that generate over 3,000MW a day produced 2,460MW today.        
	Power cuts had plagued the state even during the higher secondary examinations that ended yesterday. The crisis should be particularly worrying for the Left Front government because power tends to become an issue whether it is a local poll or a general election. It could turn even more emotive with the IPL kicking off tomorrow.        
	We have revived the Santaldih unit and the situation is expected to improve tomorrow. But we are getting coal supplies below our daily requirement, S. Mahapatra, managing director of the West Bengal Power Development Corporation, said tonight.         
	Executive director D.P. Roy Choudhury said the supply of coal had gone down over the past fortnight. We need about 48,000 tonnes daily at Kolaghat, Bakreswar, Sagardighi, Santaldih and Bandel. But we have been getting 45,000 tonnes. This is eating into our buffer stocks.        
	Roy Choudhury held a series of meetings with Coal India officials today, urging them to step up supply.        
	Coal India said it was looking into the reasons for the faltering supply. It is mainly because of scarcity of wagons in Orissa, said an official.        
	The power development corporation said the buffer stock of 6.5 lakh tonnes of coal had gone down to 5 lakh tonnes in a fortnight. Bakreswar has about 25 days stock, Kolaghat 10, Santaldih 12 and Sagardighi five.         
	At one point, Bandel was virtually without any coal stock, an official said.        
	If the supply does not improve, the stocks could be exhausted sooner than expected. We are still left with half of April and the whole of May, when demand hovers around 4,900MW, an official said.

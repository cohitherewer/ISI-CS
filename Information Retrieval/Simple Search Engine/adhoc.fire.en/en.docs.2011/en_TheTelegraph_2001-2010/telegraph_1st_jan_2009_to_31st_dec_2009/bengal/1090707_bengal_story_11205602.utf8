The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CPM lauds varsity push
                                                                                                               CPM lauds varsity push
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, July 6: CPM leaders are happy with Pranab Mukherjees move for an Aligarh Muslim University campus in Bengal at a time the communitys misgivings about education and job opportunities in the state are perceived to have led to the erosion of the partys minority support base.        
	The Union finance minister today allocated Rs 25 crore this year to develop the infrastructure of the proposed campus in Muslim-majority Murshidabad.         
	Although many spied in it a bid to appease the electorate of a district where all three seats are held by the Congress, including Mukherjees Jangipur, the CPM dubbed it a result of joint efforts by the Centre and the state.         
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, too, had been pressing for such a facility and mentioned the need for it during a visit to Murshidabad yesterday.        
	We are happy with the budget allocation for the project, which both Pranabbabu and the chief minister took keen interest in, said CPM Rajya Sabha member Mainul Hasan, who hails from Murshidabad.         
	Hasan is believed to have played a key role in bringing AMU to Bengal in his capacity as a member of the universitys decision-making body.        
	According to him, the Centre will fully fund the projects infrastructure, estimated to cost around Rs 300 crore. The campus will be set up on around 300 acres, already with the central water resources department in Suti block near Farakka, 350km from Calcutta.         
	Bengal had been locked in a tussle with Delhi for the surplus land lying with the department once under its control. But now, Hasan said, Bengal has greenlighted its transfer to the Union human resources ministry for the university.         
	However, there are differences among Muslim leaders even in the CPM on whether an independent university would have been better.        
	If the state can set up new universities in Malda (Gourbanga), North 24-Parganas (in Barasat) and Purulia (named after tribal icons Birsa-Sidhu-Kanu), why not another one focused on higher education among minorities? asked a Muslim state minister.         
	Even a Calcutta University campus would have been better. AMU cant be considered academically better than CU.        
	But Hasan made it clear that the states move was primarily guided by the fact that the Centre would bear the financial cost for a central university campus. We had been asking for a central university for long, but the NDA government had refused it on the ground that we already had one in Visva-Bharati.         
	According to him, AMU now has around 1,200 students from Bengal, primarily from Murshidabad, Malda and North 24-Parganas.         
	In Murshidabad, both science and humanities streams will be taught, he added.         
	The CPM-led governments bid to assuage the sense of discrimination among the states over 25 per cent Muslim population hasnt been limited to lauding the AMU campus.         
	Alia Madrasah, the oldest madarsa in Calcutta, is being elevated to the status of a university. The government has already allocated Rs 17 crore for the purchase of 65 acres for its main campus in South 24-Parganas Bhangar. It has bought over two acres in Calcutta for the womens campus.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Mob tries to drown BDO
                                                                                                               Mob tries to drown BDO
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Malda, July 8: Residents of a village inching towards extinction bodily lifted the block development officer and threatened to drown him in a raging river before all of us go down.        
	Some other villagers rescued Narboo Tshering Lepcha, who had gone to the village 50km from Malda town last night to negotiate the release of an embankment project engineer being held hostage there.        
	In the past three days, the Fulhar has gobbled up 600 metres of the embankment guarding Bhaluka village. Cracks have appeared in the portion of the dyke still standing and the villagers are worried that once that goes, the river will take away all that they have.        
	The engineer, Salil Pal, went to the village yesterday morning to supervise anti-erosion work that the villagers felt was an eyewash. The em-bankment should have been strengthened before the rain arrived, they said.        
	Harishchandrapur II BDO Lepcha was pleading with the villagers to release Pal when some of them cried out drown him before we are all drowned and lifted him.         
	Another group snatched him away and smuggled him into a house from where police whisked him away.        
	What was my fault? Lepcha asked today. He has lodged a police complaint against the villagers.        
	Irrigation officials said the Fulhar had been in spate for the past few days and the water level was a metre below the extreme danger mark.         
	Massive erosion has also been reported from Manikchak, about 30km from Bhaluka.        
	We have started introducing anti-erosion measures in these areas on an emergency basis, said a senior official of the Mahananda project, of which Pal is a part.        
	The measures are primitive  dropping sandbags and boulders  and the villagers feel it may be too late for that.         
	Irrigation department executive engineer Biren Das said the local panchayat samiti had sanctioned Rs 5 lakh to meet the immediate crisis. We will soon start building a permanent embankment. Tenders have been floated.        
	Bhaluka residents said the work on the permanent embankment should have started by now. We had been telling the irrigation department for over a year that nothing less than a concrete embankment will be of any use. But they did not listen to us, said Suresh Chowdhury, secretary of a residents association.

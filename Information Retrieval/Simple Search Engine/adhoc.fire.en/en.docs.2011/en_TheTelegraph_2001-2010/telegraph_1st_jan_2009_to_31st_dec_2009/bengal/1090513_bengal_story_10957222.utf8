The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Party and Subhas differ on third front 
                                                                                                               Party and Subhas differ on third front 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, May 12: The states CPM leadership today sought to distance itself from transport minister and state secretariat member Subhas Chakrabortys scepticism about Prakash Karats third front expe-riment.         
	Visibly embarrassed about Chakrabortys subtle critici- sm of the partys top leaders in a TV interview last night, state CPM secretary Biman Bose issued a statement saying comrade Chakrabortys comments have no connection whatsoever with the political position of the CPM.        
	His assessment of the Congress goes against the understanding of our party. What he has said on the decision of not joining a Congress-led government in 2004 is contrary to the resolutions of the central committee and the party congress.         
	A self-proclaimed disciple of Jyoti Basu, Chakraborty had earlier slammed the party brass for not allowing Basu to be Prime Minister in 1996. Yesterday, he said: It would have been better had we joined the UPA government in 2004.         
	Like Somnath Chatterjee, Chakraborty had not liked the withdrawal of Left support to the UPA government over the Indo-US nuclear deal and had opposed voting along with the BJP against the trust motion.         
	Bose said: Had we not withdrawn support, it would have meant our acceptance of the Congress governments surrender to US imperialism.        
	He also reacted to Chakrabortys scepticism about the credibility of Karats third front partners like Orissa chief minister Naveen Patnaik  a BJP ally till the other day  and the stability of a non-BJP, non-Congress government. He said the central committee had taken a unanimous decision to try to forge a third front government and talks with Patnaik were part of that initiative.         
	He also certified Patnaiks secular credentials. The BJD has severed its BJP links.         
	Championing the partys official line, Bose said a third front government promising secular, pro-people policies and a genuinely federal system and independent foreign policy is possible.        
	The repeated mention of the unanimous nature of decisions in the central committee was apparently aimed at countering Chakrabortys complaints about the unelected but powerful coterie of party leaders.         
	However, Bose didnt react to Chakrabortys prescription that all top leaders should get the popular mandate before assuming high office.

                                                                                                               In the clear, doctor files FIR against attackers
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Serampore, Sept. 22: A doctor from Behala who was beaten up by a mob that charged him with raping and murdering his domestic help has filed an FIR against the attackers after the post-mortem showed there was no sexual assault.        
	Police, which had started a case of rape and murder against gynaecologist Mihir Saha under pressure from the mob before the details were known, will now move court to have the charges quashed.        
	However, the police will wait for the viscera report before giving the final clean chit.        
	The police and doctors said preliminary investigation suggested that Rozina Khatoon, 22, was a tuberculosis patient and she could have died after choking on the blood she vomited. She was found dead in the doctors chamber in Hooghlys Serampore yesterday, triggering a mob attack in which Saha suffered a skull fracture.        
	The post-mortem revealed that the girl was a patient of acute tuberculosis and died because of that. As soon as we came to know about it, we released the doctor, his driver and a local sweet shop owner on personal recognition bonds, Serampore sub-divisional police officer Ajay Thakur said.        
	In the FIR, Saha has charged his attackers with assault, unlawful assembly and ransacking his chamber. We are trying to identify those who attacked the doctor. We will arrest them, a police officer said.

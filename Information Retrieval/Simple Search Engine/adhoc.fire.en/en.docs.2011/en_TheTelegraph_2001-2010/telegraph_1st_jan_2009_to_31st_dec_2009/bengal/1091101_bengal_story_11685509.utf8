The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Talks bid to open varsity
                                                                                                               Talks bid to open varsity
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Oct. 31: The Visva-Bharati executive council, which met in Calcutta today with the single objective of finding a way to end the week-long impasse in the university, today decided to return to Santiniketan and call the striking employees for talks.        
	No classes have been held in the institution since last Friday because of an agitation by employees demanding a CBI probe into corruption charges against the vice-chancellor and his resignation.        
	VC Rajat Kanta Ray refused to divulge what steps the universitys highest decision-making body had mulled to ensure normal academic activities on the campus. But he said: The members of the council have unanimously observed that it is extremely necessary to restore normal academic activities as early as possible. The members are going back to Santiniketan tonight and they will sit with the agitating employees to solve the crisis.        
	However, an immediate end to the crisis may not be in sight. Debabrata Sarkar, the leader of the universitys non-teaching employees body, ruled out talks until the VC was asked to go on leave. There is no use holding another meeting. We have had enough of them. A proper inquiry into our charges cannot take place in the VCs presence, he said.        
	Sarkar added that the employees against whom Ray had brought corruption charges were willing to go on leave during the probe.        
	However, the council has ruled out asking Ray to go on leave. No action can be taken against the VC unless the charges against him are proved, said a senior member.

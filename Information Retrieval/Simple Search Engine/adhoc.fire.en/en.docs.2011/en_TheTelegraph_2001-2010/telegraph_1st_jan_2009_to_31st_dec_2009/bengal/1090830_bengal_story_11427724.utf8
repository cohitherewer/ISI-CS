          OUR BUREAU                              
	Aug. 29: Two CPM supporters were shot dead today by suspected Maoists in West Midnapore and Purulia, both rebel strongholds.        
	Police said that Lakshmi Kanta Kumar, a 50-year- old CPM local committee secretary was waylaid by a group of Maoists when he was returning home in Arsa, Purulia, about 360km from Calcutta.        
	Lakshmi was going home after completing party work around 7pm.         
	The spot where he was murdered is near a CRPF camp in Mudali, which is near Arsa.        
	Five assailants on motorbikes fired at Lakshmi from a close range. He died on the spot. The assailants fled under the cover of darkness, said a police officer.        
	Mohammed Ibrahim, a CPM district secretariat member in Purulia, who rushed to the Sindhurpur village, condemned the incident and said the Maoists were involved.        
	In another incident, an armed gang of Maoists killed Bidyut Baran Das in Binpur, West Midnapore.        
	Forty-eight-year-old Bidyut, too, was fired at from a close range.        
	The assailants stopped Bidyut, a poultry seller, when he was returning home on his bicycle around 9am. He was shot in the forehead.         
	The villagers found him lying in a pool of blood and took him to Jhargram subdivisional hospital where he died of his injuries.        
	Bidyut was our party supporter. The Maoists suspected that he used to work as a police informer, said Narottam Maity, local committee member of Belatikri, also in West Midnapore        
	There is no witness to the incident. But preliminary investigations show that the killing is the handiwork of the Maoists, said an official of Binpur police station.

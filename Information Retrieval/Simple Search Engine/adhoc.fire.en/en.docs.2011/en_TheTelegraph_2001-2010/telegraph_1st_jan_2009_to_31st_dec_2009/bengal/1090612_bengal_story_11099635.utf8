	Midnapore/Bankura, June 11: A CPM branch committee member was stabbed to death in Lalgarh tonight, capping a day through which supporters of the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities clashed with opponents in West Midnapore and Bankura.        
	The CPM alleged that Shalku Soren, 48, was dragged from his home and butchered. The committee denied it. Five people were injured when suspected CPM supporters set fire to 25 shops and two motorbikes in Bankuras Ranibandh.

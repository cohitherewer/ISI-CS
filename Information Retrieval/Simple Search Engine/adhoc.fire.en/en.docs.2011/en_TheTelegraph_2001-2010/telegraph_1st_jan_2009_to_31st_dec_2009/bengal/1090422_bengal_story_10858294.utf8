          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Midnapore, April 21: Over a dozen people came on motorcycles, dragged three CPM members out of their homes in Maoist-hit Salboni and shot dead two of them.        
	The third was rushed to hospital with a bullet inside.        
	Salboni is only 5km from Lalgarh where the rebels are believed to be guiding a tribal resistance against the police. Villagers will meet there tomorrow to decide whether to allow central forces to enter the area for the April 30 polls.        
	West Midnapore police suspect Maoists raided Nadaria village around 1.30pm.         
	They took Saktipada Sen, 50, Hambir Mandi, 46, and Ranjit Singh, 40, to the Kalaimuri jungle and fired at them from revolvers before stabbing them, said an officer.        
	Villagers started looking for the CPMs Nadaria branch committee members after they felt the assailants had left the forest.         
	They found Sen and Mandi dead. Singh, who was groaning in pain, was taken to a hospital in Bankuras Sarenga, about 40km away.         
	Sen was a farmer who owned over an acre and a half and while Mandi and Singh were farm labourers.        
	Police sources said the strike could have been timed to scare villagers going to a CPM rally in Salboni for its Jhargram candidate.         
	West Midnapore police chief Manoj Verma said suspected Maoists were involved in the murders.        
	CPM district leader Dahareswar Sen said the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities, which is leading the Lalgarh protests, could also have a hand in the murders.

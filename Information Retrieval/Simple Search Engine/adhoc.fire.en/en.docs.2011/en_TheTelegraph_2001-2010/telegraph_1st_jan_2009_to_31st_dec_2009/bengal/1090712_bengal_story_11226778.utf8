	Pabitra, the 23-year-old son of Panchu Roy who is a Class IV government employee, and Sabitri were said to be in love.        
	Last night, when 20-year-old Sabitri did not come home  she had not told the family where she was going  Sudhir went to the Roys residence, on the outskirts of Malda, about 360km from Calcutta. When he knocked on their door, the Roys did not respond.        
	Sudhir left but came back with two relatives, Bachchan Ghosh and Sudip Ghosh, after half an hour. This time Panchu responded. The girls father asked Panchu to either to bring Sabitri out or face dire consequences.         
	He kept saying that Panchu knew the whereabouts of Pabitra and Sabitri.         
	A heated argument followed between the fathers. While the two were quarrelling, Panchus 20-year-old daughter Chandana came in carrying sister Sharmilas daughter Rimi, a little over two years old. Chandana also said the family had no idea where Pabitra was.

	Sudhir and his family fled after the incident. Pabitra and Sabitri are still untraced.

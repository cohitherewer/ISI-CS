The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Morcha firm on bandh
                                                                                                               Morcha firm on bandh
                            
	Darjeeling, July 14: The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha today said it would not withdraw the indefinite strike in the hills just because the Centre had promised another tripartite meeting.         
	Well consider calling off the strike only after looking at its outcome, Morcha president Bimal Gurung said.         
	The outfit also insisted that the talks would have to be held on the single agenda of Gorkhaland. Gurung said it must be a dialogue at the political level (and not secretary level as in the past).        
	The tripartite meeting is slated for August 24. Darjeeling district magistrate Surendra Gupta said: The state informed (the Morcha in a letter today) the Centre is willing to hold the talks next month. It has requested that the strike be withdrawn so the talks can be held in a congenial atmosphere.         
	The Morcha said it was willing to hold a meeting with the chief minister as well, but only on Gorkhaland.         
	However, it piped down down its stand on children in hill school hostels, saying it could arrange for their rations during the bandh. Earlier, the Morcha had had asked them to leave the hills.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Jawan kills boss
                                                                                                               Jawan kills boss
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Krishnagar, June 2: A BSF jawan has gone missing after gunning down his superior, possibly after being hauled up for shirking duty near a border outpost in Nadia.        
	Police said Ranjit Singh, 35, is on the run. A search has been launched.        
	Ranjit killed sub-inspector Hoshiar Singh, 45, who was in charge at Fatehpur in Hanskhali, 150km from Calcutta.        
	A police officer said a pre-liminary probe revealed that Ranjit was missing at his post when the officer went on an inspection last night. When Hoshiar Singh spotted him elsewhere, an altercation possibly ensued during which the jawan shot him in the chest.        
	Alerted by the gunshot, other jawans rushed in and found the officer dead.        
	Additional superintendent of police Annappa E. said: We are yet to find out the actual reason behind the murder.        
	Sources said Ranjit, who is from Himachal Pradesh, was inducted into the force in 2000.         
	The BSF has begun its own probe into the incident. There was no problem over leave, an officer said. Discontent over denial of leave is one of the biggest reasons behind fragging in the country.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Metro rush-season scare
                                                                                                               Metro rush-season scare
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	Calcutta, Sept. 12: Calcutta had another harrowing weekend on Metro and promise-a-day Mamata Banerjee spoke of more trains and ticket counters.         
	But the four new rakes and 20 ticket counters she promised could be woefully inadequate to cope with the rush. The chaos in stations could reach staggering proportions during Puja, warned senior Metro officials who did not want to be named.        
	The railway minister herself gave an indication of what lay ahead when she said: Metro passengers will have to bear with the problems for another two-three months. It takes time for a new thing to fall into place.         
	She was speaking at Sealdah station after flagging off two daily trains  one from Calcutta to Ajmer Sharif and the other between New Farakka and Nabadwip Dham.        
	Mamata said the new Metro counters would work from Monday. After the (Tollygunge to Garia Bazar) expansion, the number of passengers has gone up by one lakh every day. So we are opening these counters, she added.        
	According to sources, Metro carried around four lakh passengers every day before the August 23 expansion. The number has now gone up to over five lakh.         
	It will increase by at least 20 per cent more during Puja and the situation would be difficult. Metro has never handled such a huge number of passengers before, a senior Metro official said.        
	There are 153 ticket counters now to handle the five lakh-plus passengers. Ideally, there should have been over 200, not just 20 more.        
	According to Metros own operating standards, it should take only three minutes for a passenger to enter a station, buy a ticket and reach the platform. But with queues for tickets now reaching the stairs, it would be an impossible feat. I stand in the queue at Central for more than 10 minutes on an average and miss one train every day, said Madhura Sarkar, a college student who commutes between Kalighat and Central.         
	The ride, too, is not Metro any more, complained some.        
	Four new rakes are expected to arrive in December and till then passengers will have to bear with the problem (of overcrowding), the railway minister said.        
	The new rakes (which should take the total number to 18) were scheduled to arrive earlier but the coach factory (Integral in Perambur, Chennai) has delayed delivery, she said.        
	Once all the rakes arrive, Metro will be able to maintain the six-minute frequency, but the entire signalling system has to be overhauled for the promised four minutes.        
	The system is manual now and one train has to wait two stations behind another.         
	What is required is the automatic signalling system, which will simultaneously control the movement of trains along the entire stretch and ensure that a train leaves a station as soon as the one in the station ahead starts.        
	Call to CPM        
	Mamata today called on the CPM to join hands for deve- lopment projects. CPM leaders must attend railway programmes. Politics should be at its own place, she said with Congress leader Pranab Mukherjee by her side.         
	Observers pointed out that the Trinamul Congress chief had been seeking the CPMs co-operation since taking charge of the ministry, realising it was difficult to push ahead with new projects without political consensus.

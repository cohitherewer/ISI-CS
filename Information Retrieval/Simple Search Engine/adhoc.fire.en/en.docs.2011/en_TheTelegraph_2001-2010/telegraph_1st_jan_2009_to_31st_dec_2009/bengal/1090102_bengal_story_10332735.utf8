The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Leaderless GNLF blamed for attack
                                                                                                               Leaderless GNLF blamed for attack
          OUR BUREAU                          A deserted Kurseong town. Picture by Vivek Singh                                  
	Jan. 1: The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha has blamed the GNLF  a party now virtually leaderless  for orchestrating the attack at Rohini in Kurseong last night.         
	None of the prominent GNLF leaders are currently in town. Most of them were forced to leave after the Morcha was launched in October 2007.         
	It is learnt that the attackers were led by Krishna Diyali, who was a former GNLF gram panchayat member from Rohini and had surrendered to the Morcha only a few months ago. It seems the group was forced to surrender under compulsion following the GNLFs loss of face before the public. We now realise that in their hearts they were still with the GNLF and it seems that they bore a grudge against our leaders, said Binay Tamang, the media and publicity secretary of the Morcha.         
	One of the injured, Suraj Subba, is the vice-president of the Darjeeling Hill Terai Dooars Plantation Labour Union  a Morcha affiliate. Subodh Pradhan, who died on the spot, was the convener of the Giddhapahar-Pankhabari unit of the Morcha.         
	Our leaders had gone to Rohini on party related work but they were attacked without any provocation. This proves that the attack was pre-planned, said Tamang.         
	In February last year, Pradhans motorcycle and his car had been burnt at Pankhabari soon after he joined the Morcha. It was then alleged that the GNLF was behind the attack. At that time, Subash Ghisinghs party was not yet a spent force.         
	It is clear that that the police and the intelligence have failed. K.L. Tamta (IG, north Bengal) must be made accountable, said Tamang raking up the partys old demand for transfer of the officer.         
	In Kurseong, the Morchas Pankhabari-Giddhapahar un it has called a bandh to protest against the early morning lynching. Although vehicles were allowed to move around, the town wore a deserted look after 1pm. Most shops had downed the shutters on the first day of the new year. Tamang denied that the party has called a shutdown in the hill town.        
	It is the people who had downed shutters spontaneously. I have learnt that some 16 houses were targeted by people venting their anger, said Tamang.

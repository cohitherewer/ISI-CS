          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Calcutta, Feb. 12: The states fifth pay commission today submitted its report to the chief minister recommending an average salary jump of 30-36 per cent for 10 lakh government employees.        
	Over 4 lakh pensioners would also benefit from the recommendations that the panel wants implemented from April 1, 2009, with retrospective effect from April 1, 2008.        
	Finance minister Asim Dasgupta said: The revised scale... would lead to a 30 per cent hike in the states expenditure. In a fortnight the government will decide whether to accept.         
	A finance department official said: The exact average hike can be calculated after the government comes out with the notification on the new pay structure. The estimated hike should be anything between 30 and 36 per cent. The additional expenditure the state will have to bear would work out to Rs 5,500 crore-6,000 crore per annum.         
	The minimum basic pay recommended is Rs 6,600 (for Group D employees who get Rs 2,600 now), while the maximum is Rs 70,000 (for joint secretary and above).         
	The panel has kept the rate of the house rent allowance unchanged at 15 per cent of the basic. Its chairperson S.N. Ghosh said: We did not change the HRA rate as the new pay scale would fetch a handsome HRA. But we have raised the HRA ceiling from Rs 2,000 to Rs 6,000. We have suggested that medical allowance be raised from Rs 100 to Rs 300 a month and the reimbursement for medicines for treatment be raised from Rs 1,000 to Rs 2,500 each time the patient is hospitalised. The other suggestions are:         
	n Minimum pension of Rs 3,300, maximum Rs 35,000        
	n The arrears for April 1, 2008, to April 1, 2009, be paid in three equal yearly instalments, preferably from 2009-10        
	n The maximum amount of death/retirement gratuity be fixed at Rs 6 lakh instead of the ceiling of Rs 2.5 lakh        
	n Full pension at the rate of 50 per cent of the last drawn pay be given for a minimum qualifying service of 20 years        
	n The DA dues from July 1, 2008, be cleared at the earliest.

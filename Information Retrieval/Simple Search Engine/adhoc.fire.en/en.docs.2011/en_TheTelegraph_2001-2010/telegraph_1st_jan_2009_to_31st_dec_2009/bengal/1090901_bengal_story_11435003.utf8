	Calcutta, Aug. 31: Four miscreants when told to clear their bill broke a Howrah bars glass doors, some liquor bottles, furniture and fired two rounds in the air.         
	Kath Gobinda, a local tough, and his gang were leaving without clearing their bill at Angan Bar Cum Restaurant around 10pm today.        
	The gang also tried to kidnap hotel manager Sandip Konar after beating him up.        
	One of them held a gun to the head of Anindya Ghosh, the bars proprietor, but he managed to escape.

                                                                        Wednesday , November 18 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                              Front gags partners, puts off poll review
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 17: The Left Front today chose to turn its back on discontent among partners with chairman Biman Bose barring public criticism of the CPM and the government in the interest of unity.         
	We did not discuss the Assembly bypoll results as this was not on the agenda. We wont go for the review after discussing it with the media, Bose said. However, he added the front would do a preliminary review on Sunday.         
	CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan had yesterday blamed the CPM and the state government for the plunge in the Lefts fortunes, underlined by the Oppositions victory margins in the bypolls earlier this month. Before him, smaller partner Socialist Partys Kir-anmoy Nanda had asked for early state polls because he felt the Left had lost its mandate.        
	The Lefts vote share plunged to 38 per cent in the bypolls while that of the Trinamul-Congress combine shot up to around 51 per cent. The Left polled had over 50 per cent in both the 2004 parliamentary and 2006 state polls.        
	The CPM knows how deep the erosion is, but it will not spell that out fearing the truth will frustrate its ranks even more, said a front veteran.         
	According to him, Bose only voiced concern about the victory of the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha-backed Independent in north Bengal after a split in votes on ethnic lines.         
	Nanda skipped yesterdays Left rally as well as todays meeting, where Bose resented his outburst. Some of us are making comments in public at the cost of front unity, he said.         
	RSP leader Kshiti Goswami brought up the comments by the CPIs highest leadership but state CPI secretary Manju Mazumdar said Bardhan didnt mean what had been reported.         
	Goswami also complained that he was booed by CPM supporters at the rally for his barbs against the front Big Brother and the government it led.         
	The Forward Blocs Ashok Ghosh played agony uncle, saying the allies cacophony would only send a wrong signal to supporters and urged them not to be frustrated over the bypoll results in seven districts.        
	Bose said the CPM had a bigger role (in maintaining front unity) being the largest constituent, but its partners, too, had to do their bit.         
	He parried the question whether the CPM had owned principal responsibility for the poll debacles, being the largest constituent. Im not endorsing what Bardhan said. His party will speak to him, Bose said, adding: Today, we have decided that the front partners can spell out their party positions, but they have to take the front into confidence first when it involves the front and government.         
	At the meeting, the allies egged the chief minister on to provide rice at Rs 5 to Rs 7 a kilo to those who were not officially below the poverty line but were poor nonetheless.

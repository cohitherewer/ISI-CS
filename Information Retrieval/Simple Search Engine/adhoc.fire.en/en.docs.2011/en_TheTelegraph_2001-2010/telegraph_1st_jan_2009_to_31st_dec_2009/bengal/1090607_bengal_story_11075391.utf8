	Durgapur, June 6: Four Government Railway Police personnel were suspended today for allegedly robbing passengers of a Sealdah-bound train two days ago.        
	One of them is an assistant sub-inspector, the others are constables. After a preliminary probe, railway police superintendent (Howrah) T.K. Das said: The four were directly involved in robbing people in a general compartment of the Muzaffarpur-Sealdah fast passenger on the night of June 4.         
	The four had boarded the train at Asansol. When it star-ted moving, they locked the doors of the compartment and snatched cash, ornaments and mobile phones at gunpoint. A passenger who got down at the next station, Raniganj, was the first to report the incident.

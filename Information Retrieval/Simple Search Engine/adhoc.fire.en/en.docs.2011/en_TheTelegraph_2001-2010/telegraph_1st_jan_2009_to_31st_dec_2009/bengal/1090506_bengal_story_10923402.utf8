The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Free hand for coal thieves
                                                                                                               Free hand for coal thieves
          ABHIJEET CHATTERJEE                              
	Asansol, May 5: The going has been smooth for the 50,000 illegal coal miners in Asansol as neither the CPM nor the Opposition has made the coal mafia an issue this time.        
	The reason is the CPMs rural poll drubbing last year. The party had campaigned against the coal mafia and pledged to stop illegal mining in strongholds Salanpur and Baraboni.         
	Police raids were conducted and illegal mining stopped for some time. But the electorate  about 1.25 lakh voters, mostly illegal mining hands and their families  gave their reply. The CPM lost both the Salanpur and Baraboni panchayat samitis as well as seven of the 19 gram panchayats.         
	The Congress and the Trinamul Congress, which accuse the CPM of patronising the coal mafia, gained at the CPMs expense. We wanted to prove the Opposition charge wrong but learnt our lessons. We di-dnt take chances this time, said a district CPM leader.         
	Bansagopal Chowdhury, the MP from Asansol who won by over 2 lakh votes in 2004, said there were far more important issues this time.        
	A Trinamul leader said most of the land in the region was single-crop or barren and coal smuggling was the source of income for many. So we are not uttering a word against it.        
	A 50-year-old widow who earns a living as an illegal miner in Salanpur said: We can get on with our job now. Her two sons work in illegal mines at Churulia, also in Asansol.        
	Asked about the sudden halt in raids, Burdwan police chief R. Rajsekharan said the polls had kept the force busy.

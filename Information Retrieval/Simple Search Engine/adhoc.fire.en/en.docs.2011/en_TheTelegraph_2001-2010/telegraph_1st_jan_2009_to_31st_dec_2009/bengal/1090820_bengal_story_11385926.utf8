          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi says namashkar to state CPM secretary Biman Bose as chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee looks on at Raj Bhavan on Wednesday.
  This was the first time they met since the furore sparked by Gandhis statement slamming the veritable tandava of political violence and the reluctance of those in authority to act against it. The Left had called him partisan in response.  
	However, at the swearing-in of three new ministers on Wednesday evening, it was all pleasantries. Gandhi greeted both Bhattacharjee and Bose and enquired about the chief ministers health. They had tea together. Bose later said: I have no personal enmity with the governor. Why shouldnt I speak with him? We exchanged courtesies.  
	Transport minister Ranjit Kundu, labour minister Anadi Sahoo and animal resource minister Narayan Biswas were the ones sworn in. Picture by Amit Datta                    
	Calcutta, Aug. 19: CPM state secretary Biman Bose today admitted the party had made wrong choices in picking its candidates for the Lok Sabha polls.         
	Explaining the factors behind the Lefts worst ever electoral debacle, Bose said: I have no hesitation in admitting that the state leadership had made mistakes in picking the candidates. We had also made a delay in announcing the list.         
	He did not elaborate, but party insiders pointed out the leaderships failure to replace some of the old-timers and induct fresh faces following pressure from certain sections, including its 26 MPs.        
	Then Tamluk MP Lakshman Seth, who became most controversial after the Nandigram violence, secured renomination despite the reservations of many senior leaders, party sources said.         
	The leaderships slipping control over the organisation was also evident after the polls as it failed to make any meaningful change in the state cabinet, insiders pointed out.        
	However, Bose tried to convey the leaderships desperation to bring the partys grassroots workers out of their demoralised state by lashing at apparatchikis down the hierarchy.         
	Our leaders have to be self-critical and stop the practice of heaping all blames for the ills on low-level workers. I can detect the lies whenever district leaders make false claims and give wrong impressions in their reports. All of us should own up to mistakes at our level, the state party chief said.        
	He reminded district and zonal committee leaders that they should also admit their mistakes in choosing candidates for last years panchayat polls. For the first time in over 30 years, the Left was routed in the 2008 rural polls. The slide has continued since.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Light rival for Pranab
                                                                                                               Light rival for Pranab
  - CPM considers municipal chief against minister        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Pranab Mukherjee and Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee                                       
	Calcutta, Feb. 24: The CPM is expected to field a lightweight municipality chairman against foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee in the Lok Sabha polls.        
	CPM sources said municipality chief Mriganka Bhattacharya would replace former MP Abul Hasnat Khan as Mukherjees rival in Murshidabads Jangipur.         
	The party move comes against the backdrop of perceived warmth between Mukherjee and the Left Front government  a factor which Mamata Banerjee occasionally seizes on to needle the Congress veteran.         
	That the threat of a possi- ble electoral arrangement between the Congress and Mamata is playing on the CPMs mind was evident today when state party secretary Biman Bose cautioned state committee members about the dangers of a grand alliance.        
	The CPM has also drawn a distinction between the Congresss politics and Mukherjee as a person. We will criticise Congress politics. We have nothing personal against Pranabbabu, party veteran Benoy Konar said.        
	Rabin Deb, the former MLA and CPM city unit leader, will be the partys likely candidate against Mamata in Calcutta South. In 2004, he had brought her victory margin down to 98,000 from 2.14 lakh.         
	The partys deputy leader in the Lok Sabha and MP from Calcutta North East, Mohammad Salim, is set to be fielded in Calcutta North. The CPMs second MP in the city  Sudhanshu Seal from Calcutta North West  is likely to be dropped as his and Salims constituencies have merged after delimitation.         
	However, the list for the 32 seats the CPM will contest in Bengal has not been finalised because of differences in the state secretariat and some of the district committees over certain candidates. The secretariat has been authorised to finalise the list.         
	The CPM is likely to re-nominate most of its 26 sitting MPs, including Lakshman Seth, whose name the state secretariat cleared today.         
	His absence would have hurt the party more than his presence, a secretariat member said.        
	Jhargram MP Rupchand Murmu, however, is likely to be removed in view of the tribal unrest in his area and his non-performance.        
	The party is yet to finalise its candidates in the reserved seats of Bongaon (North 24-Parganas), Ranaghat (Nadia) and Mathurapur (South 24-Parganas). The decisions on these three are inter-related, organisationally and politically, a leader said, indicating differences in the secretariat as well as the respective district units.         
	A section of the secretariat and the Nadia unit are also unhappy with former athlete Jyotirmoyee Sikdars possible re-nomination in Krishnagar.         
	Buddha thanks        
	The chief minister wrote to chemicals minister Ram Vilas Paswan today, expressing appreciation for speeding up the Centres nod to the proposed Nayachar chemical hub. It will be of great help for the people of Bengal, an official quoted the letter as saying.

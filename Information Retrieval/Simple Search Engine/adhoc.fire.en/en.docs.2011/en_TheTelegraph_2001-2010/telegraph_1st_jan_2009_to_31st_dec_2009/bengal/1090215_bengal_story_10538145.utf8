The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Alliance fate with Cong brass
                                                                                                               Alliance fate with Cong brass
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Mohsina Kidwai                                
	Calcutta, Feb. 14: The Bengal Congress today resolved in the presence of AICC general secretary Mohsina Kidwai and state unit chief Pranab Mukherjee that the high command in Delhi would take a final decision on an alliance with Mamata Banerjee.         
	Sources in Delhi said the high command was more or less tilting towards an alliance unless last-minute hitches crept in.         
	Congress sources said the state units familiar  and unavoidable  move to seek the high commands counsel had twin purposes. First, it would help stem dissension between the pro and anti-alliance factions of the party. Second, it would keep Mamata happy since she had insisted on talking to the Congresss central leadership on the alliance.         
	It amounts to killing two birds with one stone. If the high command does manage to resolve the row, it would help stem squabbles in the party and keep Mamata in good humour, a leader said.         
	The state units decision such moves are often choreographed by Delhi  followed barbs from several local leaders, seemingly opposed to the pact, at a co-ordination committee meeting.         
	We have heard you, and now the high command will take a final decision on the alliance with Mamata after we brief the Congress president, Pranab was quoted as saying.         
	Of the 17 members of the committee, 12 were present.         
	The leaders spelt out two conditions before Pranab and the AICC leader in charge of Bengal  a respectable number of parliamentary seats, including Calcutta North, and an undertaking from Mamata that the Trinamul Congress would not desert the UPA after the elections.         
	The state leaders also insisted that Mamata formally sever ties with the BJP-led NDA.         
	Party leaders feel that an alliance with Mamata is the need of the hour to avert a split in Opposition votes. But at the same time, we need a clear-cut assurance from Mamata that she is no more with the NDA and will back the Congress-led UPA after the polls, state party working president Pradip Bhattacharya said after the meeting.         
	Asked why the Congress was seeking a fresh assertion from Mamata days after she said she would back a secular alliance after the Lok Sabha polls, Bhattacharya said: Going by her statement, we have withdrawn our candidate for the Bishnupur West Assembly bypoll. But she has to make her stand on the NDA clear.         
	At the meeting, MLA Dee-pa Das Munshi questioned Mamatas public statement pledging support for a secular alliance. What did she mean by secular alliance? Amar Singhs Samajwadi Party is also secular. Mamata has to clarify that she would back the UPA and Sonia Gandhi after the elections, she said.         
	Another state party working president, Subrata Mukherjee, was accused of taking Mamatas side to pave the way for the pact. General secretary Shankar Singh said Subrata was acting more like a Trinamul spokesman and demanded his ouster from the helm of the campaign committee.         
	Abdul Mannan went a step further. Some leaders are advocating the alliance with Mamata for Lok Sabha tickets from her, he alleged.        
	Cornered, Subrata refused to address the gathering despite requests.         
	Sources said that in principle, the party was keen to tie up with Trinamul. But many in the state Congress believe the jot (alliance) may benefit Mamata more than their party. They concede, though, that it will also bring down the number of Left MPs by at least a dozen.         
	At the meeting, MP Adhir Chowdhury regretted that the Congress appeared keener on the pact than Mamata. Ours is a national party. Why should we beg for an alliance? Mamata should come forward to initiate a dialogue on how to work it out, he said.         
	Mamata was not available for comment. A Trinamul functionary said the party brass would go into a huddle tomorrow to discuss the Congresss demands.         
	Subrata tonight attended the wedding of Trinamul MLA Partha Chatterjees daughter. Pranab, also invited, did not.

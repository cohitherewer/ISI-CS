                                                                                                               Furniture at receiving end
          BIRESWAR BANERJEE                             Mayor Gangotri Dutta (top), chairperson Sabita Agarwal                          
	Siliguri, Oct. 1: Congress and Trinamul supporters today ransacked the venue where Siliguris new mayor was to be felicitated, angry that the national party had taken the Lefts support to bag the top two civic posts.        
	Since morning, hundreds of workers of both the Congress and the Trinamul Congress had assembled on the Siliguri Municipal Corporation premises. The administration, apprehending violence, had deployed security personnel.        
	At 10.30am, Darjeeling district magistrate Surendra Gupta presided over the councillors oath-taking ceremony. The mayors election commenced around 11.15am. Soon, rumours started swirling that the 17 Left Front councillors had voted for the Congress.         
	Around noon, the Trinamul councillors left the civic office in a huff. We will not participate in the election of the chairperson and sit in the Opposition, one of them said.        
	At Baghajatin Park where a felicitation for the new mayor was scheduled, Trinamul and Congress workers tossed chairs in the air and broke all other furniture.         
	Raiganj Congress MP Deepa Das Munshi, believed to have been the prime mover in the mayoral election, later said: We had appealed to all 47 councillors to vote for our candidates.... We had sought co-operation from the Left councillors and all of them voted for us for the chairpersons post. For the mayor, we cannot say as Trinamul voted as well.        
	Opposition alliance supporters abused Deepa. Many of them ringed her car and banged on the bonnet.         
	Darjeeling Left Front convener Asok Bhattacharya said: The Congress had sent a letter seeking support. We discussed it and decided to support. The letter was sent by Darjeeling Congress chief Shankar Malakar.        
	Gautam Deb, who lost to Gangotri Dutta, said: People will understand the Congresss stance....This will have serious political repercussions.

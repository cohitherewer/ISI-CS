	Calcutta, May 14: The overall turnout in the Lok Sabha elections in Bengal has gone up to around 81 per cent from 77 per cent in 2004.        
	In the first phase, the turnout was 81 per cent, the second 83 per cent and the third 76.26 per cent. The overall turnout is 81 per cent, chief electoral officer Debashis Sen said. The Election Commission in Delhi had yesterday put at 70 per cent the tentative turnout in the third phase.        
	Any legislator, minister or mayor or anyone provided security by the government can no longer be a counting agent, the panel has said.

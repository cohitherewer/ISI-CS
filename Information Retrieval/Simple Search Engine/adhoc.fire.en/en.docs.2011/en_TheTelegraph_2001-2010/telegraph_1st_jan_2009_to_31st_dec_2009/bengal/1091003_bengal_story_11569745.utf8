The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | In Sens silence lies   a Karat riddle
                                                                                                               In Sens silence lies   a Karat riddle
          BISWAJIT ROY                            Karat, Bhattacharjee                                
	Calcutta, Oct. 2: The CPMs support to the Congress in Siliguri may renew tensions between the pro- and anti-Prakash Karat camps in the state unit as well as in the Left Front, insiders said.        
	A full bench meeting of the CPM state secretariat today ratified the decision taken by its available members on Wednesday evening after the party received feelers from the Congress.        
	Many leaders hailed the collaboration as a smart move that could drive a wedge between the Congress and the Trinamul Congress with the potential for a thaw between the estranged friends at the Centre. But others expressed apprehensions about a wider fallout on the CPMs anti-Congress campaign.        
	It is not clear whether the partys Siliguri support, initiated by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and state secretary Biman Bose, had the blessings of either general secretary Karat or politburo member Nirupam Sen.         
	Karat could not be contacted today while Brinda, a politburo member and his wife, declined to take questions.        
	Sen told The Telegraph: I am in Pondicherry. I wont comment on the issue now. Let the leaders present in Calcutta speak on it.        
	Some sources are interpreting Sens reluctance to comment as a sign that the prime movers behind the CPM-Congress handshake may face opposition within the party as well as the front.        
	Bhattacharjee and, to a large extent, Bose are known to have held the Lefts withdrawal of support to the Congress-led UPA primarily responsible for the Lefts Lok Sabha debacle. In contrast, Sen stood by Karat, defending the withdrawal of support and mainly blaming state factors.        
	However, veteran Benoy Konar said today: The (Siliguri) decision was taken after discussing with the general secretary and he agreed. Nirupam was also consulted over the phone.        
	But another secretariat member offered a different version. The decision was communicated to Prakash on Wednesday. But there was no need to obtain his concurrence since, according to our party constitution, a matter pertaining to a civic body poll is not to be decided with the approval of the highest leadership. If required, the general secretary may take up the issue at the politburo meeting, he said.        
	 He admitted that some members of the state secretariat had expressed apprehensions about wider political ramifications that could confuse the cadres.        
	This seems to have prompted secretariat member Shyamal Chakraborty to insist that the support to the Congress was Siliguri-specific. Our opposition to the Congress will continue at the state and national levels, Chakraborty said.        
	RSP dissent        
	Differences have already cropped up in the front with the RSP accusing the CPM of not consulting the ally. The party will send a letter to Bose to protest the unilateral move. The RSP has directed its lone councillor in Siliguri to withdraw support to the Congress.

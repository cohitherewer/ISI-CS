	Nov. 23: All 875 permanent workers of Haldia Petrochemicals today entered the comp- lex as over 200 policemen stood guard but casual workers owing allegiance to the Trinamul Congress were not allowed inside because they turned up over an hour late.        
	After striking Citu workers and their Trinamul rivals turned the HPL gates into a battlefield yesterday, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had directed the police to ensure that those who wanted to work could do so.        
	A large police team arrived at the entrance early today and prevented striking the Citu strikers who had been picketing there for the past two days from resuming their sit-in.        
	Over the past two days, Citu supporters had prevented their rivals from joining work. But when the gate opened today, the Trinamul supporters were not to be seen. They came past 9.30am, though workers should report latest by 8.45.         
	In Calcutta, labour minister Anadi Sahu met HPLs Citu president Lakshman Seth and representatives of the company to end the impasse. The talks, which began in the afternoon, went on beyond 1.30am, the longest such meeting at Writers in recent memory.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Hint to Delhi in Buddha siege
                                                                                                               Hint to Delhi in Buddha siege
          BARUN GHOSH                                           
	Calcutta, Oct. 17: Ostensibly, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee was the target, but Mamata Banerjees decision to send Partha Chatterjee to Writers Buildings to protest outside the chief ministers chamber and then stop Calcutta in its tracks over his arrest may have been a signal to the UPA government, sources said today.         
	Apparently, the Writers sit-in was part of Mamatas non-cooperation movement against the Bengal government that she wants to paralyse.        
	But Trinamul sources said the party chief was unhappy about the way Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and home minister P. Chidambaram concurred with chief minister Bhattacharjee on continuing the operation against Maoists in Bengal.         
	By pushing Bhattacharjee, she thought, she would pile pressure on the UPA government at the Centre.         
	Although she supported the Centres proposed offensive against the Maoists elsewhere in the country, Mamata wanted the operation in Bengal to be stopped and the central forces withdrawn from Lalgarh.         
	Mamata is not opposed to the Centres planned offensive against the Maoists after Diwali but she wants the central forces to be withdrawn from Lalgarh as they are being used by the CPM to recover lost ground in the tribal belt, said Trinamul state president Subrata Bakshi.         
	A Trinamul junior minister at the Centre said Mamata was also upset over Bhattacharjees bid to prove she had links with the Maoists.         
	Chhatradhar Mahato, the leader of the Maoist-backed Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities who has been arrested, had earlier said he had been a Trinamul member  a statement that may have embarrassed Mamata.         
	The central minister said the siege may have been planned as a move to deflect public attention from this matter.         
	Many Trinamul members also questioned the sudden siege. They said Mamata had engineered it in consultation with Chatterjee, whom she called the shadow chief minister yesterday.         
	We were not aware of any such thing on the eve of Diwali. The strategy was entirely worked out by didi in consultation with Parthada. Didi, convinced that the Centre will not give in to her demand of imposing Presidents rule in the state, is desperate to paralyse the state government. Hence this wildcat protest in the state secretariat, a Trinamul vice-president said.         
	He said such protests are on the partys agenda for the next two years before the 2011 Assembly polls. Our one-point mission is to show this government in poor light by highlighting its lawlessness. We want the police to harass us so that it draws attention to the governments high-handedness, the leader said.        
	The Congress refrained from commenting on its allys political programme, but state Congress working president Subrata Mukherjee said he did not approve of yesterdays Writers siege. Partha should have chosen the Assembly to lodge his protest instead of Writers, he said.        
	Chatterjee, however, got sympathy from Siddhartha Shankar Ray. The former chief minister today visited Chatterjees Naktala home to share his concern over the state of lawlessness in Bengal. I was twice leader of the Opposition in the Assembly. A leader of the Opposition should not have been manhandled in this manner, Ray said.

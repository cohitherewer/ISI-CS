	Arambagh (Hooghly), April 14: A dozen Trinamul supporters have fled their homes in a Hooghly village after alleged beating and intimidation by CPM activists targeting them for having attended a Congress rally last week.        
	Another man, severely beaten up after the April 8 rally, has returned home to Ramanandapur in the districts Goghat area but alleges that he cant step out because of CPM cadres threats.         
	The 12 have taken shelter in the Trinamul office in nearby Arambagh.         
	One of them, Farman Haque, alleged that some 25 CPM supporters had hit them with spears and sticks. We escaped with minor injuries. They told us we will be killed if we remain in Trinamul, said Farman.        
	Twenty of the alleged assailants were arrested but later released on bail. Trinamuls Arambagh leader Samir Bhandari yesterday lodged a complaint with subdivisional police officer Samiran Roy. The SDPO has asked the Goghat officer in charge to ensure that the Trinamul workers could return home and were safe.

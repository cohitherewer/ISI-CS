The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Rs 5-lakh claim for fourth child
                                                                                                               Rs 5-lakh claim for fourth child
          ALAMGIR HOSSAIN                              
	Sagardighi, Aug. 5: A rickshaw-puller has sought Rs 5 lakh in compensation from the government after his wife gave birth a fourth time despite undergoing tubectomy and officials refused to listen to his complaints.        
	Kamaluddin Sheikh, who earns barely Rs 70 a day pulling a rickshaw in Murshida- bads Sagardighi, ran around various government offices for a year and a half before moving the consumer court.        
	His wife Shamima had undergone the operation  in which the fallopian tubes are cut to prevent pregnancy  almost six years ago. She delivered a baby in March last year.        
	Kamaluddin, 35, lodged a complaint with the block development officer immediately after becoming a father the fourth time.         
	Waiting for over a year without any response from the government, he lodged a complaint with police. The police told him it was the health departments concern.        
	Murshidabads chief medical officer, Subhas Mondal, admitted that if a woman became pregnant after tubectomy, it was the health departments fault.         
	But Shamima is apparently not entitled to the compensation of Rs 30,000 the government gives such women because she underwent the operation before the rule was framed.        
	I have three sons. I made my wife undergo the operation because I would not be able to bring up a fourth child. But it didnt help, said Kamaluddin. We are illiterate people and thought there will be a response from the government. But nothing happened. I want justice.         
	Kamaluddins fourth child is a daughter.

                                                                                                               Nurses neglect charge on doctor
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Durgapur, June 1: A doctor in the state-owned DPL Hospital here refused to deliver a baby and sent the woman back from the labour room last night.         
	Gynaecologist Sumanranjan Dutta allegedly assaulted a nurse after she called him and accused him of negligence when the woman delivered a baby in her bed minutes later.        
	The nurse, Saraswati Bose, lodged a complaint against the doctor this morning. Her colleagues staged a protest and demanded punishment.        
	Dutta denied the assault and described the incident as a misunderstanding.         
	I didnt punch or push the nurse. It was a misunderstanding. Ive sent an explanation to the hospitals chief medical officer. Both the mother and the baby are fine, he said.         
	Around 10.30 last night, Anima Dom felt a pain and nurse Bose took her to the labour room immediately. However, Dutta told Bose to take her back after a brief check-up. Ten minutes later, Anima, 39, gave birth to a boy.         
	 I have been in this profession for 17 years and knew the baby will come out any moment. But he told me to shift the patient to her bed without properly examining her, alleged Bose.         
	After the baby was delivered, Bose called the doctor again and accused him of negli-gence. An altercation ensued and Dutta allegedly hit her.         
	Chief medical officer Hiramoni Singh said: We are looking into the complaint.

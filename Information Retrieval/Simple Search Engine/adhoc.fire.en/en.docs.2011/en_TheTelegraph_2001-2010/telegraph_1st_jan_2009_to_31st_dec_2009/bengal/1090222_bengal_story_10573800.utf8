The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Kuntal killers get life term
                                                                                                               Kuntal killers get life term
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Calcutta, Feb. 21: A Howrah court today sent Kuntal Sains killers to life in jail.         
	Manjusha Mukherjee and her younger son Jyotirmoy were sentenced for criminally conspiring to murder the 18-year-old on July 2, 2004.         
	Arijit Pal, Kuntals senior in St Thomas School in Dasnagar, was handed the same punishment for murder.         
	The three were convicted yesterday. Sampad Mukherjee, Manjushas elder son and the fourth accused, died in Presidency Jail in October 2004.        
	When judge Raghunath Roy read out their sentences in the packed courtroom today, the three didnt betray any emotion.        
	According to investigators, Sampad had called Kuntal, his neighbour in Howrahs Sashthitala area, to his house on July 2, 2004.        
	Kuntal was then locked up in a room while Arijit called up his home and demanded a ransom of Rs 25 lakh from his father Avijit Sain.        
	The father agreed to pay but, on a hunch, sent a friend of Kuntal to check if his son had been confined by the Mukherjees.        
	The quartet managed to send the friend away but feared that they might get caught.        
	That evening, Arijit and Sampad took Kuntal to Pankuria, also in Howrah. They hit him with a chopper over 40 times and dumped the body under a bridge.        
	Shibpur police had started a probe into the murder on the basis of a complaint lodged by Kuntals father the same day.        
	The trial began in 2005.

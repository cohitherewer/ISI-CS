The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Bidi and Barack hand in hand
                                                                                                               Bidi and Barack hand in hand
          ABHIJEET CHATTERJEE                           A man reads out from a newspaper to the bidi binders. Picture by Gour Sharma                                  
	Bankura, Aug. 25: Pat came the answer when someone asked a young man rolling bidis in Bankura who Barack Obama was.        
	What is swine flu? Who won IPL 2009? Which is the worlds cheapest car? What is global warming? And global meltdown?        
	Ashish Sinha is no whiz. Nor was he, like slumdog Jamal, taught the answers by lifes horrible experiences.        
	But the 26-year-old who had last had anything to do with books over a decade and a half ago, in Class II, knows the world he lives in thanks to a 70-year-old practice at his factory.        
	A man reads out from two newspapers for an hour every day to the 300-odd workers at the bidi factory run by the Bankura Bidi Shilpi Co-operative Society in Bankura town.        
	As their fingers roll the leaves, bind them with a thread and snap it with one deft pull, their ears are tuned to the loudspeakers over which the newscast is aired.        
	Ashish wasnt the only one in the bidi factory who knew the answers.        
	Its cheaper than a television and clearer than radio, said Akul Bauri, who is not sure how old he is but knows about the Nano or what to do to escape swine flu.        
	Most of the workers are either illiterate or primary school dropouts.         
	We are poor and dont have TV at home. Moreover, we dont have the time. Listening to news while working is great, added Akul, who takes home Rs 1,000 a month for nine hours labour a day.        
	Papers provide news in greater detail than the radio, said an unlettered Gopal Bagdi, 52.         
	I was fascinated when America got a black President for the first time. Can you imagine it? It has been an independent country for over 200 years but never before has it had a black President, said Ashish.         
	About the meltdown, he said: Many people have lost their jobs across the world because of the financial crisis.         
	The older Bagdi is keener on politics. The CPM started losing ground because of its policy of acquiring fertile land for industry. The Trinamul Congress has taken full advantage of it, he said.        
	In the Oscar-winner Slumdog Millionaire, the young Jamal rattles of all the answers in a quiz show to win Rs 2 crore.         
	Ashish hums Jai Ho at work. He has seen the film at a local video parlour.        
	The tradition of reading out the news started when the bidi factory was set up amid the fervour of the freedom movement in 1937. It has continued.         
	Pashupati Nag, a private tutor, has been the newscaster for the past 25 years. He gets Rs 40 for an hours work.        
	If I miss the routine, I feel very bad. It has become a habit for me. After I complete reading, many of the listeners ask for clarifications or more information, said Nag, 45, who has studied till Class XII.         
	He knows the preferences of his audience. Those below 40 are keen on sports. The older ones love politics and take an interest in astrology.         
	The younger workers often ask him to read an article twice. The boys often come and ask me to repeat an item on football or cricket. They are interested in knowing the names of players. However, they have also started taking an interest in the political developments in the state since the Lok Sabha polls, said Nag.        
	He reads from two Bengali dailies, Anandabazar Patrika and CPM mouthpiece Ganashakti, from 1pm.        
	The founders of the co-operative society had thought reading newspapers to illiterate bidi workers was important. They had engaged an unemployed youth to read from Basumati, Desh Hitoishi and Jugantar, said Jharu Gorai, secretary of the co-operative.         
	Akul, who has been rolling bidis for almost as long as he can remember, said: Whatever I know besides binding bidis is from newspapers. I try to remember what I learn.        
	Nemai Gorai, 35, has learnt a lesson from the papers. I dropped out of school in Class II. But listening to news for the past 18 years in the factory, I have realised that there is no alternative to education. I want my son to study, said Nemai, whose son is in Class III.

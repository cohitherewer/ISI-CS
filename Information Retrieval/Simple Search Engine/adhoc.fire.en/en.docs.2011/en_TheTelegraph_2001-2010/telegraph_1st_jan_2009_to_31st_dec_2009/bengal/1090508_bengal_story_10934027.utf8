	Calcutta, May 7: The Left and the Opposition traded charges over todays violence.         
	While CPM state secretary Biman Bose accused the Trinamul Congress of capturing booths, intimidating voters and attacking CPM supporters in Nandigram, Mamata Banerjee questioned the absence of policemen in polling stations at Tekhali, Gokulnagar and Adhikarypara.        
	The states chief electoral officer, Debashis Sen, said the CPM had demanded repoll in 52 Nandigram booths. The (Election) Commission in Delhi will consider the official complaints lodged by the party on these 52 booths and a decision will be taken not before tomorrow evening.        
	In Delhi, CPM central committee member Jogendra Sharma met the deputy election commissioner and submitted a memorandum saying its polling agents were not allowed to enter 42 booths in Nandigram.        
	Accusing the CPM of unleashing terror, the Trinamul chief said the CPM would lose despite indulging in violence.        
	State Congress working president Pradip Bhattacharya echoed Mamatas charges and went on to accuse CPM activists of trying to molest his partys Burdwan-Durgapur candidate Nargis Begum.        
	CPM activists tried to molest me and even threatened to murder me when I went to a booth in Barobelum (in Burdwans Bhatar, about 140km from Calcutta) to enquire about false voting, Nargis said. She has lodged a police complaint.         
	Foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee said there were attempts to capture a dozen booths in his Jangipur constituency. The supporters of the ruling party succeeded in capturing two booths, for which I demanded repolling, he added.        
	The CPMs Bose accused the Congress of killing local leader Kashinath Mondal in Jangipurs Khargram village.        
	Bose, also the Left Front chairman, attributed the murder of the Trinamul supporter in Asansol to the peoples resistance to the Opposition rampage to capture booths.

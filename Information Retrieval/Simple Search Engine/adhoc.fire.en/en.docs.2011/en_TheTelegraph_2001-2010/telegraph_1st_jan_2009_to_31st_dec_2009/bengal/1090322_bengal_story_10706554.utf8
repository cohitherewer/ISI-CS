                                                                                                               At 111, Hanifs fine
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Mohammed Hanif in CMRI                                  
	Calcutta, March 21: At 111, Mohammed Hanif felt just fine after a surgery.         
	The patch on his left eye  because of the cataract operation  did not stop the grandpa with white hair and beard from chatting and smiling.        
	I am feeling fine. Once my vision improves, I will start reading again, he said.         
	Hanif likes poring over books on religion. Till two years back, he could do that without glasses. But last year, he had to undergo a cataract surgery in his right eye.         
	I usually spend my time reading religious books. But for the last two years, I was having problems, he said.        
	His family says Hanif is 111, though they have no documents to prove it. The Calcutta Medical Research Institute, where the surgery was done today, believes them.        
	His family members said his age is 111 years, said an official of CMRI. On the basis of this claim, the hospital recorded his age in the patients registration documents, he added.        
	He loves to chat with his two sons, their wives and a dozen grandchildren who stay with him in Beck Bagan.         
	In the election season, Hanif also had a lesson for the electorate, most of whom would certainly be younger than him. I have voted in all the elections held till date and I will vote this time too, he said smiling.         
	Apart from his eyesight, Hanif said he had no other ailment. Even now, I fast during Ramazan.        
	The tissues of his eye had become loose because of old age and the cataract was hard. His vision was completely gone (in the left eye) and there was a risk of the cornea getting damaged, said Bhaskar Roychowdhury, the head of the ophthalmology department at CMRI, who did the surgery. The surgery was successful and his vision would improve.

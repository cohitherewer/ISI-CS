	Calcutta, Dec. 17: IIM Calcutta will finalise its post-autonomy action plan in three months and submit the proposal to the Union human resource development ministry in February 2010.         
	In October, the HRD minister had asked all the IIMs to draw up a plan on what they wanted to do if given greater autonomy.         
	We discussed several proposals. Today, the board discussed them and gave the green signal to go ahead and prepare a blueprint on what the institute can achieve after getting (greater) autonomy, said an IIM source.         
	The IIMs enjoy freedom in academic affairs  such as deciding the curriculum  and in finalising the fees.        
	The ministry takes the final call on administrative matters  such as the appointment of the directors.         
	Our objective is to turn IIM Calcutta into a world-class management institute. Given the existing set-up, thats not possible. In our plan, we will explain what we will achieve in five years, said the source.         
	The B-school wants to apply for international accreditation to recruit managers for administration.         
	IIM Calcutta has started working on getting international accreditation from the American Association of State Counselling Boards, a leading accreditation body. It hopes to get the tag in the next two years.        
	The IIM also wants to raise its student intake to around 500 in each batch.         
	At present, a batch has around 400 students.

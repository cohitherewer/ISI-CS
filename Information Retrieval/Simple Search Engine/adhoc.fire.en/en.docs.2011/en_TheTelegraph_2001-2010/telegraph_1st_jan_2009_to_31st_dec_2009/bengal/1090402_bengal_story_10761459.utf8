          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          The school, 130km from Calcutta. Telegraph picture                                   
	Burdwan, April 1: A primary school in Burdwan that remained padlocked for some inexplicable reason during class hours on Monday opened its doors when a group of CPM supporters arrived to hold an election rally in the afternoon.        
	Nearly 150 students who had turned up at the school in Gaitanpur village around 10am found the main gate locked. Some 50 of them  mainly Class I and IV students  waited some two hours because they had to write their Bengali and mathematics papers. The door didnt open.        
	Neither the headmaster nor the two teachers and the peon, who keeps the school keys, came.        
	The peon was there to say Present, Sir to the CPM dadas around 2.30pm. Armed with chairs and loudspeakers, they canvassed for the Birbhum CPM candidate, Susmita Bauri.        
	The officer in the charge of the local Khandaghosh police station, Amitava Sanyal, said no permission had been sought for the rally on the school premises.         
	According to the election code of conduct, a campaign meeting can be held in an educational institution only after classes and with the permission of its authorities and the local police station.         
	As the higher secondary exams are on, use of loudspeakers and microphones has been prohibited till April 16.         
	Headmaster Phanindramohan Biswas, who lives in Burdwan town, 30km away, said he could not attend school on Monday because of some personal work. But there are two other teachers. Ive sought an explanation for their absence, said Biswas.         
	He denied knowing about the CPM plan in advance.        
	The OC, too, pleaded innocence, saying the school was 5km from the police station. Had I known about the meeting, I could have sent people to video record it and acted against them for violation of the code, said Sanyal.        
	Guardians alleged that the school was kept closed to facilitate the CPM meeting. It could have been held on Sunday, or Monday evening, said Sambhu Mahato, father of a Class IV boy.        
	Saran Mahato, whose son is in Class I, said: The CPM meeting started around 3pm and went on till about 5.        
	Burdwan inspector of schools (primary) Mahadeb Urinda has ordered a probe. If the headmaster could not attend the school for some genuine reason, why didnt he inform the teachers? he asked.        
	A local CPM leader claimed that the party had taken permission for the rally from the school as well as the police. Khandaghosh zonal committee secretary Mahafauj Rahman said: We never do anything violating the law.        
	Headmaster Biswas said no one had taken his permission for the party meeting.

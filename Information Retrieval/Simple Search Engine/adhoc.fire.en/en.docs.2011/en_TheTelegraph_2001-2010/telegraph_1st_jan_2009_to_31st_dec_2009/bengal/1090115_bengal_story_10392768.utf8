	Calcutta: The number of Madhyamik examinees is set to cross 10 lakh for the first time this year, apparently fuelled by a spurt in the number of girl students.        
	Nearly 10.02 lakh candidates have enrolled for the exam slated to begin on February 25. About half of them are girls. Only around 40 per cent of the 7.36 lakh students who took the exam last year were girls, Madhyamik board secretary Partha Roy said.        
	An official attributed the rise to awareness among rural parents and an increase in the number of schools.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Notice to jail guards
                                                                                                               Notice to jail guards
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          One of the warders asleep in jail on Saturday                                  
	Durgapur, Aug. 9: Durgapur sub-jail authorities today show-caused the five guards who had allowed two visitors to drug them with spiked soft drinks and escape with six inmates yesterday. Sub-jailer Anjan Chatterjee was also served with a notice.        
	Preliminary investigations show it is a case of negligence. We will start departmental action against the warders (guards), said B.D. Sharma, additional director-general of prisons.        
	In his report to Sharma, R. N. Basu Roychowdhury, the Durgapur sub-divisional officer who is ex-officio the sub-jails superintendent, has accused the guards of negligence. The five have been identified as Bachchu Maity, Netai Guchhait, Jagannath Dutta, Pradip Chakraborty and head warder Virendra Singh.        
	Sources in the prisons department said the warders did not search the visitors, one of whom was carrying a gun.        
	The food the two visitors had brought, ostensibly for the prisoners, has not been tested. Under jail rules, anyone who brings food for a prisoner has to eat it first. The inmate can eat it after 15 minutes.        
	Nor were the visitors asked to submit an application for permission to meet the prisoners. Permission has to be granted by the sub-jailer or the SDO. I didnt get any application, sub-jailer Chatterjee said.        
	The five warders, who were semi-conscious in hospital late last night, were stable today. The head warder has been discharged. Their urine, blood and vomit samples, and samples of the soft drinks, have been sent for forensic tests.        
	The police are yet to trace the visitors or the six criminals whom they freed.

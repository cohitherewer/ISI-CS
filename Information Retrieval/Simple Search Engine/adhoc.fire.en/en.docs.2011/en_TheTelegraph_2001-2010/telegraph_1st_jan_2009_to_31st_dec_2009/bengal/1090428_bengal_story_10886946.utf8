The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | 4 fall in killing spree
                                                                                                               4 fall in killing spree
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bongaon, April 27: A young mentally challenged man who had been kept in fetters by his family after being caught trying to rob a neighbour broke free today and hacked to death a six-year-old girl and three adults before being lynched by a mob.        
	Residents of North 24-Parganas Bongaon alleged that Ratan Ghoshs family had come from Bangladesh and settled there seven years ago.         
	His wife, three children, father and brother went missing today after the 30-year-old man with a history of drug abuse went berserk.        
	He ran out with a scythe and attacked Dhiren Biswas, 65, working on his field with granddaughter Nibedita Mondal by his side. He hacked the elderly man and turned to the little girl when she raised the alarm. She was thrown to the ground and her throat was slit, a police officer said.         
	Manju Biswas, 60, and Kalidashi Bairagi, 70, who were drawn out of their houses by the girls cries, were also butchered.        
	Around 8.30am, vegetable vendor Anup Sapui saw the four bodies and a blood-splattered Ranjit standing with his weapon. Within seconds, other villagers were out as well. Some of them went to the local BSF camp and alerted the jawans there.         
	Two of the jawans joined us and we gave Ratan a chase, said Anup, 52. He could be caught 15 minutes later, only after the weapon accidentally slipped off his hand.         
	Neighbours said Ranjits children were between five and 10 years old. He used to pull a rickshaw van for a living like his father Prahlad and brother but his addiction got the better of him and the family decided to put him in chains, a police officer said.         
	According to a psychiatrist, Ranjit was possibly suffering from a personality disorder and the addiction aggravated the violent nature within him. The way he killed people at random suggests that he had not been able to take drugs for long, said psychiatrist Ranadip Ghosh Roy.        
	An elderly villager said the police came after everything was over.         
	We had no option but to beat him because he could have killed more people had he been allowed to roam free.        
	Officers of the Bongaon police station, some 2km away, claimed that they had been informed about the incident only after Ranjit was lynched.

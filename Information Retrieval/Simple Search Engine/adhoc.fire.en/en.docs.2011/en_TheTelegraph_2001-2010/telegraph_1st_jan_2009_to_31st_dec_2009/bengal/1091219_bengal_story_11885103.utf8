The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Govt plans shanty right
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Govt plans shanty right
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Dec. 18: The state government plans to provide shanty dwellers on a 99-year lease the land on which they live.         
	Starting with Siliguri on an experimental basis, the plan will later be implemented in Calcutta and Howrah, urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya said.        
	We shall start with Siliguri on an experimental basis and then implement the policy in other towns and cities, including Calcutta and Howrah. We have already identified 2,000 families living on government land in Siliguri town, the minister said.        
	If given on lease, shanty owners will not be able to sell their land, but they can rebuild homes and live without the fear of eviction.        
	The possible move comes less than six months before Calcutta Municipal Corporation and 83 other civic bodies go to the polls.         
	The Opposition called it an an attempt to woo voters who have shunned the Left in successive elections since last years rural polls.        
	Bhattacharya said the chief minister had given his consent to the proposal and a four-member panel headed by the chief secretary had been formed to work out the details. The cabinet will take a policy decision on this score once we get a comprehensive report from the panel next month, Bhattacharya said.        
	However, to implement the plan in Calcutta and Howrah, the Thika Tenancy Act, 1982, has to be amended. We plan to do that in the budget session. Once amended, people living in over 2.5 lakh slums in Howrah and Calcutta can rebuild their dwelling places with funds the government will provide, he added.        
	Mohammed Nizamuddin, joint secretary of the CPM-affiliated Calcutta Bustee Federation, said nearly 40 lakh people in the city and five lakh in Howrah would benefit.        
	According to him, Tangra, in east Calcutta, has the highest concentration of slums. Beleghata, Topsia and Rajabazar follow.        
	RSP leader Manoj Bhattacharya said he was not aware of any such move.         
	The CPM is desperate. The (shanty) plan is politically motivated, said Trinamuls Subrata Bakshi. However, for the same political reason his party will not be able to resist the move if the government goes ahead.

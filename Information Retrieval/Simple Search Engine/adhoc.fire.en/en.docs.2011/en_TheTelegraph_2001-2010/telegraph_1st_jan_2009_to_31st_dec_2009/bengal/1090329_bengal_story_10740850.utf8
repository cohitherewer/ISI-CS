The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Jeweller clue in Kaafila arrest
                                                                                                               Jeweller clue in Kaafila arrest
                            
	Calcutta, March 28: A jeweller to whom Sarod Gandhi had allegedly tried to sell slain restaurateur Mukesh Jaiswals diamond accessories turned up at airport police station yesterday.        
	Sarod, 30, the alleged mastermind of his friend Mukeshs murder, was a regular customer of the Ultadanga store whose owner guessed from where the valuables had come from after reading about the missing jewellery in newspapers.        
	Following his leads, a police team raided the Gandhis house at Pathuriaghata in north Calcutta last night and picked up Sarods elder brother Sree, who had allegedly gone to the jeweller to collect the payment for the sold stuff. More of Mukeshs jewellery was allegedly found in the house.        
	Sarod took away some of the valuables after his friend was killed, said an officer. The three killers hired by Sarod took some more.        
	Mukesh, a director of Kaafila restaurant at City Centre, Salt Lake, and its new branch on Theatre Road, went missing on Sunday evening. He was found dead on Monday.         
	Sarod, a supplier of machinery and tools, is accused of killing Mukesh so he did not have to repay the Rs 70 lakh he had borrowed from his friend. An officer said: He went to the jewellery store on Monday afternoon, hours after getting Mukesh killed.        
	The police said the jeweller had paid Rs 2.3 lakh to the Gandhi siblings in two instalments, but they wanted more.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                 Trinamul supporters celebrate in Bishnupur on Sunday. Telegraph picture        
	Calcutta, March 1: Hours after Trinamuls bypoll victory today, Congress senior leader Pranab Mukherjee signalled that talks on an alliance with Mamata Banerjee had begun.        
	We have already begun talks for working out an alliance with the Trinamul Congress. The central leadership has taken a decision on this, Mukherjee told journalists in the afternoon. By midnight, the two sides had formally announced the alliance.        
	During the day, the Congress leader in charge of Bengal for the Lok Sabha elections, K. Keshava Rao, said: The (Bishnupur West) bypoll result has sent a positive message to the party rank and file across Bengal. A Congress-Trinamul electoral tie-up could end the CPMs rule. We are all optimistic about stitching an alliance with Mamata to counter the Left in the state.         
	Earlier, Mukherjee was quoted telling party colleagues: We want an alliance with Mamata ahead of the Lok Sabha polls. Our central leadership is already in talks with Trinamul to see that the alliance is worked out. But everything depends on her (Mamata).         
	Congress Working Committee member Mukul Wasnik and Rao were present at the meeting in the state Congress headquarters near Park Circus.                    Keshava Rao in Calcutta.   (Amit Datta)    
	State Congress sources said it was also decided at the meeting that even if the alliance did not materialise, the Congress would not field a candidate against Mamata in the Calcutta South seat.         
	Last month, a Trinamul general secretary had said: Didi is waiting for the Bishnupur West bypoll result on March 1. She will talk to the Congress leadership after seeing the victory margin of our man, Madan Mitra.         
	Reacting to Mukherjees statement, Mamata said in the evening she was willing to speak to the Congress leadership. We are willing to initiate a dialogue with the Congress to firm up an alliance but a response has to come from them also, she said at her Kalighat home.         
	Yesterday, asked about sharing seats with the Congress, she said the Congress leadership had told her two months ago that it wanted to field candidates from 12 seats, including the six the party already holds.        
	For the Bishnupur West bypoll the Congress had withdrawn its candidate to avert a split in the anti-Left votes. Mukherjee said the win by a decisive margin showed peoples support for anti-Left forces. Going by todays result, it is clear that people dont want the anti-CPM votes to split.

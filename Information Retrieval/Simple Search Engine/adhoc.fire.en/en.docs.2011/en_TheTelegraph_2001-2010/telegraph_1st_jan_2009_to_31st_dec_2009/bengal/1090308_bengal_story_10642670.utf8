The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Militants pat for bomb man
                                                                                                               Militants pat for bomb man
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, March 7: The Lashkar-e-Toiba leader whom India has accused of plotting the 26/11 attacks had apparently applauded the bomb-maker caught in Calcutta yesterday for his excellence in explosives handling during training at Muridke near Lahore.        
	Abu Taher is said to have told officers of the special task force that he had met Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi on several occasions. Taher told us he supplied the explosives for at least 24 explosions since 1997. We do not know yet whether he supplied the explosives for last years Delhi, Jaipur and Bangalore blasts, an officer said.        
	Taher, 45, born in Katihar, Bihar, had allegedly left India in 1997 after carrying out blasts in Delhi and Ludhiana. He was caught after he got off the Murshidabad-Calcutta Lalgola Passenger yesterday.         
	Sleuths found a train ticket on him that said he was on his way to Delhi.        
	Taher, a close associate of Abdul Karim Tunda, the Lashkar recruiter-in-chief in Bangladesh, apparently told the police that he was specially trained in explosives handling in Pakistan. Lakhvi was pleased with my performance. I received monetary awards from him on a number of occasions after other operatives of the organisation carried out strikes successfully with the help of explosives I had prepared, he was quoted as saying.        
	The police said Taher knew how to segregate ammonium nitrate from fertilisers. This was the common explosives ingredient forensic experts found in most recent blast sites. He can make both high-intensity and low-intensity bombs and is equally good at making timer devices, said an officer.         
	Taher has apparently confessed to supplying explosives for a train blast in Pakur, in Jharkhand near the Bengal border, on August 15, 2002. Fifteen people were injured.        
	His current assignment was apparently to set up a Lashkar module. We are trying to figure out whom Taher was supposed meet during his Delhi visit, said another officer.         
	In Rajshahi, Bangladesh, the police said Tahers job was to motivate madarsa students to join the Lashkar.

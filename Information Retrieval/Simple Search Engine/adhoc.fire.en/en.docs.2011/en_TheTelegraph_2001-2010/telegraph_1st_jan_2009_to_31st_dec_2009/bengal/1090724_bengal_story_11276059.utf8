	Midnapore, July 23: CPM activists today took a leaf out of the Lalgarh resistance by blocking a road with trees to keep police out of a panchayat area while they went on a rampage to recapture lost turf.        
	In the wee hours today, the CPM activists  about 400 of them with guns and bombs  launched the attack on four villages in the Bhagabantapur gram panchayat in West Midnapore, where Lalgarh too is located.         
	One Trinamul supporter was killed, the police said.        
	While the CPM men went about setting fire to homes of Trinamul supporters, 400 women shut the local Chandrakona police out by putting tree trunks on the road.         
	At 7.30am, around 20 cops from Chandrakona police station had tried to enter the area but could not because of the chopped trees. Another 10 policemen, posted in a camp at Krishnapur, about 500m from the trouble spot, refused to venture out.         
	We heard the shots and explosions but we did not come out because we were very few in number, said a policeman in the camp.        
	Around 9.30am, when a police contingent finally managed to enter the villages  Maheshpur, Murakata, Ramberia and Khandanga  after removing the chopped trees, the CPM activists had already finished their job.         
	The task the CPM set out to achieve around 3am was done by 6. Red flags were seen fluttering atop houses.        
	The CPM had won the Bhagabantapur panchayat poll, about 100km from Lalgarh and 125km from Calcutta, uncontested last year. But in the general elections, the party trailed by 2,500 votes in the panchayat area  a sign that Trinamul was gaining ground.         
	After todays attack 10 people were arrested.        
	The mother of Aftabuddin Bhangi, the Trinamul supporter who was killed, said CPM activists snatched his body. Fatema Bibi said: My son had run out of the house and a bullet hit him in the chest. When some neighbours and I were taking his body to a hospital in Garbeta, CPM activists snatched it away from us.         
	The police found the body in Garbeta, about 7km from the area, in the evening. The Trinamul said 12 supporters were missing.         
	CPM MLA Gurupada Dutta said: It was the Trinamul supporters who opened fire on our men. Despite opposition, they managed to enter the villages.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Mamata and Congress in seat tussle
                                                                                                               Mamata and Congress in seat tussle
          BARUN GHOSH                          Mamata: Sulking?                                  
	Calcutta, July 19: A tug-of-war has begun between the Congress and Mamata Baner-jee over the byelection to the Bowbazar Assembly seat on August 18.         
	Two Calcutta seats  Bowbazar and Sealdah  from where Congress candidates had won in 2006 are going to polls that day because the MLAs have become MPs.         
	The duo  Sudip Bandopadhyay and Somen Mitra  are with the Trinamul Congress now and Mamatas party wants the seats vacated by them to be split among the allies. But the Congress feels it has a right to contest both seats.         
	The growing tension bet- ween the two parties came to light yesterday when some state Congress leaders pleaded with their president, Pranab Mukherjee, to ensure that they could field candidates from both Bowbazar and Sealdah.         
	Mamata is ready to part with Somens Sealdah, but not Sudips Bowbazar.        
	State Congress working president Subrata Mukherjee said: We met Pranabda yesterday realising Mamata was eyeing Bowbazar. Things have to be sorted out (with Trinamul) fast as we have to begin picking our candidates in a day or two.        
	Immediately after the Congress delegation called on Pranab, Mamata apparently called up the state Congress president and staked her claim to Bowbazar.        
	However, according to Subrata, Pranab also thinks the party should contest both seats.        
	Technically, Somens seat fell vacant after the Assembly Speaker cancelled his membership following a complaint from the Congress as he had floated his own outfit. However, he became an MP on a Trinamul ticket. Sudip has formally joined Trinamul.         
	A Trinamul general secretary said: We are not asking for Sealdah, which has traditionally been represented by the Congress. But Mamata is right to ask for Bowbazar from the Congress. It was represented by our Nayana Bandopadhyay (Sudips wife) between 2001 and 06.         
	Sudip said Trinamul should get the seat because he had bagged the highest number of votes from that Assembly segment when he won the parliamentary polls on Trinamul tickets in 1998 and99 from erstwhile Calcutta North West.         
	Realising that the claims and counter-claims might take their toll on the alliance firmed up before this years Lok Sabha polls, Congress general secretary K. Keshava Rao is hurrying to the city on Tuesday.        
	From Delhi, Rao said he was earlier scheduled to come to Calcutta on August 9 but rescheduled it at Pranabs directive. I shall talk to Mamataji about the bypolls. Besides, I shall also attend her rally on Tuesday.         
	He added: There is no doubt that we deserve Bowbazar, but we must also take forward the alliance with Mamataji.

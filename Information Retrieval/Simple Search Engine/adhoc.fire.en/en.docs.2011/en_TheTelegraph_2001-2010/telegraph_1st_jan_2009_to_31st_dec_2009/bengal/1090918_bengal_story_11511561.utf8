	Durgapur, Sept. 17: Durgapur police yesterday fed 850 people at an iftar on the police station grounds, flouting a government order barring celebration of festivals on campuses used by law enforcers.        
	Although there is no specific law, there is a government order restricting such programmes inside any police establishment. I am not aware of what exactly happened in the Durgapur police lines but I will enquire about it, home secretary Ardhendu Sen said.        
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had earlier asked the police not to organise Kali puja in police stations.        
	Last evening, around 800 Muslims who prayed on the police grounds were treated to fish fry, vegetable cutlet, fruits, dry fruits, cakes, sweets and fruit juice.        
	The iftar was held between 5pm and 7pm in a pandal. Among those who attended it were Durgapur mayor Rathin Roy and local CPM MLA Biprendu Chakraborty.        
	Pintu Mukherjee, the officer in charge of Durgapur police station, said: We invited 700 people, including the mayor, local MLA, Opposition party leaders, our officers and journalists, but over 850 turned up to make our programme a success. It was done to improve police-public relations.        
	A local catering company, Bhuri Bhoj, was engaged to supply the food that came at Rs 65 a plate. We had arrangements to serve 700 people but later the OC told us to add another 150 plates. We charged Rs 65 a plate, said Dipankar De Sarkar, the proprietor of the catering agency.         
	The police also distributed a lungi and a sari to each iftar guest. The police also spent over Rs 10,000 to pay the decorator for the pandal, chairs and tables. The total cost came to around Rs 2 lakh.         
	Asked where the money had come from, Mukherjee said it was donated by well-wishers but refused to elaborate.         
	Burdwan superintendent of police R. Rajsekharan has ordered a probe into the matter. If the officers are unable to give satisfactory replies to showcause notices, they may be suspended.         
	The OC had told me that he was going to organise a small gathering for the Muslim policemen. I had no idea about this big and costly iftar, he said.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Midnapore, Nov. 8: Suspected Maoists last night murdered a CPM activist about 25km from the circuit house in Midnapore town where the chief minister was staying.         
	Nabakumar Singh, 42, had fled his home with several other activists in the wake of a Maoist strike in the area three months ago. But the man who owned about two-thirds of an acre took a chance and returned a fortnight ago for the potato-sowing season.        
	Past 10 last night, the gang first knocked on the door of Nabakumars brother Lakshmi and called him out to identify his siblings house.         
	My uncle obliged the Maoists under threat. When the armed men stormed into our courtyard after breaking open the door and started calling out for my father, he hid himself under a bed in fear. But they found him out and dragged him by the neck. We dared not resist, said Nabakumars son Dipak, 20.        
	There were about 70 people in the gang. I heard one of them ask father about how many CPM activists had taken shelter in the Enayatpur party office (about 7km from the village) and what arms they had stockpiled there, Dipak added.         
	Around 8am today, the residents of Gohaldanga village, about 160km from Calcutta, found Nabakumars bullet-riddled body in a paddy field. His hands were tied behind him.        
	It appears to be a Maoist job, said an officer of the Midnapore police station.         
	About 100 CPM activists from Gohaldanga and neighbouring Sirshi and Chandra villages have taken shelter in the CPM office at Enayatpur.         
	About 150km away, in Gopiballavpur near Bengals border with Orissa, CPM zonal committee secretary Subhas Soren was shot at. Soren, 55, is in hospital with gunshot injuries in his waist.         
	On Friday night, three members of an anti-Maoist outfit were shot dead by the Maoists in Binpur, about 80km from Midnapore town.

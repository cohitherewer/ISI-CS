                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Miffed boys flee school
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Calcutta, Dec. 12: Fifteen students of a residential school in Barrackpore who were missing from the campus this afternoon were traced to Canning.        
	Some school officials who did not want to be named said the boys, aged between 12 and 14, had been seeking the removal of a hostel warden.         
	Police, however, are not drawing any conclusion yet. Its too early to comment on the matter, said Rahul Srivastava, the police chief of North 24-Parganas, where the boys school is located.         
	Sources said the students had earlier accused the warden of not allowing them extra helpings of food and beating them up.        
	Principal K. Victor Paul said: They (the boys) may have fled. We have contacted some of them.        
	Sumita Shaw, whose son Pritam in Class VIII is among the 15 missing, told the police that the boy had called up home to say he was safe with his friends. He also told her he would not return unless the warden was removed.         
	A senior officer said: Sumita Shaw told us her son said that unless the warden was not removed, he and his friends would not return. We are verifying her claim.         
	Ghutiarisharif in Canning, where the boys have been traced to, is in South 24-Parganas.

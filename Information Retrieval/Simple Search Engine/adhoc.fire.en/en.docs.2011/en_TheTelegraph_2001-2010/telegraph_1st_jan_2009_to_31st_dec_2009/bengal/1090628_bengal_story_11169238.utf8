          PRONAB MONDAL AND IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI      
	Ramgarh, June 27: A welcome awaited the security forces as their 35-vehicle convoy rolled into Ramgarh this afternoon.        
	The residents of the small town, standing along the Kadashole-Ramgarh road, offered the troops water  a relief on a humid June afternoon for the jawans who had lost a colleague to heat stroke.        
	We are so relieved the security forces have come. The last few months were a nightmare, said Abani Chatterjee, a retired post and telegraph employee. He had skipped his siesta because he wanted to see the troops enter the town, and had waited on the road for over an hour.        
	The jawans approached some people and asked for water. They had been told that no resident was to be harmed.        
	There were specific instructions that no villager should be touched. A smiling and approachable force is a big confidence-building measure, a senior police officer said.         
	Ramgarh, with a 10,000-plus population, is the second-largest of Binpur I blocks 14 panchayat areas after Lalgarh. Over 70 per cent of the towns residents are non-tribals, engaged in farming and trade or holding regular jobs.        
	Although the townspeople are not part of the Maoists core support base, the rebels had turned Ramgarh into a stronghold with help from the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities.        
	The 30-odd shops in Ramgarhs bazaar used to bustle till November, drawing people from nearby villages such as Kushmasuli, Chotishole and Alamdanga. Then the Peoples Committee began its police boycott and, like elsewhere in and around Lalgarh, business suffered here too.        
	For the past three months, most shopkeepers at Ramgarh bazaar had kept their shutters down.        
	Minati Jena, a housewife, said that though the Maoists and their Peoples Committee collaborators never harmed residents, they terrorised them by organising rallies and marches by armed activists.        
	Chatterjee said: They forced me and my family several times to participate in the rallies, held under the banner of the Peoples Committee. Since there were hardly any policemen, we could not protest.        
	A retired policeman said: My son is a schoolteacher. He and his colleagues pay a levy of Rs 500 to the Maoists every month. I hope the security forces camp here for sometime and leave only after normality returns.        
	A senior officer said the 120-odd policemen at the Ramgarh outpost were virtually held hostage in their two-storey building for the past seven months.

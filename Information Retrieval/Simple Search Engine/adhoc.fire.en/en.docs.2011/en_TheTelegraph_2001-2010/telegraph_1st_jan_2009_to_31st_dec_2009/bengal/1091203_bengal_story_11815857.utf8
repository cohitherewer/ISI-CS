  - Officials turn down Trinamul plea to visit villages        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Sulking? Trinamuls Mukul Roy at the BSF guesthouse. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)				                                       
	Calcutta, Dec. 2: The central team that was in Bengal for a two-day visit to discuss law and order with the government refused to tour any of the troubled areas despite a fresh Trinamul Congress request this morning.        
	Union minister Mukul Roy, who led the Trinamul delegation that met the team at the BSF guesthouse on Gurusaday Road, called up Mamata Banerjee and complained: Despite our request that they visit Khanakul they decided not to do so.         
	Mamata will take up the matter with the Union home minister, he added.        
	The Trinamul chief, who had been coaxing the Centre to send a team to villages where her supporters had been under attack, was upset last evening when it became known that the central team did not intend to go anywhere.        
	Roy said: We requested the officials to see for themselves the CPMs state-sponsored terrorism. We also told them to talk to the injured and the families of those killed.         
	The team responded by promising to carefully go through the papers he had submitted.         
	The officials accepted a Trinamul document claiming 150 of its activists had been killed since the May Lok Sabha polls and newspaper clippings and CDs purportedly carrying evidence of CPM-sponsored violence. Then they left for Writers Buildings for a meeting with district magistrates.        
	After a lunch break, the team led by Union home ministry additional secretary Dipranjan Sarathi Chowdhury returned to the secretariat around 2pm. The officials met chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti and home secretary Ardhendu Sen for about 10 minutes before leaving to catch a 5pm flight to Delhi.        
	Asked about the reason given by the team for not visiting any of the troubled areas, the home secretary said: Presumably, they didnt feel it necessary to visit such areas after having been briefed by the district magistrates.        
	Roy tried to find some conso- lation for the party. That a central team has come to the state after 32 years of Left misrule is an achievement on our part. Had the situation been normal, they wouldnt have come at all. They told us we wouldnt be denied justice.        
	The leader of the central team heads the Union home ministrys Naxalite management division and Writers sources suggested that much of todays talks focused on Maoist violence.         
	They said the discussions centred on:        
	n Strengthening intelligence network using technology  email and, if possible, satellite phones        
	n Increasing strength of police force and fortification of police stations in the Lalgarh region        
	n Increasing number of thanas and police-population ratio        
	n Filling up vacant police posts, said to be around 4,000 across the state        
	n Posting at least 50 personnel in every police station in the Maoist belt, instead of the current 15         
	n Imparting annual training to cops in guerrilla warfare        
	n Categorising thanas as urban, semi-urban and rural and allocating more funds and personnel to the rural ones        
	n Bridging the gap between officers and foot soldiers        
	Home secretary Sen said the team also took stock of incidents in other areas and the steps taken by the government. They didnt comment but only took down details of the incidents. They also didnt recommend anything.

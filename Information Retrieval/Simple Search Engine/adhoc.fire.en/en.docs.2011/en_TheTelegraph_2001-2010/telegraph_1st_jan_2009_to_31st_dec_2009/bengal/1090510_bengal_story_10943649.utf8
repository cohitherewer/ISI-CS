The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Biman mum on little Sania
                                                                                                               Biman mum on little Sania
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Paramilitary personnel on poll duty march through Tollygunge on Saturday evening. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                                  
	Calcutta, May 9: CPM state secretary Biman Bose today had nothing to say on the murder of Sania Khatoun in Nandigram, possibly the youngest victim of this election at one year and 11 months.        
	With Bengals ballot battle being increasingly fought with bullets, claiming at least 15 lives in the first two phases, Bose accused the Trinamul Congress-Congress combine of attacking first.         
	He was reminded about the toddler who was in her mothers lap when she was shot dead allegedly by CPM activists.        
	The CPM top gun looked embarrassed but didnt express regret for the killing, unlike after the deaths in police firing in Nandigram two years ago.         
	I did not read the newspaper reports on the violence in detail as I was busy with other studies. What can I say about it? I have nothing to say, Bose said, lowering his eyes.        
	If the Opposition has seen signs of a popular backlash and resistance against the ruling party in the violence, Bose has sniffed the rivals desperate designs to hold on to losing ground.        
	The Trinamul Congress chief had incited the violence by asking voters to come out with household weapons like haata-khunti (spoon and ladle) on polling day. We had got a hint of her design to spread violence and alerted people accordingly. The Opposition, particularly Trinamul, started the violence everywhere, he said.         
	The forces of anarchy and evil will continue the violence till the last phase of the polls on May 13, he added, and asked the government to deal sternly with the troublemakers.         
	The state party chief parried questi- ons on whether the Left would be able to retain its 2004 tally of 35 or whether there would be a repeat of 1984, its worst performance in the past three decades with 26 seats. We are fighting to win all 42, he said.         
	Bose and several other CPM leaders indicated the recovery of a good part of the Left support base, lost in last years panchayat polls, but the Bengal CPM chief was edgy when asked about the erosion of support among Muslims, backward castes and tribes. These questions are communal and divisive. Panchayat and Lok Sabha polls are not the same. People have come to realise the difference between truth and lies, he said.

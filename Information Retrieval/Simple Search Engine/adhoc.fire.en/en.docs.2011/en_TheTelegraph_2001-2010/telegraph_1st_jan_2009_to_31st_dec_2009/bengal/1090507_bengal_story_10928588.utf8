The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Minus CPM badge, trio branded witch
                                                                                                               Minus CPM badge, trio branded witch
          UTTAM DUTTA                          Bharat Kisku (right) with his family. (Ananda Das)                                  
	Haripal (Hooghly), May 6: Not a CPM supporter, then a witch and outcast.        
	Three tribals have been branded witches and banished from their homes in two Hooghly villages with their families after they switched allegiance to the Jharkhand Disham Party a few months ago.        
	Brothers Tipu and Soben Hembram have been blamed for chicken and goat deaths in Jangiparas Ayodhya, a CPM stronghold.        
	Bharat Kisku of Sonatikri in Haripal has been held responsible for more  a neighbour falling sick.        
	The Hembrams exit followed a shalishi (reconciliation) meeting that decreed the poultry had died because of the evil spell cast by the brothers. They were fined Rs 60,000.         
	We told the shalishi sabha we wont be able to pay the fine. Then, some villagers threatened to kill us if we didnt leave. We had to flee to a relatives house, said Tipu, 70.         
	The brothers, both sharecroppers, had lodged a comp- laint with Hooghly police chief Rajeev Mishra, who promised protection.        
	They were escorted back home last week but have been living in fear. Since we returned, we are being threatened by some villagers who are pressuring us to withdraw our complaint, said Tipu.        
	The Hembrams, long-time CPM supporters, switched sides after the Jharkhand Disham Party started campaigning for the development of the tribal pockets in Hooghly, inspired by the agitation in Lalgarh.         
	The pradhan of the CPM-controlled Jangipara panchayat, Basudeb Haldar, denied the partys role in the Hembrams ouster, saying they were driven out because they were branded witches.         
	Although the villagers are CPM supporters, this has got nothing to do with our party. The two brothers are victims of superstition, said Haldar.        
	In nearby Sonatikri, Bharat was forced to leave with his wife and 21-year-old daughter in November, a few days after he joined the Disham party. They were driven out again in March.         
	The family had requested the CPM controlled Olipur-Kashipur panchayat to be allowed in so they could cast their votes.         
	The pradhan, Sufal Mandi, promised to escort them back  after the election.        
	Bharat was labelled a witch after a housewife in the neighbourhood fell ill.         
	Mugli Baskey, who stayed near our house, fell ill. Some goats and chickens also died and my husband was blamed for both incidents, said Bharats wife Arati.        
	Mandi tried to put the blame on the villagers. They will not allow Bharat to stay. The villagers are angry because he joined the Jharkhand Disham Party.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Long march from island to mainland
                                                                                                               Long march from island to mainland
          ZEESHAN JAWED                          Sunderbans villagers on their way to the Godkhali launch ghat. (Sanjay Chattopadhyaya)                                  
	Gosaba (Sunderbans), May 30: Subrata Murmu could not bear the stench anymore.        
	The stench of his dead, rotting buffaloes floating outside his roofless house and his standing crop that is now decaying under water.        
	Cyclone Aila claimed everything from the farmer, sparing only his family. Like hundreds of cyclone-hit residents of Gosaba island in the Sunderbans, Subrata is fleeing to the mainland.        
	He wants to take his family  wife, three children and aged parents  to Thakurpukur in Calcutta, about 140km from the cluster of islands.        
	Little help came from the government after Subrata became homeless on Monday. For our family of seven, we got 250gm of chira (flattened rice) and gur (jaggery) and five pouches of water a day, Subrata said.         
	The fear of disease is also playing on his mind. My four-and-a-half-year-old girl already has fever, Subrata said.        
	It was impossible for us to stay back in our home in Gosaba, the conditions are so bad, he said. There is waist-deep water inside the house, the thatched roof has blown away and our two dead buffaloes are floating outside our home. We cant even cook. The stench, its unbearable.        
	Of the 45 lakh people in the Sunderbans, spread across the 52 inhabited islands, about 25 lakh people suffered property ruin when cyclone Aila struck. In Gosaba alone, 2.5 lakh people are believed to have been affected.        
	Today, bags and utensils on their heads, hundreds of villagers  some tugging along goats and calves that luckily survived  stood in a long queue at the Godkhali launch ghat. They had crossed the Bidyadhari river from Gosaba. They were bound for Basanti  the nearest mainland point. Some like Subrata want to move farther, to Calcutta, where they can live with some dignity with relatives.        
	Social activist Tushar Kanjilal, who has worked for the uplift of the people in the Sunderbans, said he had never seen such destruction in the Sunderbans in the last 50 years.        
	In some places, Kanjilal said, even the meagre relief that Subrata got had not reached.        
	Gosaba town is like a ghost town. Most of the kuchcha houses have crumbled. The ones made of bricks have been deserted. People have either shifted to relief camps  there is one in a Gosaba school  or have left the Sunderbans hoping things will get better later.        
	Subrata, though, was sceptical about what the future held. The crop on his two-and-a-half bighas has gone waste. I dont know what we will do once the water recedes, or what we will eat, he said.        
	On the islands of Rangaberia and Bageberia, both near Gosaba, people have started living on embankments.         
	They wave at passing launches in the hope of aid. No relief material has come our way. We are desperate, said Bapi Gayen of Bageberia. Sometimes, people just dump tarpaulin, gur and chira on the embankment and rush off. No one bothers to come and see our plight. Wont somebody do something?        
	The block development officer of Gosaba, Amiya Bhushan Chakraborty, admitted that relief distribution has been slow.        
	There are not enough boats to take the relief material to the interior areas, he said. Just in the Gosaba block there are 2.5 lakh people living without a roof over their heads.        
	Kanjilal said he feared that during high tide on purnima, which falls on Thursday, water may enter the islands again.        
	There are around 3500km of embankments in the Sunderbans, he said. Of this, 600 km got washed away and another 500km need repair. People will now have to build temporary embankments with gunny bags by Thursday.

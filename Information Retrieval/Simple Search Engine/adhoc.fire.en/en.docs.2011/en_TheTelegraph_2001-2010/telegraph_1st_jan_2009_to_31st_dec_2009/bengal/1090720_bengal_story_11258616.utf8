          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Purulia, July 19: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today admitted that there might be villages in the Ayodhya hills of Purulia where water was so scarce that people and animals were drinking from the same source.         
	It may be so. But that is not the general trend in the district, the chief minister said when reporters covering his trip to one of Bengals most under-developed districts told him about villages where the same water source served humans and animals.         
	He avoided comment when asked if people from such deprived villages were turning Maoist sympathisers.        
	After daylong meetings with local officials and leaders, the chief minister told reporters that providing water for drinking and irrigation was the governments priority. He went to see a new reservoir at Chharra, 8km from the district headquarters.        
	But at least 10 villages in Baghmundi block, about 45km from the town, are without drinking water even after 32 years of Left Front rule. At Borgora and Amkocha, for example, villagers depend on water from a hill stream along with dogs and other animals of the surrounding forests.        
	Bhattacharjee brought with him a heavy downpour to the district, which has received less than average rain this monsoon.         
	The rain drenched to the skin about 300 children of Chharra High School who had been told to come to the institution  next to the pond that the chief minister went to see  if they wanted a glimpse of the VIP.         
	The teacher-in-charge had told the students to come in fresh uniforms on Sunday for the chief ministers visit. They had even been promised sweets and snacks if they turned up, said Pareshnath Rajak, a trader whose children Aparna and Dayamoy study there. Im worried that they might get fever, the father said.        
	Teacher-in-charge Narayan Choudhury said security personnel had told him the students would not be allowed into the school today if they were not in uniform. He claimed many of the students had wanted to come on their own on Sunday to see the chief minister from close.        
	But the fact remains that hundreds of these children got wet waiting since 8am for the chief minister to turn up at 9.30, said Chiranjiv Banerjee, a Chharra resident.

	Nandigram, May 8: Hasina Bibi became a widow last night. She also became a refugee for the third time in a year and a half, having to flee her home in CPM citadel Satengabari.        
	CPM cadres going house to house and threatening Trinamul Congress supporters who had defied their diktat and voted battered her husband to death.        
	There were about 100 of them, armed members of the CPMs Harmad Bahini (cadres army). They screamed revenge against those of us who had voted, said Hasina, 35, squatting in a courtyard adja-cent to Maheshpur High School, her children clinging to her.        
	She has four daughters aged between two and eight and a son, who is a year old.        
	Hasina said she ran to a police jeep parked only 200 metres away from their home when Yasin Mir was lying in blood. The police refused to budge, saying they were only there to guard the polling booth at Satengabari Primary School.        
	Her brother-in-law Mohsin and half a dozen others carried a blood-soaked Yasin on their shoulders for around 2km to reach the block hospital. Yasin died hours later.        
	Around 3am, Hasina joined the hordes of Trinamul supporters running for their lives from Satengabari. Trudging 5km, she reached the school, which had doubled as a polling centre earlier in the day. There, we joined many others, most of them men, crouching inside classrooms. I spread a bed sheet on the floor for my children to sleep. This is the first time Im out of home without my husband, Hasina said, tears rolling down.        
	By morning, the refugee camp was cramped with over 1,000 people from Satengabari, Keyakhali, Ranichak, Takapura, Kamalpur, Girirbazar  all part of the only gram panch- ayat the CPM won in Nandig-ram last year. Trinamul controls the 16 others.        
	Yasin, Hasina and Mohsin had fled home for the first time during the CPMs bloody re- capture of Nandigram in November 2007. They were forced to flee home a second time on the eve of last years panchayat polls.         
	Trinamul leaders today organised a meal of rice, dal and pumpkin curry for about 700 people. The rest had to make do with puffed rice and batasa.        
	Mir Mosharaf Ali of Ranichak has also become home- less a third time. The count is the same for his two-year-old son. A tailor in Howrah, Mir had come home to vote. We are tired of running for our lives, he said.        
	About 200 more have taken refuge in a Tekhali bakery and a house in Nandigram town.         
	Trinamul leaders said they had asked the administration to escort these people home immediately. Mohsin was not sure about when that would be.

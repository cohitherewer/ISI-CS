The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Children injected expired vaccine
                                                                                                               Children injected expired vaccine
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chinsurah, July 7: Six children aged between five and 14 were hospitalised with breathing problems this afternoon after health workers administered Japanese encephalitis vaccines past their expiry date in a Hooghly village.        
	A farmer father first noticed the May 26, 2009, expiry date on an empty ampoule lying on the ground at the health camp. He brought it to the notice of a local schoolteacher and they found all the ampoules outdated.         
	By then, 40 children had been injected with the vaccine at Natibpur village, in the Khanakul area of Hooghly.        
	Panic-stricken parents rushed to the local health centre with their children even before they fell ill. Asima Sardar brought her daughter Sushila, 14, after she said she was finding it difficult to breathe. My daughter was vaccinated around 10.30am. Around one, she complained of breathing trouble, the mother said.         
	The doctor on duty admitted Sushila. Five more were admitted by 4pm.        
	District chief medical officer (CMO) Bhusan Chakraborty said the vaccines did not have side effects and should not harm the children. The condition of those who have been admitted is stable.        
	Paediatricians in Calcutta, too, said it was unlikely that the faulty vaccines would lead to illnesses. However, the purpose of administering the vaccine will be defeated as it has lost potency, said Apurba Ghosh, director of the Institute of Child Health.        
	Japanese encephalitis is a disease caused by a mosquito-borne virus and affects the brain. The vaccination drive was being undertaken because many children had been affected in the region over the past few years.        
	As news of the lapse spread, nearly 2,000 villagers gathered at the primary school where the camp was being held. Some of them slapped the three health workers  Rita Das, Khudiram Samanta and Chandana Parui  and locked them in a room.        
	Police persuaded them to lift the gherao six hours later.        
	Chief medical officer Chakraborty said a probe into the lapse had been ordered.

	New Delhi, March 7: Worried by the spectre of a rainbow Opposition alliance, the Bengal CPM is hoping that the general election will be decided by national rather than local issues.        
	State party secretary Biman Bose told the CPM central leadership today that the Lok Sabha elections, unlike the recent local body polls and Assembly byelections where the party suffered serious blows, would be fought on national issues, according to sources.        
	Some sources said Boses statement, made in a report he presented at the party central committee meeting that began here today, may carry a hidden implication.         
	He could be suggesting that the general election would put to the test the party leaderships positions on national issues, a source said.        
	Bengal CPM leaders said their election campaign would focus on subjects such as the economic slowdown and the Centres policies in relation to it.        
	Bose did not try to downplay the threat a united Opposition could pose. The state unit believes it will face tough fights in at least half of Bengals 42 Lok Sabha seats.        
	Asked what the biggest challenge before the Left was in these elections, Bose told reporters outside the CPM headquarters: It is the rainbow combination put up by Trinamul and the Congress. He wondered how the Congress will be part of such an arrangement but did not elaborate.        
	Party leaders from Bengal explained the word rainbow  it meant all the anti-CPM elements, from the Naxalites to the BJP, would join forces even if the alliance was only between the Congress and Trinamul.        
	Its a tough election, but we are confident of winning the majority of seats, politburo member and industries minister Nirupam Sen said.        
	In the past too the Left had defeated a Trinamul-Congress alliance. We are always prepared and we can defeat the alliance.        
	Sen said the economic crisis would be a major poll plank, but had to admit that industrialisation too would be.         
	He put up a brave front saying: The majority of the people in Bengal are in favour of industrialisation.        
	Sen said that in the recent panchayat elections, the CPM had polled more than 50 per cent of the votes despite the Opposition trying to make Nandigram and Singur an international issue.        
	Politburo member Sitaram Yechury said: The Congress-Trinamul understanding was a de facto one in the last elections; it has become de jure now.        
	A central committee member from Bengal, Shyamal Chakraborty, said the Left Front had never underestimated the strength of the Opposition, nor would it overestimate its strength.        
	The central committee meeting, which ends tomorrow, discussed the party manifesto and seat-sharing issues.

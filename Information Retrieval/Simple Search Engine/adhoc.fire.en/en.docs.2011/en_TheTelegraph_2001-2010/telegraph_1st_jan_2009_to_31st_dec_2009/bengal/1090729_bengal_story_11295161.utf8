	July 28: Had police been around when bandh enforcers held a sword to Arghya Samantas throat yesterday, he would have lived, his father said.        
	The hardware trader is believed to have died of shock after supporters of the Jharkhand Disham Party threatened to kill him for daring to keep his shop open.        
	If the police were there had they come hearing about the bandh enforcers, I wouldnt have lost my son, Swarup Samanta, 55, said in Burdwans Raina.        
	Other traders alleged that the local police station, 1.5km away, had been informed im-mediately after the tribals had arrived, armed with swords, spears and bows and arrows.         
	The police had told them: Aamra dekhchhi. It literally means we are watching, something the police have been accused of doing across the state, from Lalgarh to Darjeeling, instead of acting.        
	The Disham supporters had forced shops in two other markets to shut before they came here. But hearing the police say aamra dekhchhi, we thought the force would arrive any moment. They didnt, said grocer Debashis Som.        
	The bandh had been called to demand the withdrawal of forces from Lalgarh.        
	Burdwan police said they had not anticipated such hooliganism. There was no special police arrangement at the Raina bazaar for the bandh because the party doesnt have a strong organisation there, said additional superintendent Humayun Kabir.         
	Asked about the blockade of Durgapur Expressway that troubled thousands, a subdivisional police officer said: We requested the agitators to move, but they didnt listen.        
	The same road was blocked near Dankuni today by a group protesting the murder of a transport company employee. The police stood and watched.        
	IG Raj Kanojia said a probe had been ordered into the polices role at Raina and on the highway.        
	Bandh victim        
	A man who could not reach a hospital in Calcutta because of yesterdays bandh committed suicide on the fringes of Burdwan town. Sagardeb Hatis family said he had been suffering from a painful eye.

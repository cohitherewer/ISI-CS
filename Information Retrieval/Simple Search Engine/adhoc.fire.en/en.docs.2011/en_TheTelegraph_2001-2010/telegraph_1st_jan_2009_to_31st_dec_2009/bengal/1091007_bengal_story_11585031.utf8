The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Govt clean chit to artistes
                                                                                                               Govt clean chit to artistes
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 6: The government today said there was no evidence of writers and artistes having links with Maoists, 24 hours after Mamata Banerjee warned that Bengal will burn if the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act is slapped against them for sympathising with the Lalgarh agitation.         
	Asked if some of Bengals leading authors and artistes had been behind Chhatradhar Mahatos movement or had links with Maoists, home secretary Ardhendu Sen first evaded giving a direct answer.        
	Yesterday, Prasun Chatterjee and Raja Sorkhel were arrested on the basis of evidence collected against them. They were not only involved in collecting money in order to provide financial assistance to the Maoists but they also maintained links with Maoist organisations.... No evidence has been found against the intellectuals you people are talking about, Sen said.        
	Asked if he was clearing the air on Mahasweta Devi, Aparna Sen and Joy Goswami, Sen said: I have categorically said two people were arrested on the basis of information gathered against them. As for the names you mentioned, there is no proof or evidence of their involvement with the Maoists. They would have faced arrest had it been so.        
	On Saturday, chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti had said those who are helping any banned outfit are making themselves liable for punishment under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act.        
	Mamatas threat was in response to this statement.        
	Sen also clarified today that none of those arrested in connection with the Lalgarh movement were murderers. The murderers are still in the forests, he said. But in the same breath he added that two or three of those arrested have been found to be involved in some murder cases.        
	He said more arrests were likely in Calcutta as Mahato, who led the Maoist-backed Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities, has given certain names during the interrogation.        
	He admitted that, so far, the police had not found anything to prove that Mahato was a member of any Maoist organisation.         
	Sen said: The person who gave interviews with his back to the camera (in Lalgarh) was Kishanji or Koteswar Rao. He will also be arrested though it could prove to be a bit difficult than arresting Mahato.

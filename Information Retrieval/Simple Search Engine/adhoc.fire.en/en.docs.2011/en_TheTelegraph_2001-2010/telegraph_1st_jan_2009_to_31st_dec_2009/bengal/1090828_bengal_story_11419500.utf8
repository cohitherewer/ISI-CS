	Behrampore, Aug. 27: The hostel in Murshidabad where a tribal girl died last night after suspected goons sneaked in has a 50-year-old woman cook as its night guard.        
	A 50-year-old woman who is a cook in the hostel  32 girls stay there  keeps watch at night. There are no security guards, a police officer said.        
	During a power cut around 9.30 last night, four men entered the hostel located in a secluded part of Itor village, 230km from Calcutta.        
	Murshidabad superintendent of police B.L. Meena yesterday said Pratima Baskey, 13, was found dead with scars and scratch marks on her body. The cause of the death has not been ascertained, Meena said. Four other girls were hospitalised senseless. Their condition was better today.        
	Arindam Mondal, headmaster of Itor Santhal Shiksha Niketan, today said: We are running the hostel for the past 34 years but never had any security arrangement. After yesterday, we have realised we need proper security. He has sought security from the police to run the hostel where boarding and lodging are free.        
	There are two hostels  one for girls, the other for boys. The boys hostel is on the school premises but the girls hostel about 100m from the school. The hostel is surrounded by tall trees.        
	Two superintendents are supposed to be in charge of the hostels. But Anil Ghosh and Jagadish Ghosh, who were appointed to the posts on August 1 dont stay on the premises of the school or the hostel. They stay in their own homes in Itor village.        
	We go home at night after the hostel boarders have had dinner. We dont stay at the hostel because we are no longer required for any work, said Jagadish Ghosh.        
	The school is aided by the state government, which also runs the hostel.        
	The police initially thought the four alleged goons  there are still no details about who they are  tried to rape a girl. Today, while questioning the girls, the police found out no one had entered any room.         
	We were probing the rape angle because we found scratch marks on the dead girls right hand and neck. While questioning the girls, we came to know that Pratima and 14 others had rushed to hide under two beds and there was a stampede of sorts. Pratima may have got the scratch marks while trying to hide, said sub-divisional police officer of Lalbag, Rajsekhar Ganguly.

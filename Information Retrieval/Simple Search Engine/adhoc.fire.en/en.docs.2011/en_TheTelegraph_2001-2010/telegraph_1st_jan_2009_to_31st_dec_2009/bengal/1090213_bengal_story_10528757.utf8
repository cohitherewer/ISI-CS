The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Money at one go for land losers
                                                                                                               Money at one go for land losers
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Nirupam Sen                          
	Calcutta, Feb. 12: The government will pay land losers their full compensation at one go, instead of the three-instalment policy in force now, to cut red tape.        
	No date has yet been set for the implementation but a meeting of a sub-committee chaired by industries minister Nirupam Sen decided today that the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC) will pay the land and land reforms ministry 10 per cent of the total money as administrative costs and the rest 90 per cent within three to six months of paying the first instalment.         
	The land and land reforms ministry will announce the compensation or award and give the land losers the money at one go.         
	Under the new policy, the requiring body (the WBIDC) will give 10 per cent as administrative costs initially and the remaining 90 per cent at one go before the award is declared against the land. This will help land losers get the compensation quickly once their land is acquired, Sen said after the meeting.         
	Sen said once the full amount was paid, the mutation for the land would be done.        
	Abdur Rezzak Mollah, the land and land reforms minister who was present at the meeting, said: If 1,000 acres are acquired, the industry department or WBIDC will have to give 10 per cent to my department as administrative costs. The remaining 90 per cent must come to us before we declare the award for land losers.         
	Under the current system, the payment by the WBIDC to the land ministry and by the ministry to the farmers is broken into instalments of 10, 50 and 40 per cent.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Please, please, plead police
                                                                                                               Please, please, plead police
          SUJAN DUTTA                              
	Lalgarh, April 23: The Lalgarh story is about taking on the state administration but just how it unfolds is a scene to behold.         
	One episode revealed itself this afternoon. The Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities that is leading the Lalgarh movement should really have been on the defensive after allegations from both the CPM and the police that Maoists were suspected to have killed about six CPM workers in a village near Ramgarh, just short of the Lalgarh area.        
	But by the evening, the tables were turned. In the presence of The Telegraph correspondent, a police officer even telephoned the secretary of the committee and urged him to call off a protest march and said sorry for fear that the demonstration would snowball into a larger movement.        
	The committee has called a rally in Calcutta tomorrow.         
	The events went like this.         
	Around seven in the morning, the officer-in-charge of Lalgarh police station called the secretary of the committee, Sidhu Soren, a youth in his mid-twenties, who rides a motorcycle in style.         
	The police officer threatened to lead a force to a village named Shaluka, said Soren at the Katapahari Chowk this afternoon, as he filled petrol in his bike.         
	A CPI (Maoist) banner calling for (a) a boycott of the elections (b) dubbing the CPM social fascists and (c) building a peoples revolutionary alternative has been put up in the bazaar where Soren is filling up.        
	As Soren is talking, a police officer keeps calling on his cellphone, pleading with him, to call off his march. Soren says no, nothing doing.         
	In Sorens account, he told the police officer in the morning that people of Shaluka were participants of a social boycott of the police. If the officer were to lead a force, there could be mayhem.         
	The police officer told him they had information that there was violence in Shaluka and that at least six or seven people had been killed. Soren promised he will find out.         
	Soren found out that there was indeed violence and that not six or seven but villagers had killed one man and had burnt his body. I called up the police from Shaluka and informed the officer from there itself, he said. Then Soren and friends left.         
	Around 3pm, the group reached Chowkisal Bridge. A police party was waiting for them there. They were gheraoed, thrown off their motorcycles, boxed, beaten up with the butts of rifles, and detained for about an hour. For the secretary of an organisation that goes by the name Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities this was insult to injury.        
	The friends drove as fast as possible as soon as they were released to Boro Pelia Chowk, the venue for most meetings of the outfits leadership.         
	Chhatradhar Mahato, the committees chief, is away in Calcutta but Santosh Patra, the joint secretary, is here, listening to an account of a marital dispute and a suicide in another village. Soren and friends narrate their story.         
	Patra telephones Mahato and asks him to inform the press. Soren and Patra are back-room boys of the Lalgarh movement.         
	Minutes later, Soren is in Katapahari Chowk organising the protest march to the Ramgarh police outpost.         
	The police have got wind of it, possibly through tapped telephones and are urging Soren to call it off. Soren is unrelenting. The tribal committee has picked up another cause this evening.        
	Late at night, the police denied beating up Soren.

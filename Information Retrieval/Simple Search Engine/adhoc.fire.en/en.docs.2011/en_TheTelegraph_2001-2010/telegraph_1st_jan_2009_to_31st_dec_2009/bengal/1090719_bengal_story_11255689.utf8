The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Lalu MLA deserts Left 
                                                                                                               Lalu MLA deserts Left 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, July 18: A Left Front-backed MLA from central Calcutta today walked over to the Congress.         
	Mohammad Sohrab, who had won the 2006 election from Burrabazar as a candidate of Lalu Prasads Rashtriya Janata Dal, called on state Congress president Pranab Mukherjee at his south Calcutta home and declared he would be joining the Congress.         
	I would resign as an RJD MLA and join the Congress because it is a much bigger secular platform. I have no faith in the Left Front, which seems to have become isolated from the people. It is losing elections one after the other since the 2008 panchayat polls, Sohrab said.         
	Mukherjee was quoted as telling him: You are most welcome.        
	The RJD leader had defeated the Congresss Amitava Chakraborty by around 750 votes largely because of his Left backing. He is the lone Left-backed MLA in the House now.        
	Congress sources said Sohrab might be fielded from the Bowbazar seat where a bypoll is due on August 18.         
	Left Front chief whip Syed Mohammed Masih described Sohrabs decision as a most unfortunate political development. He is one of the 235 front legislators to have won in 2006. His desertion at this juncture is painful for us.         
	CPM state secretariat member Benoy Konar dubbed Sohrab an opportunist.         
	He won the elections with our support but is deserting us realising that the Left might lose Burrabazar in the next Assembly polls.        
	Sohrab is the first sitting MLA to have walked out on the front in 32 years of Left rule. A CPM leader admitted that several front partners were becoming restive following the ruling fronts successive poll drubbings.         
	Observers said Sohrabs move signalled the changing ground realities. Many minor front partners might go his way.        
	The Left has 230 MLAs in the House now, the Congress 17 and Trinamul 25.         
	Congress legislature party leader Manas Bhuniya ac-companied Sohrab to Mukherjees house. Bhuniya later suggested Sohrab might not immediately resign from the House.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Mike cloud on House
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Mike cloud on House
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 8: The Assembly will recommence on December 10 but Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim has warned that if the new sound system malfunctions again, he will adjourn the House like he had done last week.        
	There are still some problems with the system, but if it malfunctions while the House is on, I will have to adjourn it again, Hashim Abdul Halim said after an inspection today.        
	The Trinamul Congress stayed away from the inspection in which other political parties, PWD engineers and representatives of Bosch, the German company that installed the system, were present.         
	The Speaker had adjourned the House for 10 days on December 1 after many of its mikes stopped working because of what the PWD then described as a software virus.        
	The snag left Halim fum- ing and the government red-faced.         
	However, the snag appeared to be chasing the Speaker when the microphone he was using for todays media briefing on the Assemblys ground-floor Nauser Ali conference room stopped functioning. Halim was forced to speak without a mike.        
	I have nothing to say aga-inst Bosch. It is a renowned company. But as the Speaker, I should have been consulted (before the new system was installed). The sound system and the voting machines are functioning, but with certain hiccups, Halim said.        
	Bosch sources claimed that the system had worked fine in the Assembly for the past three days but that was not to say that the trial period was over.         
	It is not a matter of just 10 days. We believe more the trials you run the better. After all, a system needs time to stabilise, Dhiraj Wali, vice-president and business head of Bosch Security System, told The Telegraph.         
	Yesterday, Bosch officials met the PWD brass and informed them that a technical expert would be in the Assembly during the session.        
	If required, we are ready to train state officials in how to run the show, a Bosch official said.        
	After the system collapsed on December 1, the PWD secretary had owned up a part of the blame and said no trial had been run between the November 24 installation of the new system and the Speakers enquiry about its working five days later.         
	PWD minister Kshiti Goswami had announced an inquiry committee to look into the lapses that led to the snag and followed it up by suspending an executive engineer, an assistant engineer and one sub-assistant engineer.        
	Trinamul House leader Partha Chatterjee defended the decision to skip the all-party meeting. If the system is still not functioning properly, whats the point of the inspection? he asked.         
	The Congress, however, expressed satisfaction after inspecting the system.

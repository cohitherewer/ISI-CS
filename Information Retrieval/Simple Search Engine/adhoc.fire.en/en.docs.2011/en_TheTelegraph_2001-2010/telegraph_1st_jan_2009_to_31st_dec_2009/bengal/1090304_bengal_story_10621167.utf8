  - Morcha 12 head to Delhi

	Darjeeling, March 3: Bimal Gurung today summoned senior Gorkha Janmukti Morcha leaders to Delhi where he is currently camping for an emergency meeting to discuss the partys stand in the Lok Sabha elections.         
	Although the central leaders were tight-lipped, party insiders said there had been major developments in Delhi. The party has till now kept all its options open. However, things are developing very fast and some announcements may have to be made on March 5. A thorough discussion is needed before we take a stand, said a source.         
	A 12-member team with vice-president Pradeep Pradhan and general secretary Roshan Giri left for the capital this afternoon.         
	The general secretary refused to divulge much before his departure. We are going to Delhi because the party president has called us. This is all I can tell at the moment, said Giri. Gurung had personally written to BJP president Rajnath Singh on February 26, requesting him to promise Gorkhaland in the partys election manifesto.         
	The letter had been written following suggestions from L.K. Advani, BJPs prime ministerial candidate. The inclusion of the word Gorkhaland in the manifesto will be a major achievement by itself, but even then, certain issues have to be sorted out, said the source.         
	Sources said the Morcha was also trying to convince the national parties about the differences it could make in the Alipurduar seat in the Dooars.         
	It is certain that the Morcha cannot win the Alipurduar seat but the party can definitely be a factor for the Congress which has now joined hands with Trinamul. Even the BJP could make some inroads there with the Morcha support. This issue is also likely to figure in the Morchas internal meeting in Delhi, said the source.         
	Case shifted        
	Responding to a petition moved by GNLF Darjeeling branch committee president Dipak Gurung and his supporters, Calcutta High Court today shifted the Pramila Sharma murder case trial to the additional chief judicial magistrates court in Siliguri. Earlier, the case was being heard in the court of chief judicial magistrate, Darjeeling,        
	The GNLF supporters have been accused of murdering Pramila, a Morcha member.

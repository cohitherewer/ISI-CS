                                                                                                               Cop held for bus molest
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Jan. 21: Molested by a policeman in a crowded minibus, a homemaker sandal-whipped her tormentor who jumped off but was caught by other passengers in hot pursuit.        
	The woman, who said she was being harassed constantly, complained first and then hit Dharanidhar Pati.         
	He jumped off the bus in the Entally area around 9pm. But several passengers followed the 50-year-old and caught him a few yards away. The plainclothes policeman was dragged back to the woman and then to a traffic sergeant on duty in the area.         
	An officer of the Entally police station, where Pati is posted, said: We have received a written complaint and arrested constable Dharanidhar Pati.        
	He has been charged with assault with intent to outrage her modesty.        
	The woman, in her late 30s, had taken the Airport-Jadavpur mini from her home in the Phoolbagan area to go to her parents place near Puddapukur. Her 11-year-old daughter was with her.         
	I was sitting and the man was constantly pressing himself against me, she alleged.        
	I shouted at him and alerted the others around me. Then I took off my sandal and hit him once before he moved away and jumped out near Munsibazar (in the Entally area). I asked the driver to stop the bus and several passengers went after him.         
	The mother and daughter were supposed to join other relatives and attend a dinner invitation together.

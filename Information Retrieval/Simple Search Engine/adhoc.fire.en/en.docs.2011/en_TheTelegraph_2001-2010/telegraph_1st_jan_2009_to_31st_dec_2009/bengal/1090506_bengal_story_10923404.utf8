The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Trinamul Nandi assault
                                                                                                               Trinamul Nandi assault
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          A Canon 1D Mark 3 camera, the type of which was smashed                                  
	Tamluk, May 5: About 40 motorcycle-borne Trinamul Congress activists in Nandigram held a group of BJP leaders hostage for over an hour, thrashed a New York-based photographer and smashed his two cameras and lenses.         
	The BJP chief whip in the Rajya Sabha, S.S. Ahluwalia, was among those who had to be rescued by police from Sonachura this evening. He was there to campaign for Rajyashree Chowdhury, the party candidate from Tamluk.        
	Freelance photographer Jay Mandal, who contributes to The Telegraph, was taking pictures of the motorcyclists flying Trinamul flags when attacked.        
	Two youths walked towards the dais and jumped onto it. My flash gun alerted one of them. He came to me and gave me a big shove. I fell into a drain with my two cameras. Under the impact, one of them broke. The other was also badly damaged. I lost my glasses and without them, I am nearly blind, said Mandal.        
	Mandal said he was using a Canon 1D Mark 3 and a Canon 5D camera. The cameras along with their three lenses and flash guns cost Rs 16-17 lakh.        
	I dragged myself out of the drain and limped to the courtyard of a house, where I requested a lady to keep the other lenses I had. As I sat down beside a tulsi plant, the youth who had pushed me came and asked for the chips in the camera. I requested him not to take them. Then the beating started, said Mandal.        
	The youth pulled my hair and beat me up mercilessly. When I fell to the ground, he kicked me. I suffered severe bruises on my elbows, wrist, knee and thigh.         
	Mandal got back his damaged cameras and lenses but the youth took the chips away.        
	Ahluwalia said the Trinamul men on motorcycles were passing by when he was telling a gathering of some 400 people that Nandigram had hogged the headlines only because he had raised the March 14, 2007, killings in Parliament. I was midway through my speech when they tore off the canopy and broke the microphones, he said.        
	Nandigram Trinamul leader Abu Taher admitted the assault and defended it. Ahluwalias comments on Nandigram didnt go down well with our people.         
	The 10 policemen at the rally venue did not dare to intervene when the Trinamul gang arrived. In Trinamul fortress Sonachura, even the CPM dares not campaign.        
	Reinforcements had to be sent from the district headquarters to rescue the BJP team.

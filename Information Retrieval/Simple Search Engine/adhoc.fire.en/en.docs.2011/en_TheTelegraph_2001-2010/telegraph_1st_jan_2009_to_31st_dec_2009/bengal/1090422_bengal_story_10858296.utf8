	Domkol (Murshidabad), April 21: For several families thrown into disarray by bloodshed during polls, another round rekindles unhappy memories and the pent-up anger at hollow promises.        
	At least three families in Domkol, a pocket of Murshidabad where 11 people were killed during last years panchayat polls, have decided not to have anything to do with this election after being let down by the leaders.        
	After Sajem Ali Mondal, 36, was killed in a blast outside the polling booth at Panchananpur village, Congress leaders had promised compensation, his family says. A year on, the district leadership denies any such promise.        
	The chief of the Congress-controlled Domkol panchayat samiti, Rezaul Karim, admitted it, though. The district Congress leadership had indeed promised Rs 50,000 to the families of those killed on polling day but the money never arrived. We (the panchayat) spent some money on the treatment of those injured but the kin of the dead got nothing.        
	Sajem left behind two sons, the first to be hit by the familys misfortune.         
	Rajesh, 15, who was in Class VIII, and Rakesh, 13, then in Class VII, had to drop out of school to earn a living.        
	They are construction la- bourers in Calcutta now. Mother Rasheda anxiously waits for her sons every month.         
	Neither me nor my husband could study beyond the primary level. So, we had dreamt of educating our sons, said a teary-eyed Rasheda.        
	Congress leaders came to our house and promised help. But not only did I not get the money, no leader came to my house a second time. Ive told my sons not to come to the village around the time of the polls. Ill definitely not go to vote.        
	Domkol is part of the Murshidabad constituency, where sitting Congress MP Mannan Hossain and the CPMs Anisur Rahman are the main contenders.        
	Nazrul Islam of Ghoramara village had rushed out of home hearing blasts on May 18 last year. His mentally unstable child had just stepped out and Nazrul was worried. But shrapnel claimed the father.        
	Nazruls wife Marjia Bewa now has to care for her son Alib and daughter Khadeja, abandoned by her in-laws after being widowed. Congress leaders were all sympathy then. But we never heard from them again, Marjia said. We have over an acre, but have to dep- end on others to till it and get only a third of the yield.        
	The family of Sagar Ali, a CPM supporter killed in the panchayat polls, is in no better shape.         
	At Panchananpur, Sagars mother has to depend entirely on her other sons income. Her daughters  aged 18, 16 and 13  go to school but they may have to drop out any day. If Sagar and Kaosar were together, I wouldnt have had to worry, said Rokeya, a widow.        
	Anisur Rahman, the animal resource development minister, had visited her after Sagars death. He had promised financial help and said local leaders would regularly enquire about our needs. We should have known, said Rokeya.        
	Anisur said two young men, from among the five families that lost their earning members on May 18, had been given jobs in his department.         
	District magistrate Parwez Ahmed Siddiqui visited Domkol today. We went to the villages to build confidence among the voters before the polls.         
	Among the families he met was that of Sajem.

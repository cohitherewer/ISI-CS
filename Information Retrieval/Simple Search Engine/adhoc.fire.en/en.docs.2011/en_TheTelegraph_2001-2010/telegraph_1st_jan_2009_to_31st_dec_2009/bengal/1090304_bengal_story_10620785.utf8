	Siliguri, March 3: GNLF chief Subash Ghisingh today deposed in a Jalpaiguri court in the case related to an attempt on his life eight years ago.        
	Ghisingh was one of the key witnesses of the case in which former Gorkha Liberation Organisation (GLO) leader Chhatray Subba and 13 others were arrested. The GNLF leader was the penultimate of the 74 witnesses who had deposed in the case the trial of which had begun in 2003.        
	Around 1pm, Ghisingh, accompanied by son Mohan, who have been staying at a house in Jalpaiguri Collegepara for the past couple of days, reached the district and sessions court in a police convoy. Chhatray and other accused, who were brought from Jalpaiguri Central Jail, were at the lockup. The courtroom was packed with lawyers, onlookers, policemen and other visitors. Soon, Subhash Chandra Chattopadhyay, the judge, took his seat and ordered commencement of the proceedings.         
	Ghisingh took to the witness box and narrated the incident in Chilaunaydhura on Pankhabari Road on February 10, 2001. He also spoke of some threat letters allegedly sent to him by the GLO. When the lawyers asked him for proof like the letters or police complaint, he failed to provide any document.        
	Around 3pm, Ghisingh left the court. C.K. Pradhan, the investigating officer and the last witness of the case, then made his submission before the trial ended at 6.45pm.        
	Ghisingh could not provide any proof of Chhatrays involvement in the attack, said Akhil Biswas, a defence lawyer. He also could not furnish any evidence of the GLO threat letters. He, however, admitted that he had sought a CBI investigation of the case in 2005, saying that the real culprits of the attack have not been arrested.        
	Pradhan was also cross-examined by the defence counsels. Tomorrow, we will question him further. The court will then fix dates for hearing the argument, Biswas said.         
	In the evening, Ghisingh addressed a news conference in Collegepara. It is for the sake of peace that I have left the hills. Let those who are in the hills now do whatever they want to, he said. I feel this is an interval for me. My horoscope will decide when I will be back there. On the Lok Sabha polls, the GNLF chief said his party would announce its stand in the next few days.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Home hurdle after Patil pat 
                                                                                                               Home hurdle after Patil pat 
          AMIT UKIL                          The Telegraph report on Rekha meeting the President                                  
	Kotshila (Purulia), Aug. 27: She had got the Presidents pat in May for revolting against her family who wanted her to leave school and get married, but 12-year-old Rekha Kalindi has not had it easy since.         
	On May 14, Rekha, Afsana Khatun and Sunita Mahato  the three Purulia schoolgirls who had chosen to go to school in the face of family opposition  shook hands with Pratibha Patil, who had encouraging words for the them.         
	Three months on, Rekhas elder brother Dilip told her to stay at home and do household chores instead of going to school. Also the money the panchayat gave for her books and uniform got spent buying rice and dal for the family.        
	The main reason why I refused early marriage was because I wanted to continue my studies, unlike my elder sister who got married when she was 13, Rekha said, sitting at home in Bararola village, about 370km from Calcutta,         
	That (the sisters marriage) was about five years ago. Since then she has had four children. None survived, she added.        
	But the other day, my elder brother Dipak told me to finish all the household work first and then go to school. I had to do that and missed classes for two weeks, Rekha said.        
	Twenty-year-old Dipak has never been to school and is a farm labourer.         
	Gopal Kumar, the teacher-in charge of the National Child Labour Commission school that Rekha attends, noticed her absence. I sent a teacher to her house last week to find out what had happened. Rekha told the teacher that her brother was preventing her from attending school and asking her to do household chores.         
	Rekha recently called up the district assistant labour commissioner Prasenjit Kundu. Kundu spoke to her parents and brother. For the time being, they have agreed to let Rekha go to school again. But there is no surety that they will not change their minds again, Kundu said.        
	The panchayat gave the family Rs 5,000 two months back so that Rekha could buy books and get a uniform.         
	But the entire money was spent on buying provisions like rice and dal at home, said Rekha, who has a younger sister and two younger brothers.        
	Her father Karna, 49, has stopped rolling bidis for a living. Asked why the Rs 5,000 was spent on food, Karna said: We are poor and I am not keeping well. We needed the money to feed the family.         
	Neighbours said Karna stays at home most of the time. Earlier, he used to roll bidis for Rs 30 to Rs 40 a day, said neighbour Mathur Kalindi.        
	Rekha was given Rs 10,000 by the President, which is in a fixed deposit. The chief minister has promised her Rs 10,000 a year as long as she continues her education. That money is yet to come.

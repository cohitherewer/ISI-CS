The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Hooch blame game erupts
                                                                                                               Hooch blame game erupts
  - Toll goes up to 15, police and villagers trade charges        OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Tamluk, May 5: The families hit by the hooch tragedy in Tamluk today blamed police for not cracking down on illegal liquor dens and the cops cited peoples resistance to such drives to defend themselves.        
	The official toll climbed to 15 today. About 200 more have been hospitalised.         
	The police came every week and hovered near the liquor shops. But they never took any action despite our repeated complaints. We are sure the liquor shop owners bribed the police, said Aparna Bhakta, 23, whose father-in-law Madhab, 55, was among those taken ill at Ramtarakhat village.        
	Women armed with sticks and brooms raided three liquor shops at Ramtarakhat yesterday and set them ablaze.        
	Aparna, who was part of that mob, said the shops had been doing roaring business for over five years. It was be- cause of the bribes that the police remained inactive. We will never allow these shops to come up again. But the police might try to provide protection to them, she said.        
	Tamluk circle inspector Gopal Haldar said that whenever the police went to raid the liquor shops, a section of villagers prevented them. It is because of the peoples resistance that we were unable to demolish the shops.         
	Excise superintendent Saikat Chowdhury echoed Haldar. It is difficult to demolish an illicit liquor shop without the backing of local people.        
	No official has been to the 10 villages reeling under the tragedy to check on deaths that may have occurred at homes or in private clinics.         
	The district is going to the polls on Thursday. All officials are involved in the poll process. That is the reason behind the delay. Our team will visit the villages after Thursdays polling, said additional East Midnapore district magistrate Srikumar Chakraborty.        
	He confirmed 11 deaths at the district hospital here and four at SSKM in Calcutta.        
	Madan Bera, 55, and Gob- inda Malik, 45, died yesterday after a drink at a crematorium where they had taken a liquor victim for his last rites.        
	Owners of three shops at Balluk village, neighbouring Ramtarakhat, have been arrested. At least four shop owners are in hiding.         
	The government has asked excise department additional commissioner Ananda Ghosh to probe the incident and submit a report within a fortnight. The probe will cover who supplied the liquor to the shops and who were involved, said chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti.        
	Left Front chairman Biman Bose demanded strong action against the culprits. Finance minister Asim Dasgupta held a meeting and asked officials to renew the drive against illicit liquor across the state.        
	This is the third liquor tragedy this year. In January, 28 people had died at Garden Reach, Calcutta. The same month, six people were killed after consuming spurious liquor in South 24-Parganas Maheshtala. Dasgupta had then vowed to launch a crackdown and raids had been carried out.         
	Chowdhury, the excise officer in Tamluk, said: We are handicapped with only 40 men and four vehicles. It is difficult to conduct frequent raids.

	Purulia, June 22: Two railway employees checking the tracks off Bengals last station along the border with Jhar-khand in Purulia stumbled on explosives minutes after what they thought was a brush with robbers.        
	While the gangmen were being robbed of their mobile phones, they heard a noise that suggested someone was tinkering with the tracks a few metres away. So they went for a closer look after the robbers had fled and found a cylindrical object with red and green wires sticking out of the stones the tracks rest on.         
	Nardev Panti, 30, and Chandan Hazari, 35, ran to Biramdih station, some 500 metres away, and raised the alarm around 2am.        
	The improvised device couldnt be pulled out till late this evening because of fears that it could go off under the slightest pressure. A bomb squad from Calcutta finally triggered an explosion where it was.        
	Divisional railway manager A.K. Garekar said the device had about 7kg of explosives but they were loosely packed and the explosion that occurred could not do much damage to the line.         
	Train services, stalled through the day between Purulia  about 40km away  and Chandil in Jharkhand, resumed after 8.30pm.         
	Four express trains, including the Puri-New Delhi Puroshottam Express, had to be rerouted through Chandil and Muri  near Ranchi.        
	Hazari said: We thought it was a simple robbery. But we could hear some tinkering on the tracks ahead of us and see dim lights moving, which were possibly torches wrapped in a cloth or something. There were about five or six people.        
	Panti said two men with handguns asked them in Hindi who they were and searched them, possibly for arms. They took away our mobiles. After about 10 minutes, they let us go and disappeared, thinking we had not noticed the activity in front and had already finished checking that stretch of the tracks.         
	Garekar said such incidents were common in the Maoist-hit districts and called for a mobile bomb squad.

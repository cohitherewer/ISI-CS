	Contai, Jan. 23: Left-backed candidates have failed to win a single seat on the 138-member board of the biggest urban co-operative bank in the east.        
	A panel backed by the Trinamul-Congress combine bagged all the berths on the Contai Co-operative Banks board. The Left had 12 seats earlier.

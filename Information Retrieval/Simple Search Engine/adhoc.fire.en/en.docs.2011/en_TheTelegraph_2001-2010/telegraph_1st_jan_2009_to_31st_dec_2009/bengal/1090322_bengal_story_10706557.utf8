The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Narbula gets Cong hill ticket
                                                                                                               Narbula gets Cong hill ticket
          VIVEK CHHETRI                               
	Darjeeling, March 21: Congress MP Dawa Narbula was given the party ticket for the Darjeeling seat late tonight.        
	Narbulas candidature was no surprise, but he is yet to get the final word of support from the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha, which is not fighting the elections but whose writ runs in the hills.        
	Last time, Narbula had managed to get the support of all Opposition parties in the hills and also the Gorkha National Liberation Front.        
	But the space occupied by the GNLF has been taken over by the Morcha, which had shown an inclination to support the BJP because the party reportedly promised to include the Gorkhaland demand in its manifesto.         
	Morcha chief Bimal Gurung, however, said the final decision had not been taken.        
	Gurung will leave for Delhi with four of his central committee leaders tomorrow. He is expected to meet Congress leaders.         
	Since I have been given the party ticket we will try to get support from all quarters, Narbula said today.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Handful then, bagful now
                                                                                                               Handful then, bagful now
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Industrialists Sanjiv Goenka (top) and Prasoon Mukherjee at the meet                                
	Calcutta, Aug. 21: If morning showed the day, it had to be Mamatas. And how different the day was from earlier ones.        
	When she chose to meet industry representatives for the first time on September 2, 2006, only four from the city agreed.        
	The last time she met them was on August 19, 2008, at the height of the Singur movement that culminated in Tata Motors pulling out of Bengal, dealing a huge blow to the states image.        
	The attendance went up manifold as the Trinamul Congress had by then become a force to reckon with. But few had kind words to say about her.        
	Today was different.        
	Media managers of various industry houses and chambers of commerce began calling up to ensure that their bosses got featured in the upcoming interactive session with Mamata Banerjee, the railway minister and, many believe, the next chief minister of Bengal.        
	Some wanted their bosses quotes to be published while others wanted a share of the picture frame.        
	But would they ask difficult questions? I am not sure. Depends on her mood. You got to be careful, said one.        
	Mamata was in a good mood all through but uncomfortable questions were few even as the meeting turned out to be a roll call for city industrialists. When Mamata strode in, they scrambled to be seen with her.         
	I am amazed to see the change in peoples attitude towards her. I had arranged the earlier meetings with Mamata. I remember only three-four people had turned up in the first meeting, Partha Chatterjee, a Trinamul leader, said.        
	Those who could not reach Mamata thronged around him, seeking Chatterjees time, of which he has little, and ears, of which he has only two, to resolve various issues.        
	Once the meeting got over, industry leaders were only too happy to speak to reporters to praise Mamatas business acumen and her freshly minted responsible act.

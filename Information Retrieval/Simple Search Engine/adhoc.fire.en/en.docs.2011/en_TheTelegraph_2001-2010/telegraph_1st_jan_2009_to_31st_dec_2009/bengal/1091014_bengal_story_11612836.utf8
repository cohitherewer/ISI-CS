          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Durgapur, Oct. 13: A retired Durgapur Steel Plant general manager was shot dead minutes after he had returned home this evening from a Diwali shopping trip with his wife.        
	P.K. Mishra, 61, who lived in the upscale Andrews Place area of the town, barely 500 meters from the police lines, was watching TV in the living room when his wife Subhra heard a gunshot from the kitchen.         
	She found her husband sprawled on the sofa and bleeding profusely from the neck. The killer had fled by the time she reached him.        
	Subhra raised the alarm and neighbours came rushing. Mishra, who had retired this January as general manager, steel, of Durgapur Steel Plant, was declared dead at the plants hospital 15 minutes later.        
	The hospital said a single bullet had been fired at him from very close range. The bullet had entered through his neck and lodged itself in his chest.         
	Subhra said that after returning from the City Centre here around 6.30, Mishra said he wanted to relax over coffee. I was in the kitchen, making coffee, when I heard the shot, a sobbing Subhra said. I rushed into the living room but I didnt see anyone. Only my husband was lying on the sofa        
	Police said it was too early to comment on the possible motive behind the murder. Mishras wife couldnt tell us anything about the assailants, but we suspect there would have been at least two of them, said Pintu Mukherjee, the officer in charge of Durgapur police station.         
	They may have been waiting outside their bungalow before the couple returned from shopping.        
	The police are probing whether there was any personal enmity or if Mishra was involved in any dispute while working at the DSP.        
	Late tonight, a sniffer dog was taken to the bungalow, opposite Durgapur Club and next to the house of the plants managing director, but little headway was made.         
	Mishra, originally from Balarampur in Uttar Pradesh, had decided to stay on in Durgapur after retirement and had retained his official bungalow by taking it on rent. He had recently bought a plot near the Bengal Ambuja Housing complex about 4.5km away and was building his own two-storey home.        
	Before going shopping, Mishra had gone to oversee the construction of his house.        
	Their son Manish is a marine engineer, now in Dubai with wife. Daughter Priti Kataria lives in Chennai after marriage.         
	Mishra was a good classical singer and a popular man. He was also the president of Durgapur Fine Arts Club where our officers and their families are members, said Debasish Lahiri, president of the DSP Officers Association.

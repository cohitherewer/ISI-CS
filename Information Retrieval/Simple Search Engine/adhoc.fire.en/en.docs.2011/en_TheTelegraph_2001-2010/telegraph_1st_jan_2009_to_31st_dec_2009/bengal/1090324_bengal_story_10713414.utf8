	Kharagpur, March 23: IIT Kharagpur today announced a probe by a retired high court judge and promised better healthcare on the campus in a desperate attempt to pacify students who held fierce demonstrations yesterday holding the authorities responsible for Rohit Kumars death.         
	According to the students, the 21-year-old who suffered head injuries in a fall off a rickshaw, died after he was left untreated at the BC Roy Technology Hospital for over three hours.        
	We have set up a committee to find the exact cause of Rohits death. Once the committee submits its report... action will be taken against the people named, stand-in director Madhusudan Chakraborty said this evening.         
	The one-man committee will submit its report to the board of governors within a month of its appointment.         
	IIT Kharagpur chairman B. Muthuraman, the Tata Steel MD, is expected on the campus on Friday, said Chakraborty, who assumed charge after the institutes director quit owning moral responsibility for the death.        
	The acting director skirted most con- troversial issues  why there was no proper ambulance to take Rohit to hospital, why he was not accompanied by a doctor and why despite many pleas from the students, the IIT hospital was in tatters  saying he would speak only after the inquiry report came in.        
	However, he promised an overhaul of the facilities at the hospital on the campus. We will give land to private players they will build the hospital and run it.        
	The institute will also request the air force to extend help at the nearby Kalaikunda base during medical emergencies.         
	Rohits father R.P. Singh arrived here this morning and went straight to the Midnapore General Hospital to receive his sons body.         
	The campus was calm, but students  past and present  continued to slam the authorities inaction on the Net. Blogs and social networking sites saw students and the alumni venting their ire.         
	Plans for a Rs 98-crore multi-speciality medical research centre were suddenly abandoned after a foundation stone-laying ceremony in May 2007. The project should be revived, said Amal Kumar Ray, former head of the School of Medical Science and Technology, IIT Kharagpur.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          The fake notes seized at Bamungola. (Surajit Roy)                                  
	Malda, Jan. 1: A carrier of counterfeit notes was arrested from Bamungola area near the Bangladesh border today, prompting district police to think of new means to tackle the menace.        
	This is the first time that a fake note carrier was picked up from Bamungola.        
	Gopal Mondol, 25, was picked up while he was on his way to deliver the fake notes of 500 and 1,000 denomination to a person at Pakuahat. The police recovered fake notes with face value of Rs 48,300 from him, Banerjee said.         
	The accused is a resident of Goladanga village in Habibpur.        
	Till today, the smugglers had been sending carriers through Kaliachak and Baishnabnagar. They took shelters in villages there. With heightened vigil in those areas, they are changing their plans, said Satyajit Banerjee, the Malda district police chief.        
	The BSFs deputy-inspector-general of the Behrampore sector, Balbir Singh, also echoed the district police chiefs claim. Todays arrest indicated that the smugglers are changing their routes to push fake notes into India to avoid capture. We do not believe that the smuggling has been stopped completely, he said.

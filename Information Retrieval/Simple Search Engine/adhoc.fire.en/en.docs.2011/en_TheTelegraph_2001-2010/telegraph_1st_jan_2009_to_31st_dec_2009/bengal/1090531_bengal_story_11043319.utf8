The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Stench drives out patients
                                                                                                               Stench drives out patients
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, May 30: Several patients got themselves discharged from the Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital today unable to stand the foul smell coming from its morgue where decaying amputated limbs have been lying for at least three months.         
	Sujata Saha, from Minakhan in North 24-Parganas, was admitted in the gynaecology ward. Her brother-in-law Rajesh said: For the last three days, there was this foul smell. Today, the stench was unbearable. So we decided to take Sujata home.         
	Sujatas family signed a risk bond to get her released.        
	Sailen Kundu, who injured his hand and came to the surgical outdoor patients department for a dressing, also left.         
	I could not stand the horrible smell. My son who came with me was almost vomiting, he said. Kundu left without getting the dressing done.         
	Hospital employees also complained about the smell. We informed the medical superintendent about it. It was impossible to sit in the office, said Debdas Pal, an employee in the electrical department, situated opposite the morgue.         
	The Park Circus hospital blamed police, who had deposited the severed limbs, and the airconditioning system.         
	There are 15 amputated body parts which have been lying for three to four months, said S.K. Saha, the medical superintendent.         
	The AC in the morgue was out of order because of the cyclone which hastened the decomposition. We have told the police to take away the limbs by evening.

	Alipurduar (Jalpaiguri), Jan. 28: A wild bison today killed a cow, shoved a man, smashed tubewells and scared away an elephant brought by foresters to drive it away.        
	Some 12 hours after the marauder from Jaldapara sauntered into a forest village, it walked back, unhurried.        
	Just when we were wondering if we should tranquillise the animal, it walked back into the forest, said divisional forest officer Ujjwal Ghosh.         
	The densely populated Pradhan Para, 38km from here, was foggy in the morning. It was so hazy, we could hardly see a few steps ahead. So we were very scared of bumping into the bison, said Mridul Roy, a farmer.        
	Dilip Adhikary almost did that. It is not that I did not see the animal. It was 8.30 and the sun was up. But the animal came straight at me and the little brush that I had with its body was enough to knock me out. Before I realised what was happening, it disappeared from my courtyard, said the 43-year-old.        
	Tied to its post, Bairagi Sarkars cow was killed. The bison kicked the tubewells and they came off, said a villager.        
	In the afternoon, forest officials brought Jenny, their pet elephant. Chased away once, it did not want to return.         
	Some crowd management, however, did the trick. As foresters forced onlookers to vacate a corridor leading to the sanctuary and cordoned off the area, the animal found space to retreat. The bison saw the road was clear and ran towards the opening, the divisional forest officer said.

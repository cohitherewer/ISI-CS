The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Papa blames Infy tests
                                                                                                               Papa blames Infy tests
          OUR BUREAU                                          Abhijit Mukherjee      
	April 18: Ashish Mukherjee said his son fell victim to the extreme and unfair pressure of trainee assessment tests at Infosys but an IT executive felt Abhijits was a case of higher-secondary syndrome.        
	Abhijit hanged himself on the Mysore campus of Infosys last Tuesday. In his suicide note he wrote he did not feel competent enough for the training.        
	The boys father Ashish said: They (The IT companies) talk about keeping their word to the thousands they recruit. But they make sure the training is so tough that they can cut the number down to what they need.        
	Some former Infosys employees agreed the training there was the toughest in the industry  one compared it to spending time in a lions cage  but a senior executive associated with IT companies in Calcutta said: This is what I call the higher-secondary syndrome  boys succumbing to peer pressure and the fear of failure. So many others were facing the same pressure, he said. Abhijit was only 22. His whole life was ahead of him. Had he failed, it would not have been the end of the world.        
	The assessment tests would have to be tough to see who was cut out for the job, the executive said. In these meltdown times companies cant afford a large bench strength.        
	Howrahs Abhijit, who joined Infosys in February, was struggling to cope with the volley of performance assessment tests or PAT, as a woman IT employee called them.         
	The woman executive in Calcutta said she too went through the gruelling PAT, a routine matter in IT companies. Many who trained with her did not clear the tests. But almost everyone got jobs somewhere. The PAT may not always be on your back, but it isnt the last exam one takes.        
	Asked about Abhijits case, Dr Tapashi Mitra, a psychiatrist, said: How one copes with a situation depends on the person. It appears he (Abhijit) was not confident of maintaining his status as a good student and must have felt he would have lost face if he was unable to complete the training.        
	Psychologist Nilanjana Sanyal said: When a person commits suicide because of pressure, a lot of it depends on his personality, not just environmental factors.

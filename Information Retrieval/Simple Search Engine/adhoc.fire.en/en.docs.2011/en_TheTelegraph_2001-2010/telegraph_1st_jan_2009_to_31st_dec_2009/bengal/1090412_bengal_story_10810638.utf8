The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Shop target of poll extortion
                                                                                                               Shop target of poll extortion
          A STAFF REPORTER                           The vandalised cellphone shop in Gariahat. (Sanat Kumar Sinha)                                  
	Calcutta, April 11: A cellphone shop near Gariahat was ransacked today by a gang allegedly led by a Trinamul Congress man, apparently because its manager had refused to donate Rs 50,000 to the party poll fund.        
	Abhishek Pal, manager of the shop on Purna Das Road, said that around 9.30am, a civic employee who oversees garbage clearance asked him why he had dumped waste on the road after it had been cleaned by corporation staff.        
	Pal said: I told him the shops cleaner had not come and I would get it cleared by tomorrow. But he started arguing with me. I told him if he was so keen, he could impose a fine.... He picked up some of the garbage, scattered it around my shop and asked me to go to the local Trinamul office. I didnt.        
	He said that around 10, some seven or eight youths arrived, led by former Trinamul councillor Durga Mukherjee, and began throwing about the chairs and umbrellas kept outside the shop. They also broke the shops glass door.        
	Mukherjee came in a car and, before leaving, warned me not to open the shop for a month. Obviously, this was because I had not responded to their demand a few days ago to pay Rs 50,000 to the party election fund, Pal said.        
	Mukherjee was not available for comment. Trinamul leader Sovandeb Chattopadhyay said: The place was cleaned early morning. Later, when the conservancy overseer found the spot littered, he asked the shop owner to clean it up. But the owner tried to beat him up.        
	Pal has lodged an FIR at Gariahat police station.

                                                                                                               Cheap potato in govt stalls
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, July 9: The state government today said it would start selling potatoes at Rs 13 a kg from 11 outlets in Calcutta and one in Salt Lake from Saturday to check the rising price of the vegetable.        
	Potatoes that sold for Rs 10 a kg in January are now selling at Rs 18.         
	The step to open counters in the 12 markets would be followed up in the districts.        
	Finance minister Asim Dasgupta today met food and civil minister Paresh Adhikary, agriculture minister Mortaza Hossain and chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti before taking the decision. We will buy potato from cold storage facilities at Rs 12.50 a kg and sell from 12 outlets in the city and Salt Lake at Rs 13 from Saturday, Dasgupta said.        
	The counters will be opened by the agricultural marketing and co-operation department in Ultadanga, Shyambazar, Manicktala, Garia, Phoolbagan, Salt Lakes BC Market, Sealdah, Tollygunge, Bhowanipore, Gariahat and near Lake Market.         
	Dasgupta said the districts had also been asked to open counters.         
	Hossain said his department would co-ordinate with the food department to open the outlets. We held a meeting with cold storage owners yesterday and they agreed to sell potato to us at Rs 12.50 a kg. We believe that once we start selling potato at Rs 13, prices in other markets will also come down, Hossain said.        
	Agriculture department officials said blight had destroyed almost half the crop in Burdwan, Hooghly and other potato growing districts.

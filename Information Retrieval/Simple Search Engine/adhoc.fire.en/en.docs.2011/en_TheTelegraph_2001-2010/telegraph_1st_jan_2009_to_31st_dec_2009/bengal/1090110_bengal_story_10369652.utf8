The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Lesson for teachers on sparing stick
                                                                                                               Lesson for teachers on sparing stick
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Jan. 9: The West Bengal Board of Secondary Education today released a manual that tells schoolteachers to spare the rod and be patient with hyperactive children.        
	The board is worried that teachers are increasingly resorting to corporal punishment and the governments ban is going unheeded.         
	In November, an eight-year-old girl in a school in Mominpur went into coma and died after her yoga teacher allegedly slapped her so hard that her head hit a wall.         
	The teacher was sacked when she did not surrender before police. The boards code of conduct for teachers has provisions for suspension and dismissal if they use the stick.        
	The 85-page manual, handed to headmasters of all affiliated schools, encourages teachers to involve children in group activities like gardening and identify areas of interest in each child.         
	It suggests that a hyperactive a child should not be forced to stay seated at one place against his will  a task many teachers may find difficult in a classroom.         
	Teachers must realise that they cannot vent their anger on students. We need to train the teachers on how to deal with children, Partha Dey, the school education minister, told headmasters today.

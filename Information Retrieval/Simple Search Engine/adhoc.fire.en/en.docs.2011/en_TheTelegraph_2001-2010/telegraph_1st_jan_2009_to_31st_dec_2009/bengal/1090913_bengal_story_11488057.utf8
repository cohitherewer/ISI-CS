The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Monkey trouble in zoo
                                                                                                               Monkey trouble in zoo
                            
	Calcutta, Sept. 12: A langur entered Alipore zoo this afternoon, headed for a cage housing another simian, climbed the grilles, tried to grab its food, scared away visitors, and ensured more monkey business even before the dust had settled over the lost-and-found marmosets.        
	Weekend visitors ran for shelter presuming the langur had broken free from one of the cages. The Assamese monkey in the cage, which was blissfully enjoying a lunch of fruits and vegetables, started jumping in panic. The zoo authorities went into a tizzy. The langur went over a fencing and climbed up the iron bars of the cage. Scared, the monkey inside started jumping, said a zoo employee.         
	The intruder leapt from one cage to another and went towards the one housing the marmosets, rescued from thieves recently and reinstated in their old cage yesterday. Zoo director Raju Das said: Monkeys keep entering the zoo in search of food. The langur left the zoo premises without causing any harm.

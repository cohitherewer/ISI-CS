The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Govt suffers custody snub
                                                                                                               Govt suffers custody snub
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Jhargram, Oct. 7: A West Midnapore court today turned down a government plea for 18 days police custody for Chhatradhar Mahato and granted only three days.        
	Explaining the reason, the additional chief judicial magistrate in charge in Jhargram, Bishal Mangrati, said: I am not convinced that the provisions of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) are applicable to the accused person. The Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities is not a banned organisation under this act.        
	Public prosecutor Suman Das Mahapatra said the government would move the high court to challenge the order. We will move the high court against the order because we believe we should have got 18-day police custody, he said.        
	Mahapatra had sought 18 days custody as the act allows police custody up to 90 days. Mahato has already been in 12 days of police custody. Under the IPC, the police can seek at most 14 days custody.        
	Mahatos lawyer Kaushik Sinha had argued that the stringent act could not be applied to him as the peoples committee that he heads was not a banned organisation.         
	There is nothing on record saying that my client is a Maoist activist. The police are repeatedly harping on his Maoist links and seeking his remand. But he has been described by the police as a leader of the peoples committee that has Maoist links. So, if the committee is not a banned organisation, then why should my client be charged under the UAPA? he asked.        
	Mahatos lawyer also said according to rules, if the government wanted to implement the UAPA, it has to issue a gazette notification and it has to be published in newspapers. But the government has done nothing of the sort. Then how is the government using the UAPA? he asked.        
	Home secretary Ardhendu Sen responded to the order later in the day. I have heard that Mahatos advocate had said a pre-condition for charging somebody under the UAPA is a gazette notification and its subsequent publication in newspapers. We examined the matter and found that such notification or publication is not required. It is a central act and automatically applies in the state. We will have to explain our stand in court and to the judge about the committees connection with the Maoists.        
	Three others  Shagun Murmu, Ranjit Murmu and Sambhu Soren  who were also arrested on September 26, the day Mahato was picked up, were also produced in the Jhargram court and remanded in jail custody for two weeks.        
	In Calcutta, Swapan Dasgupta, the publisher of Maoist periodical Peoples March, and Sadananda Singha, one of the five directors of the press that printed it, arrested last night, were produced in court today and sent to police custody till October 20.

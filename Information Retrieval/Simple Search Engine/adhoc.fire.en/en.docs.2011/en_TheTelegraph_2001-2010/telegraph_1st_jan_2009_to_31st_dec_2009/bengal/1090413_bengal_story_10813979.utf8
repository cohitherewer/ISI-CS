The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Village square out of rally bounds
                                                                                                               Village square out of rally bounds
          SOUMI BHATTACHARYA                          Shibtala, the village square, where rallies are barred. (Balaram Dutta)                                  
	Birbhum, April 12: A Birbhum hamlet has made it clear that politicians must keep their meetings and mikes off the village square. If they dont, they will get stoned.        
	For eight years  barring one attempt by the CPM  the parties have been forced to follow the common mans diktat in Karkaria, a village 285km from Calcutta.        
	The first party to taste the villagers ire was the Trinamul Congress. In 2001, the party had organised a meeting in the village square  residents call the area Shibtala  for its candidate Ashis Banerjee.         
	Giridhari Sen, a 61-year-old farmer who was at Shibtala when the meeting started, said: Suddenly stones and bricks started flying from all directions towards the square. The leaders ducked and fled.        
	That villagers hurl stones from behind trees and bushes is common knowledge but not one resident will name those involved. They are scared of reprisals, though they are not against any political party.        
	What they are against is the cacophony that fills the village square during the political meetings  the blaring sound boxes, the gathering rallyists and the obstruction of traffic around Shibtala.         
	Many villagers are elderly people and feel uncomfortable when political parties hold meetings using loudspeakers. The only open space in the village is in the middle, Shibtala, and a rally there disturbs us all. If a meeting is held, children, too, cannot study, said Netai Dey, a 51-year-old farm labourer.        
	Debashis Mondal, another resident, said: If a meeting is held at Shibtala, all roads get blocked and we have to make a detour to leave the village.        
	After the missiles at its meeting, Trinamul got the message from the 3,500-odd Karkaria residents.        
	The CPM, however, thought of taking a chance last year during the panchayat elections. The party organised a meeting at Shibtala where its leader and this years Lok Sabha candidate, Braja Mukherjee, was to speak. Bricks and stones rained again.         
	The CPM then moved to a field outside the village, which has now become the venue for all such gatherings.        
	Asked if they knew the villagers who throw stones, Narayan Chandra Mondal said no one would identify them. We will not give you their names. We also dont say anything openly against political parties. Who would want to open his mouth against any political party? Some of the villagers belong to the Trinamul Congress and some to the CPM, Narayan said.         
	He clarified, though, that the majority of villagers were happy that the parties had realised they were not welcome at the square.         
	A Trinamul member of the local Sahapur gram panchayat, Bhuban Chandra Mondal, said: We cant hold meet- ings at Shibtala because the villagers throw stones at us. We dont know who throws the stones. We have shifted to the Haatpara field, said Mondal.        
	Rampurhat CPM zonal committee secretary Sanjib Barman also said his party was holding campaign meetings at Haatpara, not Shibtala.

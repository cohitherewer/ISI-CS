	Imphal, June 12: Four men from South 24-Parganas were made to sit in a row and shot dead by two gunmen on a university campus on the outskirts of Imphal town where they had been engaged as construction workers.        
	Abul Hussain, one of the targets who managed to flee, said the duo called six of them out of their hut in Central Agricultural University around 8.30pm last night. The six were taken to a football ground, lined up and shot from behind.        
	Gouranga Mondal, 27, Dilip Mondal, 25, and Subodh Midda, 26, died on the spot. Jagannath Mondal, 39, died in hospital this morning. Hussain and Palash Chanda survived.         
	A bullet grazed Chandas neck and he feigned death to save his life.        
	Hussain said he was on the extreme left when made to sit on the playground. When they started shooting from the right, he fled under the cover of darkness.         
	He is now at a relief camp. The police brought all the 45 migrant workers employed at the university there today.         
	During the attack, one of the eight huts housing migrant labourers was targeted.         
	The contractor, Binod Mondal, who had brought Hussain and his mates from South 24-Parganas Patharpratima, is also from Bengal.        
	Over 20 migrant labourers have been killed in Manipur since February. The camp Hussain has been put up in also houses other migrants.        
	Bengal home secretary Ardhendu Sen said: A team will be sent to Manipur to bring the bodies. The district administration is trying to contact the victims families.

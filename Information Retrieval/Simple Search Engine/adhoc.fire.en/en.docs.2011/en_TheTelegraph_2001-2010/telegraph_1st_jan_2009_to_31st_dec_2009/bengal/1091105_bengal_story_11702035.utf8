	Santiniketan, Nov. 4: Classes will resume in Santiniketan tomorrow as striking Visva-Bharati teachers and employees have called off their agitation.         
	The move followed the Prime Ministers promise of an impartial inquiry into allegations of corruption against vice-chancellor Rajat Kanta Ray. The employees had started the strike 11 days ago seeking a CBI probe.         
	Some of the students who had initially supported the strike had demanded resumption of classes two days ago.

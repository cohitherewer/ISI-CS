The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Power threat to Dunlop
                                                                                                               Power threat to Dunlop
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Oct. 15: Dunlop chairman Pawan Kumar Ruia today said he may have to stop paying employees at his Sahagunj factory as the company had not got steady power supply to resume production.        
	I cant go on paying employees without starting the plant, he said.        
	Ruia said his company had given a letter of credit of Rs 53.77 lakh on September 19 to the government for power supply. He said he would wait till October 19 to see if supply is restored. Dunlop has to clear power arrears of around Rs 13 crore in nine years.         
	But Ruia today said the West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company Limited had been adding new clauses to the letter of credit. I am trying to accommodate what it is asking.... If it takes time, we will have to declare a lockout till we get power or set up our own power plant, he said.        
	The factory has been shut for nearly six months.        
	Officials at WBSEDCL said Dunlop had been asked to submit the letter of credit according to norms of the State Electricity Regulatory Commission (SERC). As per SERC norms, the letter of credit should be confirmed, revolving, irrevocable and non-recourse. In short, it must be unconditional. But Dunlop has not submitted it following the norms, an official said.

          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	New Delhi, March 31: The Supreme Court today said it would hear the Nandigram firing case on April 24.         
	It is expected to hear two contentions  whether a stay on prosecution of policemen found guilty of firing on protesters should continue and whether compensation should be paid to all those killed and injured in the incident.         
	The apex court had earlier refused to stay a high court order on paying compensation to the kin of the dead and those injured in the March 14, 2007, firing but restrained the CBI from prosecuting the errant cops. The state has been urging the court to leave out those who had attacked police from the compensation package.

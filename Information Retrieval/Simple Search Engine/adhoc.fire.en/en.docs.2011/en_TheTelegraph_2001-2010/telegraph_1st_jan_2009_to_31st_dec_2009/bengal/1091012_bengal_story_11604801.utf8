The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Arrest CM, cries Mamata 
                                                                                                               Arrest CM, cries Mamata 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 11: Trinamul activists will demonstrate in front of offices of district magistrates and police stations across the state the next two days demanding the arrest of the killer chief minister, Mamata Banerjee said today after alleged CPM cadres shot at three of her supporters in Arambagh.         
	I could have called a three-day bandh... but I am opposed to bandhs as they inconvenience people. However, the situation is so alarming in Arambagh and Khanakul that it warrants state-wide protest, she told a news conference at her Calcutta home.         
	Mamata will visit Arambagh in Hooghly on Tuesday. Her general secretary Mukul Roy will address a rally of the partys youth wing in Khanakul tomorrow.        
	I cannot sit idle when innocents are being attacked with firearms by CPM cadres and the police at the instance of the chief minister.... This killer chief minister should be put behind bars imme- diately and the CPM-led government sacked.         
	Mamata said she wanted central forces to be deployed in Arambagh and in other parts of Bengal where the CPM has begun a turf war after losing its grip on the people because of their rout in almost every election since last year.         
	She said Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee was the main culprit behind the violence.         
	Trinamul sources said Mamatas ire was directed at the Centre for entertaining the chief minister in the capital.         
	Bhattacharjee is in Delhi to attend a CPM politburo meeting and met home minister P. Chidambaram. A Trinamul general secretary said: Mamata timed the news conference after 4pm to send a message to Chidambaramji and the Centre that she was unhappy with the way they were falling into the chief ministers trap.        
	While we are fighting the CPM tooth and nail here, the Centre is holding talks with him in the capital. She cant bear this, said a party leader, on condition of anonymity.

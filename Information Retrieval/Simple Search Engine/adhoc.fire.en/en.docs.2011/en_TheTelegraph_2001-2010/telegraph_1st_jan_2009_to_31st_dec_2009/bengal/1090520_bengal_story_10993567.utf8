The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | IIT boss back in office
                                                                                                               IIT boss back in office
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                              
	New Delhi, May 19: Damodar Acharya has rejoined as IIT Kharagpur director after the institutes board of governors absolved him of any responsibility in the death of a student because of alleged medical negligence in March.         
	In an explanation to the Centre, the institute has instead accused elements from outside the campus and sections of the faculty of stoking student sentiments after the death of third-year electrical engineering student Rohit Kumar.         
	Acharya had been forced to quit after students mobbed him at his campus residence following the death on March 22, accusing the director of ignoring repeated complaints over lack of medical facilities.         
	Rohit died after the hospital on the campus failed to treat him for head injuries he suffered after falling off a rickshaw.         
	At a meeting in Kharagpur yesterday, the IIT board authorised Acharya to return as director. By afternoon, he was in office.         
	His return comes even be- fore an inquiry panel set up to investigate the allegations of medical negligence has submitted its findings.         
	Board chairman B. Muthuraman had promised a judicial inquiry under retired Supreme Court judge U.C. Banerjee.         
	Banerjee refused to take up the inquiry after students questioned his impartiality because he was a frequent guest lecturer in the institutes law school and suggested that a team of medical experts be appointed instead. That panel is yet to submit its report.

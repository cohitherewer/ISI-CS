The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Parties agree on need for industry
                                                                                                               Parties agree on need for industry

	Calcutta, July 11: The ruling Left Front, Trinamul Congress and the Congress agreed today that industry was the way forward for Bengal in a rare show of solidarity.         
	At a panel discussion titled American Investor Interest: Positioning West Bengal, organised by the American Chamber of Commerce India, Calcutta chapter, and The Telegraph, representatives of the three political parties agreed to put aside disagreements when it came to industrialisation in the state.        
	We should not let political differences interfere with the process of industrialisation in West Bengal. The parties should meet once in a while to chalk out the way forward together, said Mausam Benazir Noor, the Congress Lok Sabha MP from Malda North, who was one of the panelists.        
	Trinamul general secretary Partha Chatterjee and former CPM MP Shamik Lahiri agreed that though there is a debate on which is the best path to industrialisation, there was no doubt that industry is important for Bengals development.        
	This, however, was the only silver lining in a discussion that was clouded by Bengals shortcomings in providing an investor-friendly atmosphere.         
	The discussion was moderated by journalist Vir Sanghvi.         
	Ronen Sen, a former Indian ambassador to the US who delivered the keynote address, pointed out that the overall perception of Bengal is that it is not investor-friendly.        
	Foreign investors look at experiences of Indian companies and if Indian companies are walking out of a state then it does not reflect well on the state, Sen said.        
	Panelists said Bengals potential because of its geographical location, human resources and ready market  arguments put forward by IT minister Debesh Das and Lahiri in the states favour  would not be realised as long as the mindset of the people remained unchanged.        
	Potential energy does not get converted into kinetic energy on its own. There is transformation waiting in the east but the question is whether Bihar is going to lead that change and West Bengal is going to be the last, said Bibek Debroy, economist and professor, Centre for Policy Research.        
	Three corporate panelists  Tejpreet Singh Chopra, CEO and president of GE India and chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce, Gautham Mukkavilli, director of PepsiCo India Holding and president PepsiCo International, India region, and Michael Boneham, president and managing director of Ford India  enumerated steps Bengal should take to woo investors.         
	Boneham said what Bengal should do is compare itself with other states and move up from being the worst city in the world to do business in to being a leader in some aspects.        
	States dont have to be top in every benchmark. They have to show that they are among the leaders in most of them, Boneham said.         
	US consul general Beth A. Payne said Bengal needs to market the fact that it appreciates private enterprise as a driver of growth.

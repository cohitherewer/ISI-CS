The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Border seal plea on Buddha lips
                                                                                                               Border seal plea on Buddha lips
          BISWAJIT ROY                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 9: The Centre must ensure the sealing of the Jharkhand-Bengal border during the proposed operation against Maoists in the two states simultaneously, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is expected to tell the Union home minister when they meet in Delhi on Sunday.         
	The state government has sought extra forces to scale up operations to flush out Maoists in the jungle mahal simultaneously with the forthcoming anti-Maoist operation in Jharkhand. It will be a pincer attack on the banned CPI (Maoist). We now want the Centre to ensure that the Maoist bases in Jharkhand are destroyed and the states borders are sealed so that they cant sneak into Bengal, a CPM secretariat member said after chief minister Bhattacharjees briefing.        
	Bhattacharjee is scheduled to meet Manmohan Singh on Monday. The anti-Maoist operation is expected to feature in their talks too.        
	The chief minister will leave for Delhi tomorrow night to attend a CPM politburo meeting on Sunday. He is expected to meet P. Chidambaram before the politburo meets, party sources said.        
	Bhattacharjee today reportedly said that his government was happy with the Centres support to the joint security operations despite UPA ally Mamata Banerjees opposition to it.         
	Some secretariat members said Bhattacharjee told them that the home ministry had approved the deployment of additional CRPF and BSF companies that the state had sought as well as extended the deadline for central forces presence in Lalgarh and adjoining areas till December.        
	Bhattacharjee told them that the Centre had hinted it would go all out after the Maoists in Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh after the Assembly elections this month.         
	But the party would not offer loud support on army involvement knowing it would not be politically correct when the CPI and other allies had opposed it. But after the Gadchiroli massacre of policemen by Maoists yesterday, the Centre is expected to toughen its resolve, a member said.         
	On the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, Bhattacharjee, who has faced opposition from the Left partners, said he would report to the Centre and the politburo on this. We will have to explain to the people that there has been no indiscriminate use of the act, he was quoted as saying.         
	Benoy Konar, in a jab to the partners, said: Let our allies tell us how many more murders of comrades would help them to support the act.

	Calcutta, Jan. 12: The government will start departmental proceedings against two police officers accused of torturing tribal women in Lalgarh after a blast in November.         
	A team led by Lalgarh inspector-in-charge Sandip Sinha Roy and officer Sushanta Rajbanshi had raided Chhotopelia village on November 6. An official said they would be suspended and could even be dismissed.         
	Admitting excesses, the government announced damages ranging from Rs 15,000 to Rs 50,000 for the women injured during the raids.

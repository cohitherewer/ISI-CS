	Nov. 16: A businessman whom a bank had let go after a bid to swindle it two months ago was among two men arrested today for allegedly butchering four of its employees after a failed heist on Thursday.        
	Tapas Ghosal, 35, a wholesaler of moulded furniture with a fancy lifestyle, was picked up along with Azad Sheikh, 30, from a hotel in Asansol, about 250km from crime scene Karimpur, in Nadia.        
	Police said none of them had a criminal past.        
	About Rs 1 lakh, mostly in denominations of Rs 10, were found on the duo.         
	United Bank of India could not say if the money was stolen from its branch because the police have sealed it. However, an official said notes of smaller denominations were usually not kept in the vault that the robbers had failed to open.        
	Nadia police chief Champak Bhattacharya said: Seven or eight people were involved in the murders.        
	The only survivor of the massacre, a deputy manager, had told his colleagues on the way to hospital about a known face seeing whom officials had opened the bank door past 10pm. The murders were committed after the robbers failed to unlock the vault, whose se-cond key was with a cashier who had gone home.         
	About two months ago, a bank official said, Ghosal had tried to cheat the bank by depositing Rs 60,000 and claiming he had put in Rs 6.6 lakh.        
	He gave Rs 60,000 in cash, but wrote Rs 6.6 lakh on the receipts counterfoil . After the man at the counter stamped the banks copy, Ghosal took it back feigning he had forgotten to write something and fudged it to look like he had deposited Rs 6.6 lakh. We called the police and he broke down and apologised. Being a known customer, we pardoned him, said the official who did not want to be named.        
	The police confirmed the banks reluctance.        
	A bank official also said Ghosal had borrowed Rs 4 la kh a year ago and had applied for an upgrade of the loan.         
	Ghosals father Mangal, who stays on the ground floor of their two-storey house, said his sons business had been floundering. He is a spendthrift and changes his motorcycles every now and then. For a Rs-5 shave, he would pay the barber Rs 45 as tips.        
	Ghosal has a two-year-old daughter. The police said Azad worked in a laundry owned by his sister in Karimpur town.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Burdwan action challenge for Buddha
                                                                                                               Burdwan action challenge for Buddha
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee                                  
	Calcutta, July 16: The events at Mangalkot have caught Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee once again between compulsions of governance and the CPMs organisational policy.        
	This time though, he faces a more complicated challenge. He has to take on the partys most influential district unit if he proceeds against those guilty of the attack on the Congress MLAs.        
	Party sources indicate that the chief minister does want to take action  he is believed to have promised Pranab Mukherjee that he will.        
	But the sources also wonder if he would be allowed to get his way, especially because any action he takes might rattle the influential Burdwan unit and its most powerful face, commerce and industries minister and politburo member Nirupam Sen.        
	Bhattacharjee, however, has a powerful ally this time in state party secretary Biman Bose.        
	The internal struggle of the CPM over Mangalkot shows in the three leaders responses in the past 24 hours.        
	Bose was the only one to have reacted to the events yesterday. He condemned the incident and promised to take action against any party activist found to have been involved. His target obviously was the Burdwan unit in general and Sen in particular.        
	Relations between Sen and Bose soured in recent months, particularly since the CPMs withdrawal of support to the UPA government. Sen, who is believed to be a Prakash Karat acolyte, had his personal relations with Bhattacharjee also strained over this issue.        
	By contrast, neither the chief minister nor Sen reacted yesterday. It was, however, learnt today that all three had discussed the statement that Bose issued to the media yesterday. But Sen was said to be unhappy over it, particularly about Boses veiled criticism of the Burdwan group.        
	A different note was introduced to the party drama today in the Assembly.        
	Both the chief minister and Sen condemned the incident  a shift in Sens case since he reportedly refused to publicly condemn the incident yesterday. He also made himself unavailable to the media yesterday.        
	The Burdwan groups different response to the incident was evident in the line that the district unit secretary Amal Haldar has taken. He maintained that it was an outburst of popular anger against the killing of CPM district committee member Falguni Mukherjee by Congress-Trinamul goons a few weeks ago.        
	Haldar alleged today that some of the four accused in the murder named in the FIR had accompanied the Congress MLA team. Congress leader Manas Bhuniya denies this.        
	The tussle within the party showed also in a report on Mangalkot in the party organ Ganashakti. While it carried Boses statement condemning the incident, it also sought to justify the violence describing as an expression of popular anger against the slain leaders murder.        
	Falguni Mukherjee, the slain CPM leader, hailed from the village  Dhanyarukhi  where the incident took place yesterday.        
	The condemnations in the Assembly  by the chief minister, Sen and the Speaker  were predictable after Bose yesterday laid out the party differences.        
	The chief ministers defence of Sen on the Congresss allegation against the latter were also routine. The differences in the party also reflect tensions and contradictory views over how to fight back the mounting Opposition challenge.        
	At a party programme in Calcutta two days ago, Sen had warned the cadres against resorting to counter-violence but the pressure from the grassroots and the leaders desperation to keep the cadres morale from hitting rock bottom seemed to be pulling the party in different directions.        
	Bhattacharjee finds himself caught in the party politics yet again. He has given in to pressure from the party on other issues, particularly on education. Mangalkot adds another dimension to it  of managing equations between different party leaders.

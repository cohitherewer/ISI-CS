The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Buddha door ajar for handshake with Cong
                                                                                                               Buddha door ajar for handshake with Cong
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at the Calcutta Press Club on Monday. (Aranya Sen)                                  
	Calcutta, May 11: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee left the option of supporting the Congress after the elections open on the closing day of the campaign, unlike his party chief who has ruled out such a possibility.         
	What Prakash (Karat) said was the partys pre-poll position. We will take the final decision after the polls. Its too early to comment who will form the government. Let the elections be over and the results come out. We cant foresee what will happen, Bhattacharjee told a programme at Calcutta Press Club this afternoon.         
	We dont believe in unto-uchability, the Bengal chief minister said with a twinkle in his eyes when asked whether he considered the Congress untouchable.         
	Bhattacharjees comments were in contrast to party general secretary Karats repeated refusal to support the Congress or a coalition led by it. Karat has demanded Congress support for a Left-led front in return for its 2004 backing.        
	While this may be construed as an indication of differences between Karat and the partys Bengal unit, Bhattachar- jee denied it. Instead, he offered a reading into the CPMs tactical line.         
	Dont misunderstand our general secretary. We are following the same tactical line. At the moment, we are sincerely trying to defeat both the BJP and the Congress and form an alternative government. At this juncture, that is our objective. We cant send a wrong message to other parties who are with us that we would join hands with the Congress, he explained.         
	But it was evident that Nitish Kumars hug to Narendra Modi at the NDAs show of strength had upset him and his comrades, who had been hoping to win over the Bihar chief minister after poaching on the BJP camp and getting the support of his Orissa counterpart. I wasnt in touch with him (Nitish). My colleague Sitaram Yechury had spoken to Nitish. We are not running after any party or leader but focusing on policy-based unity to form an alternative government, he said.        
	Unlike Karat, Bhattacharjee would not say that the Left would prefer sitting in the Opposition in Parliament rather than extend a hand to the Congress if the third front failed to muster the numbers.         
	It is in tune with his and the Bengal party units worries about the political cost of facing a hostile central government and a Congress-Trinamul combine in the Assembly elections in 2011.         
	Bhattacharjee insisted that the media had misunderstood Karat on this issue, too. I dont think Prakash meant it (that the Left would rather sit in the Opposition than help the Congress), he said.         
	Bhattacharjee stopped short of echoing Jyoti Basu, who had said the party had comm-itted a historic blunder by not allowing him to become Prime Minister. Its not proper to comment on what Jyotibabu had said. I never do that, he said.        
	However, he made his preference clear. Our party has changed its earlier position on the issue. If we are in a decisive position and can ensure meaningful and effective interventions in policy matters of the alternative government, we will definitely join it, he said.         
	The chief minister ruled out a move to the Centre. (There is) no question of my joining central politics. I know the state and will stay here.        
	If Bhattacharjees stress on the possibility of the Left parties joining the government was meant to boost their poll prospects in the final phase, his insistence that Mamata Banerjee would switch to the BJP camp after the polls, despite her denials, was apparently aimed at confusing minority voters.         
	I refuse to believe Trinamul will stick to the Congress. Its manifesto kept mum on the BJP, and L.K. Advani was silent on Mamata during his two visits to the state, he said.         
	The same necessity to break the Congress-Trinamul alliance before the civic polls next year and the Assembly elections was evident when he met state Congress chief Pranab Mukherjees poll-time barbs with kid gloves.         
	Pranabda is a Bengali bhadralok. He said what he was compelled to say at the time of polls. Shudhu ki mukher katha shunechho debata (Did you only listen to my words, oh Lord)? Bhattacharjee said.

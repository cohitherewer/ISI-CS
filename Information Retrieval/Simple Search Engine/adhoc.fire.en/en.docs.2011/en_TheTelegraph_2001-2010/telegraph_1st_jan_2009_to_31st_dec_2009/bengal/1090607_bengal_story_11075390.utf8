The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Cong nod to Writers meet
                                                                                                               Cong nod to Writers meet
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, June 6: Mamata Banerjee may be giving the go by to the state governments all-party meet on Aila relief but her ally Congress will take part in it because it doesnt want to be seen in poor light across the country.        
	Ours is an all-India party. The UPA government is providing all assistance to the state government to tackle the post-cyclone crisis. At this juncture, if we stay away from the meet, it would show us in poor light across the country, state Congress working president Pradip Bhattacharya said after a meeting with his boss Pranab Mukherjee.         
	The Trinamul Congress said it was the Congresss internal matter.         
	We may have fought the Lok Sabha elections together, but we have nothing to say on their organisational decisions, said Trinamul state president Subrata Bakshi.         
	His party colleague Partha Chatterjee said the all-party meeting had been called to put a seal of approval on the governments mismanaged relief efforts. We shall not oblige them by attending it.        
	Told that they could have given suggestions to the government on how to go about it, Chatterjee said: This is not the time for meetings. Our workers rushed to the affected areas and joined relief work without any meetings.        
	The allies have not been able to extend their Lok Sabha bonhomie to a majority of the 19 municipalities going to polls later this month. Their candidates are contesting each other in most seats.        
	Trinamuls other ally, the SUCI, has also decided to skip tomorrows meeting.        
	Subrata Mukherjee and Manas Bhuniya will represent the Congress at Writers Buildings. We shall ask for a concrete disaster management plan from the chief minister, said Subrata.         
	Bengal Congress president Pranab Mukherjee today met a dozen state party general secretaries and decided to hold a two-day session in August to rejuvenate party workers demoralised after the alliance with Trinamul.        
	The alliance has demoralised a section of the party at the grass roots. Many feel the party is fast losing its identity by riding piggyback on Mamata. So a brainstorming session is necessary to strengthen the organisation, Pradip Bhattacharya was quoted as saying at todays meeting.

                                                                                                               CM raps minister for power cuts
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, March 13: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today cut short the power minister when he tried to defend himself against flak for frequent blackouts in the examination season and tardy progress in rural electrification.        
	Mrinal Banerjee had come armed with figures on power generation and demand at a gathering of Left Front MLAs. When he started reeling them out, the chief minister reportedly said: Common people do not understand statistics. We must ensure power to priority sectors and take care of examinees.        
	Bhattacharjee admitted that several districts were lagging in rural electrification and asked Banerjee to ensure power to every rural home by 2012.         
	As Bhattacharjee urged the allies to speak in one voice, a Forward Bloc MLA wanted to know whether the government was planning to introduce any controversial bill.         
	The Bloc is opposed to the governments plan to relax the rural land ceiling and introduce parallel infrastructure to market farm products, now in the party domain.        
	Leader escapes blast        
	A CPM leader had a narrow es- cape when suspected Maoists detonated two landmines seconds before his motorcycle rolled onto a stretch in West Midnapores Lalgarh today.        
	Chandi Karan and his bodyguard, a constable who was riding pillion, were thrown to the ground but were unhurt, said district police chief Manoj Verma. A CPM local committee secretary, Karan was heading to the party office at Belatikri, 200km from Calcutta.        
	We have found a 200-metre wire, which we believe was used to detonate the explosives, Verma said.

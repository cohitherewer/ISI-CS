The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Missing cop mom guns for police
                                                                                                               Missing cop mom guns for police
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 12: The family of one of the two policemen kidnapped by Maoists in Lalgarh a fortnight ago today accused the police brass of doing little to trace him.         
	No senior officer cared to come to our house (in Burdwans Memari) and express sympathy, constable Sabir Mollahs mother Jahanara told a news conference in Calcutta this evening. From the beginning, there has been no communication from their end.         
	Sabir, in his early 30s, and fellow state armed police constable Kanchan Gorai were abducted on July 30 while returning to their camp in Dharampur from Lalgarh town on a motorcycle. Four days later, Maoist leader Bikash said the duo had been abducted by the people of the area who would try him in their court.        
	Jahanara appealed to the Maoists and the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities to release her son. We are poor and the Maoists fight for people like us. My son, the only one in service in our family, is not at fault. He is a low-level policeman who carries out orders from superiors. I pray with folded hands for my sons release, she said with tears rolling down her cheeks.        
	The family has written to Union home minister P. Chidambaram and governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi urging them to ensure more intensive efforts to trace the duo.        
	Asked about the polices failure to stand by the family, IG (law and order) Surajit Karpurakayastha said: It shouldnt have happened. We take special care of those in Maoist areas. Well look into the charge.

                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Monday crackdown on illegal pool cars
          A STAFF REPORTER                                           
	Calcutta, Nov. 21: On Monday, parents should be ready to drop children to school and bring them back as there may not be a pool car waiting at the door.        
	More than 5,000 pool car operators, who ferry children to and from school every day, have said they will not run their vehicles fearing a police crackdown on those that are illegal or have not been following safety norms.         
	Under the rules, all pool cars  there are around 8,000 such operators in the city and on its outskirts  have to be registered as commercial vehicles. The owners of the vehicles have to pay more tax than those of private vehicles. Pool cars also have to follow safety norms as most of these ferry children. (See chart)        
	I have received several complaints about pool cars. So, the public vehicles department (PVD) has to take the necessary steps, said transport minister Ranjit Kundu.         
	The government has alleged that pool car owners are not getting their vehicles registered to avoid paying the higher tax on commercial vehicles, and have been reluctant to follow the safety norms.        
	Subir Bhadra, director of the public vehicles department (PVD), said: Right now, almost none of the vehicles plying as pool cars is registered as commercial.        
	He said the PVD had requested the police to help enforce the crackdown from Monday.         
	Dilip Banerjee, deputy commissioner (traffic), said: The fine for errant operators is Rs 3,000.        
	Abir Roy, secretary of the Pool Car Welfare Owners Association, blamed the government for not explaining the regulations.        
	We are willing to pay the extra tax, Roy said. But the government is not explaining the new tax structure that we will have to follow. We want to become legal operators.        
	Bhadra trashed the argument. He said pool car owners knew that their vehicles fell in the commercial category, and that they would have to pay the same tax that the owners of other commercial vehicles in their category did.        
	If they have any doubts they can come to us and we will explain, a senior PVD official said. We dont have a separate pool car category and will treat them as commercial vehicles. Since the vehicles transport children, we have a set of safety norms too.        
	Schools are expecting late arrivals on Monday. Usually we do not allow late arrival. But we will allow students to walk in after the scheduled time, said Malini Bhagat, principal of Mahadevi Birla Girls Higher Secondary School.        
	Mausumi Das, whose daughter is in Class VII in Kendriya Vidyalaya, Salt Lake, said: My husband will have to drop her to school before work. We have to find a way of picking her up too.

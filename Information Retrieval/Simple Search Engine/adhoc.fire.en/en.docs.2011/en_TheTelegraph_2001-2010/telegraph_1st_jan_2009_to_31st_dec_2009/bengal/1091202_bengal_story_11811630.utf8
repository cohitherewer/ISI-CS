                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Assault slur on Trinamul
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Durgapur, Dec. 1: Three executives, including the American plant head of Phillips Carbon Black, were assaulted here last night by Trinamul Congress supporters demanding recruitment of local youths as security guards.        
	The gang led by Trinamul Youth Congress leader Chandrasekhar Banerjee pounced on general manager (operations) N.L. Lee, senior manager (electrical) Chanchal Ghosh and adviser Supriti Ghosh when they were getting into their cars after work around 8pm.        
	The RPG enterprise, which manufactures carbon that is used mainly in the tyre industry, had recently decided to hire ex-army men as guards.         
	Lee, an American citizen, who was at the companys Kochi unit earlier, took charge of Durgapur about a month ago.         
	They dragged the general manager by his collar and pushed him around. When Chanchal Ghosh came to his rescue, they tried to throttle him. Supriti Ghosh was pushed to the ground, said a senior official of the company.        
	Some of the workers and guards  a private agency is in charge of security now  rescued the executives. As the authorities called police, the 30-odd Trinamul activists fled.         
	The plants senior manager (HR) Dulal Chandra Roy lodged an FIR this evening accusing Banerjee of leading the assault. A police picket has been posted at the plants gate.         
	Production was normal at the plant today, Roy said.         
	The police said Banerjee was missing today.        
	The plant has both CPM and Trinamul unions. None of them had opposed the use of the private agency. But the Trinamul union started opposing the move to engage ex-army men since losing an election to CPM labour arm Citu.         
	They are desperate to regain the lost ground, said local Citu leader Naren Sikdar.         
	The leader of the plants Trinamul union refused comment. The state chief of the Trinamul trade union wing, Purnendu Bose, said: We are against the use of force in an industrial unit.

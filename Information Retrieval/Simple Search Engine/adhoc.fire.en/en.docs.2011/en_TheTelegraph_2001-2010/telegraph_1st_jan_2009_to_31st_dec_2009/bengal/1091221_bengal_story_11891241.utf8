                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Black flags in plains for hill talks teams     -  Tripartite meet today
          OUR BUREAU                          Union home secretary GK Pillai in Darjeeling. (Suman Tamang)                                        
	Dec. 20: Central and state officials received contrasting welcomes in the plains and on the foothills on their way to Darjeeling for tripartite talks to be held tomorrow.        
	The teams led by Union home secretary G.K. Pillai and Bengal chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti were greeted with black flags by outfits opposed to the division of the state, just as their convoys emerged from Bagdogra airport at 2pm.         
	Some 10km away, where NH31 (which goes to Darjeeling) meets NH55 (which snakes towards the Dooars), Gorkha Janmukti Morcha supporters dressed in the traditional daura sural and choubandhi cholis waved yellow-and-green party flags and cheered as the cars winded uphill.        
	The Amra Bangali, Bangla Bhasha O Bhasha Banchao Committee and the Dooars-Terai Nagarik Mancha  whose members waved the black flags  have called a 24-hour bandh in Jalpaiguri district and Siliguri tomorrow to protest the talks.        
	At Bagdogra, Pillai told reporters he was hopeful that tomorrows discussions would be fruitful. This is the fourth round of talks and I hope that we will have fruitful discussions with the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha and the representatives of the West Bengal government.         
	The state chief secretary said: We cant specifically say what will be discussed tomorrow. However, the issue of development in the hills would be discussed. Similar talks have been held earlier and all of us are here to openly discuss several issues. We are also hope- ful of a positive outcome.         
	At Planters Club in Darjeeling, a 16-member Morcha team went into a huddle this evening to finalise its plans for tomorrow. Our delegation will stonewall all efforts to discuss matters other than Gorkhaland. It will counter attempts to discuss development by reminding the bureaucrats that the state had not fulfilled its promises to reopen the closed Dooars tea gardens and regularise the casual workers of the DGHC (Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council), a Morcha source told The Telegraph.         
	After putting on hold an indefinite fast yesterday, Morcha president Bimal Gurung had said his team could walk out if anything other than Gorkhaland was discussed.         
	As the Morcha wants the Terai and the Dooars included in the proposed state, the party-backed Independent MLA from Kalchini, Wilson Champromary, will be part of the hill team led by Morcha general secretary Roshan Giri. Another Morcha leader from the Dooars, S.N. Pradhan, and Rajen Lohar from the Terai will also be present.         
	In Darjeeling, men and women followed a Morcha request to show the visiting delegates how different we are from the rest of Bengal and turned out on the streets in their traditional attires.         
	Tomorrows meeting will be held at the conference room of Mayfair resort at 11am. Joint secretary N.S. Kalsi, special secretary Anita Chowdhury, deputy secretary P.N. Saxena, intelligence branch chief Rajiv Mathur and Centre-appointed interlocutor Vijay Madan will be in Pillais team.        
	On the states side, the chief secretary will have home secretary Ardhendu Sen, director-general of police Bhupin- der Singh, DGHC administrator B.L. Meena, Jalpaiguri divisional commissioner A.K. Singh and Darjeeling district magistrate Surendra Gupta in his team.

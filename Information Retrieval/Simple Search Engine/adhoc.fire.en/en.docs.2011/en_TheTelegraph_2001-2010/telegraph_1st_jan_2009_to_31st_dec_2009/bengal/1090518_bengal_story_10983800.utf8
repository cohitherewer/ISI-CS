The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | No bargain for ministry
                                                                                                               No bargain for ministry
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, May 17: Mamata Banerjee today said she would not bargain for the berth of her choice in the Union cabinet.         
	Im not going to enter into a political bargain for a ministry of my choice. We can bargain only on issues concerning peoples problems, the Trinamul Congress chief said when asked if she would press for railways.         
	I have no preferences. I did not ask for railways even in 1999. Atal Bihari Vajpayee had sent Jaswant Singh to my home and offered the railway portfolio, she added.        
	The Trinamul parliamentary party will meet tomorrow to elect its new leader and discuss future strategy.         
	Sources said the meeting would also discuss the possible Trinamul ministerial candidates. Mamata might ask for four ministerial berths, said a party general secretary.        
	Told that Lalu Prasad, the railway minister now, could be keen to retain it, Mamata flared up. Dont ask me to comment on what others have said or done. Our primary task is to ensure a Congress-led stable government at the Centre that will work for the people in the next five years.        
	Asked about her ally SUCI, which has refused to back the UPA government, Mamata said: I dont know what the SUCI has said. But we had given the Joynagar seat to the party and its MP, who has won as an Independent, is expected to toe our line.        
	The MP, Tarun Mondal, met Mamata today.        
	Mamata demanded recounting of votes in Balurghat where the RSP has won by a little over 5,000 votes and threatened to move court alleging rigging at Keshpur, which is part of the Ghatal constituency.

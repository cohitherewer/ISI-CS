The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Dooars campaign on hold 
                                                                                                               Dooars campaign on hold 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Kalimpong, Jan. 22: The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha has decided to put on hold its Dooars Chalo campaign, but said its supporters would stay put in Gorubathan till they were allowed to hold meetings in the region.        
	The decision was taken to honour chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees request during his meeting with a Morcha delegation in Calcutta yesterday, hill leaders said.         
	 Binay Tamang, the publicity secretary of the Morcha, said his party would not hold any rally and would scale down the strength of its supporters camping in Gorubathan, the foothill village bordering the Dooars.        
	Last week, the Morcha supporters had made repeated attempts to enter the Dooars. But on each occasion, the administration blocked them to avert clashes between the Morcha and Adivasi activists.

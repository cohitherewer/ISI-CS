The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Party overdrive to encash Subhas
                                                                                                               Party overdrive to encash Subhas
          BISWAJIT ROY                      Chakraborty: Last laugh                          
	Calcutta, Aug. 13: The CPM leadership will try to reinvigorate the ranks and arrest the partys increasing alienation from voters by appropriating Subhas Chakrabortys popul-arity at a rally to remember him tomorrow.         
	However, as the party geared up to ferry busloads of people to ensure footfall at Netaji Indoor Stadium, a traffic alarm went off in the city.        
	Police said much of central Calcutta was likely to get choked from noon by processions of the party faithful.         
	The partys state secretariat will meet tomorrow morning to fine-tune the condolence resolution to be placed at the rally that starts at 4.30pm.         
	Sources said the resolution would urge supporters to turn their sorrow into strength and emulate Chakrabortys ability to bond with people.        
	Our central committee has identified the lack of contact with commoners and haughty, bureaucratic behaviour of our leaders down the line as the prime factor for our setbacks. We want to promote Subhasdas example to catalyse a new mass contact campaign, said a secretariat member.         
	Although a section of the leadership isnt exactly happy with the growing personality cult and cultivation of Chakrabortys larger-than-life image since the massive turnout at his funeral procession, others admitted the partys desperate bid to tap all resources for a turnaround before the 2011 Assembly polls.         
	So, no one in the party will mind the inconvenience caused to Calcuttans tomorrow. Giant screens and loudspeakers have been set up outside the stadium too.         
	The partys labour arm, Citu, is holding a memorial meeting at the Calcutta University Centenary Hall on Sunday. The partys North 24-Parganas unit is organising one at Salt Lake Stadium on August 23.         
	More rallies, booklets on Chakraborty and a photo exhibition on his life are in the pipeline, unlike in the case of many of his stature in the party hierarchy.        
	The CPM expects to raise the emotional tempo to ensure an even bigger gathering on August 31 to mark 50 years of its food movement. The party should rock the city that day, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had said.         
	Although invited to Netaji Indoor, Mamata Banerjee is unlikely to turn up. She did not even acknowledge receiving the invite today, though the organisers insisted that it had reached her.        
	A Trinamul source said she was also unlikely to go on Sunday to Chakrabortys house, where his wife Ramala had invited her. Didi is not expected to help the CPM galvanise its cadres.         
	Mamata had gone to the mortuary to pay her last respects to Chakraborty.        
	CPM general secretary Prakash Karat, too, wont be there tomorrow. The organisers downplayed it saying the politburo would be represented by its four members from Bengal, but others pointed to Karats reservations about Chakrabortys brand of politics, not always in tune with the partys.        
	That the party has discovered Chakrabortys virtues after his death is evident from the number of reports on him in party organ Peoples Democracy. Karat, too, has a message there, underlining his personal association with Chakraborty, the SFI general secretary when Karat was its president.         
	However, while Karat gradually rose to the highest party position, Chakraborty took 37 years to make it to the state secretariat.

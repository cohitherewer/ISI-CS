The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Maoists target CPM offices
                                                                                                               Maoists target CPM offices
          OUR BUREAU                          The burnt CPM office near Jhargram town. (Sanat Kumar Sinha)                                  
	June 23: Maoists and their supporters today looted and burnt down two CPM offices, one near Purulias Burrabazar and the other close to Jhargram, West Midnapore.         
	About 10km from Burrabazar, the Citu office was raided around one in the morning. Srichor Mahato, whose father had provided the land for the two-room building three decades ago, was woken up by the noise of doors being smashed.         
	I saw 12-13 men setting fire to the office. Several villagers gathered at a distance and helplessly watched flames leaping out of it, said Srichor, who stays 200 metres away.         
	He is one of the 160-odd Citu supporters working at Beldih Mines stone quarry nearby.        
	The rampage lasted about 20 minutes, Mahato said.         
	Santosh Mahato, whose home is closer to the party office, was woken up by muffled voices. I could see axes, rods and other weapons. They broke open the doors and windows and used some flammable substance to set fire to the furniture. No one had the courage to go close, let alone stop them.         
	The attackers put up posters saying CPI (Maobadi) zindabad before leaving.        
	At daybreak, the villagers saw tables, chairs and boxes containing receipt books, agreement papers, passbooks, audit files and records of self-help groups reduced to ash.        
	Police from Burrabazar came around 9am. We dont have faith in them. Their coming or not coming doesnt make a difference, said Gangadhar Mahato, the secretary of the Citu union.        
	Also around 1am, a group of 13-14 attacked the partys local committee office at Dakshinshole village, about 4km from Jhargram town.         
	When the masked miscreants banged at its door, three partymen on guard inside fled through the rear.        
	The gang ransacked the office but did not destroy its most prized possession, a computer. They took it away.

  - Afternoon raid at a Purulia station near Jharkhand        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          An injured policeman being wheeled into hospital. (Mita Roy)                                         
	Purulia, Feb. 25: Suspected Maoists boarded a train as it rolled into a Purulia station this afternoon, shot dead two Railway Protection Force constables, injured two others and snatched their weapons.        
	The constables were returning in the brake-van at the rear of the Tata-Dhanbad Subarnarekha Express after escorting a cash consignment to Jamshedpur.         
	The assailants, who apparently knew they were in that coach, ran up to it and started firing at Barabhum station in Balarampur, about 220km northwest of Calcutta.        
	A handful of passengers on the platform started running in fear. Schoolteacher Shamsher Khan, returning home after work, hid behind a wall.         
	I was about to board the train around 2.20pm when I heard the shots. I first thought someone was bursting crackers. But then there were screams for help towards the end of the platform. Some of us ran for cover behind a building. A while later, we saw a group of men with rifles running along the tracks, he said.        
	The rebels fired shots in the air while fleeing along the tracks. After running straight for some distance, they entered an adjacent forest that leads to the dense jungles of the Ayodhya Hills.                 
	Barabhum station is about 10km from the Jharkhand border.        
	There were about seven or eight of them, said S.P Majumdar, the Purulia station manager, who came to the spot, 20km away. The constables said the attackers shouted pro-Maoist slogans while fleeing, he added.        
	The guerrillas took away two Insas rifles, a carbine and a 9mm pistol.        
	Purulia superintendent of police Rajesh Yadav said: Our forces have joined the Government Railway Police and the RPF in combing operations in the region. The forces are following the escape route taken by the attackers. We are trying our best to trace them in the difficult forest terrain.        
	Three days ago, the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities, which is believed to enjoy Maoist patronage, had organised a rally in the area. About 6,000 tribal people from Purulia, Bankura, West Midnapore and Birbhum attended the rally in which CPI (Maoist) spokesperson Gaur Chakraborty was among the guests.        
	The dead constables were identified as S.R. Majhi, and N.B.N. Ansari. Majhi, 47, was declared dead on arrival at Bokaro General Hospital, about 75km away. Ansari, 27, died on the operation table.        
	A constable is in the hospital with bullet wounds. The other injured cop, who was apparently hit by rifle butts, is being treated in Purulia.        
	On December 22, the gue-rrillas had killed two constables in the districts Barabazar block.

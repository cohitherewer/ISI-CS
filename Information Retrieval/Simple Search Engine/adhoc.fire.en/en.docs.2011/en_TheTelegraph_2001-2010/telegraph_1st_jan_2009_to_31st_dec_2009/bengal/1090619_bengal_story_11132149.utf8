The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Cautious CPM basks in Mamata dilemma
                                                                                                               Cautious CPM basks in Mamata dilemma
          BISWAJIT ROY                          Mamata, Buddhadeb                          
	Calcutta, June 18: As they go into battle in Lalgarh, the CPM and the state government believe they are better placed politically compared with Nandigram two years ago.        
	One reason for the cautious optimism is the Prime Ministers stern warning to Maoists at large yesterday, which the CPM sees as a message for Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to take the rebels on in Lalgarh.        
	The second is their assessment that Mamata Banerjee cannot afford to oppose the joint crackdown by state police and central forces until there are major civilian casualties.        
	She cannot support the Maoists openly, a CPM state secretariat member said.        
	The Trinamul Congress chief was silent on Lalgarh through the day, telling reporters who had gathered at her home: I am busy with the railway budget.        
	Party sources said Mamata was tight-lipped out of annoyance with the Maoists.        
	The Maoists have offered Bhattacharjee and his party an opportunity to recover from their post-poll demoralisation by shifting the focus to Lalgarh, a senior member of Mamatas think tank said.        
	Second, Mamata apparently felt embarrassed with Kishanji, chief of the rebels armed wing in Bengal, Jharkhand and Orissa, and his Lalgarh deputy Bikash saying on TV that the Maoists had fought together with Trinamul in Nandigram, and adding that Trinamul and the CPM were two sides of the same coin.        
	The chief minister left for Delhi this evening after giving the go-ahead for the initial phase of the Lalgarh operation. CPM state secretary Biman Bose accompanied him to the capital, where they will attend party politburo and central committee meetings.        
	Neither Bhattacharjee nor his party officially linked the decision to go on the offensive to Manmohan Singhs support, but CPM leaders privately admitted the connection.        
	They said the CPM state secretariat had decided on tough measures but the party was dithering about the timing as it wanted to complete the political groundwork first to avoid a repeat of Nandigram.        
	After securing Left Front allies nod yesterday, the leadership was looking for Bhattacharjees scheduled meeting with Singh tomorrow to ensure the Centre shared responsibility for the unpalatable decision. But Union home minister P. Chidambaram made it clear that ordering an operation was Bhattacharjees call.        
	We were worried about Trinamul and the so-called civil society and human rights groups because they would create an uproar if there is bloodshed. But now we have the Prime Minister on our side. Mamata cannot object to the Centres involvement since she cannot support the Maoists openly, a CPM state secretariat member said.        
	Anxious to keep the Congress in good humour, Bose today refused to react to its spokesman Manish Tewaris remark that the Bengal government should step down if it cant solve the Lalgarh standoff.        
	I wont join issue since I am not sure whether it was his personal opinion or that of the Congress, Bose said.        
	Aware that the mood of his front allies and the larger political opinion might change quickly with loss of innocent lives, Bose said: I dont think there would be much casualty.        
	He was careful to distance the party from the operation, saying: The government will take the administrative steps; we will do the political battle against the Maoists.        
	Both the CPM and the Maoists are demanding that Mamata spell out her position.        
	In Nandigram, we had fought (together) with Trinamul under the banner of the BUPC (Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee). I want Mamata to come out with a clear stand on it (the Lalgarh operation), Kishanji told a TV channel.        
	The CPMs Mohammad Salim said: Mamata has been running a rainbow coalition of extreme Left to extreme Right. Let the people know where she stands.        
	CPM leaders appear to be enjoying Mamatas perceived dilemma, hoping she would face flak from her Leftist friends in the civil society if she failed to criticise the police action.        
	Bhattacharjee did not mention Lalgarh in the Assembly today, nor did Trinamul or the Congress demand any statement from him on the police operation, apparently in a bid to distance themselves from the Maoists.        
	A leader close to Mamata said: The Maoists invited the operation by claiming centre stage after the demolition of CPM leader Anuj Pandeys home (in Dharampur), which was otherwise an expression of popular wrath against corrupt CPM leaders.        
	He added: In their zeal to upstage Mamata in the post-poll scene, the Maoists have forgotten the legal aid (after various past arrests) and other kinds of help we had once given them. There has been no contact between us and the Maoists since the two sides developed enmity.        
	He said even Lalgarh tribal leader Chhatradhar Mahato, head of the Peoples Committee against Police Atrocities, had not contacted the party in recent days. He is doing what he is being asked at gunpoint now.         
	Mamata has asked her men not to get involved in Lalgarh. She will go if innocent people lose lives, the Trinamul leader said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Route secured, people insecure 
                                                                                                               Route secured, people insecure 
          IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                              
	Ramgarh, June 27: The police have secured the Kadashole-Ramgarh stretch but the villagers are far from secure in the area.        
	This morning, at Saluka village around 2km from Kadashole, the rebels held a meeting during which they took the phone numbers of all residents carrying cellphones.         
	They said they were leaving the village for a while and told us to keep informing them about police movement, said an elderly villager who did not wish to be named. The Maoists, guns slung across their shoulders, took his son-in-laws number too.        
	They said they would not spare us if we gave the police details about them.        
	The son-in-law said: We told the police that the Maoists had threatened to kill us if we didnt provide them with information.         
	A senior district police officer said the force was aware that the Maoists would use local people to get information on troop movement.        
	Our biggest challenge now is to win the confidence of the local people and convince them that we can protect them from the Maoists. If we do that successfully, the villagers will help us nab the Maoists, the officer said.        
	The police have detained 10 people from Kadashole and Ramgarh on the suspicion of having Maoist links.        
	The officer said the forces would set up camps in some villages on the route to Ramgarh from Goaltore to ensure round-the-clock vigil.        
	These camps will be set up along the road and inside the villages, especially at the entry points, he said.         
	The police are also sealing the exit points from Ramgarh. There are more than 26 exit points from Ramgarh and the Maoists may take any of them to flee to Jharkhand via Bankura. We are trying to seal these routes but it will take some time, he said.        
	Saluka has been in the grip of the Maoists since November. The troops recaptured it today after an hour-long gunfight with mortar shelling.         
	NGO team held        
	Eight members of an NGO were arrested at Midnapore after they said they wanted to visit Lalgarh. The police tried to persuade the team from Delhis Fact Finding Committee of India, which arrived at Midnapore railway station at 5.30pm, not to visit Lalgarh. When they remained firm, they were arrested.

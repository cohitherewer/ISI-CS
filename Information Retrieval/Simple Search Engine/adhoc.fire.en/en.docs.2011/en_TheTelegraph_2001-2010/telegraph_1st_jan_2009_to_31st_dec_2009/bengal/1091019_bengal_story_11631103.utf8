The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Unborn rival threatens to blank out Haldia
                                                                                                               Unborn rival threatens to blank out Haldia
  - Upcoming Dhamra port in Orissa could steal Bengals locational advantage          SAMBIT SAHA                                                  
	Calcutta, Oct. 18: Delay in executing a scheme to regulate the Hooghly, said to be a difficult river for ships to navigate, and a budding rival in Orissa are threatening to rob Haldia port of its locational edge and a large share of cargo.        
	Dhamra port, being built by Tata Steel and Larsen amp; Toubro, will be operational by April and target the two lifelines of Haldia port  cargos of coal and iron ore.        
	Shipping circles said Dhamra would give users an at least $5-a-tonne advantage over Haldia in terms of ocean freight because it would be able to handle ships that are thrice as big as those sailing to Haldia.         
	That will blunt the Bengal ports locational advantage, built over years through the creation of a vast hinterland well connected by the railways.        
	Dhamra will begin with a 25 million-tonne capacity but the port will reach full potential only in October, when a rail link to the Howrah-Chennai line is ready.        
	Rapid siltation in the Hooghly riverbed has compromised ships ability to carry heavy loads to Haldia. If the Bengal port can receive ships with barely 22,000 tonnes now, its Orissa rival will be able to handle 165,000-tonne ships.        
	Even now Haldia is the last-discharge port for shipping lines which unload the bulk of their cargo at Orissas Paradip, the closest major port to Haldia.        
	But an all-time-low draft  allowable depth of a vessels keel under water  is increasingly making the port unviable. Ships could soon be unloading everything at Paradip.        
	The steel industry still uses the Haldia port to bring coal as there is a $4-a-tonne advantage over Paradip because of its proximity to the plants. But unless something is done immediately, the great advantage of Haldia may not remain, said Dibyendu Bose, the managing director of TMIL, a Tata Steel subsidiary.        
	The threat to Haldias coal and iron ore cargos comes at a time the port is set to lose about 10 million tonnes of liquid cargo, mostly crude oil, to Paradip because the Indian Oil Corporations Haldia-Paradip pipeline is almost ready.        
	Haldia had handled about 41 million tonnes of cargo last year. After the first six months of this fiscal, it is down 22 per cent from the corresponding figure for last year.        
	But what has led to such rapid reduction in river draft (by 0.7 metres since end-August)? Observers said years of neglect, especially during the tenure of former shipping minister T.R. Baalu.         
	The ports proposal to carry out capital dredging  the removal of soil from beneath water to increase depth  and build dykes to regulate the flow of the river gathered dust at the Union shipping ministry for three years (2004-2007) until it lapsed.         
	The port has had to commission a fresh study on the pro-ject. We expect the final report by the end of this year, said Anindya Mazumdar, the acting chairman of Calcutta Port Trust.        
	Haldia port spends around Rs 300 crore a year on dred- ging aimed at maintaining the existing draft. The aim of capital dredging is to increase it.        
	The 2004 proposal was also late by several years. The pro-ject was conceived in 1998, re-validated in end-2001 and put to bidding in 2002. However, the dredging cartel of Belgian and Dutch companies did not participate and the bid had to be scrapped.         
	A fresh study was then commissioned and its report became ready in 2004.         
	But Baalus ministry did not push it forward. What was conceived as a Rs 350-crore scheme will now cost over Rs 1,000 crore.        
	The old dredgers of the Centre did not help matters. Their efficacy was reduced further as they spent more time travelling to dump mud in the sea than in scooping up silt, in the absence of land to dispose it.        
	But experts said there was hope for Haldia still as a new shipping channel could provide greater depth.        
	Sources said the new Eden channel, which might provide over an eight-metre draft, could be opened sooner than expected.        
	The difficulty of the job at hand can be made out from the dredgers struggle to maintain a 500-metre-wide channel for shipping on the Hooghly, which is several kilometres wide at Haldia.

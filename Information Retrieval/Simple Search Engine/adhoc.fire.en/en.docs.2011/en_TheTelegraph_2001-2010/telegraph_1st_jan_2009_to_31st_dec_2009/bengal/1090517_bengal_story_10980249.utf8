	Calcutta, May 16: Mamata Banerjee today said the Bengal verdict was a a vote of no-confidence against the ruling CPM and the Left Front.         
	The results were a vote of no-confidence against the ru-ling CPM and the Left Front. Bengals electorate today created history by expressing their no-confidence against the oppressive CPM through the ballot, the Trinamul Congress chief told at a news conference this afternoon when the results were still pouring into her Kalighat home.        
	People brought in a change to end the CPMs 32-year-old misrule. This overwhelming support helped us win the Maa-mati, manush-er lorai (the battle for land, which people treat as their mother).        
	However, in a departure from the past, Mamata did not immediately ask for the chief ministers resignation. Asked if she would demand the dismissal of the Left government, she said: Let the new government be installed at the Centre. Then we shall discuss all matters concerning Bengal.         
	Mamata also did not provide a clear answer on her joining the government at the Centre. I shall discuss the matter after the complete results are announced, she said.         
	Her aides said that Trinamul, being the second largest party after the Congress in the UPA, would join the government. They also indicated that she might want a couple of her MPs to be inducted into the Union cabinet.                  Mother Gayatri Banerjee has tears in her eyes hearing about Mamatas success.

	Mamata apparently received several calls from Congress leaders requesting her to join the ministry. Didi has already spoken to a host of Congress leaders, including Pranab Mukherjee and K. Keshava Rao, on the post-poll scenario. A call also came from Congress president Sonia Gandhi, said a Trinamul general secretary.        
	Asked if she would seek advancement of the Assembly polls, due in 2011, Mamata said: The Assembly polls should be brought forward following the CPMs drubbing. The people want an end to the CPMs atrocities.         
	During campaigning, Mamata had said that if her all- iance could ensure the CPMs defeat in a majority of the Lok Sabha seats in Bengal, it would help hasten the Assembly polls.        
	The CPM would be wiped out of Bengal in the Assembly polls, she thundered.        
	The Trinamul leader attributed her overwhelming victory to several factors.         
	First, the CPMs move to grab farmland for industry, ignoring the importance of agriculture.         
	Second, the alleged state-sponsored terrorism unleashed on people and, third, CPM cadres arrogance towards ordinary people.        
	We want both agriculture and industry to happily co-exist. We want an end to atrocities on people. One should not be arrogant while dealing with people. Everybody should keep in mind that in a democracy, people have the last word, Mamata said.         
	As the trend became clear this morning, party workers outside her home started chanting: CPM dekhey ja, Mamatar khamata (CPM come and see Mamatas might), .        
	Then came the sweets and the green gulal. This win has exceeded all expectations. And to think a woman has achieved this, said Kalighat resident Prabhat Chakraborty.

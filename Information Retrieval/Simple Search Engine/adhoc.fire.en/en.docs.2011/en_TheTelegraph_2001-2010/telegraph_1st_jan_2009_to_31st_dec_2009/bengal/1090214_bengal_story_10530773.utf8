The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Citu men pull down plant wall
                                                                                                               Citu men pull down plant wall
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Durgapur, Feb. 13: Citu supporters today pulled down a portion of a factorys boundary wall, saying a 2.5-bigha patch, the governments after a court verdict, would be distributed among the landless.        
	Armed with red flags, rods and hammers, the mob descended on the entrance to the Durgapur Plus Cement factory at Laudoha, 220km from Calcutta, around 8.30am. They waved their hammers at us and a portion of the 10ft high wall came down in half an hour, said production manager Debasish Sinha. We were too scared to protest.        
	Last July, Citu had stopped production at the plant, accusing the management of not hiring local youths.         
	When Anukul Maity bought the four-acre plot last February, the 2.5 bighas (about an acre) in question were under litigation. The government won the case in the land tribunal court.        
	Maity said that didnt give Citu the right to pull down the factorys wall. Even if a por-tion of my land is vested, is it the duty of Citu or the CPM to take control over it?        
	Maity has already applied for a lease of the 2.5 bighas.         
	Burdwan district Citu leader Ranjit Mukherjee said the land was freed because the administration had done little to get it back. We have taken control of the land and will distribute it among the poor through the government.        
	The Rs 100-crore plant, 11 months old and employing 40 people, produces 1,000 tonnes of cement in a day.

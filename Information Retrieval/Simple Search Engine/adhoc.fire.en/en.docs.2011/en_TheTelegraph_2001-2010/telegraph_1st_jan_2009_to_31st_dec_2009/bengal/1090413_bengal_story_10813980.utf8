          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, April 12: Mamata Banerjee today lodged a complaint with the Election Commission against Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee for his alleged provocative utterances threatening the Opposition.        
	The chief minister used provocative language while campaigning. He is constantly threatening the Opposition.... I lodged a specific complaint with the EC against him, the Trinamul Congress chief said.        
	Although Mamata refused to give details of Bhattacharjees threat, it seemed she was referring to the chief ministers rally yesterday in the city where he said he would not bow to the Opposition and instead go ahead with setting up a factory on the Singur land.         
	I shall go to Singur and set up a factory there,come what may, he had said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Bloc pins CM over land
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Bloc pins CM over land
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 14: Left Front partner Forward Bloc today singled out Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees land acquisition drive as the biggest reason for the ruling alliances worst electoral crisis ever.         
	The land acquisition policy was wrong. We are facing todays situation because of it and the person who initiated the policy is now himself admitting it, Bloc leader Ashok Ghosh said without naming the chief minister at the end of its state party conference.         
	The government has acquired fertile land without caring for its adverse impact on farmers, most of whom are small landholders in post-land reforms Bengal. There is no proper acquisition and rehabilitation policy in the state. Thats why many Left Front supporters have gone against us and supported Trinamul, added Ghosh, who has been re-elected general secretary of the partys state unit.         
	The report he tabled at the conference lamented that the front owed its advent to power and success to land but it became its nemesis, too.         
	Three incidents (police firing in Nandigram, political strife over Singur and exit of the Nano project) galvanised the pent-up anti-government feelings, which snowballed into intense resentment, (and) hatred... that led to (the) massive defeat of the Left in Lok Sabha polls, Ghosh said.         
	The barbs came apparently after delegates at the party meet pulled up the Bloc leadership for toeing the CPM line after spitting fire.         
	Ghosh also resented the government decision to offer the railways the abandoned Nano project site in Singur without discussing it within the front.         
	However, the party would continue to sail with the CPM. Its the beauty of the Left Front, Ghosh claimed. We fight but also unite.

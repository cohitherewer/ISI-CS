The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Mamata complains to Pranab 
                                                                                                               Mamata complains to Pranab 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, March 26: Mamata Banerjee tonight called on Bengal Congress president Pranab Mukherjee at his Dhakuria home and is said to have complained about some Congress leaders who were not working for her candidates.        
	Mukherjee had earlier said that those who worked against the interests of the Congress-Trinamul alliance would face disciplinary action.        
	The Trinamul Congress chief is believed to have mentioned to Mukherjee that Congress leader Abdul Mannan, a former MLA, was today missing from a meeting Mamata addressed in Hooghly.        
	Asked for his reaction, Mannan said: I was invited but did not go as it was a Trinamul workers convention.        
	Mamata also said Congress leaders in Nadia should be asked to campaign jointly.        
	Mukherjee has asked Pradip Bhattacharya, the Bengal Congress working president, to send him the names of those leaders who have been staying away from joint campaigns.        
	After the meeting with Mukherjee today, Mamata said: We met to discuss who would go where to campaign and to take stock of our election activities.         
	She said such meetings between the two parties would be a regular feature in the run-up to the Lok Sabha elections. The joint campaigns are necessary to send a message to our political adversaries that the alliance is emerging as a viable alternative, she added.        
	The two leaders also discussed the visit of Sonia Gandhi to Bengal. Sonia Gandhi will come to Bengal twice but the dates have not been finalised, Mamata said.

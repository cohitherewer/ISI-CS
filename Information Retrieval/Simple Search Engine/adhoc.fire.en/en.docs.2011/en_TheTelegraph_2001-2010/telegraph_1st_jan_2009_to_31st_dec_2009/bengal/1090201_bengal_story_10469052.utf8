The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Fest put off, school dead quiet 
                                                                                                               Fest put off, school dead quiet 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Howrah, Jan. 31: One of the brightest days of the festival calendar at MC Kejriwal Vidyapith turned dark this morning as the news of Yash Lakhotias death came in.        
	Less than a third of the students attended the Saraswati Puja at the school auditorium around 10am. Those who did were herded together and sent home before noon.         
	The puja was held almost as a formality. The cultural events that were to follow were scrapped.        
	After hearing about the tragic death of Yash, who was a Class II student of our school, we decided to cancel the festivities we had planned, said headmistress Mallika Mukherjee.         
	After the puja, we ob- served a minutes silence in his memory and held a condolence meeting where we expressed our shock and grief over the incident.        
	Several students who attended the programme were in tears, she added.        
	Yashs classmate Tushar Agarwal said: I saw his picture on television and asked my parents what had happened to him. They told me he had been killed. I cannot believe I will never again see my friend, who I used to meet in class and talk to every day.        
	Seven-year-old Tushar said he did not feel like going to school after hearing about his friend. His parents did not force him.        
	Teachers said the school usually celebrated Saraswati Puja in a big way. Students decorate the campus and paint alpana on the floors. A pandal is erected on the dais in the auditorium and students sing and dance around the goddess of learning through the day. There is also the customary feast in the afternoon, a teacher said.        
	A deathly silence ruled today. Shaon Chaubey, who lives in the neighbourhood, said: Every year, we heard them singing on loudspeakers and make merry around the campus. This time, all was silent.         
	If ears were cocked to the sprawling campus, the only audible sound probably would have been of the children sobbing for their lost friend.

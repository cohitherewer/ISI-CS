	Calcutta, Oct. 30: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today stepped up the CPM campaign against Mamata Banerjees nexus with Maoists, accusing the railway minister of covering up the guerrillas role in Tuesdays siege of the Rajdhani Express.         
	In the same vein, CPM state secretary Biman Bose asked the CBI to question Trinamul Congress minister Sisir Adhikari, who had claimed that he knew in advance the plan to block the train.         
	However, Bose later clarified that he was not asking for a CBI probe, an indication of the party and the state gov- ernments dilemma over the central agencys intervention in the state.         
	The offensive was appar-ently aimed at pressuring the Congress into taming partner Trinamul and to fuel the CPM campaign for 10 Assembly byelections on November 7.        
	Addressing a rally organised by the Left Fronts Howrah unit at Esplanade, the chief minister pointed out that the railways FIR on the Rajdhani blockade had not named the leaders of the Peoples Committee against Police Atrocities, though they had publicly sought Chhatradhar Mahatos re-lease while holding up the train.        
	We have always maintained that the Chhatradhar bahini (force) is the creation of Maoists. Now that we have arrested Chhatradhar, his bahini blocked the train. If the CRPF could name some of the (blockade) organisers in its FIR, why did the railways fail to do so? Bhattacharjee asked.        
	He blamed Mamata for the omission without naming her. Youve won the polls and become a Union minister. Even then the railway department didnt name the attackers. Because it wanted to shield the Maoists involved in the incident and conceal the truth from the people, Bhattacharjee said.         
	The Maoists are a major danger to the state but it (the danger) wouldnt have become so big had it not been for Trinamul, he said. Unfortunately, Trinamul is supporting the Maoists. They joined hands in Nandigram and launched a violent agitation, though we decided not to acquire land there. Today, the Maoist-Trinamul combine is killing Left supporters in Junglemahal.        
	The chief minister iterated his resolve to defeat the Maoists and expose their nexus with Trinamul.         
	The CPM also tried to pay Mamata back in her own coin when its leaders demanded the return of 700 acres of farmland in Howrahs Sankrail, which were acquired for the railways 25 years ago but had remained unused.        
	The railways have to decide what to do with that land. They want us to acquire more land for them in Bengal. Will you (read Mamata) accept if we offer land which the owners are unwilling to give up? Bhattacharjee asked.         
	The chief minister blamed the Centre for the rise in prices of essentials, but sounded soft on the Prime Minister. The Congress came to power by raising expectations among the poor in the country. It knows well it cant retain power if it fails to deliver.        
	Bose alleged that some of the recent Maoist activities had been planned in Mamatas presence. He also knew where  the Salt Lake house of an artist.         
	Asked later, he was not clear on what plans they had made, but left no doubt about not wanting a CBI probe. Im not asking for a CBI probe into the Rajdhani blockade, Bose said. The CBI should ask Adhikari how he came to know about it in advance and whether he had informed his leader and the government.         
	Guerrilla leader Kishanji denied any nexus with Mamata and added that train blockades were not new to Bengal. Rail or rasta rokos are not new here and mainstream parties are allowed to do so.         
	Cong support        
	The Congress iterated its support for Mamata. In Delhi, party general secretary Keshava Rao said: Mamata wants welfare of the poor and peace in Bengal. Asked about her alleged association with Chhatradhar, he said: So what? That doesnt make her a Maoist sympathiser.

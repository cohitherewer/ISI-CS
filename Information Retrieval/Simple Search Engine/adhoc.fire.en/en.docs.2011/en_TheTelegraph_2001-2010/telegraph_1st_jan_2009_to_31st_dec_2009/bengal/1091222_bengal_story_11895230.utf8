	Calcutta, Dec. 21: A bill to raise the salaries and allowances of MLAs was passed by the Assembly today.         
	Once the Bengal Legisla- tive Assembly (Members Emoluments) Amendment Bill, 2009, becomes an act, an MLA drawing Rs 10,500 a month will get Rs 15,750.        
	The monthly pension for former MLAs will go up from Rs 2,000 to Rs 4,000. The monthly medical allowance for them will also be doubled from Rs 2,000.        
	An Assembly official said the last time Bengal legislators emoluments had been revised was five years ago.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Godown raid to check prices
                                                                                                               Godown raid to check prices
          A STAFF REPORTER                                          
	Calcutta, July 8: The government will raid cold storages and godowns across Bengal to find out whether prices of potatoes, pulses and other essentials are spiralling because they are being hoarded by some.        
	Finance minister Asim Dasgupta, who held a meeting today to discuss the soaring prices, said the stocks at cold storages should be able to buck the trend.        
	We will conduct the raids to find out whether that is what is pushing up the prices. Steps will be taken against those stockpiling items, said Dasgupta.        
	He admitted that the government has woken up late to the problem, but blamed it on a range of issues from the Lok Sabha elections and cyclone Aila to Lalgarh. That is why we could not take any steps. But we will now take action, he said.        
	Ashok Kumar Dana, the principal agriculture officer of Bengals potato capital Hooghly, blamed low production last winter for the soaring prices more than hoarding.        
	What sold for Rs 10 a kilo in January is priced at Rs 18 now.        
	 Dana said: We grew about 19 lakh tonnes in Hooghly in the winter of 2007. But in 2008, we had about 50 per cent less production. Half the crop was destroyed by blight (a fungal infection). The crop in the neighbouring districts was also affected.        
	However, Dana admitted that the stocks in the cold storages, about 67 per cent full now, should bring down the price if released properly.        
	In Burdwan, which produced 15 lakh tonnes of the crop in 2007 winter, only about 8 lakh tonnes was produced last year. So there is not enough stock in the cold storages there, an agriculture department official said.        
	The price of sugar has gone up almost 50 per cent in the past six months.         
	Most of the sugar that Bengal consumes is procured from other states like Gujarat. Dasgupta said that if need be, sugarcane would be imported and sugar manufactured at mills in Bengal.         
	We are also thinking in terms of importing crude sugar and processing them into fine sugar. This sugar will be distributed through the public distribution system, said Dasgupta.         
	Bengal has to depend on other states for pulses, too. We will buy 1,700 tonnes of moong and masur dal from central government agencies and distribute them through ration shops, the minister said.        
	Farm marketing minister Murtaza Hossain, food and civil supplies minister Paresh Adhikary and senior police officers attended the meeting that decided on the raids by the enforcement branch.

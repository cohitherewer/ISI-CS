          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                                    
	Calcutta, March 10: Calcutta High Court has suspended a lower court judge who often slept in the courtroom at night, took a shower in the court cloakroom and hung out his underclothes to dry on its corridors.         
	R.P. Ghosh, did not take his quarters in Garbeta, West Midnapore, and travelled 175km from Bandel to reach office. It is alleged that he was usually late, often reaching the court past 1pm.         
	Once in the Garbeta court, he allegedly heard even cases beyond his jurisdiction.        
	Ghosh was suspended last Friday and charged with breaking norms of the judicial services. The West Midnapore district judges office today handed over the suspension letter to him.         
	High court sources could not recall another suspension of a judge on similar grounds in three decades.        
	An administrative committee headed by Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and consisting of four other senior-most judges of the high court took the decision in the wake of a 60-page complaint by district judge Ganesh Sarkar.        
	Suspending Ghosh, the chief justice said: This is an unprecedented event. The decency, decorum and prestige of the judiciary are at stake.        
	Sarkar, in his complaint, had said: He comes to Garbeta court from his house in Bandel, in Hooghly district, and reaches after 1pm.        
	In the morning, he takes his bath in the court bathroom and hang out his underclothes to dry just outside the courtroom.        
	Ghosh, civil judge of Garbeta court, about 185km from Calcutta was also accused of hearing cases he shouldnt have. The judge, who is an ex-serviceman, did not pay any heed to my requests (not to hear cases beyond his jurisdiction), the district judge complained.        
	The judge even heard a case that had the jurisdiction of a civil court in Calcutta and passed an order. Such activity creates complications but the judge concerned is not ready to accept it, the complaint said.        
	The Garbeta court bar association had also lodged a complaint with the high court administration.         
	Last Thursday, when representatives of the state bar council met the chief justice along with members of the Garbeta court bar association, he (the chief justice) said Ghosh should be suspended immediately, said Saradindu Biswas, an executive member of the state bar council.        
	A fact-finding committee will now inquire into the charges against Ghosh. His service can be terminated on the basis of its report, a legal expert said in Calcutta.        
	Ghosh could not be reached for comment.        
	Suspension of a judge in Bengal is rare. Some 30 years ago, the bar association of Alipore court had accused a judge of flouting court discipline. The judge, however, had sent his resignation to then Calcutta High Court Chief Justice Shankar Prasad Mitra.        
	Justice Nijjar told the members of the state bar council: It is unfortunate that some subordinate court judges are violating judicial norms. According to Supreme Court guidelines, judges are supposed to deliver judgments within six months of completion of hearings. But some judges are not following the guidelines.

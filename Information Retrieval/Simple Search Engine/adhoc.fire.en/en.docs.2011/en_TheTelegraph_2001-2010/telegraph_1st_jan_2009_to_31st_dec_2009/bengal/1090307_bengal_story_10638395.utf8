The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Minority ache for CPM
                                                                                                               Minority ache for CPM
          BISWAJIT ROY                              
	Calcutta, March 6: The CPM has officially played down the exit of sitting MP Abu Ayesh Mondol as a positive factor but party leaders admitted in private that he would be a handy tool for Mamata Banerjee who has been trying to win back the support of the minority community.        
	The CPM is alarmed over Mamatas efforts to harvest the perceived discontent among the community, which accounts for nearly 27 per cent of the voters in the state, by opening the Trinamul Congresss door to Mondol. Mamata has assigned Mondol the task of campaigning against the CPM in districts with a considerable minority presence.        
	Lack of community development among Muslims and Scheduled Castes and Tribes is a charge the CPM will find difficult to tackle.         
	There will be no negative but positive impact of his desertion on our poll prospects. He had committed a heinous crime by maintaining secret liaison with Trinamul over the past two years, state CPM chief Biman Bose said today.        
	The CPM has held preliminary discussions on the strategies on the community-specific campaigns.        
	We will address the post-Sachar committee grievances of minorities in Bengal and campaign focusing on what the Left government did for them and what we will do in future, a leader said.         
	Basu worry        
	Jyoti Basu today again expressed his worry about the possibility of reduction in the Lefts numbers in this Lok Sabha polls. But he did not speak about it outside the state secretariat meeting, apparently after the party brass urged him not to take any questions from the media.

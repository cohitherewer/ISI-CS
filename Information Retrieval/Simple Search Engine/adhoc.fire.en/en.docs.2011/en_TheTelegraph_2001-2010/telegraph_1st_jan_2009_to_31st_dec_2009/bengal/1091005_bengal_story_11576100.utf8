The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Greedy friend betrayed us: Mamata
                                                                                                               Greedy friend betrayed us: Mamata
          OUR BUREAU                           Mamata Banerjee in Siliguri on Sunday. Picture by Kundan Yolmo                                  
	Oct. 4: Her friend, the Congress, has become greedy, Mamata Banerjee told Siliguri today, apologising to its people for not being able to run the civic board.         
	Amar bandhura lobhi hoye giyechhilo. Kintu er janya amay dosh deben na. Anya daler baparey ami kichu bolbo na (My friends had become greedy. Do not blame me for that. I cannot speak about matters in other parties).         
	Then, hands folded, she said: I came here to apologise to the people of Siliguri as they gave us a favourable mandate to run the civic board. But we could not live up to this because of our friends betrayal. Her councillors too stood behind her, hands folded.         
	On October 1, the Congress won the posts of the Siliguri mayor and chairperson with the Lefts support, though the party had fought the popular election as Trinamuls ally.         
	But after the election neither party was ready to give up its claim to the mayors chair.        
	Mamata did not name the Congress at all during her 25-minute speech today at Bagha Jatin Park in Siliguri. They (the Congress) became greedy and used it (the mandate) for their own interests, she said.        
	She said the Congresss decision to approach the Left for support was taken at the national level, not local. It (the decision to form the civic board with Left support) is not local, but national...  she said.        
	Her accusation, directed at state Congress chief Pranab Mukherjee and general secretary K. Keshava Rao, has been proved true as MP Deepa Das Munshi had said on October 1 that she had spoken to Mukherjee and Rao, the in-charge in Bengal, before the party wrote to the Left for support.        
	Mamata mentioned the letter, which was also sent to Trinamul, and said: There is a difference of hell and heaven between writing to Trinamul and to the Left. We are an ally, the CPM is our enemy number one.         
	She reminded the Congress that Trinamul had backed the UPA government at the national level to keep its commitment to the country. But in the state, as we are Bengal-oriented, they (the Congress) need us. We are not ready to do politics at the cost of our self-esteem and prestige.        
	New express        
	Mamata today flagged off the Sealdah-New Jalpaiguri Padatik Express from New Jalpaiguri. It will leave New Jalpaiguri on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays at 9pm and from Sealdah at 10.55pm on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.

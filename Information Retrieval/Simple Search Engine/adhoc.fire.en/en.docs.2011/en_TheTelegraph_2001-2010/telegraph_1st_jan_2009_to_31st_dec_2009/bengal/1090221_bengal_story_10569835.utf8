The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Paswan push to Nayachar
                                                                                                               Paswan push to Nayachar
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 20: The Union cabinet is likely to clear the Nayachar project next week, but only about a fifth of the 250sqkm chemical hub will be located on the island.         
	The rest will be carved out of the existing industrial zone on mainland Haldia.        
	Chemicals and fertilisers minister Ram Vilas Paswan has sent a note to the cabinet asking it to clear the hub along with earlier notes seeking similar clearances for hubs in Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat.        
	The Lok Janshakti Party leader, who has always maintained good relations with Left leaders, is believed to be keen on a tie-up with them in Bihar and Jharkhand, where the CPM and the CPI have significant pockets of influence.         
	His ministry has worked overtime to push the Bengal proposal, which was finalised earlier this month. The Andhra and Gujarat proposals had been finalised months before.         
	Paswans note says a mere 49sqkm of the hub will come from Nayachar and the rest from Haldia, much of which has already been acquired by the Bengal government or by key tenants in the hub.         
	Although a small portion of the hub will be on the char or new land that has come up because of silting of the river mouth, the project may face problems when it comes up for environmental clearance.         
	The island is within the coastal area, where industry is not normally allowed.         
	The 60-year-old island is also believed to be too young geologically and some say a proposed bridge to link it with the mainland and other infrastructure could be in danger in case of quakes.         
	Around Rs 12,872 crore has already been invested in Haldia. The state government, in collaboration with private investors, will be investing another Rs 16,000 crore in infrastructure. The Centre will put in around Rs 2,100 crore.        
	Officials said Indian Oil and Cals Refinery would be the anchor investors, pumping in Rs 15,000 crore and Rs 10,000 crore respectively. The hub is slated to bring in a total investment of Rs 90,000 crore.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Campus plan snag
                                                                                                               Campus plan snag
                            
	Calcutta, Oct. 24: Work on the Murshidabad campus of Aligarh Muslim University has run into a technical hitch.        
	At an event held by the university old boys association in Calcutta, Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said there were some legal issues about the land but he expected them to be solved soon.        
	Mukherjee had sanctioned Rs 25 crore for the campus in his budget. He said a 264-ac- re plot already with the Uni- on water resource department near Farakka had been identified and I was under the impression that it could be handed over to the HRD department directly. But the transfer needs to be done through the state because it had given the land to the water department.

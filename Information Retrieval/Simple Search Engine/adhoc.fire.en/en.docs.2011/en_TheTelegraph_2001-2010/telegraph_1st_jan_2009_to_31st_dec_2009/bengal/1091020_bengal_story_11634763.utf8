	Krishnagar, Oct. 19: Kali Puja organisers in Nadias Chakdah ransacked a store, roughed up the owners elderly mother and cleaned out the cash box after they were refused a Rs 5,000 subscription.        
	The owner of the cloth store, China Barik, said the youths from the local club had sought the money from her on Thursday. They had turned up at our shop on Friday and Saturday as well. We told them we had to give money for half a dozen Kali Pujas and would not be able to give them over Rs 300, said China, in her 40s.        
	Around 10 last night, Chinas younger brother Subhas was in the shop with his 72-year-old mother Sarama when 15 men stormed in. They picked up the chairs and smashed the showcases and a music system, said Subhas.         
	My mother was sitting in a corner. They threatened to kill us if we did not give the money. Suddenly, one of them went for the cash box and took away the Rs 12,000 in it, Subhas added.        
	Hearing him scream for help, other shopkeepers came and the miscreants fled. Before running away, they slapped my brother and pushed ma to the ground, said China.        
	Nadia additional superintendent of police Annappa E. said a search was on for the accused.

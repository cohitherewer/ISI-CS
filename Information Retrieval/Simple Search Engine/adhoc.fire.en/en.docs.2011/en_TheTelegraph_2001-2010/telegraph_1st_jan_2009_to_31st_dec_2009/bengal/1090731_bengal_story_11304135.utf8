	New Delhi, July 30: Union home minister P. Chidambaram today said many districts of Bengal had become killing fields while giving a clean chit to Trinamul Congress ministers who visited Lalgarh.        
	Many districts of Bengal have become killing fields. This has to stop, P. Chidambaram said after a meeting with Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjee and fin-ance minister Pranab Mukherjee.        
	Mamata is believed to have demanded a halt to the security operation in Lalgarh and withdrawal of central forces from there. Chidambaram, however, said that unless the state government said so, the forces would not be moved.        
	On July 28, Trinamul central ministers and Partha Chatterjee, leader of Opposition in the Assembly, had visited Lalgarh. Chidambaram said political leaders were not allowed to visit Lalgarh earlier because of the joint operation, but one could not prevent them from going there after six weeks.         
	The home minister said Trinamul had briefed him about the very repressive action against its workers.         
	The Congress, too, has suffered at the hands of suspected CPM supporters. Nine Congress MLAs were chased through slushy paddy fields by stone-throwing CPM supporters in Burdwans Mangalkot recently.         
	I will talk to the Bengal government. We are concerned.... These killings should stop, Chidambaram said.        
	In the Lok Sabha today, Trinamul MPs demanded central intervention to stop the killing of party workers.        
	Led by chief whip Sudip Bandopadhyay, the MPs stormed the well of the House, blaming the state government for yesterdays murder of three partymen in Burdwan.

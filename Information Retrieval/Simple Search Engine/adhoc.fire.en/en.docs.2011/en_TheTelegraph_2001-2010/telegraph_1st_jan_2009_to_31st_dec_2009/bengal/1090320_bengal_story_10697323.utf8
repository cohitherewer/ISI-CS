	Calcutta, March 19: Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee will meet state Congress president Pranab Mukherjee on Saturday here to discuss a joint campaign strategy.        
	I might call on Pranabda on Saturday night to discuss how to go ahead on a joint campaign with state Congress leaders for the Lok Sabha polls. After stitching an alliance with the Congress, we are ready for a joint campaign, Mamata said this afternoon.        
	State Congress working president Pradip Bhattacharya, who is in Delhi, said over the phone that he would meet AICC leaders to finalise the list of campaigners for Bengal.         
	He said Congress president Sonia Gandhi and her son, MP Rahul Gandhi, may visit the state early next month for a joint campaign with Mamata and other Trinamul leaders.        
	Congress sources said Sonia and Rahul would address two rallies in the state, one of which would be in Calcutta.        
	State Congress sources said the joint campaign was necessary to send the message to grassroots workers on both sides so that they too start similar ones.        
	The state Congress has begun forming co-ordination committees in all districts involving leaders from both the Congress and Trinamul following an AICC directive.

	Late on Thursday night, the Congress in Delhi named Abdul Mannan Hossain as the candidate for Murshidabad. The sitting MP is said to have the support of the rank and file but is not liked by district Congress chief Adhir Choudhury.

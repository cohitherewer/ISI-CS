The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Rain pain ahead of tide fury
                                                                                                               Rain pain ahead of tide fury
          IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                              
	Sonargaon, June 5: Rivers in the cyclone-ravaged Sunderbans rose by up to a feet after a heavy downpour today even as officials admitted they had no evacuation plans for the weekends high tide.        
	As the rain began around 1.30pm, Jharna Banik held her 18-day-old daughter tight and muttered a prayer in a makeshift shelter. Husband Sushanta, sitting next to her, turned to brother Prashanta: Ekhon ki hobe? (what will happen now?) Thousands across the Sunderbans echoed the question.         
	Work on the damaged embankments stopped and loudspeakers crackled to life, asking people to shift to safer places. Why dont they show us those safer places? said Sushanta, whose daughter was born a week before the cyclone struck. Prashanta, whose wife Pushpalata gave birth to their son in the shelter two days after Aila barrelled in on May 25, said tomorrow would be a bigger test. Bhora kotal aaschhe (the spring tide is coming).         
	South 24-Parganas DM Khalil Ahmed said the water levels could go up by another four feet tomorrow. At Gosaba, an official said there was no order yet on evacuation. Where will we house so many people? he said.        
	A Delhi team, arriving in Calcutta tomorrow, is likely to visit the area on Sunday.

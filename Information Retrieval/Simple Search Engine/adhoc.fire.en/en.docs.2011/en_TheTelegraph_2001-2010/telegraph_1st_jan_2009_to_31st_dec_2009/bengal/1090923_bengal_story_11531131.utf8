          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 22: Santana Das, the 86-year-old widow of a schoolteacher, today donated Rs 2,000 to the chief ministers fund for Aila victims  the amount saved from pocket money given by her sons.        
	A glowing Santana Das walked out of the chief ministers office this evening, flanked by her relatives.        
	Saving money has been a habit all my life. I have not given up this habit even at this age, said Santana Das, who lives in Harinavi in South 24-Parganas.         
	He (the chief minister) told me the amount does not matter. The chief minister appreciated my will to help the Aila victims.

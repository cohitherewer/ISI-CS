The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CID quizzes officer
                                                                                                               CID quizzes officer
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 26: The officer who had been taken hostage by Maoists told the CID today what some of his captors looked like and what he had done during his 54-hour captivity.        
	Atindranath Dutta said he had not seen his colleagues at Sankrail police station being shot dead. He came out unarmed hearing the shots and was taken hostage by a woman.        
	CID officers said they wanted a blow-by-blow account, but Dutta could only provide sketchy information as he had not witnessed the shooting and was blindfolded for most of the time in captivity.        
	Dutta said he saw Maoist leader Kishanji the night before his release, but only for a short while. Kishanji came to him late at night to say he would be released the next day, a CID officer said. But the meeting was brief and Dutta could not recollect too much of what Kishanji looked like.        
	However, based on what Dutta said, the CID is making portraits of Kishanji and the woman who led the raid on Sankrail police station.        
	Dutta narrated separately to three senior officers  inspector-general (I) P. Nirajnayan, deputy inspector-general (operations) Ajey Ranade and special superintendent (west) Ashoke Prasad  what happened between his kidnap and release.        
	The OC came to the CID headquarters in a police vehicle around 1.55pm, accompanied by his father and a friend. The questioning went on till 7.45.         
	We will analyse his inputs once we finish collecting the versions of the other policemen who witnessed the attack. Dutta will have to come again for more details of the hostage episode, said Ranade.        
	Sources said the CID would analyse whether he should have stepped out of his quarters unarmed after hearing the shots. Asked why he did not try to find out from his colleagues over the phone what was happening outside, Dutta said: It was a reflex action. I just opened the door.         
	The OC said his hands and legs used to be tied during captivity. They released me for lunch and dinner and when I wanted to relieve myself.

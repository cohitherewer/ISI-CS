The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Thai sups with Trinamul, not govt
                                                                                                               Thai sups with Trinamul, not govt
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 17: A visiting Thai official who ranks equal to the deputy Prime Minister today met the leader of the Opposition in the Assembly, but not any Bengal government representative.        
	Kiat Sittheeamorn, president of the Thailand Trade Representative, met Trinamul Congress leader Partha Chatterjee in the morning, participated with local industrialists in a session organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry and left for Bangkok in the evening.         
	In between, he paid a visit to Raj Bhavan to meet governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi.        
	The official said he intended to meet chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee but he was not available.        
	The chief minister is down with fever. In Bhattacharjees absence, Sittheeamorn did not meet anyone else from the state cabinet.        
	I dont think we (could have) managed any other appointment because my visit was very short, he said.        
	We are not picking sides, Sittheeamorn added, making it clear he was aware of the political ramifications of his meeting with Chatterjee.        
	The Thai consul-general, too, tried to explain why they did not try to meet anyone in the government other than the chief minister. The visit had been planned in a week, Manop Mekprayoonthong said.        
	It is a diplomatic tradition for foreign envoys or politicians to meet the leader of the Opposition when in Delhi. But there was no parallel to it in Bengal until today.         
	The stability of the Left Front government may have been a reason for the guests not calling on Opposition leaders in the state but Trinamuls landslide victory in the last parliamentary polls appears to have changed the perception.        
	Sittheeamorn sought Chatterjees support for Thai companies in Calcutta. Chatterjee said he wants more Thai companies to work here, Sittheeamorn said.        
	Thai construction giant ITD is executing the Calcutta airport modernisation programme. Another company, CP Group, is engaged in a shrimp and fish project.

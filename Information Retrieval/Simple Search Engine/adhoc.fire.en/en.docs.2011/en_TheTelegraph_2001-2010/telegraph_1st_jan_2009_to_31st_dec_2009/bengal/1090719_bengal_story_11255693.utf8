The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Basu ICU at home
                                                                                                               Basu ICU at home
          SANJAY MANDAL                                      
	Calcutta, July 18: Jyoti Basus bedroom will be converted into a virtual intensive care unit with life-saving equipment to ensure the 95-year-old CPM leader does not face a crisis like last Sundays when he twice fell unconscious.        
	Doctors at AMRI Hospitals, Salt Lake, today said Basu could be released on Monday if his health remains stable.         
	He slept well last night and has taken his food adequately. The sodium and potassium levels are within normal limits. Basu is slowly being mobilised out of bed and is likely to be released on Monday after a final review by all members of the medical board, said T.S. Kuckrejja, executive vice-president, AMRI, Salt Lake.         
	Basu was put on a wheelchair today for the first time since being admitted. The medical board has suggested that before shifting Basu to his Salt Lake residence, we should arrange a medical set-up there, a senior AMRI official told The Telegraph.         
	The unit at Indira Bhavan will have a cardiac monitor, pulse oximeter, defibrillator, Ambu bag, oxygen cylinders and a suction machine (see chart) as well as emergency drugs.         
	Doctors and trained nurses will man the unit round the clock.         
	On July 12, Basu became unconscious twice while brushing his teeth in the bathroom. The attending nurse, Madhabi Biswas, could not find his pulse or record his blood pressure and provided cardiac massage to revive him.        
	Madhabi will be part of the new unit following a request from Basu.        
	CPM state secretary Biman Bose has conveyed to AMRI that the party would pay for the equipment.         
	Bimanbabu wanted AMRI to facilitate the procurement of these equipment, a hospital official said.         
	Sources said it would cost around Rs 5 lakh to set up the unit. According to them, standby equipment would be provided by tomorrow and these would be replaced once the new equipment are procured.

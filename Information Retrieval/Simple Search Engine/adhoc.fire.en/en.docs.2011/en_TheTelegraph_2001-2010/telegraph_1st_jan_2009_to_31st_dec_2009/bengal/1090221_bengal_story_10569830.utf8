The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Mamata praise pinch to Pranab 
                                                                                                               Mamata praise pinch to Pranab 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 20: Mamata Banerjee today said Pranab Mukherjee should stop praising the CPM before she goes into talks with the Congress over a proposed alliance.         
	I am ready for talks with the Congress, but Pranab- da should stop praising the CPM all the time, she told reporters at her home.         
	The Trinamul Congress chief said it was wrong to launch the East-West Metro project in Calcutta before the elections. Why are they (the Centre) in a hurry? Elections are round the corner. It is unfair to unveil projects at this juncture. I appeal to Pranabda not to share the dais with the chief minister for the project launch on Sunday.        
	Mukherjee had earlier praised the states health sector and, without naming Mamata, hit out at Opposition leaders who resisted industrial and development projects.        
	Mamata called up Mukherjee, also the state Congress president, later in the evening to say she did not intend to disrespect him.

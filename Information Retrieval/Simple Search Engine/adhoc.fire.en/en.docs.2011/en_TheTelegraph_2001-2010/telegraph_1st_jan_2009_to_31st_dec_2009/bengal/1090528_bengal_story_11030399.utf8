          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, May 27: Floodwaters receded from many south Bengal villages today but people in several pockets of the two 24-Parganas were still marooned and without relief.        
	The chief minister reviewed the situation and said many villagers were in distress in South 24-Parganas Pathar Pratima and North 24-Parganas Sandeshkhali.        
	Officials said hundreds were also marooned in Kultali, Basanti and Gosaba in South.         
	Finance minister Asim Dasgupta put the toll across the state at 78. Six lakh houses have been damaged. The administration has been told to clean all drinking water sources, he added. The cabinet will meet tomorrow to discuss ways to deal with such an emergency in the future.        
	Broken embankments could again flood hundreds of villages during the next high tide (kotal), expected in a week.         
	Irrigation minister Subhas Naskar said 400km of embankments had been damaged and it would take around Rs 110 crore to repair them.        
	Doctors strike        
	Junior doctors at Burdwan Medical College and Hospital stopped work this evening after police detained one of their colleagues for allegedly assaulting relatives of a patient.         
	The relatives had accused the doctors of negligence after the patient, electrocuted by a wire snapped by Aila, died.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 25: Nobel laureate Amartya Sen today appreciated the Bengal governments efforts in child development but said it needed to do more.        
	A good deal has been achieved but more can be done. There are states which have done better, Sen said.        
	He was speaking after re-leasing The Pratichi Child Report, a study on the progress of the Centres Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) in Bengal. Launched in 1975, ICDS tries to combat under-nourishment among children under six.         
	The study, which covered six districts  Jalpaiguri, South Dinajpur, Murshidabad, Bankura, Burdwan and South 24 Parganas  says peoples involvement and expectations from the scheme are rising. The success of the mid-day meal programme in primary schools has had a positive effect on ICDS, it adds.        
	The report says mothers are keen to ensure pre-school education and nutrition for their children at anganwadi centres, through which the ICDS benefits are provided.         
	The food provided under ICDS forms an important part of the childrens daily intake, it says.         
	The report turns the spotlight on the problems, one of which is poor infrastructure in the anganwadi centres. The heavy workload on anganwadi workers is a concern, as also their lack of training and supervision, it says.

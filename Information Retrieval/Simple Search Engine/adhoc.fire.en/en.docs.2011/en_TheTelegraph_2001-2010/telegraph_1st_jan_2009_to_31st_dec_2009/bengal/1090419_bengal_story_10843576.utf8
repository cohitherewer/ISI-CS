The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Lalgarh relents, with a rider 
                                                                                                               Lalgarh relents, with a rider 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT      
	Lalgarh/Calcutta, April 18: The tribal leadership in Lalgarh has said it would allow police in for 12 hours on election day only if the government gives its demands a sympathetic hearing.        
	Polling in Lalgarh is scheduled on April 30. The Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities wants a meeting with the government and the Election Commission before that.         
	After the nearly three-hour meeting, committee leader Chhatradhar Mahato said: I know it may not be possible for the government to do much before the polls but at the meeting they should sympathetically consider our demands. We have written to chief electoral officer Debashis Sen.        
	He said the people of Lalgarh wanted to vote. But they have a few conditions which the government will have to accept. Policemen will have to leave the booths with the polling personnel after voting. They will not be allowed to patrol the villages. Our police boycott will continue from the day after the polls.        
	The tribal committee had said it would not allow the police to enter the area in West Midnapore  a demand, the government suspects, is fanned by Maoists.        
	The tribal committee wants an apology from the West Midnapore superintendent of police for the forces excesses last November and removal of police camps in areas near Lalgarh. The tribals also want the government to pay Rs 6 lakh each to the families of six committee members who were recently found dead and a government job for a member of each of the families.         
	They also want a Rs 3-lakh compensation for Chhitamoni Murmu, a woman who a policeman allegedly hit with a rifle butt during raids after the Maoist blast on the chief ministers convoy route last November.         
	 Sources said the meeting today stretched to three hours because of a debate between hardliners who do not want police presence during the polls and those who want the force, but for only a few hours.        
	Last Sunday, the poll panel had suggested sending central forces to Lalgarh.        
	In Calcutta, chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti said he was willing to discuss the tribals grievances but ruled out removing the police camps. That is not possible, he said.        
	Chief electoral officer Sen said from Delhi: It is a delicate situation. I will comment after the tribal leadership gets in touch with me either over phone or through a letter.

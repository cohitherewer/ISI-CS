The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Cry for early polls in state
                                                                                                               Cry for early polls in state
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, May 18: Mamata Banerjee today said would make all efforts to bring forward the Assembly polls in the state, scheduled for 2011.        
	The CPM has lost its moral right to continue in power after being routed in the Lok Sabha elections. People have no faith in this government. The Assembly polls should be advanced taking into account the peoples mandate. I shall talk to others in Delhi to get their opinion on bringing the Assembly polls forward, she told STAR Ananda tonight.        
	When she goes to Delhi, Mamata said, she will produce evidence to prove the corruption and inefficiency of the Left government to convince the Congress to bring the state elections forward. We know we should strike the iron when it is hot.         
	We shall see if funds have been misutilised in Bengal. If they havent been able to govern the state properly for 32 years, why should they stay on? The CPM has lost the right to rule.        
	She said Trinamul should come to power in the state as soon as possible because if the party was in power both at the Centre and the state, there would be a flood of development activity in Bengal. I have a lot of plans for the states development. But before that we want to see a new government in power in Bengal, for development cannot wait, she added.         
	Mamata said shed tell Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh that whatever ministry she takes, she should be allowed to spend a lot of time in the state.

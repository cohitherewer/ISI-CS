   Mamata steps up pressure on Cong
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Mamata Banerjee                                        
	Calcutta, Jan. 22: Mamata Banerjee today said her party could take on the CPM on its own if a poll alliance was not worked out with like-minded parties, piling pressure on the Congress without mentioning its name.        
	People are in favour of an alliance of like-minded anti-CPM forces in Bengal to avert a split in the Opposition vote bank. But there have been so far no talks on this score. Against this backdrop, I shall be left with no other option but to fight the ruling CPM independently, the Trinamul Congress chief said this afternoon.        
	Mamata was talking to reporters at her Kalighat residence where former Malda zilla parishad sabhadhipati Goutam Chakraborty and some other leaders from the Congress in north Bengal joined her party.        
	Trinamul leaders said Mamata wanted to send a message to the Congress leadership to begin the process of talks for the electoral alliance at the earliest.        
	For the past three days, Mamata has been insisting on a poll alliance with the Congress so that Opposition votes are consolidated. However, getting no response, Mamata is virtually issuing a threat to the Congress to begin talks for a poll alliance, a Trinamul leader said.        
	The state Congress has convened an extended meeting of its executive committee on February 7. The Trinamul issue is expected to figure at the meeting, though the final decision will be taken by the high command. The Congresss outgoing working president, Pradip Bhattacharya, said foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee and AICC general secretary Mohsina Kidwai would be present at the meeting.        
	We shall discuss seat adjustment with Mamatas Trinamul Congress in the presence of two senior AICC leaders, Bhattacharya added.

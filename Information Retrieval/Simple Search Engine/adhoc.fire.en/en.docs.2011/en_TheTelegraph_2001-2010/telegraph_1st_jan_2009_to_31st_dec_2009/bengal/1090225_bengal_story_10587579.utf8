	Durgapur, Feb. 24: Two engineering students got stuck in the bed of an irrigation canal and drowned during a morning dip with friends.        
	Eight students of Bengal College of Engineering and Technology had gone to the canal, about 30km from their co-llege in Durgapur town, for a picnic to celebrate the belated birthday of Anuj Kumar.         
	Anuj, 22, a final-year BTech student, was one of those killed. Rajib Ranjan, 22, his batchmate, was the other victim.         
	Two boys managed to wriggle out of the mud and run to safety. They raised the alarm.        
	Local fishermen pulled out the bodies of Anuj and Rajib, both residents of Patna.

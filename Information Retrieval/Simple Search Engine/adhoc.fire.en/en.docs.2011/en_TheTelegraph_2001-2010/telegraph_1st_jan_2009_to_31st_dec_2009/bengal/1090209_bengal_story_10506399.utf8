	Papuri, Feb. 8: Police had been warned about a possible bloodbath at Papuri village, a government officer said, a day after six people were killed.        
	The cops allegedly did little on the administrations alert on stockpiling of arms and ammunition following a complaint by the chief of the CPM-led Charkolgram gram panchayat a fortnight ago.         
	We had held at least three meetings in which I told the police to take action to prevent any untoward incident, said Bolpur subdivisional officer Sunil Ranjan Shikdar.        
	Panchayat pradhan Kakali Debangshi was provided a police escort for a week after she told the block development officer that she feared an attack on her. Nothing was done to secure the village, where hundreds of CPM supporters had been rendered homeless during the 10 years the Trinamul Congress ruled the panchayat.        
	The CPM wrested the village body last May but failed to ensure its supporters return to Papuri, which remained a Trinamul stronghold. Yesterday, the CPM tried a Nandigram-style recapture of the village, about 250km from Calcutta, triggering clashes.        
	Trinamul leaders had tipped the police off about CPM supporters trying to take control of the village with the help of musclemen, said Birbhum district party president Anubrata Mondal.         
	Villagers who do not owe allegiance to any party had also sniffed trouble. Hafeeza Bibi, in whose house CPM supporters Lalbabu Sheikh and Rashed Sheikh were burnt to death, said: We had seen CPM supporters and outsiders near our village a few days ago.         
	Birbhum police chief L.N. Meena refused to comment on the allegations of inaction. He said: We had conducted raids in the village but didnt find any outsider or arms.         
	However, he couldnt recall whether there have been raids in the past fortnight.        
	Many fled the village today with their essentials fearing more clashes. No policeman was in sight in the deserted village till late this afternoon.        
	There is no police since 5pm yesterday. We are scared, said Aslama Bibi, 45, whose husband Swadi and mother-in-law Hafisa, 70, are ill.         
	Rashed Sheikhs widow Koli lodged an FIR at Nanoor police station today, accusing Trinamul supporters of murder. Trinamul worker Sheikh Siraj gave a statement to the police before his death yesterday, saying CPM supporters had hurled bombs at him.        
	Police raids in the village this evening yielded a couple of dozen bombs.

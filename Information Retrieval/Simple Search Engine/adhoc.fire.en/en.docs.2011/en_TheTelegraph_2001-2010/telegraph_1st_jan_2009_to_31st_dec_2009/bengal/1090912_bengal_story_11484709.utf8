The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Halt, cries govt to fleeing ministers
                                                                                                               Halt, cries govt to fleeing ministers
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 11: The government today made it clear that its ministers were not expected to run away from flood-hit areas even if they had to face angry villagers.        
	Yesterday, relief minister Mortaza Hossain and civil defence minister Srikumar Mukherjee had left a Hooghly village in 15 minutes after being confronted by people complaining about lack of aid.        
	Asked to explain the duos reaction to peoples grievances, finance minister Asim Dasgupta justified the villagers anger. They had a point. They were not getting relief properly. Floodwaters had moved into their homes, forcing them to stay in camps. Having found ministers in their area, the villagers showed their anger.         
	Then came the message to ministers: I assert that our ministers will go to the flood-hit areas even if they are booed or shooed away.        
	Dasgupta, the senior minister who holds flood-related briefings for the government, may have put up a brave face today but yesterdays incident is a reflection of poor governance and the CPMs alienation from the people, according to some.        
	If relief distribution is proper, why would villagers rush towards a minister who has come to oversee the arrangements? Its clear that the distribution was handled shoddily, an official said.         
	The charges had been the same after cyclone Aila struck in May. The CPM MLA from Hingalganj in North 24-Parganas was dragged into muck and manhandled by villagers who held him responsible for the lack of relief. In South 24-Parganas, the chief minister had to hear unsavoury remarks about his government.         
	The scooting by the ministers at the first hint of trouble yesterday suggests the CPM is no longer in touch with the masses, said a political observer.        
	Various party forums have cited this alienation as the cause of the recent electoral routs.         
	Asked about the finance ministers assertion that ministers will have to face the music during times of peoples distress, a senior CPM leader suggested there was no alternative. Our leadership scrutinised our performances and concluded that one reason for the debacle was our partys drift away from the people. So, in order to win back the confidence of the people, we have to keep visiting them, even if we face protests, the party state committee member said.        
	Deulpara village in Hooghly, where the ministers faced the flak, had been under chest-deep water for three days. A helicopter came with relief (before the ministers arrival yesterday) but the food packets were dropped in the water, said a villager.        
	Mukherjee, the civil defence minister, today parroted the party line without explaining why he had fled yesterday. We cannot ignore their complaints we should keep touring the affected areas, he said.        
	The flood situation improved today and the water levels receded. There hasnt been fresh rainfall. So we have decided not to airdrop but to physically hand over food packets to the victims, Dasgupta said.

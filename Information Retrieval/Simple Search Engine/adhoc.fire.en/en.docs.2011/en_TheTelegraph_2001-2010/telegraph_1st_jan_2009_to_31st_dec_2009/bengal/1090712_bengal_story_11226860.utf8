          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, July 11: Around 70 students of the Jadavpur Universitys womens hostel gheraoed their superintendent since Friday evening alleging she was not allowing freshers to choose their rooms.        
	The girls disbanded after superintendent Aparna Kar Chowdhury said the dean and registrar would look into the matter. Hostel girls said freshers earlier had the freedom to choose their rooms according to their preference and room availability. But the superintendent is not allowing this though 40 per cent of the rooms are vacant a postgraduate student said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | All political roads lead to Mangalkot
                                                                                                               All political roads lead to Mangalkot
  - Mamata to visit spot on August 11
          OUR BUREAU                                            
	Aug. 9: Subhendu Adhikari dropped in yesterday, Subrata Mukherjee did the rounds today, Mamata Banerjee will come calling on Tuesday and the Congress would like Pranab Mukherjee to pay a visit at his convenience.        
	Mangalkot is the latest pilgrimage spot for Bengals political leaders.        
	The rural stretch in Burdwan became a hot button on the political map around mid-June when a CPM leader was killed, allegedly by Trinamul Congress activists. Since then, the area, where the Lefts grip seems to be slipping, has seen repeated clashes.        
	Trinamul chief Mamata announced her plan to visit the trouble zone yesterday after her supporters were lathi-charged by police near Mangalkot, where Section 144 is in force.        
	As if to match Trinamul, the state Congress began lobbying Delhi to send either Bengal Congress president Pranab Mukherjee or any other AICC heavyweight to the area.        
	I have already briefed Pranabda about todays peaceful programme in Mangalkot and requested him to visit the area at a time convenient for him. We are also expecting senior AICC leaders to visit Mangalkot, said state Congress working president Subrata Mukherjee, who visited Mangalkot today with MP Deepa Das Munshi and 18 other leaders.        
	The 20 Congress leaders went to Dhanyarukhi village, from where a team of Congress MLAs was chased out on July 15 by CPM supporters. The chase and the successful state-wide bandh the Congress enforced on July 17 brought the party out of Trinamuls shadow.        
	Unlike July 15, the villagers did not put up any resistance today.        
	Opposition parties are not the only ones making a beeline for the Burdwan block. A Left Front delegation also visited Mangalkot on July 24.        
	The political traffic to Mangalkot picked up from June 18, three days after CPM leader Falguni Mukherjees murder.         
	Trinamul MP Sudip Bandyopadhyay and party MLA Madan Mitra were the first to get blocked when they tried to reach Mangalkot. They were stopped on the way by police.        
	On June 23, leader of the Opposition and Trinamul MLA Partha Chatterjee was gheraoed by CPM activists for over six hours when he tried to reach the area to meet supporters. Mamata called up Pranab Mukherjee who assured Chatterjee he would raise the issue at the Centre.        
	Villagers said they were fed up with the visits the political leaders were making almost daily. They come, make promises of hefty compensation and leave. They forget everything after reaching Calcutta, said Sabita Ghosh of Dhanyarukhi village. Are we animals in a zoo? Why do they come here daily to see us?         
	Kartick Paul, 42, a sharecropper, said: Whenever political leaders come here, policemen accompany them. We felt confident after the leaders assured us that the police would patrol the area. But they were nowhere to be seen afterwards.

	Feb. 5: The Forward Bloc today took out processions and held a meeting in front of the subdivisional office in Dinhata on the first anniversary of police firing that killed five party supporters.        
	Although the meeting was slated for noon, the Cooch Behar-Dinhata road was blocked from the morning when the Bloc supporters began setting up a dais on a truck on the middle of the road. Tarpaulin sheets and gunny bags were spread out on half-a-km stretch of the busy road for the people to listen to their leaders.        
	Later, Bloc secretary of Cooch Behar Udayan Guha announced that every year the day would be observed with a similar meeting. There is no question of taking the permission of the administration for the rally and meeting. The district collectorate is embezzling funds from the central governments employment guarantee scheme. That was why we had held a rally on this day last year when five of our members laid down their lives in the firing, Guha said. He said the government had not so far explained the reason behind the firing. There was a conspiracy to make our party weak. But we have answered it in the panchayat polls.         
	In Calcutta, partys state secretary Asoke Ghosh today said anti-government agitation in different parts of the state should not be dealt as law and order problems.        
	Paying homage to the firing victims, he said thousands of Bloc supporters had courted arrest in Dinhata during former chief minister Jyoti Basus tenure. But it did not invite police firing at that time, Ghosh said in an oblique criticism to the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees rule. It seems that the government has learnt a lesson from Dinhata and decided to keep the police restrained in Singur, Lalgarh and in Darjeeling.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Jaswant back in hills
                                                                                                               Jaswant back in hills
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Siliguri, May 21: Jaswant Singh, the newly elected Darjeeling MP, landed in Bagdogra today, ending speculation sparked by the CPM that the BJP leader would not return to the hills.        
	After disembarking from a chartered plane, Singh (picture left) said he would continue to strive for the formation of Gorkhaland  the BJPs stand that made him the Gorkha Janmukti Morchas candidate of choice.         
	Standing with his family, Singh said: I feel like returning home after several days. It is nice to be among the people of the Darjeeling hills again.         
	When the results were announced on May 16, Singh was not in Darjeeling, giving the CPM an opportunity to question the BJP leaders sincerity about Gorkhaland.         
	We doubt how successful Singh will be in achieving Gorkhaland. He has not even collected his winners certificate from the district magistrate. He will not return to the hills at all, urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya had said.

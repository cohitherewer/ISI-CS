The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Rebels return to secured stretch
                                                                                                               Rebels return to secured stretch

	Kantapahari, June 29: Early this morning, while police were marching towards Kantapahari both from Ramgarh and Lalgarh, Maoists struck along a 15km stretch from Pirakata to Goaltore, blocking it at eight places with tree trunks.        
	The police said it was the handiwork of Maoists hiding in the forest along the metalled road that had been cleared about 10 days ago.        
	A lot more work needs to be done to fully secure the area, said S.N. Gupta, DIG (operations), CID, who led the march from Goaltore that ended here today.        
	The police have identified four stretches that need to be fully secured within the next few days  Pirakata to Goaltore (15km), Lalgarh to Dherua (18km), Binpur to Belatikri (6km) and Lachhipur to Belatikri (10km).        
	Gupta said a meeting would be held tomorrow to figure out how many personnel should be sent to each of these places and where to set up camps.        
	Clearing the Pirakata-Goaltore stretch is a challenge for us, Gupta said. Whenever we give them chase, they flee into the adjoining Jhitka forest. But the job has to be done.        
	On the Lalgarh-Dherua stretch, which has been dug up at six places and blocked with tree trunks at many more, the most important task would be to restore law and order at Dharampur, where CPM leader Anuj Pandeys house was demolished and the CPM office torched on June 15. Dharampur is about 7km from Lalgarh.        
	The village is deserted. So our first task would be to instil confidence in the people and ensure they return home, said an officer.        
	It wouldnt be easy because many villagers have fled to their relatives in other districts.        
	The Binpur-Belatikri stre-tch, according to IG (traffic) B.P. Tarania, who led an operation there yesterday, is a minefield. This road hasnt been dug up or blocked but the place is full of improvised explosive devices, Tarania said. We covered a 2km stretch yesterday and found five of them.        
	Last evening, the team led by Tarania returned because they wanted to touch base before nightfall. We need more bomb disposal squad members, Tarania said.        
	The last stretch, between Lachhipur and Belatikri, could be a tricky one.         
	This is a kuchcha track and the police believe the Maoists may have planted mines under the road itself, unlike in the case of the metalled roads where they are placed on the side. Last week, under the leadership of Bikash, armed Maoists had ransacked the house of CPM local committee member Chandi Karan and made a bonfire of his furniture.        
	The police said they also had information that a section of the retreating Maoists had taken shelter in the area because it provided an easier getaway to Jharkhand.

	Calcutta, March 19: Election campaigns will be extensively recorded on video to track candidates and political events in the state, the poll panel chief said today.        
	Chief election commissioner N. Gopalaswami said the recordings would be kept in the safe custody of district magistrates so that the authentic tapes could be checked in case of any controversy, like the one sparked by Varun Gandhi in Pilibhit.        
	Digital cameras would be used for tracking candidates and events. We would bring in private parties for the job and district magistrates have been asked to take necessary steps for this, Gopalaswami said.         
	The SPs and DMs have been asked to submit a vulnerability report about how people turning up to vote in certain pockets may get intimidated, he said.        
	Apart from video coverage, the commission has decided to connect all polling booths either by a landline, a mobile phone or a satellite phone directly to the Election commission control room in New Delhi so that vital information and complaints reach it directly. A dry run would be carried out to test the network before the polls.        
	He said special counters would be set up where voting machines not functioning properly would be kept.        
	Asked about paramilitary deployment, Gopalaswami only said: Almost all the parties have sought paramilitary forces in all booths. We will look into this. He did not give any numbers about deployment.        
	Mamata Banerjee, who met the poll panel team, said she had told the chief election commissioner she had no faith in the state police. I told the EC that state police are totally politicised. That is why central paramilitary forces to be present, she said after meeting Gopalaswami.

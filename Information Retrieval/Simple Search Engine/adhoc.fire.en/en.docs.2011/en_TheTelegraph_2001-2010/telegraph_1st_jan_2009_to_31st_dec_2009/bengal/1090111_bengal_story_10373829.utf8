	Calcutta, Jan. 10: Vehicle owners driving from one petrol pump to another only to be greeted by the no supply sign may be luckier tomo-rrow.        
	Many pumps in the city reported no petrol stocks this morning, a day after the oil strike was called off, but later in the evening the West Bengal Petroleum Dealers Association said no pump would run completely dry after tonight.        
	The general secretary of the petroleum dealers association said: We have made efforts to reach petrol to almost all pumps in the city by tonight so that there should be some supply everywhere. No petrol station should remain totally dry.        
	This morning, however, Tushar Kanti Sen, the president of the association, had said petrol supply at pumps would normalise on Monday. We started loading at 8pm last night and will continue loading at the depots throughout tonight and remain open on Sunday. Things should return to normal by Monday.        
	Diesel supply in the citys pumps has been restored.        
	Most of the citys 375 petrol pumps, which draw supplies from depots in Budge Budge, Maurigram, Haldia and Rajabandh, ran out of stock by Thursday night after executives of 13 oil companies called a nationwide strike on Wednesday.

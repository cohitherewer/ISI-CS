The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Maoists kill three to spread terror
                                                                                                               Maoists kill three to spread terror

	Binpur, Aug. 6: Maoists executed three Jharkhand Party (Naren) workers making them kneel and then shooting them in the head near Lalgarh in a move to spread panic among political forces and enforce domination over the area.        
	The three youths were from Binpur, where the Jharkhand Party (Naren) is said to have taken the rebels help to win in the state elections.         
	The CPM is usually the target of the Maoist bullet but the latest attack indicates that no political force will be spared by them.        
	Late last night, about 15 armed Maoists descended on Magura village in Binpur block, on the periphery of Lalgarh, and headed for a cold storage unit where three youths were watching television with a dozen others in their small party office on the premises.        
	On reaching the party office, the Maoists called out Shaktipada Murmu, Budheswar Hansda and Asim Soren.         
	Murmu, 28, was a farmer, Hansda, 25, and Soren, 24, worked in the cold storage.         
	When the trio emerged, the Maoists ringed them, then dragged them half a kilometre to Ankho village and shot them dead beside a village path.         
	The police, judging by the way they were found this morning, said the three were made to kneel down and then shot at the back of their heads.        
	When I heard the shots, I realised that the Maoists were killing someone, said villager Bireshwar Murmu.        
	The Jharkhand Party (Naren) said there was no reason for the Maoists to target the trio as they were neither police informers nor working against the Maoists.         
	Binpur MLA and Jharkhand Party (Naren) leader Chunibala Hansda said she had no clue on why the three were targeted. They were just party workers, not prominent leaders, said Hansda. Now, our party workers are planning to flee in large numbers.        
	The police said this was what the Maoists wanted.        
	When the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities was formed last November and the Maoists lent support to it, the Jharkhand Party (Naren) did not support it. Relations soured further when the rebels told the party to boycott the general elections but it put up a candidate in Jharkhand.        
	We have learnt our lesson from Nandigram where Trinamul disowned us though we were part of the movement, a Maoist leader said. We want total area domination here.

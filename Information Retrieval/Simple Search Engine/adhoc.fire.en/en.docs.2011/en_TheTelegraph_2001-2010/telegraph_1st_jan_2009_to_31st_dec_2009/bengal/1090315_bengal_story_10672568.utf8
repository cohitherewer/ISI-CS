	Calcutta, March 14: The all- iance between the Congress and the Trinamul Congress has raised hopes in both parties on the basis of their study of voting patterns from the 2004 parliamentary polls to last years panchayat elections.        
	The two were not in any sort of official alliance for the 2004 Lok Sabha, 2006 Assembly or 2008 panchayat elections.         
	In the 2008 panchayat polls, an immediate frame of refe- rence, the Left Fronts gram panchayat tally went down to 1,597 from 2,303 in 2003. The Lefts grip over panchayat samitis also loosened, the figure coming down from 265 in 2003 to 183 in 2008.        
	On the other hand, the Congress and Trinamul nearly doubled their combined gram panchayat tally, from 744 in 2003 to 1,479 in 2008. For panchayat samitis, the combined Opposition tally in 2008 was 126 against 40 in 2003.        
	The Lefts slide continued in zilla parishad seats. It lost over 100 seats while the Opposition gained almost 150.         
	Trinamul got 69 zilla parishad seats in East Midnapore and South 24-Parganas. It had five in 2003. The two districts have six Lok Sabha seats and they are all with the Left now.        
	Of the 17 districts that went to the rural polls last year, the Left suffered an erosion in its bases in Hooghly, South -24-Parganas, East Midnapore, Howrah, Nadia, North 24-Parganas, Malda, North Dinajpur, and Birbhum and to an extent in Purulia.         
	There may be some discontent in the Congress ranks over the high commands surrender to Mamata on seat sharing for the forthcoming elections, but records of the past few polls show there is reason for them to cheer, a state Congress leader said. Both parties will benefit if the alliance works out well at the grassroots, he added.        
	Political observers, however, feel one shouldnt read too much into the panchayat results as the ball game is different in the Lok Sabha polls.         
	According to Saugata Roy, Trinamul MLA and party candidate for the Dum Dum Lok Sabha seat, the alliance has been struck keeping in mind not only the 2008 rural poll results but also the 2006 Assembly elections. We didnt have an alliance with the Congress in 2006 and Trinamuls tally was 30. The Congress and the Independents it supported got 25 seats. After studying the 2006 results, we have found that had there been an Opposition alliance, there could have been an alteration in results of 70 seats besides the 55 we got, Roy said.        
	According to him, the combined figure translates into 18 Lok Sabha seats for the Opposition.         
	CPM state committee member Rabin Deb rubbished the claim, saying: Lok Sabha seat calculations are not so easy. The ground realities and peoples responses to work done by the state government have to be taken into account.        
	Even if the CPM leader is correct in his assessment, the 2004 Lok Sabha results show that a Congress-Trinamul alliance in that poll would have led to a swing in the Oppositions favour in around 10 seats.         
	In the 2004 polls, the Congress and Trinamul fought separately and got a total of seven seats. Had there been an alliance, the combine would have got about 17 seats. A scrutiny of the 2006 Assembly polls reflected more or less the same figure. After the rural polls, we are expecting an additional swing in our favour. However, it wouldnt be prudent to speculate on the basis of that, Trinamul MLA Partha Chatterjee said.        
	Another feel-good factor for the Opposition, leaders said, was the 6 per cent increase in the combined votes of Trinamul and the Congress in the 2006 Assembly elections, vis--vis the 2004 Lok Sabha polls.        
	Given the peoples disenchantment with the states Left Front government these days, this figure is expected to go up in the coming Lok Sabha polls, a Bengal Congress functionary said.

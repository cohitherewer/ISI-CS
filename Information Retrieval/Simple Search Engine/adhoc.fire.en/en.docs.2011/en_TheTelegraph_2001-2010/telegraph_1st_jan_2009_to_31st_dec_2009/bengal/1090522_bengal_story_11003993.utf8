	Calcutta, May 21: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and his party have drawn up a new road map for the state government for the last two years of its term after the stunning rout in the Lok Sabha elections, reports our special correspondent.        
	I am preparing a note focusing on the governments priorities. These guidelines will help individual departments to set their priorities, the chief minister told a state cabinet meeting today amid signals the government may shelve its industrialisation drive.        
	Bhattacharjee readily accepted demands by RSP ministers Kshiti Goswami and Biswanath Choudhury and the CPIs Nandagopal Bhattacharjee to include their views before placing the final draft before the cabinet and the front for approval.

	Malda, Feb. 5: A section of students of Malda Womens College today demonstrated in front of the principals chamber after the authorities refused to allow 56 of them to sit for university examinations.        
	Chaitali Chattoraj, the principal of the college, said students with 10 per cent of attendance would not be allowed to sit for Part I and Part II examinations beginning tomorrow.         
	Quoting university rule, Chattoraj said the students have to attend 75 per cent classes to be allowed for the varsity examinations.         
	This year, we had prepared a list of 100 students who were not eligible to sit for the examinations as they did not have the required percentage. Later, we reviewed our decision and allowed 44 students. But those who did not attend even 10 per cent classes had to be denied the right to sit for the tests. A line has to be drawn somewhere, she said.        
	The college authorities decision has prompted Chhatra Parishad district president Madhumay Sarkar to threaten a hunger strike by the students. We will organise a sit-in at the office of the sub-divisional officer tomorrow, Sarkar said.        
	District secretary of the SFI Joy Charkraborty said many students were pregnant and could not attend classes. The college authorities have not even allowed them to sit for the examinations. This is inhuman, he said.        
	Sushmita Kundu, one of the guardians who joined the protest, said her daughter was not well for a long time and could not attend classes. I even produced doctors certificate. But the college authorities is not ready to accept that. My daughter will lose one year, she added.

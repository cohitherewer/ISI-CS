The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Court bar on village trial 
                                                                                                               Court bar on village trial 
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 18: The high court today asked police to take stern action against panchayat members holding sha- lishi (reconciliation) meetings on non-bailable crimes.         
	A division bench of Justices K.J. Sengupta and Tapan Mukherjee told the Murshidabad superintendent of police to bring to book panchayat functionaries holding kangaroo courts. The SP is (being) directed to see that in no way a panchayat settles in a kangaroo court cases that are non-bailable and to take stern action against the offending panchayats.        
	Although the order is in the context of Murshidabad, it will be held as a precedent across the state.        
	The directive came as the court rejected the bail petition of Sheikh Sufiyan, 32, a resident of Gopalgunj in Murshidabads Suti, about 275km from Calcutta. He had been arrested on charges of raping a woman in December 2007. The 28-year-old, a mother of two, had lodged a complaint with the local Gopalgunj panchayat.         
	The village body heard the accused and the victim and asked Sufiyan to pay a compensation of Rs 5,000 to the woman by January 2008.         
	As she did not get the money, the woman lodged a complaint of rape against Sufiyan with Suti police station.         
	Arrested last April, Sufiyan had applied for bail in the high court, but it was rejected.        
	Opposing the bail prayer, public prosecutor Asimesh Goswami informed the court about the shalishi meeting and said the accused had not even bothered to carry out the panchayats order.        
	Last year, the court had said shalishi meetings conducted by villagers did not come under the purview of the judiciary. So orders passed by such kangaroo courts were not binding on those held guilty.         
	Today, for the first time, it restrained panchayats from holding trials in cases involving non-bailable crimes.        
	Lawyer Sailendu Rakshit said: The court has asked the police to take action against panchayats if they hold shalishi meetings on issues relating to non-bailable crimes. But it has not clarified whether villagers could try those guilty of relatively minor offences.

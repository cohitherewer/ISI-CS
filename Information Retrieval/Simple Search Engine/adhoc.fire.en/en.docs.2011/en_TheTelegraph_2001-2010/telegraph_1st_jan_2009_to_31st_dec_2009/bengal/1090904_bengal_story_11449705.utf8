	Tamluk, Sept. 3: A boy who was suspended from school for two months after he sneezed during prayer time is missing.        
	Students said during school prayer last Saturday, when students are supposed to maintain silence, Gopinath Soren of Class XII in Kolaghat, East Midnapore, sneezed.        
	After the payer, a teacher slapped Gopinath, accusing him of being mischievous. Gopinath told the teacher he had a cold and could not stop sneezing. But the teacher sternly told him if he was not well, he should not be in school. Gopinath told the teacher he was not at fault, said Ganesh Mal, the boys classmate and hostel roommate.        
	On Monday, headmaster Gourhari Pal called Gopinath, who is from Purulia, to his chamber and suspended him for two months.         
	Pal had summoned Gopinaths father Arjun Soren today. When Arjun came to take his son home, Gopinath could not be found in the hostel.         
	Pal said Gopinath was not suspended for sneezing. Gopinath was suspended because he misbehaved with the teacher.... Gopinath tried to slap the teacher back, he said.        
	But the boys friend Ganesh said: Gopinath did not do any wrong.... He was depressed after he was suspended. He was missing from the hostel this morning.         
	His classmates locked the school gate, demanding withdrawal of the suspension order. They also demanded that the boy be traced.

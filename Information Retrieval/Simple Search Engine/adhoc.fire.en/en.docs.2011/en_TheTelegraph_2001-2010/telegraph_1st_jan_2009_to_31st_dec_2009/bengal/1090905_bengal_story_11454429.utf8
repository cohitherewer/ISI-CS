The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CPM duo killed
                                                                                                               CPM duo killed
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Behrampore, Sept. 4: Two CPM activists were today murdered in a Murshidabad pocket where the party had snatched the local gram panchayat from the Congress.        
	Police said Ajmat Ali, 26, and Mirajul Sheikh, 30, were sipping tea at a stall when alleged Congress supporters hurled bombs at them. They died on the spot.        
	CPM supporters assembled within minutes and a clash with Congress activists ensued at Kapasdanga village. Two CPM supporters and a Congressman had to be hospitalised after the fight in which bombs and bricks were used.         
	Murshidabad police chief B.L. Meena said 15 people were held for murder and rioting. All of them are from the Congress.         
	The CPM and the Congress have been locked in a turf war since Kapasdanga panchayat went to the CPM last year. Three days ago, eight people were injured in a clash in the village in the Beldanga area, about 180km from Calcutta.        
	Murshidabad has been a traditional Congress stronghold and Kapasdanga was no exception until last year.         
	The CPMs Beldanga local committee secretary, Abul Kasem, alleged that the Congress was trying hard to topple the panchayat and creating tension in the area. The CPM has eight members and the Congress six. The Congress denied the topple bid.

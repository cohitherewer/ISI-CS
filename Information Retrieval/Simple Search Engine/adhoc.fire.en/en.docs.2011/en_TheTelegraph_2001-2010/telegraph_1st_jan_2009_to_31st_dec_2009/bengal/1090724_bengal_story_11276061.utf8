	Midnapore, July 23: Maoists last evening ransacked the home of a CPM local committee member in Salboni and set it on fire.        
	Around 6pm, 15 Maoists with rifles arrived at Benishole village and asked for Gourhari Mahatos home. No one was there when the rebels broke in. Mahato had fled with his family yesterday.         
	The rebels burnt the furniture and damaged the roof of the house before leaving.

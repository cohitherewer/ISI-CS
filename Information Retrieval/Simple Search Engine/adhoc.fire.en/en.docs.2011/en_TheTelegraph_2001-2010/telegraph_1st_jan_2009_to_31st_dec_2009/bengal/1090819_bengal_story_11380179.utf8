The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Grenade kills jawan at camp
                                                                                                               Grenade kills jawan at camp
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Midnapore, Aug. 18: An ac-cidental explosion claimed a CRPF jawan in Midnapore town on a day Maoists missed their target in Lalgarh.        
	Dipak Kumar was blown up while apparently cleaning his rifle and hand grenades.        
	The grenade fell from his hand and exploded. His right arm was ripped apart and he received grave injuries all over the body, said the officer in charge of the barracks.        
	Kumar, 24, from Uttar Pradesh, was part of the Lalgarh operation but was stationed at the district headquarters from where jawans are being sent to the war zone by rotation.         
	According to inspector-general of police (western range) Kuldiep Singh, the grenades pin was loose or bent, which is why it came off on hitting the ground. Normally, a pin wouldnt come off so easily, Singh told The Telegraph.         
	Kumar, Singh added, could have saved himself had he seen the pin come off. Then he would have had the time to run out of the room. There is a five-six-second gap between the pin coming off and the blast.        
	A grenades pin has to be cleaned regularly to ensure it doesnt get jammed.        
	A blast in Lalgarh missed a police patrol by a few metres around the time Kumar was hit. It took place on the metal- led road connecting Lalgarh and Ramgarh, which had been scanned for explosives barely an hour ago.        
	About 100 CRPF and state police personnel were returning on foot after a routine patrol of villages on the fringes of Lalgarh town when the deafening explosion took place.         
	An officer said it was a directional mine.        
	About 400 metres of electric wire was found snaking into a paddy field from the road. It ended in a clump of bush at the edge of Barapelia village.         
	The jawans fanned out to the villages and found two more explosive devices  tin cans stuffed with ammunition.         
	West Midnapore police chief Manoj Verma said: The Maoists mistimed the blast.        
	For the first time since the Lalgarh operation began on June 18, a jawan took a direct hit yesterday. Like today, that blow too came at the fag end of a patrol. The jawan, who took a bullet in his waist, is stable.

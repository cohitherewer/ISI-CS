	Midnapore, Oct. 31: A CPM supporter whose two brothers had been kidnapped by Maoists about a fortnight ago was shot dead in Belpahari today.        
	Madhav Modi, 42, was cutting grass in a field outside his house when five men surrounded him. West Midnapore police chief Manoj Verma confirmed it was a Maoist job. Madhavs brothers Ratan, 35, and Mantu, 30, are still missing.        
	In Goaltore, around 50km from Belpahari and closer to Lalgarh, security forces fought a three-hour gun battle with the guerrillas.

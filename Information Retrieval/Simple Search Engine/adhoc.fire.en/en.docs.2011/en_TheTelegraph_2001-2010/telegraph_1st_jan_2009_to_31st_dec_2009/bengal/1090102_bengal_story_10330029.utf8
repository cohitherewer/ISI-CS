The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Cops cry against peddler bails 
                                                                                                               Cops cry against peddler bails 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Balurghat, Jan. 1: Police have appealed to the legal fraternity not to file bail petitions for drug peddlers to keep them off the streets for some time, raising a storm in town.        
	The clandestine sale of psychotropic substances had become a menace and difficult to control in most parts of the town, said Amitabha Das, the town officer of the Balurghat police station.        
	We catch the drug peddlers but once they are out on bail it is back to square one. So we have made a verbal appeal to the local bar association not to appear for the arrested offenders because after spending sometime in jail they could lose their addiction and leave selling drugs, Das said.        
	The secretary of the Balurghat bar association, Pradip Mitra, acknowledged to have received such a request from the police.         
	But there is some constitutional difficulties in not appearing for an offender. However, we will discuss the matter and figure out how best to tackle the situation, Mitra said.        
	The additional police superintendent of South Dinajpur, Imran Wahab, admitted that drug abuse was a problem in town. It is the policemans job to ensure that the law and order is maintained and it is also their responsibility to bring the wrongdoers of the society to the mainstream of life, he said.        
	Ashok Kanti Sarkar, a local lawyer, has not taken the police appeal lightly.         
	It is not important whether a lawyer should or should not move a bail petition for an offender. More important thing is every individual has the constitutional right to seek the assistance of the law. If the police want to tackle the drug problem, they should turn to the social welfare department or non-government organisations, he said.        
	Police sources said the bus stand, hospital area, Saheb Kutcherrypara are known hangouts for drug users and peddlers who often play a cat and mouse game with the law enforcers. There is no particular shop where the deals are done and the drugs handed over.        
	The worst hit are the poor, handcart pullers and cycle-rickshaw drivers, who waste their hard-earned money to pursuit their habits. We need to keep them off drugs so the peddlers must be put away, a police officer said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          A huddle in Midnapore, also experiencing a severe cold. (Samir Mondal)                                  
	Bankura, Dec. 29: Six poultry workers who had lit a fire in their room and shut its door and windows to beat the biting cold last night were found dead in a Bankura village.        
	A farm guard who came looking for a morning cup of tea in the workers quarters raised the alarm when no one responded to his calls.        
	They broke open the door and found the six still sleeping. We became suspicious and checked if they were breathing. They were not, said the guard, Rana Goswami.        
	Police suspect asphyxiation caused the deaths at Nakaijuri village in Onda block, about 210km from Calcutta. They had lit a coal fire in an earthen oven to keep themselves warm. But they made a mistake of shutting all the windows. A mix of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide in the closed room, where all the oxygen must have got used up, possibly killed them, an officer said.        
	Gases like carbon monoxide lead to drowsiness and eventual death as vital organs collapse, said S. Majumdar, a doctor at the Bankura Medical College and Hospital.        
	The mercury has hovered around nine degrees Celsius in Bankura over the past few days. Sitaram Raut, 40, Mahesh Raut, 32, Raju Yadav, 32, Govind Yadav, 25, Panchu Bajpai, 25, and Pramatha Mondal, 40, had one thin blanket each.        
	They were casual workers of Amrit Hatcheries, brought from its Calcutta office to help in cooking and other odd jobs, said additional superintendent of police R.K. Jhajaria.        
	Amrit official refused to comment.

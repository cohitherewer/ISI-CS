	Purulia, Sept. 11: Maoists beat up a CPM leaders wife after not finding him at home and took away a Trinamul Congress leaders licensed double-barrel gun last night at the foothills of Ayodhya in Purulia.         
	A police team acting on a tip-off almost came face to face with the guerrillas and an hours gunfight followed, but no casualties were reported.

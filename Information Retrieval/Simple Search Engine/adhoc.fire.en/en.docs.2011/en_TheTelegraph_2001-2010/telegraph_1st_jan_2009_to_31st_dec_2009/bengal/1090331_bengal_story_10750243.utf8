                                                                                                               Jawans slain mom pops up
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Midnapore, March 30: An army jawan who had his father-in-law arrested and drove his wife into hiding by accusing them of kidnapping and killing his stepmother was found travelling with the lady last evening.        
	Debashis Maity and his stepmother Kulalakshmi were produced before the chief judicial magistrate in Midnapore town today. The 40-year-old man hasnt been arrested but a probe is on.         
	Kulalakshmi was released on a personal bond, as the case on her kidnap is still going on. The matter will be heard again on April 13.        
	We feel there is foul play in Debashiss kidnapping complaint. We will charge him with misleading police, West Midnapore superintendent Manoj Verma said.        
	The dispute goes back to Debashiss refusal to pay maintenance to his wife, who left their Sabang home in West Midnapore after alleged torture by her husband in 2005.         
	While at her fathers place, Mamata had sought the help of two neighbours, primary school teacher Gour Das and farmer Shakti Samanta, to pressure Debashis into making the payments.        
	Debashis lodged the kidnapping complaint in April last year, naming Mamata, her father Rampada Talik and the two neighbours as suspects.         
	On March 11 this year, Debashis lodged another complaint saying a foul smell from a septic tank in Samantas backyard made him suspect Kulalakshmis body was hidden there. A few bones were found and sent for DNA tests, police officer Verma said.        
	The jawans alleged deception game ended last evening when Das caught him allegedly shifting Kulalakshmi from one hideout to another. Debashis has now told the police he found his stepmother standing on the road when he went to give the second instalment of a Rs 7-lakh ransom.

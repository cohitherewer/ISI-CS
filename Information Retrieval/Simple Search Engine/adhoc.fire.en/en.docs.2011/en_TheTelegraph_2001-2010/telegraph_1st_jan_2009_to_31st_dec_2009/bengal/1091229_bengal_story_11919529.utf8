The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Back to farming in Singur, Tata training goes waste
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Back to farming in Singur, Tata training goes waste
          UTTAM DUTTA                          Monimohon Bangal, a former Tata Motors apprentice who has returned to farming for the lack of an alternative. Picture by Ananda Das                                  
	Singur, Dec. 28: They had dreamt of a life different from their fathers  a life protected from the mercy of the weather god and propped by their own hard-earned abilities.        
	Mamata Banerjee had willed otherwise.         
	Many of the 500-odd Singur youths who had gone to industrial training institutes and had been absorbed as techni- cal hands in the Tata Motors project here have now gone back to their family occupation, shovelling up mounds of soil to raise crops.        
	Monimohon Bangal is one of the victims of Mamatas 15-day siege of the Tata plant which forced the company to pull out the small-car project from Singur last year.        
	With the car factory, all our job opportunities have gone too. Our entire training has become useless, Monimohon said, tilling a small plot his family had bought in Gopalpur village with a part of the money they got selling half an acre for the Tata project.        
	After the Tatas left, Monimohon had looked for jobs in Calcutta. I tried for about eight months but in vain. We have lost our land (to the now-abandoned project) and the job as well. We are back to the days of the spades and shovels.         
	Monimohon had been to Pune in December 2007 after the government announced that the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation would organise training for those who had to part with their land because of the small-car project.        
	From August 2007, I underwent training first at Belur Shilpamandir and then at Pune. After coming back, I joined the Tata project in Singur as a trainee with a Rs 1,700-a-month stipend. But things changed rapidly after that. Now I am sowing potato seeds, he said.        
	Potato is a money-fetching crop but its farmers often suffer the most. Last year, a fog-aggravated fungal disease destroyed the crop across vast stretches and a glut took its toll the year before.        
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, whose dream it was to make the car plant possible, and Mamata, very pro-industry since becoming a minister in Delhi, have been making noises of late about the possibility of setting up a new industry on the abandoned Tata site.         
	But the factory-to-farm youths have developed a distaste for them.        
	These politicians are in the habit of promising the moon. Didi ensured the departure of the Tatas. The state government did nothing to keep them back. Now they are tossing up new ideas as if we are so naive. I dont have any land left after my family sold two-thirds of an acre for the project, said Swapan Das of Sahanapara.         
	Like Monimohon, Swapan had joined the Nano plants engine shop as an apprentice. He now works as labourer on others land.        
	But why didnt Swapan, all of 23 years old and unmarried, explore other job prospects?        
	With just a Madhyamik certificate under his belt, Swapan says the Tata Motors were his best bet.         
	He had tried for a few months to get another job and then taken a shot at business with a cousin who lived in Raipur, Chhattisgarh. None of it worked.         
	After leaving Bengal, Tata Motors has not retained any of the Singur youths it had once planned to employ.        
	Monimohons cousin Shibsankar Bangal is also among the farmer-again youths. He had been a trainee in the small-car plants paint shop.        
	Unlike many others, Shibsankar had not even tried for a job. What do I do moving from one place to another? We had to give up two bighas (two-thirds of an acre) for the project and some 2.5 cottahs are left now. I till that land and hope the money we got selling the plot to the government will see our family of three through, Shibsankar said.        
	Railway minister Mamata has unveiled a Kisan Vision project in Singur that would help keep farm produce in railways-owned cold chains.         
	Two days ago, she had promised one lakh jobs in two engine component-making units in Dankuni, 25km away.        
	For many in Singur, being a kisan again is not a happy vision. They fear they will remain trapped in the past.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Biman tit-for-tat for Kalyan
                                                                                                               Biman tit-for-tat for Kalyan
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, May 3: CPM leader Biman Bose today attacked Trinamul leader Kalyan Banerjee in the same personal vein in which the Opposition leader had targeted the chief minister.         
	His (Banerjees) mother must be a decent lady (bhadra mahila). I dont think she raised him to become the kind of person he is, Bose said.        
	Trinamul leader Mukul Roy said: Boses comments have exposed the CPM that claims to be a party of cultured people. We will submit a CD of Boses comments to the Election Commission tomorrow and demand action.        
	Last month, Banerjee, the Serampore candidate for Trinamul, had told a TV channel that Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee was a liar and ridiculed the chief ministers visits to the culture hub of Nandan.         
	The CPM complained to the poll panel, following which Banerjee apologised.

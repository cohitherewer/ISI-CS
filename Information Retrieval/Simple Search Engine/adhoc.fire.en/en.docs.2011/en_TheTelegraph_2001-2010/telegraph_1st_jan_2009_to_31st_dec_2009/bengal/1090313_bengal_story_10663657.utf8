                                                                                                               Cong wrestles with riddle
          OUR BUREAU                          Congress and Trinamul workers take out a joint rally at Hazra on Thursday. Picture by Amit Datta                                  
	March 12: The Bengal unit of the Congress is trying to make sense of the alliance with the Trinamul Congress that has denied the national party a toehold in south Bengal.        
	Some state leaders suggested that the high commands desire to seal the deal fast  against the backdrop of snarled talks in Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra  might have dissuaded the Congress from pushing Mamata Banerjee too hard.        
	Controversies have erupted over the Congresss seat-sharing with the Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh. Similar things are happening with the NCP in Maharashtra. Our partys central leadership felt that a repeat of such incidents in Bengal would make it look like a failed alliance-starter, a state leader said.        
	Another state leader referred to the warm relationship between Sonia and Mamata  citing how the two were sometimes seen having coffee in Parliaments Central Hall  but sources in Delhi said the Congress chief rarely allowed personal likes and dislikes to dictate political strategies.        
	On the other hand, Sonia probably would have had the events in Orissa in mind, they said. While the Congress is pleased that the BJP has lost an old ally in Orissa, it isnt thrilled at the CPMs efforts to draft Naveen Patnaik into the Third Front.        
	If the CPMs seats in Bengal can be reduced, it would undermine its clout after the polls and encourage the Third Front constituents to gravitate towards the Congress. Mamata must appear a plausible means to this end.        
	Congress general secretary K. Keshava Rao was on the phone with the Trinamul chief through Tuesday and Wednesday, telling her that her terms were acceptable and making it clear he was the only appointed interlocutor.        
	I told her, lets not call it an alliance. Its a friendship, we will go hand in hand, work shoulder to shoulder. Let it be an enduring partnership, said Rao whose wife, having grown up in Jamshedpur, is fluent in Bengali and apparently helped him with notes on Mamatas media conference in Calcutta.        
	I have a challenge  to assuage the feelings of the 28 Congress members who have not got tickets, Rao said today.        
	The sources in the Congress said that while agreeing to Mamatas formula, Rao had suggested that the alliance should stretch beyond the realm of the Lok Sabha polls and continue through next years civic polls and the 2011 Assembly elections.        
	We are told that the Congress may ask for Mamatas support to a Congress nominee for a Rajya Sabha berth next year. Similarly, the party may also request Didi to allow a Congress leader to be the mayor of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation if the alliance continues and wins the civic body next year, said a Trinamul general secretary.        
	Land thrust        
	The Trinamul candidate list indicates that Mamata will try to turn the Lok Sabha polls into a referendum on the governments industrialisation drive by acquiring fertile land.        
	The candidates include many who were seen by her side during the Singur-Nandigram campaign.         
	Kalyan Banerjee, Kabir Suman, Ratna Nag, Subhendu Adhikary, Sisir Adhikary and Deepak Ghosh (all Trinamul candidates) had been with her throughout the land movement. Didi has acknowledged their contribution by making them candidates. Even the SUCI was rewarded with the Joynagar seat for standing by her, a Trinamul office-bearer said.         
	Mamata will kickstart her campaign from Nandigram on March 14  the second anniversary of the police firing that killed 14 people.        
	CPM state secretary Biman Bose ridiculed the alliance, terming it unprincipled and opportunistic.

                                                                                                               Bus kills three in escape bid
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Barasat, March 27: A bus trying to speed away after brushing a cyclist rammed into a tree and rolled into a paddy field, killing two farmers and a passenger.        
	Police said a group of villagers had started chasing the Barasat-Behrampore bus after it hit the cyclist in the Amdanga area of in North 24-Parganas, about 30km from Calcutta.         
	It travelled at a breakneck speed for almost a kilometre and crashed into the tree, an officer said.        
	Jainal Abedin, 37, and Kasem Mondal, 40, were watering their fields when the bus came hurtling down and crushed them. Jainal was killed on the spot and Kasem on the way to the district hospital at Barasat.         
	Rehana Mondal, 30, who was bound for Ranaghat, died in the hospital. Twenty others were injured.         
	The driver jumped off the bus and fled. We are trying to trace him. At Awalsiddhi, some youths on motorcycles chased the bus with some 30 people inside and it accelerated further. The driver then lost control and hit the tree and the bus rolled into the field, said an Amdanga police officer.         
	Some people had also relayed the buss number to the next stop and a group was waiting to intercept it, he added.        
	The cyclist, Azizul Mollah, 40, who fell after being brushed by the bus, has also been hospitalised.

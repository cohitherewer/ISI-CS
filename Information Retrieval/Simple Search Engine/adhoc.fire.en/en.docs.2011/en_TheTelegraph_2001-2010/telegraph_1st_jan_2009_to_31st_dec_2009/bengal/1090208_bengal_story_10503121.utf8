	Papuri, Feb. 7: Their bodies in flames, two men rushed out of a burning house as Rahima Bibi watched in shock. They collapsed at her doorstep and died.        
	Rahima, 35, was woken up around 5.30 this morning by the sound of bombs bursting in her village, Papuri, in Birbhums Nanoor block. Her year-old daughter tucked in one arm, Rahima opened the door of her mud hut. She was horrified.         
	Many, many men, their faces covered and with guns in their hands, were running around the village, hurling bombs at random, she said.        
	Rahima rushed in and shook her parents awake  she stayed with them as her husband works in Delhi  picked up her six-year-old son and ran out of the house. People were firing and throwing bombs, all at the same time, Rahima said.         
	I heard a bomb go off very close to us. I turned and saw two persons entering our house, throwing bombs inside and then disappearing. In front of our eyes, the thatched roof caught fire and a part of our house went up in smoke.        
	Rahima and her family hid behind a mud wall, close to the house of a neighbour, Hafeeza Bibi.        
	She said she saw two other men, their faces covered, rush towards Hafeezas house. Save us, help, they were crying, Rahima said. A group of men were chasing them shouting kill them, kill them.        
	This group  there must have been four or five of them  entered Hafeezas house and beat up the two who had run inside, said Rahima.         
	They then (the men who were chasing) came out, locked the two inside Hafeezas house and hurled bombs at it. The entire house was on fire in minutes with the two men trapped inside, Rahima said.         
	What she saw next horrified Rahima more.        
	After some time, the two men rushed out of the burning hut. Their bodies were in flames. They collapsed in front of our house, Rahima said.        
	The two, who died at Rahimas doorstep, were later identified as CPM supporters Rashed Sheikh and Lalbabu Sheikh.        
	Sixty-five-year-old Idu Sheikh, another resident of Papuri, had just finished his morning namaaz when he first heard gun shots at 5.30.         
	I had just finished my prayers when I heard gun shots and bombs, Idu said.         
	I saw groups of men entering the village from different sides. Then, I saw another group attacking them. I didnt know what was happening, so I rushed home.        
	The battle, the beginning of which Idu witnessed, raged till 9am in Papuri, about 300km from Calcutta.         
	The police, who arrived after the clash ended, found the bodies of five men and a 14-year-old boy.         
	The CPM claimed that five of the bodies were those of their supporters.

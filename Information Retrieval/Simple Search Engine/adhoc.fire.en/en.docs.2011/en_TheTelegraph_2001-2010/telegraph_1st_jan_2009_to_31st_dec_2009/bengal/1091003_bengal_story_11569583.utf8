The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Calcutta to China, a C-link
                                                                                                               Calcutta to China, a C-link
          OUR BUREAU                          A parade in Beijing on the 60th anniversary of communist rule in China on Thursday                                  
	Calcutta, Oct. 2: If communism is one C common to the rulers of China and Bengal, corruption is another. So Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Biman Bose admitted today.        
	At a CPM function to mark the 60th anniversary of the founding of the Peoples Republic of China, the chief minister saluted post-Mao Chinas colossal strides in economy and enormous achievements while defending its one-party state.        
	However, he listed widespread corruption and the widening gulf between the town and rural area as well as (between) individuals as two of Chinas problems.        
	State CPM secretary Bose elaborated on corruption by party cadres and state officials in China and Bengal, and said he wanted to emulate Beijings anti-corruption drive.        
	We must fight against the corruption in the party and run a rectification campaign, Bose said.        
	Bhattacharjee accused the pro-US lobby including the corporate media and arms dealers of stoking the xenophobic fear of an imminent attack by China through false claims about border tensions and the shooting of soldiers. He added that Chinese leaders had told him they didnt support the Naxalites in the 1970s.        
	Karat stand        
	CPM general secretary Prakash Karat has blasted sections of the corporate media and strategic experts and Rightwing circles in the country for reviving the bogey of a China threat with baseless or exaggerated claims of border incursions and firing.        
	In an article, Sixtieth Anniversary of Peoples Republic of China, to be carried in the upcoming issue of party mouthpiece Peoples Democracy, Karat spies a design behind these reports: to increase Indo-US strategic co-operation.        
	The RSS chief has highlighted the alleged threat from China in his annual Vijaya Dashami speech. All this is being orchestrated to demand greater defence preparedness against China with the unstated requirement being deeper strategic and military ties with the United States, Karat writes.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Red flag returns with khaki
                                                                                                               Red flag returns with khaki
          ZEESHAN JAWED                           The CPM flag on the party office. (Amit Datta)                                  
	Lalgarh, June 21: A day after the central forces rolled into Lalgarh, CPM flags were back on the party office at Bhimpur.         
	Nobody came forward to claim the feat and no one had seen anybody put up the flags. The one-room party office  barely 20 meters from Bhimpur Santal High School where central and state forces are camping  remained shut through the day, but the flags were the topic of discussion.         
	Bhimpur  like many other villages here  has seen an exodus from the CPM ranks since the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities and the Maoists started ruling the area late last year. The party office was ransacked last week and no one protested.         
	Yesterday, the last red flag was spotted around 30km from Lalgarh. Today, the distance came down to just 9km.         
	Now that the forces have reached Lalgarh, the CPM cadres are trying to stage a comeback, said a villager who did not wish to be named.         
	The middle-aged man in the Bhimpur bazaar claimed he was apolitical and never took sides but admitted that he was worried seeing the red flags. My biggest worry is bloodshed I had seen how CPM leaders and cadres were forced to quit the party by publicly announcing their decision. If the party returns to power here, they will try to exact revenge and another round of unrest will follow, he said.         
	The fear of the Maoists is evident on the walls in Bhimpur, Pirakata, Koima and several other villages where posters written by CPM cadres declare their dissociation with the party.        
	Several red flags, tied to trees, were fluttering along the road from Pirakata to Lalgarh this morning.         
	The anger against CPM leaders was justified. While we were starving, they were building palatial homes, said a villager, blaming the party for lack of development in the area. In the past seven months, the deprivation deepened further as the administration ceded control of the area to the rebels.        
	Amid murmurs of an impending CPM-versus-committee clash, the people in Bhimpur bazaar discussed in hushed tones how the red flags came back.         
	The police are beating up the villagers and forcing them to flee while the CPM cadres, who were forced to run away, are coming back, said Tarun Murmu, echoing Mamata Banerjee. Although central and state forces are jointly conducting the operation, the Trinamul Congress leader has accused the CPM of recapturing its lost ground in Lalgarh by using Bengal police.         
	Many of our workers had to publicly dissociate themselves from the party. After seeing the advance of the force and the Maoists flee, some of them may have got excited and put up the flags, said Deepak Sarkar, secretary of the partys West Midnapore district committee.         
	The Maoists and the Peoples Committee had misled the people. Well try to address the problems of the people.

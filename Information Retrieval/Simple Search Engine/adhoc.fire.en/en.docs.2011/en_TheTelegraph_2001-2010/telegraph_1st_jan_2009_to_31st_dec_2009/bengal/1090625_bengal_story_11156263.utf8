The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Like worms out of woodwork came the mini army
                                                                                                               Like worms out of woodwork came the mini army
                            
	The Telegraph correspondent Naresh Jana had ventured into the forests off Kadashole, from where police were beaten back by Maoists recently, to interview Sidhu Soren, the secretary of the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities, along with a group of local journalists. Suddenly, as news reached that the police were marching towards Kadashole from Goaltore, the Maoists held Naresh and the others hostage for an hour. A first-hand account of the experience:              
	Around 2pm, a dozen of us, local reporters and photographers camping at Goaltore, decided to meet Sidhu Soren.        
	We called him up and he asked us to come over to Mohultala, a village 3km into the jungle from Kadashole. We set off on motorcycles since there are no proper roads inside the jungle.        
	On the edge of Mohultala, where we reached around 2.30pm, we saw preparations were being made for cooking, while a few youths were just lounging. A huge wok had been placed on a clay oven under a tree and about 10 people were busy cooking. It was as if a meal was being prepared for a small army.        
	A stray thought crossed my mind: Why was a meal being prepared for so many inside the forest when I couldnt see that many people around?        
	Casting that thought aside, I asked a fellow reporter to call up Soren to tell him we had reached. Soren told him he was getting ready and asked us to wait.        
	While we were waiting, and calling up our sources to find out if any action was taking place anywhere in Lalgarh,we learnt the police were on their way to Kadashole. Then suddenly everything changed and the atmosphere became tense.        
	Out of nowhere, a motorbike with three young men, rifles slung across their shoulders, stopped in front of us. The police are making their way up, the man who was riding the bike shouted at us. Dont take your cameras out, switch off your cellphones, or else you will be shot dead.        
	With these words, the trio rode off in the direction of Kadashole.        
	Within minutes, two more motorbikes, each carrying three armed men, zoomed past in front of us.        
	Then we realised that the Maoists had taken us hostage: the villagers who were cooking, along with some others, surrounded us and two young men, pistols in their hands, stood guard.        
	Dont move, stay where you are. The police are moving up and there could be an operation, one of the men guarding us said. We will let you go when we get the signal to do so.        
	Within minutes, we heard shots from inside the jungle. We looked in that direction and found a dozen men, all armed and carrying two improvised explosive devices and a bag of ammunition, emerge from the forest.         
	Then, like worms creeping out of the woodwork, about 50 armed people came out of the forest and joined the dozen who had started marching towards Kadashole. It was like a small rally, except it was armed.        
	So this was the mini army that the villagers were cooking for, I thought.        
	At 4.15pm, we were relieved to find Soren trudging towards us.         
	We later learnt that a hoax call sent the alarm bells ringing. The police had started out from Goaltore, but after a brief recce, turned back and returned.        
	Once Soren started speaking to us, the guards and the villagers moved away, realising that we were not hostile people. Soren tried to convince us that the committee did not have anything to do with the armed people and that it did not believe in violence.        
	We asked him who all these armed people were; he said he did not know.        
	We kept quiet, realising discretion was the better part of valour. We were then shown a path through the forest that leads to Goaltore. We hopped onto our bikes and left.

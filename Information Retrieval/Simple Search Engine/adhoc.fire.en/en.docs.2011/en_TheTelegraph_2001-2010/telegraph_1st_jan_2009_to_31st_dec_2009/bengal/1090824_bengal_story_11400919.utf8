The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Maoists kill own men
                                                                                                               Maoists kill own men
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Midnapore, Aug. 23: Maoists have shot dead two Jharkhand Party (Aditya) leaders following an alleged fallout over money the duo used to extort on their behalf from traders in West Midnapores Belpahari.        
	Karan Murmu, 35, and Babulal Murmu, 33, were found dead this morning on a dirt track in the jungles 7km from Bengals border with Jharkhand. Karan, the JKP (A) block president, and Babulal, the head of its local committee, had gone to Belpahari town yesterday to attend a party meeting.         
	Our preliminary investigations have revealed they used to collect funds for the Maoists. We believe they were shot dead following a dispute over accounts, said district police chief Manoj Verma.        
	The duo lived in villages about a kilometre from Jharkhand. The area, about 100km from Lalgarh town, is part of the Maoists larger area of influence where Bengal is planning a joint crackdown along with the neighbouring state.        
	Maoist leader Bikash tonight claimed responsibility for the murders.        
	On the eve of the 2006 Assembly elections, the Maoists had launched a unique poll boycott campaign using Charlie Chaplin films on the courtyard of Karans house. They played The Kid on a battery-powered TV to attract villagers and urged them not to vote. Karan was out on bail after being held in connection with a CPM leaders murder in 2008.        
	The police found the motorcycle on which he and Babulal were travelling yesterday. They were shot point blank, an officer said. Each of them had at least four bullet holes.        
	Villagers had accused the duo, whose party runs the local Simulpal gram panchayat, of corruption. They had allegedly sought Rs 7,000 to 10,000 from each villager as cut-money for releasing funds under the Indira Awas Yojana, said Bhaskar Pal, the Binpur II block development officer.         
	Seventeen villagers had been granted Rs 35,000 each to build their own homes.

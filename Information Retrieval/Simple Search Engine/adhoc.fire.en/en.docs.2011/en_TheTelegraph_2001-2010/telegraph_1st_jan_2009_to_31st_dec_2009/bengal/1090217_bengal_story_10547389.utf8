The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Acid to avenge arrest
                                                                                                               Acid to avenge arrest
                            
	Burdwan, Feb. 16: A tease who was in jail earlier allegedly threw acid last night on the girl who had got him arrested.        
	The 16-year-old girl received 60 per cent burns on her back, waist, neck and right hand. The doctor attending to her at Kalna Subdivisional Hospital said she had severe acid burns but was out of danger.        
	The alleged culprit, Swapan Maji, 30, is missing.         
	Police said Swapan was the girls neighbour at Shibajinagar in Burdwans Kalna, about 145km from Calcutta. He also assisted her rice-trader father.         
	We have started an attempt to murder case against him, said subdivisional police officer Shibranjan Dey.        
	Swapan had been arrested on December 30 while trying to molest her. He got bail only a fortnight ago.        
	The Class VIII student was going to the bathroom across the courtyard of her house when attacked last night. I saw Swapan on the other side of our waist-high wall. With a steel container, he scaled the wall and came towards me. Instinctively, I turned and tried to run and he hurled acid from the container. I cried out in pain, the girl said from her hospital bed.

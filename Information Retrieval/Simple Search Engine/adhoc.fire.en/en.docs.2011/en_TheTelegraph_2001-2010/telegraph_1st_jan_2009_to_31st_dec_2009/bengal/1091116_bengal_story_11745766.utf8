	Nalikul (Hooghly), Nov. 15: Mamata Banerjee has begun testing the waters for an unpalatable but unavoidable factor in governance: land acquisition.        
	The railway minister who rode to power on an anti-land acquisition platform today conceded that she needed land, including from farmers but willing, to lay railway tracks.        
	Mamata stressed on the word willing to draw a distinction with the forcible acquisition of the CPM-led government in Bengal. In Singur, 1,000 acres were acquired. But there is a difference between that and the acquisition for railway land. My stand is that land will not be forcibly taken. Land will be taken only from willing farmers, she said.        
	Mamata was addressing a meeting attended by thousands who had gathered for the foundation ceremony of a rail track project between Tarakeswar and Nalikul in Hooghly.         
	We will give compensation for acquiring land that is needed for railway tracks. In critical areas, there will be compensation and also a job for each family losing land, Mamata said.        
	Her statement, in contrast with the shrill tone during the Nandigram-Singur agitation and in line with the moderate face she has been projecting since assuming power at the Centre, reflects the ground situation the railway is facing.        
	The land bank Mamata had been stressing on for the past five months does not have enough reserves to house the projects lined up for Bengal.        
	One of the projects that will require land acquisition is a proposed line to connect Singur with Nandigram  the two places where Mamata ran prolonged anti-acquisition campaigns.        
	The statement today with the repeated stress on willing land donors  suggests Mamata is also keen to send a message that she is trying to sell a non-Left model to her constituency.        
	The CPM thinks it will not give me land and so I cant implement the railway projects. But they dont know my plans, Mamata said.        
	A senior railway official explained that by critical areas, Mamata meant small plots which would have to be acquired entirely for laying the tracks. Jobs will be offered to a family member of these small landowners who give up their entire plot, Mamatas aide in the railway ministry said.        
	A strip of 30m width is required for stringing tracks, including two lines and the space left vacant on both sides.         
	Mamatas ministry is surveying land for a number of new lines. Tracks are scheduled to be laid between Tarakeswar and Magra, Baruipara and Furfura Sharif, Dankuni and Bali as well as Tarakeswar and Dhaniakhali, among others. All the places are in Hooghly district.        
	Land acquisition for a 22km Tarakeswar-Bishnupur line is also in the pipeline. There are stretches where land is required, said an Eastern Railway official.         
	The railways have land bank of 1.12 lakh acres across the country, but it was not enough for laying tracks, officials said.        
	Mamata today said the Tarakeswar-Bishnupur project, which was sanctioned by the Planning Commission during her tenure as railway minister eight years ago, would be completed by 2010.        
	Mamata wooed youths by announcing jobs in railway factories. Jobs were also promised to those who prevent sabotages by alerting railway officials. There will be no dearth of jobs for the next generation in Bengal as the railways are setting up so many industries, the minister said.         
	Mamata announced the upgrade of some stations as model stations. Bandel, Tarakeswar, Furfura Sharif and Joyrambati-Kamarpukur will be part of the project.        
	The Bandel station will be remodelled after the design of the famous church there while Kamarpukur-Joyrambati will have the architecture of the Ramakrishna Ashram. Tarakeswar and Furfura Sharif will be designed after pilgrim spots there.

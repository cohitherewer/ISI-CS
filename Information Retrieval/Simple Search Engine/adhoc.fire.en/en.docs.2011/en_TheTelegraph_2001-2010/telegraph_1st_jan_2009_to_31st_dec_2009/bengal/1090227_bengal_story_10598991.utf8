	Calcutta, Feb. 26: The government will pay the enhanced salary scale recommended by the UGC for college and university teachers, finance minister Asim Dasgupta has said.        
	Although Dasgupta had hinted as much earlier, this was the first time the government said it had accepted the recommendations.         
	Nearly 15,000 teachers will benefit. The minimum gross pay of a teacher will rise from Rs 15,000 to nearly Rs 28,000.

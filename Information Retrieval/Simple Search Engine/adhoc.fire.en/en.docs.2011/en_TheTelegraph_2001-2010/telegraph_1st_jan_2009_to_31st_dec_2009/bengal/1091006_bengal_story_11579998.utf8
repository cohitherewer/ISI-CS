The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Mamata fuels burning issue 
                                                                                                               Mamata fuels burning issue 
  - Minister issues dire warning if the learned are touched by state         OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Mamata Banerjee flags off a train to Digha at New Jalpaiguri on Monday. (PTI)                                        
	Calcutta, Oct. 5: Mamata Banerjee today said Bengal will burn if the state government slaps the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act on writers and artistes like Mahasweta Devi and Aparna Sen for sympathising with the tribal agitation in Lalgarh.         
	Banglay aagun jalbey jodi biddajaner keshagra sparsha kara hoy. Banger manush eshob bardasta karbena. (Bengal will burn if even the tip of a hair of any intellectual is touched. The people of Bengal will not tolerate this), the Trinamul Congress chief told STAR-Ananda this afternoon.        
	Reacting to Mamatas statement, chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti said: I have heard what the honourable railway minister said. We have nothing against intellectuals. But those who had helped Maoist groups are equally guilty and liable to be punished under the UAPA. Whether a person is less known or well known is not the consideration. Neither you nor me is above the law.        
	Left partner Forward Bloc slammed Mamata for the statement. Bloc veteran Ashok Ghosh said her threat that Bengal would burn was an unconstitutional statement.        
	Mamatas words were a reaction to Chakrabartis warning two days ago when he said: Those who are helping any banned outfit are making themselves liable for punishment under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act.        
	Mamata, who classified Mahasweta Devi, Aparna Sen, writer Joy Goswami and actors Shaoli Mitra and Kaushik Sen as intellectuals, said they had nothing to do with Maoists or Chhatradhar Mahato, the leader of the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities. They helped the tribal movement that was started in Lalgarh, Belpahari and Garbeta because the state government deprived the adivasi people. There is nothing wrong in supporting the movement (in Lalgarh), she said.         
	Aparna Sen, Shaoli Mitra, Joy Goswami and Kaushik Sen had visited Lalgarh and met Mahato earlier.        
	Mamata today also warned the government not to play with fire by linking the tribal movement with the Maoists.         
	The Bengal government has neither banned the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities, nor the Maoists. Then what is the harm if somebody helps such a committee to step up a movement against the deprivation of tribals? she asked.         
	The people of Bengal will protest if any attempt is made to harass intellectuals by linking them with the Maoists.         
	Reacting to Mamatas statement, Forward Blocs Ghosh said: She should step down as a central minister before making such unconstitutional statements.         
	But the Bloc leadership spoke in two voices on the possibility of questioning artistes sympathising with the Maoists. Ghosh didnt find anything wrong with it, but Bloc general secretary Debabrata Biswas was critical. The BJP government in Chhattisgarh jailed Dr Vinayak Sen as a Maoist sympathiser. Now, we are talking of grilling Mahasweta Devi.... But she has supported tribal causes not only in Lalgarh but across the country. She knows the reality about the lack of development in tribal areas, he said.

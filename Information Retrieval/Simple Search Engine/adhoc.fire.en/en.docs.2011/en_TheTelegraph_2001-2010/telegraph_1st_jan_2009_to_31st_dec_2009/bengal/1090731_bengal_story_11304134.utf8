          OUR BUREAU                          The body of Sabbar Khan Chowdhury in Bhangar. (Goutam Chakraborty)                                  
	July 30: A Trinamul Congress worker died in South 24-Parganas when police opened fire to break up a clash that followed a pattern of bloody turf battles in areas where the CPM is losing ground.        
	Bhangar, about 60km from Calcutta where the clash broke out between marching CPM cadres and Trinamul workers gathered for a meeting, is part of the Joynagar Lok Sabha seat that the SUCI holds.         
	South 24-Parganas was in the Lefts grip till the panchayat elections. But now, all four Lok Sabha seats are held by Trinamul and its allies  a cause of worry for the CPM.         
	Local CPM MLA Abdur Rezzak Mollah accepted this when he said: The main purpose of the march was to encourage party supporters who were disheartened by the dismal performance in the Lok Sabha polls.        
	Yesterday, CPM goons hacked the heels of two Trinamul supporters and speared a villager in an area of Burdwan where the party seems to be losing its grip.        
	What started todays clash is not clear. A police officer said 32-year-old Sabbar Khan Chowdhury who got killed had a bullet wound near his heart and gashes in the abdomen caused by a sharp weapon. Sabbar was a known Trinamul worker in the area.        
	The police initially did not accept Trinamuls charge that the forces firing caused the Sabbars death. But late in the night, home secretary Ardhendu Sen said: When the mob attacked the police for the second time, the police fired and one person was killed.        
	Sen said a CPM procession was attacked by Trinamul supporters, sparking the exchange of bombs and bricks. The procession was attacked twice. The police opened fire in self-defence, he said.        
	But Abdul Hakim, Trinamul block president in Bhangar-I, said party workers were holding a meeting in Shaksahar village when CPM supporters hurled bombs at them. The CPM took out a march in the area and while passing our meeting spot, they hurled bombs at us, he said.        
	Abdur Rezzak Mollah, who is the land and land reforms minister, said the opposite. He said that around 12.30pm, some Trinamul supporters threw bombs and fired at the CPM procession. Trinamul supporters hurled bombs at the procession of the CPM. They also fired shots.         
	The police said a team of about 10 personnel was escorting the CPM supporters.         
	When the clash broke out, the policemen baton-charged. It failed to disperse the mob and reinforcements were sought from Bhangar police station. Twenty minutes later, a bigger force and Rapid Action Force jawans reached the spot and resorted to a lathicharge again. They burst tear gas shells and fired four rounds. One bullet hit Sabbar.

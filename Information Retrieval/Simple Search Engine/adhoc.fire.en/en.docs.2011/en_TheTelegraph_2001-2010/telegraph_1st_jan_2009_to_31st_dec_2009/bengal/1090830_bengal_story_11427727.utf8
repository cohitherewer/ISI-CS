The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Calcutta catch in zoo theft
                                                                                                               Calcutta catch in zoo theft
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Aug. 29: Police today arrested a man who trades in rare animals at Nagerbazar on the suspicion that he had helped steal eight Common Marmosets from Alipore zoo.        
	The arrest of Sujoy Das alias Bubai Bangali came a day after Chhattisgarh police found seven of the eight monkeys alive in Durg and arrested Raj Saikia alias Rajesh, who named Sujoy as one of his associates.         
	An inter-state gang led by Raj, who is from Guwahati, had been instrumental in stealing the marmosets, the police believe.         
	Chhattisgarh police caught Raj, who is in his early thirties, after an officer posed as a customer to buy the monkeys. The police had specific information that Raj was looking for buyers.        
	On August 9, eight Common Marmosets of Brazilian origin were stolen from the zoo. The rare monkeys, the size of large rats, are worth around Rs 1 lakh each in the illicit wildlife market.        
	Raj has already named a few persons from Calcutta and we are working on it. It appears he got acquainted with some people from the city when they were lodged in the same jail in Pune, said Jawed Shamim, DIG (headquarters). This is the work of an inter-state gang that was selling rare animals for a long time. We hope to tie up the Calcutta end of the gang soon.        
	Preliminary investigations have revealed that Raj was arrested earlier in Pune for selling rare macaws. He also has cases against him in Mumbai.         
	We planned a trap, Deepanshu Kabra, Durg superintendent of police, said. A member of our squad posed as a buyer and a deal was finalised at Rs 5 lakh for each monkey. Raj was asked to come to Khursipar, on the outskirts of Bhilai, to collect the cash on Friday evening.         
	He appeared with another person, Ashoke Karai, and was arrested.         
	Sources said Raj named Bubai (or Sujoy) as a person dealing with rare animals in Calcutta. Shamim said: We have checked his (Sujoys) phone conversations. Its clear he spoke to Raj several times before the theft.

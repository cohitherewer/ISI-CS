The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Bail for jailed Singur leader
                                                                                                               Bail for jailed Singur leader
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                          Suhrid Dutta                                  
	Calcutta, Feb. 11: The high court today granted bail to CPM leader Suhrid Dutta and party supporter Debu Malik, accepting their lawyers submission that the trial courts conviction of the duo for Tapasi Maliks rape and murder was based on probability and not specific proof.        
	A Hooghly court had sentenced the former Singur zonal committee secretary of the CPM and Debu to life last November.        
	They have been in jail since being arrested by the CBI in June 2007.         
	The order will provide a breather to the CPM, embarrassed by senior party man Duttas conviction. However, the duos appeal against the lower courts order is still pending.        
	Before the division bench of Justices P.K. Chattopadhyay and A.K. Roy, the CBIs lawyers opposed the argument that the conviction was not based on specific proof.        
	State CPM secretary Biman Bose said: We were always convinced about Suhrids innocence. He is an honest person and a gentleman. He did not mention Debu.        
	Trinamul Congress leader Mamata Banerjee saw a conspiracy in the arrest on bribery charge and consequent removal of the CBI officer handling the case. In every important case, from Rizwanur Rahmans death to Tapasi Malik, investigating officers are being implicated in some case or the other and removed. The people of Singur will bring out a procession tomorrow demanding the CPM duos hanging.        
	On the morning of December 18, 2006, the burnt body of 18-year-old Tapasi, an anti- land acquisition activist, was found in a pit inside what was then the Nano project site. She had been raped and murdered.

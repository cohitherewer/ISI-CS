                                                                        Tuesday , November 17 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                              Suman sidelined, on MP cash and on stage
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Nachiketa and Suman                                
	Calcutta, Nov. 16: Trinamul Congress leader Mamata Banerjee today shrugged off as trivial her Jadavpur MP Kabir Sumans outburst against her party yesterday .        
	Suman carried on with his tirade, saying local Trinamul leaders, specifically South 24-Parganas party chief Sovan Chatterjee, were not allowing him to use his local area development funds for the people.        
	At the end of a party core committee meeting that discussed Suman, Mamata said: It is a trivial matter. Kabir Suman is not a Trinamul man. He is a Left-leaning intellectual. Moreover, he is an artiste whom we had brought into the party as a guest. His complaint about the performance of the party-controlled rural bodies may be genuine but it is his personal opinion.        
	Suman said he had nothing against Mamata but I am fed up with leaders who are preventing me from carrying out development projects.         
	The MP alleged that Chatterjee had wanted a free hand in spending money from his fund. But I could not buy his argument, Suman said. Am I a fool? Sovan wanted me to sit at home and sign papers. That wasnt possible for me.         
	The MP said he had to protest the manner in which he was sidelined in the organisation. Im not being taken seriously, Im only asked to sing, Suman said. I will be happy if Mamata asks me to quit. Or, I will ask the Speaker to provide me a different seat.        
	Yesterday, Suman said he felt suffocated in the party.         
	Today, he said he had drawn Mamatas attention a few times to the interference by local leaders. But Mamata is busy and she told me I should not worry as she herself is overseeing my constituency.         
	But is there more to the singers outburst than his inability to work for his people?        
	A Trinamul leader said the key word was that he was feeling sidelined.        
	During Mamatas Lok Sabha poll campaign, he was the one who did the singing and kept the crowds entertained. Even after the polls, he was on the dais with his guitar at the opening of Metros extended run from Tollygunge.        
	Since then, in programme after programme attended by railway minister Mamata, Nachiketa has done all the singing.        
	Some celebrities have huge egos and struggle to accept a situation where they find themselves eclipsed, the leader said. Suman has been telling people close to him that Trinamul has used him and his songs to get close to the farmers of Singur and Nandigram. Now that the battle has been won, he is not liking the fact that Didi is giving him the short shrift and Nachiketa is hogging the limelight.        
	A Trinamul secretary blamed Sumans inconsistent behaviour for Mamatas disenchantment with him. Despite being a core committee member, he rarely attends meetings. Without informing the party, he disappears and is reluctant to take instructions.        
	Suman skipped the core committee huddle today.         
	Asked about the MPs charges, Chatterjee refused comment but said that he had explained my stand to Didi.         
	Trinamul sources said Mamata spoke to Suman during the day and asked him to submit his complaint in writing. She also admonished Chatterjee for misbehaving with the party MP.

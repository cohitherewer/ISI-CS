The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Mamata bash, CM bashing
                                                                                                               Mamata bash, CM bashing
          CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE                           Mamata Banerjee at Netaji Indoor Stadium. (Aranya Sen)                                  
	Calcutta, April 14: Mamata Banerjee was humming popular Bengali tunes, chewing candies and obliging autograph hunters. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee was lamenting the loss of the Nano and thundering at rivals.         
	Sixteen evenings before the first phase of the polls in Bengal, the states two main leaders were seen in contrasting moods.         
	While a glum-faced Bhattacharjee was addressing party workers at Birlapur in Budge Budge from the dais, Mamata was seated among the 500-plus audience at Netaji Indoor Stadium for a cultural programme that stretched late into the night on the eve of the Bengali New Year.         
	Paschim Banga Sanskritik Mancha, a fledgling forum of people from the world of arts, had organised the programme  Jai Hok, Jai Hok, Nava Arunoday (Let victory be yours, let there be a new sunrise).         
	This is a cultural programme to mark the beginning of the Bengali New Year. There is nothing political about it and we have invited people from all sections of the society, said Suvaprasanna, an artist known to be close to Mamata.         
	The others on the list of organisers  theatre personalities Bibhas Chakraborty and Bratya Basu  are also believed to be close to the Trinamul Congress leader.         
	Mamata and her lieutenants Partha Chatterjee and Sudip Bandopadhyay received a warm welcome when they entered the venue around 6pm.         
	The organisers had invited her and so she is here. She loves to attend cultural programmes, said Chatterjee, seated next to Mamata.         
	The mix of invitees  writer Mahasweta Devi lighting the inaugural lamp, poet Joy Goswami reciting his poems and Basu enacting his play  was an indication that the show was stitched together to suit the Trinamul leaders preferences. To add a dash of Bollywood, the organisers also got singer Abhijeet.         
	Mamata appeared at ease from the beginning as she chatted to the organisers before settling in for the show. In between, she fiddled with her phone, swayed to her favourite tunes, bought candies  borrowing money from Chatterjee  and even requested Pratul Mukhopadhyay for one of her favourite songs, Phiriye Dao.         
	I was sitting two rows behind her and could see her humming Pratul Mukhopadhyays Aami Banglar Gaan Gai when the singer was performing on the stage, said a middle-aged woman, flashing an autograph of Mamata on a piece of paper.         
	While Mamata started relaxing with music, Bhattacharjee ended his day at Birlapur iterating his mission.         
	We didnt get the Tata Motors plant in Singur but we will surely set up a factory on the same plot in Singur. This time, we wont stop, we will go ahead with our plans, he said as party workers broke into an applause.         
	At the other end of the city, the person behind the Nanos exit from Bengal was cheering performers at the soiree.        
	Mamata left the stadium around 11 and went to the Kalighat temple past midnight. She spent 20 minutes there.

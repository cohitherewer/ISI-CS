The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Rajdhani FIR, with names
                                                                                                               Rajdhani FIR, with names
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Demonstrators surround the Rajdhani on Friday. (Ananda Das)                                  
	Chinsurah, Oct. 30: A Rajdhani was again blocked today, this time for two hours by passengers protesting the late running of a local train in which they travel daily to Sealdah.        
	However, unlike in the case of the train stopped by Mao- ists and their supporters on Tuesday, the FIR lodged by the railways in Hooghlys Dankuni today named those who allegedly led the protest.        
	After the blockade in West Midnapores Banstala, the railways had filed an FIR against unknown persons, inviting charges that railway minister Mamata Banerjee was soft on the Maoists.         
	Over 500 people stopped the Howrah-bound Rajdhani about 20km from Calcutta at 9.40 this morning.         
	A railway official said the passengers became agitated when the 9.16am Sealdah local was kept waiting to let the Rajdhani pass.         
	The blockade was lifted around 11.40am following assurances from senior railway officials that they would try to ply local trains on schedule.        
	Among those named in the FIR was Mausami Banerjee, who said she worked in an IT firm in Sector V. She has been charged with unlawful assembly on railway tracks and preventing government officials from performing their duty.        
	The report lodged with the Government Railway Police has two other names.         
	Mausami Banerjee, Pravat De and Abhijit Pal have been named in the FIR. They led todays demonstration, said Belur GRP officer-in-charge Sujoy Tunga.         
	The charges can lead to seven days imprisonment and fine.        
	Mausami said she and the other passengers lost their patience when they discovered that the Dankuni-Sealdah local was being held up again for the Rajdhani.         
	This always happens and, while we get late for work, the Rajdhani passengers move on, the woman said. This is unfair and so our protest.         
	Jyotirmoy Karmakar, 40, who was on the Rajdhani, would not buy Mausamis argument. It seems stopping the Rajdhani Express has become part of Bengals culture. Thank God they did not smash the windows as they had done in Banstala, he said.         
	Wanted Maoist Santosh Patra had led the mob in Banstala. He has admitted to have led the blockade to secure the release of Maoist-backed Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities leader Chhatradhar Mahato. But the railways have not named Patra.        
	The Trinamul Congress has said it is for the police to find out the culprits.

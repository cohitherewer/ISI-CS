The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Trinamul role in Rajdhani blockade
                                                                                                               Trinamul role in Rajdhani blockade
          BARUN GHOSH                          A Rajdhani window smashed during the blockade                                  
	Calcutta, Oct. 31: A Trinamul Congress probe has found the involvement of several party activists in Tuesdays Raj-dhani blockade, suggesting that either Mamata Banerjees efforts to distance herself from the Maoists had not percolated to the grassroots or they are too petrified to snap ties with the rebels.        
	The partys Jhargram unit had conducted the probe at the instance of state leaders following internal reports that many Trinamul activists had joined the siege at Banstala.         
	Banstala comes under the Trinamul-controlled Bandgora gram panchayat and many of our supporters were with the Peoples Committee (Against Police Atrocities) during the siege, said Gauranga Pradhan, a Trinamul general secretary from West Midnapore.         
	The probe report has been sent to district leaders in Midnapore town and state leaders in Calcutta, he added.         
	West Midnapore Trinamul president Mrigen Maity refused to reveal the contents of the report but admitted that a considerable number of lower-level party workers were with the Peoples Committee under pressure.         
	Party members and workers are helpless in the Jhargram, Binpur, Belpahari and Salboni areas of West Midnapore. The Peoples Committee has been using them as a shield to step up their anti-government movement. Tell me, what will our activists do in the face of constant threats? he asked.         
	State Trinamul leaders preferred not to comment on the report. I am not aware of it. I dont know if it has been sent to Mamatadi (Mamata Banerjee), said state party president Subrata Bakshi.         
	According to a section of Trinamul leaders, besides party activists involvement in the blockade, three other factors have added fuel to the CPM campaign to establish our links with the committee.        
	First, East Midnapore district president and junior central minister Sisir Adhikaris public admission that he was aware in advance of the impending train blockade.        
	Being a party veteran from East Midnapore, Sisirda should not have made such a statement. CPM leaders, including the chief minister, have cited it as proof of our links with the committee, said a Trinamul vice-president.         
	Second, the role played by two Naxalite leaders now associated with Mamata to end the siege. The blockade would have lasted longer had they not initiated a dialogue with the committee, said a Trinamul leader from south Calcutta.        
	These Naxalites had joined Mamatas Save Farmland Committee during the Singur-Nandigram movement. But they have been calling the shots in the organisation of late with Mamatas support, alleged a Trinamul secretary from North 24-Parganas.         
	Finally, the railways failure to lodge an FIR naming those who had led the blockade.         
	Railway minister Mamata has been accused of trying to shield the culprits.

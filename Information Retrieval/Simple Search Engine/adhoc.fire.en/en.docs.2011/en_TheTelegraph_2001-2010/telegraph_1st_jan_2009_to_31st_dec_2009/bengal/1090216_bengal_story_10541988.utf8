                                                                                                               Delhi nod to deal with Mamata
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 15: The Congress high command has greenlighted the proposed alliance with Mamata Banerjee.        
	AICC sources in Delhi said tonight that the party brass took the decision after Mohsina Kidwai, their Bengal pointman, briefed the leadership about the outcome of yesterdays meeting with state Congress leaders in Calcutta.         
	Kidwai was here to seek the leaders views on the possible tie-up. Most of them had wanted a pact on honourable terms and left the final decision to the high command.         
	In her report to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, Kidwai said the state Congress leaders were in favour of the alliance, an AICC functionary said from Delhi.         
	Mamata refused comment on the developments. You wont get me to utter a word on the talks for the alliance at this juncture, she told reporters.        
	An aide said: Didi will talk to the Congress chief first. They will finalise the deal when Didi reaches Delhi to attend Parliament next week.        
	Mamata exchanged pleasantries with Congress leader Subrata Mukherjee at the wedding of MLA Partha Chatterjees daughter last night.

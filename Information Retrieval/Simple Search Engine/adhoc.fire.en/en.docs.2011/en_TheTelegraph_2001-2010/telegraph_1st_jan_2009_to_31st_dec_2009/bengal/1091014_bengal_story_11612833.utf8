The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CM cites leak, skirts Maoist plan
                                                                                                               CM cites leak, skirts Maoist plan
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 13: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today chided his allies for leaking news to media and refrained from discussing with them his talks with the Prime Minister on the offensive against Maoists.        
	After the Left Front meeting this morning, Forward Bloc veteran Ashok Ghosh said we couldnt discuss either his Delhi visit or the issues related to the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) as Buddha was in a hurry.         
	I wanted to know about his talks with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and home minister P. Chidambaram, but Buddha said he was in a hurry to leave, Ghosh said.         
	Sources said Bhattacharjee was peeved after water resources minister Nandagopal Bhattacharya, of the CPI, complained that the chief minister had not convened a meeting of the cabinet core committee for long, though discussions on several issues were pending.         
	The minister wanted a discussion on his suggestions of pro-poor welfare measures that he had articulated in his reply to the chief ministers note on the governments course correction after the ruling Lefts successive poll debacles.         
	But the chief minister shot back by accusing his allies of compromising official secrecy. Why should I convene the cabinet core committee meeting if the notes circulated among you and the discussions are leaked to the media? If the front agrees today that no such thing will happen again, I will call a meeting of the committee, Bhattacharjee said.         
	The allies agreed and the chief minister promised to call a core committee meeting soon.         
	But it was not clear whether that meeting would discuss the anti-terror law. Front chairman and CPM state secretary Biman Bose said the core committee would delve into the states moves to contain price rise and its demands from the Centre on the issue.         
	Some of the allies felt the chief minister avoided discussing the Maoist crackdown today to ensure the differences among the partners did not spill out a day after he promised the Prime Minister full support.         
	The allies continued to harp on their opposition to the anti-terror laws provisions for preventive detention. We expressed our strong reservation about the arrests under the UAPA in Bengal and demanded a discussion on the issue, the RSPs Kshiti Goswami said after his partys bipartite talks with the CPM before the front meeting.         
	The RSP also protested the CPMs decision to support to the Congress in the Siliguri mayors election.         
	CPI state secretary Manjukumar Mazumdar said: We are still opposed to the use of the central law here. But it was not on the agenda today.         
	However, the CPM feels there is no point talking about democratic niceties when the Maoists are killing our comrades. The allies are enjoying the fruits of power piggybacking on us but are making sympathetic noises towards Maoist politics, a CPM state secretariat member said.         
	Front candidates        
	The front today named its candidates for the November 7 byelections to 10 assembly seats and chalked out a series of rallies and conventions to protest price rise and the anarchy unleashed by the Trinamul Congress.        
	Former transport minister Subahs Chakrabortys widow Ramala has been picked for Belgachhia East.         
	Although Chakraborty had won by only 1749 votes in 2006, the party hopes Ramala will ride the sympathy wave that swept the city on her husbands last journey.         
	SFI leader Kaustav Chatterjee has been picked for Alipore. The others are Pankaj Ghosh (Bongaon), Prasanta Mukherjee (Serampore), Satyendranath Ponda (Contai South), Probodh Sinha (Egra), Benoy Kerketta (Kalchini), Dhanapati Roy (Rajgunj), Ali Imran (Goalpokhar) and Mohammad Esaruddin Mondal (Sujapur).

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Siliguri support from CPI
                                                                                                               Siliguri support from CPI
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 4: The CPM today got a shot in the arm when partner CPI endorsed its move to support the Congress in the Siliguri mayors election.         
	We see nothing wrong in the Siliguri move. We are running political parties, not Bharat Sevashram (a philanthropic organisation). There is no harm in using an opportunity to break Opposition unity, said the CPI veteran and water resources minister Nandagopal Bhattacharya.         
	The Forward Bloc has already extended support to the CPM, though the RSP criticised the step yesterday.         
	I dont think it will send a wrong message to our supporters. Our opposition to the Congress at the Centre and the state remains, Bhattacharya said.         
	Asked about the possible use of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act against Maoist sympathisers, the minister said: There is no harm in interrogation and action can be taken if needed. But he declined comment on the chief secretarys statement yesterday of using the act against Maoist sympathisers. Let us know it from Buddha (the chief minister), Bhattacharya said.

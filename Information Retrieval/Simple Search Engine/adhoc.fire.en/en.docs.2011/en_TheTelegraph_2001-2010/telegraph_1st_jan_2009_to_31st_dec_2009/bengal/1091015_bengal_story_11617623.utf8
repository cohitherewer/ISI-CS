          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Midnapore, Oct. 14: Police have planned to file a slew of fresh cases, from arson and abduction to murder, in their bid to get Chhatradhar Mahato back in their custody from judicial remand.        
	They petitioned the additional chief judicial magistrates court in Jhargram town on Monday to add a murder to the list of charges already filed against the Maoist-backed tribal resistance leader there.        
	Another case will be filed soon in Midnapore, for the murder of two CPM supporters in Salboni, adjoining Lalgarh, in April. The lynching had followed a kangaroo court trial held by activists of the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities, led by Mahato.        
	On June 14, CPM supporter Prabir Mahato was picked up from his house near Lalgarh town by alleged Peoples Committee activists. He was never found. On August 14, his brother Amiya lodged an FIR alleging Prabir had been murdered and naming Mahato among the accused.        
	A West Midnapore police officer said Mahatos custody was essential to find out more about his Maoist bosses. We need to have Chhatradhar in our custody because he has a lot of information about the Maoists and their activities, including how they smuggled arms into Lalgarh, he said.        
	But the Jhargram court has already turned down a plea to extend Mahatos police custody. So the need to file cases in Midnapore as well.        
	When the police petitioned the Jhargram additional chief judicial magistrate for further police custody of Mahato on Saturday, the judge accused them of not being able to get much out of him in the three days he was with them. He said the case diary did not mention any fresh development and refused to extend the remand. The same judge will hear the August murder charge against Mahato tomorrow.        
	A team of CID officials led by additional director-general Raj Kanojia held a meeting with senior West Midnapore police officers and lawyers on Monday to find ways to get Chhatradhars custody.        
	The Bengal police also fear that their Jharkhand counterparts might get Mahatos custody in connection with the cases lodged against him there and he might become more inaccessible to them.         
	Mahatos jail custody ends on October 23. He will have to be produced in a court in the neighbouring state on October 19. We need to have him in our custody by October 18, said a CID officer.        
	The other charges against Mahato are waging war against the state, having a hand in the demolition of the police outpost at Ramgarh, near Lalgarh, and two attempts to blow up police patrols.

                                                                                                               Teenagers newborn stolen to hide shame
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Behrampore, Jan. 5: A girl born out of wedlock to two minors has been stolen from a Behrampore nursing home, allegedly to be sold by the family of the boy to cover up shame.        
	Jahanara Khatoon (name changed) has told police that her lover Abduls mother told her she would sell the baby to avoid people making fun of them.        
	Yesterday, the parents of the girl lodged a complaint of rape against 16-year-old Abdul Sheikh (name changed) with whom their daughter had a relationship for almost a year.        
	Jahanaras parents came to know that the child was missing when they visited her at the nursing home on Saturday. They lodged a complaint against Abduls parents accusing them of stealing the child.         
	Abdul, a student of Class X in the same school as Jahanara, has been arrested. Their families, who are farmers, are neighbours in Jalangi, Murshidabad, about 250km from Calcutta. Abduls parents are absconding.         
	Abdul, the son of Jamal Sheikh, had fallen in love with Jahanara a year ago. Jahanara became pregnant eight months ago. She said she kept mum because the boy had promised to marry her. But he did not tell his parents about his relationship, said a police officer in Jalangi.        
	At an advanced state of pregnancy, Jahanara spoke to Abduls mother, Shamsunnahar Bibi. His mother told me to stay quiet. She said after the child is born, there would be a marriage. I told my mother about this and our families stayed silent on the matter, Jahanara said from her nursing home.         
	On December 29, she gave birth to a girl.         
	Last Friday, Abduls mother came to the nursing home and told me she would sell the child otherwise people would make fun of us. I agreed. She picked up the child from the cot and left, said Jahanara.        
	We have arrested the boy and detained the nursing home owner. But the boys parents are absconding, said Subir Ghosh, officer-in-charge of Jalangi police station.

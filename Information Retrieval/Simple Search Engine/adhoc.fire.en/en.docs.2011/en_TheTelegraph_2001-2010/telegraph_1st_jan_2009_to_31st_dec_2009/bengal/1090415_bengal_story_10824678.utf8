The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Uncle cold to Mausams ice-breaker
                                                                                                               Uncle cold to Mausams ice-breaker
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Malda, April 14: Mausam Noor today tried to break the ice with uncle Abu Naser Khan Chowdhury on family patriarch Ghani Khans third death anniversary, but the effort appeared to have come unstuck.        
	At 10am, Mausam and her elder sister Sayeda called on Naser at his room in their Kotwali house and remained closeted for around 15 minutes, raising hopes of a thaw in their relations, cold since the Congress high command nominated Mausam instead of Naser from the Malda North seat.         
	When the trio emerged from the room and went to Ghani Khans tomb nearby to pay their respects, a train of Congress leaders and supporters followed.        
	The scene was solemn, but journalists kept persisting that Naser bless Mausam. As soon as he put his hands on her head, the Congress supporters burst out in applause, annoying Naser and his other brother Abu Hashem, the Congress candidate from Malda South.        
	Is today an occasion to make merry? What message will go out if Congress workers make merry taking advantage of this occasion? said Naser.         
	Hashem said: The entire family is in mourning and remembering our elder brother. I do not know why this happened (the applause by Congress supporters). There are some within the party who are trying to create an unnecessary tension in the family.        
	Naser has been sulking since the party brass rejected his plea for a ticket after he failed to dispel their doubts about his Indian citizenship. He had said the decision would harm the party and refused to campaign for his niece.        
	Asked about the meeting with Mausam today, Naser said: She did not formally ask for my forgiveness. She did not request me to come for her campaigns, so why should I volunteer? I will have to stand by my brother (Hashem).        
	Naser had said on Saturday that he would take a break from politics and go on a months holiday to south India. Today, he appeared to have changed his mind. I have to remain here and ensu- re that Dalu (Hashem) wins by a large margin. I am drawing up a schedule of rallies I will attend in Malda South, Naser said.        
	Mausam said she had gone to her uncles room to enquire about his health. We didnt discuss politics.

                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Eden blame 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 26: Home secretary Ardhendu Sen today said the CAB must take the blame for Thursdays lights fiasco at Eden Gardens.         
	The CAB has to be held responsible as it was the games organiser, Sen said. If I invite someone home for a meal and there is something wrong with the food, I have to be held responsible. Even if there was a drop in voltage, the buck cant be passed on to (power utility) CESC.        
	He ruled out any sabotage in the lights suddenly going blink during the India-Sri Lanka match. However, two days after police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti threatened to disallow day-night matches at the Eden till the floodlight problem was sorted out, Sen said: We want matches to be played there.

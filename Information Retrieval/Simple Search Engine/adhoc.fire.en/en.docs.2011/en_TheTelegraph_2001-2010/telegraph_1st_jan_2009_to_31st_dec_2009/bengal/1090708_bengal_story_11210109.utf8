The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | BSNL fire hits 70000 phones 
                                                                                                               BSNL fire hits 70000 phones 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, July 7: Around 70,000 landline phones and 10,000 broadband connections went on the blink tonight after a fire forced BSNL to shut down its mother exchange on Hungerford Street.        
	The fire broke out at the transmission room of BSNLs Circus Telephone Exchange on Hungerford Street around 9pm.        
	 We had to shut down the exchange to avoid further problems. As a result, around 70,000 landline connections and 10,000 broadband lines could be affected. However, we will try to resolve the problem as soon as possible. Our primary focus is to help fire and emergency officials to control the fire, D.C. Basu, the city general manager of BSNL, said at 11pm.        
	Other officials later said the lines went out of action in parts of south and central Calcutta. Broadband and telephone services to 55 exchanges under the mother exchange are under threat, they added.        
	The telephone and broadband connections at the Palm Avenue residence of chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee are also on the probable list of affected consumers, a fire official said.        
	The officials added that 3,000 lease lines and 50-60 satellite connections could also be affected.         
	Fifteen fire tenders were fighting the blaze till the wee hours of Wednesday. Thick black smoke was swirling out of the first-floor windows of the three storeyed office.        
	The smoke billowing out of the room made the work difficult for the firemen. We had to break the windowpanes from outside to let the smoke out. The cause of the fire is yet to be ascertained, but preliminary reports suggest short circuit, said a fire service official.        
	Its shocking. I just hope the firemen can get the fire under control as early as possible. Its difficult to breathe as the air is filled with the smoke, said designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee, who lives in a high-rise in the neighbourhood.

	Behrampore, Oct. 5: Eight people died in Murshidabad today when their overcrowded trekker rammed into a truck on a national highway.        
	All the people who died were among the 20 passengers in the trekker that had the capacity to carry only nine people.         
	Police said the trekker started for Beldanga from Ratanpur around 9.45am with the 20 passengers. The trekker was overcrowded and when it reached Sargachhi, it suddenly lost control and swerved to the right and hit a truck head-on, said a police officer.        
	Three persons died on the spot and three on way to Behrampore New General Hospital. Two others died later.

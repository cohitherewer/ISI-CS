The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Congress wary of Mamata alliance
                                                                                                               Congress wary of Mamata alliance
  - Bypoll nomination ruffles feathers         BARUN GHOSH                          Mohsina Kidwai: Peeved?                                        
	Calcutta, Jan. 27: The Congress central leadership today appeared uncertain about going for an alliance with Mamata Banerjee ahead of the Lok Sabha polls after she announced her candidate for an Assembly bypoll without speaking a word to her prospective ally.        
	We might field our own candidate in Bishnupur West since Mamata did not discuss anything with us before announcing her nominee. A decision will be taken at a meeting with Pranabda (Mukherjee, the foreign minister) tomorrow, Mohsina Kidwai, the party general secretary in charge of Bengal, said from Delhi.         
	On his return from Colombo, Pranab, also the state Congress president, will discuss the candidate for the bypoll and Mamata, Kidwai said.         
	She expressed doubts on whether an alliance could at all be worked out with the Trinamul Congress leader. Mamata could have given us a phone call before announcing her candidate. No electoral alliance can be worked out if she takes unilateral decisions.        
	State Congress working presidents Pradip Bhattacharya and Subrata Mukherjee, and legislature party chief Manas Bhuniya have been called to Delhi for tomorrows meeting.         
	Bhuniya, among those opposed to any truck with Mamata, today said: No alliance should be forged hampering the partys image. She shouldnt be allowed to dictate terms.        
	The Trinamul chief had last week announced party youth wing chief Madan Mitras candidature. Mitra, known to be part of Mamatas inner circle, had lost to the CPM nominee by 4,000 votes in 2006.         
	The Congress, however, had played a key role in the result, winning 15,000 votes.        
	State Congress general secretary Deepa Das Munshi said she was happy that the high command shared her views on Mamatas double standards. Mohsinaji agreed with me that it was unfair on Mamatas part to field a candidate unilaterally at a time she is advocating an alliance with us.        
	The Trinamul chief also invited criticism from some in her own ranks. At a time she is harping on the need to avert a split in Opposition votes, she should have asked the Congress brass before announcing Madans name, said a leader from south Calcutta.         
	A Mamata aide said: We may be comfortably placed having won the South 24-Parganas zilla parishad, but the Congresss votes may be crucial.         
	Mamata refused comment, but she went into a huddle tonight, to discuss strategy for the (February 26) bypoll.        
	The last day for pulling out nominations is February 9.

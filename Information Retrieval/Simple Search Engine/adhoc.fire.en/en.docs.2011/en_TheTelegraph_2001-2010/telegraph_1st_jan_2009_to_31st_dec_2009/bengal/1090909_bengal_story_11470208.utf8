The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | IISCO strike
                                                                                                               IISCO strike
                            
	Durgapur, Sept. 8: Work on the expansion of IISCO came to a halt and production at the Burnpur plant took a blow as some 9,000 Citu supporters engaged on contract went on a strike today demanding higher wages among other things.        
	Among those on strike are 4,000 workers hired on contract by the steel plant and another 5,000 engaged by contractors. They blocked gates and forced about 11,000 willing workers, also engaged by a contractor, to stop construction at the expansion site.         
	The union also wants about 2,000 contract labourers working for over 10 years to be absorbed. The 9,000 permanent staff, however, are working normally.         
	The management said talks were on with the union.

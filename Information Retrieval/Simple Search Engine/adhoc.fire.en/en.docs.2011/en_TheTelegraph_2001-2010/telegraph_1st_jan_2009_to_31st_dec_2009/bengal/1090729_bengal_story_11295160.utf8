The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Cong beats ally to civic body   Mamata cries treachery
                                                                                                               Cong beats ally to civic body   Mamata cries treachery
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	July 28: At a time the Congress and the Trinamul Congress are struggling to strike a deal over two Assembly seats, relations between the two suffered a jolt with the Grand Old Party upstaging its ally and forming a municipal board after cross-voting.        
	Mamata Banerjee called the development in Howrahs Uluberia a betrayal of the people.        
	What the Congress has done amounts to treachery, betrayal of the people. The party took the support of one Left councillor and two from the BJP to keep Trinamul out of power. This is a reprehensible political decision and goes against the avowed policy of alliance, she said before leaving for Delhi.        
	A Trinamul general secretary said it was bound to impact the talks in the capital to break the impasse over the Sealdah and Bowbazar Assembly seats, where bypolls are scheduled for August 18.        
	Mamata wants to field candidates from both places and the Congress, which had won the seats in 2006, wants at least one of them.         
	Cross-voting in the formation of municipal and panchayat boards is not new. Parties and their elected members frequently switch sides. But ob- servers feel the timing of the Congress-Trinamul rift in Uluberia gives it an added dimension.         
	In the 29-member Uluberia municipality, where voting took place through secret ballots, the Congress bagged 13 votes and Trinamul 12.        
	The Congress originally had 10 councillors and Trinamul 11. The Congresss strength rose to 11 with the lone Independent pledging support.         
	But today, the Congress tally rose by two to 13.         
	Although the Left, with five councillors, had decided to abstain, one of the two Forward Bloc councillors took part along with two from the BJP.        
	The Congress claimed that two Trinamul councillors had voted for it, while the BJP duo and the Bloc representative sided with Trinamul.         
	However, Trinamul district president Arup Roy denied cross-voting from his ranks and claimed that the Independent had sided with the party to push its tally of 11 to 12.        
	In the evening, the BJPs Papiya Mondal said she had voted for the Congress along with her party colleague since they (the Congress) can work for development.        
	Howrah CPM secretary Srideep Bhattacharya said the front would inquire into why the Bloc councillor took part in the voting.         
	After the municipal polls, when the Independent decided to back the Congress and an 11-11 tie emerged, Trinamul representatives had met state Congress president Pranab Mukherjee for a solution. He suggested a formula on the lines of what had happened in Uttar Pradesh in the90s when Mayavatis BSP and the BJP had decided to share power for two-and-a-half years each.        
	Trinamul had agreed to give the Congress the first shot at power. But the Congress did not adhere to Pranabbabus formula and instead adopted unfair means, alleged Trinamul leader Roy.         
	State Congress working president Subrata Mukherjee insisted the Congress had won with the help of a Trinamul vote. It is wrong to point fingers at a party going by the result of a poll by secret ballot.

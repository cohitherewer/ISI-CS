The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Cong sticks to fair bargain
                                                                                                               Cong sticks to fair bargain
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, July 27: The Congresss demand for a fair bargain over the Sealdah and Bowbazar Assembly by-election seats is a sign that the party wants to come out of Mamata Banerjees shadow and revive itself in Bengal.        
	Wednesday is the last date for filing nominations for the two seats that go to polls on August 18, but the Congress and the Trinamul Congress are still trying to work out a deal.         
	Our leaders in Bengal are asking for two seats. Today, I requested Mamataji to give us at least one seat in the interest of the alliance. I am hopeful she will give us one seat, if not two, in response to my request, AICC general secretary K.Keshava Rao, who is in charge of Bengal, said over the phone from Delhi tonight.        
	The AICC leader said the Congress had a legitimate claim to at least one seat since the areas were traditional Congress strongholds.         
	It is up to Mamataji to decide whether she will give us Sealdah or Bowbazar. But I asked her not to push the Congress into the corner and undermine the party rank and file in Bengal by not giving even a single seat, Rao added.         
	Trinamul sources hinted that Mamata may reconsider the Congresss demand for one seat after Raos call.         
	We have staked claim to both Sealdah and Bowbazar. But Mamata may have second thoughts about two seats following the AICCs request, said a Trinamul source.        
	Going by the results of 2006 Assembly elections, both Sealdah and Bowbazar belong to Trinamul as Somen Mitra and Sudip Bandopadhyay, who won the seats on Congress tickets, moved to Trinamul.        
	Both won the Lok Sabha elections this time, on Trinamul Congress tickets.         
	Political observers said the Congresss new assertiveness to bargain for one of the two seats comes from its improved position at the national level.        
	The partys national leaders, including AICC general secretary Rahul Gandhi, are keen to revive the beleaguered organisation in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Bengal where it has been on the sidelines for several decades.         
	State Congress working president Subrata Mukherjee today said the party would abide by whatever decision the AICC takes regarding the two seats.         
	The Congress had last week requested Bengal Congress president Pranab Mukherjee to see if the party could contest both.         
	Both Bowbazar and Sealdah are traditional Congress strongholds and that is why we wanted to contest both. But we shall adhere to the AICCs directives. If the AICC asks us to accept one seat, we shall agree. Even if it asks us to leave out both, we will have to accept it since ours is a national party, Mukherjee added.         
	Tomorrow, the Left Front will announce its candidates for Sealdah and Bowbazar. Front sources said Minati Gomes, a lawyer, is the possible candidate for Bowbazar and Prabir Deb, Calcutta unit secretary of the CPI, would probably contest Sealdah.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Tamluk, Nov. 4: A Trinamul mob torched three CPM offices and ransacked another today in the first such attack in Left bastion Haldia.         
	It followed a call by local MP Subhendu Adhikari to make life miserable for Lakshman Seth, who used to be the areas CPM strongman till the partys successive electoral losses culminated in his own defeat.        
	Three of the offices burnt were of the CPM labour arm Citu, of which Seth is the district president.        
	Adhikari had told a rally: We will make life miserable for Lakshman Seth just as we have made life miserable for CPM leaders of Nandigram and Khejuri.        
	Nandigram and Khejuri, across the Hooghly, are former CPM strongholds from where the party has been wiped out. Some of its offices there had had to be shifted to Haldia following a spate of attacks.

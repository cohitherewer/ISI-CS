The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Deepa, Subrata spar over Mamata tie-up 
                                                                                                               Deepa, Subrata spar over Mamata tie-up 
  - Eye on Lok Sabha, bypoll politics hots up        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                        Deepa and Subrata				                                             
	Calcutta, Jan. 25: Squabbles in the Congress came to the fore today with MLA Deepa Das Munshi slamming Mamata Banerjee for unilaterally announcing her nominee for a bypoll and senior leader Subrata Mukherjee accusing his party colleague of trying to jeopardise efforts to forge an alliance.        
	A day after leading a procession through Mamatas Calcutta South constituency and charging her with trying to split the Congress, Deepa said: We shall not surrender our organisation at Mamatas feet simply for the sake of an electoral alliance.         
	Mamata had yesterday announced her candidate for the Bishnupur West bypoll on February 26: Trinamul Congress youth wing chief Madan Mitra.        
	At a time she is calling for an electoral alliance with us, shouldnt she have spoken to us before choosing her candidate for the bypoll? asked Deepa, a state Congress general secretary and wife of veteran leader Priya Ranjan.         
	People dont approve of Mamatas double standards, she said yesterday.         
	Subrata, a known Deepa critic, trained his guns on her for the Mamata-bashing. We are in the process of working out an alliance with Mamata and that is why one should not use any harsh words against her at this juncture.        
	Those who are speaking against Mamata are jeopardising our efforts to work out an alliance with the principal Opposition party, he told a rally in South 24-Parganas.         
	Congress sources said Deepa and Subrata were both using the possible alliance to serve their own purpose. Deepa is trying to hog the headlines and Subratada, eyeing a safe Lok Sabha seat near Calcutta, is trying to keep Mamata in good humour, a source said.        
	Working president Pradip Bhattacharya is learnt to have updated state party president Pranab Mukherjee on the goings-on.         
	Asked if he had reported the developments to Pranab, Bhattacharya avoided a direct reply. Im in regular touch with Pranabda.         
	Pranab is scheduled to come here on January 31.         
	Mamata was not available for comment as she had left for Raichak, along the banks of the Hooghly in South 24-Parganas, to take a break from hectic politics. Over the past few days, she had expressed her eagerness to forge an alliance with the Congress.         
	A Trinamul leader said: Didi does not attach any importance to someone whose political base is limited to north Bengal (Deepa). She will talk to Pranabda or someone assigned by Sonia Gandhi.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Farm varsity stopgap plan
                                                                                                               Farm varsity stopgap plan
                            
	Calcutta, Oct. 12: The government is mulling appointing an interim vice-chancellor at Bidhan Chandra Krishi Viswa Vidyalaya amid protests against alleged interference.        
	The university in Kalyani is an autonomous institution under the state agriculture department. The department sent a faxed message to the registrar today asking him to send three names for interim VC.        
	But the anti-Left teachers body is up in arms. Ours is an autonomous institution. The government cant appoint an interim VC this way. Our executive council is our highest policy-making body, said A. Zaman, vice-president of the Teachers Forum.        
	Ranjit Samanta had quit the VCs post last week, protesting harassment by the CPM- controlled teachers union.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Breather for Gandhi from Left cannons
                                                                                                               Breather for Gandhi from Left cannons
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Gopalkrishna Gandhi                                  
	Calcutta, Aug. 16: The CPM appears to have decided to hold its fire on governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi, though the party is unlikely to mend its rel-ations with Raj Bhavan right away, state party secretary Biman Bose indicated today.        
	Bose hinted he would not shoot back a letter in response to Gandhis note clarifying the Raj Bhavan stand after the CPM-led Left Front cast aspersions on his neutrality.        
	As the Left Front chairman, Bose neither reported Gandhis rejoinder to the partners at a meeting today nor included any fresh move against him on the agenda.        
	After the meeting, Bose said: He (Gandhi) said our complaints against him were based on inaccurate information. He also asked me to consult the chief minister as he had written to him (the chief minister) explaining his position. But I didnt try to understand him (the governor) by talking to the chief minister.        
	Apparently, the CPM does not want the bad blood to spill over and further sour Gandhis last four months in his first stint as Bengal governor. He may or may not get an extension.        
	The rancour, which began with Gandhis expression of cold horror during the Nandigram turmoil of 2007, was reignited last week when he voiced concern about the veritable tandava of political violence in Bengal and blamed those who can act but are not doing so for it.         
	A day after the tandava slur, the CPM hit back, under the aegis of the Left Front, accusing the governor of failing to make the distinction between the killers and the killed.         
	At todays meeting, however, Bose brushed aside veteran Benoy Konars description of Gandhi as a Trinamul Congress representative and objection to sending a team to him.        
	Konars comment came in the wake of a suggestion from Revolutionary Communist Party leader Mihir Bayen that a front team meet the governor on price rise as he is the Centres representative in the state.         
	A Left team will indeed meet the governor on the issue.         
	But the front is not immediately trying to cap the cannons that had fired at Gandhi. We said he had bracketed those who had been killed and their killers. He didnt reply to that charge. Neither did he claim neutrality in definitive terms, Bose said.        
	Subhas condolence        
	The condolence meeting for Subhas Chakraborty at his Salt Lake home this evening had a more varied crowd than the one held by the CPM on Friday.         
	From film stars and sportsmen to a swami, everyone eulogised the CPM leader. Party politburo member Brinda Karat shared the dais with expelled leader Somnath Chatterjee and estranged leaders Saifuddin Chowdhury and Samir Putatunda.         
	Brinda called Chakraborty our dear leader and added: We have learnt many lessons from him.         
	Congress leader Pranab Mukherjee and cricketer Kapil Dev sent their condolences.

	Midnapore: Maoists set fire to a CPM leaders house tonight with his wife, four daughters and a grandchild inside.        
	At midnight, firemen from Jhargram (10km away) and security forces from Binpur (16km away) were heading on foot towards the house because the guerrillas had blocked roads with tree trunks. The Binpur inspector-in-charge and three other cops were injured when a mine planted on the way went off.        
	The CPMs Binpur zonal committee secretary, Amiya Sengupta, was not at home when the guerrillas raided Dahijuri village. Before his three-storey house, they ransacked several others.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | City law for graffiti extended to state
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      City law for graffiti extended to state
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 22: The state government today passed an amendment bill reinforcing across the state a political partys right to deface private property with graffiti with the permission of the owner.        
	The government had repealed a 1976 law which the Election Commission had invoked to ban political graffiti during the 2006 Assembly polls that triggered resentment among both the ruling and Opposition parties.         
	A slew of legislation covering civic bodies in Calcutta, Howrah and the rest of the state was also tabled in the Assembly and sent for a Ho-use select committees sc- rutiny.        
	The amendment to the West Bengal Municipal Corporation Act will bring about parity between the municipal laws of Calcutta and Howrah and the rest of the state.         
	The bill will regularise rates civic bodies across the state can charge commercial advertisers. So far, such rates had been fixed only for Calcutta and Howrah.        
	The advertisers would need the property owners written consent as well as permission of the municipal bodies before using land or walls of private buildings.         
	They would have to pay a security deposit to the civic body and would risk forfeiture if the advertisement is not erased or removed within the prescribed time. Advertisers seeking publicity in fairs and cultural events would have to pay a surcharge.        
	Non-commercial as well as public interest advertisers, including political parties and their mass organisations, will enjoy free publicity and wont have to seek a civic bodys permission. They only need the property owners consent.         
	But they have to spare walls of state and central properties, hospitals and educational institutions.         
	The Trinamul Congress and the Congress did not oppose the bills.        
	Another bill passed aims to slap stiffer punishment, including attachment of property, on unscrupulous private finance companies.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Lalgarh extortion list out
                                                                                                               Lalgarh extortion list out
          NARESH JANA AND PRONAB MONDAL                                          
	Oct. 4: West Midnapore police have claimed that the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities forcibly collected at least Rs 80 lakh a month from Lalgarh and Binpur residents after quizzing a treasurer of the outfit.        
	Police sources said the sleuths in West Midnapore had seized a book with accounts records of the Maoist-backed outfit from Shukhshanti Baskey, the assistant treasurer, who was brought from Midnapore to Bhavani Bhavan, the headquarters of the CID in Calcutta, today.         
	The sources said the extortion figures were based on what was found in the accounts book and Baskeys interrogation in Midnapore.        
	The tribal committee treasurer, arrested on September 27, was brought to Calcutta because some of his confessions ran contradictory to what Chhatradhar Mahato, the leader of the outfit, told the police in Bhavani Bhavan. We are quizzing them together because we found discrepancies in their statements, said an officer.        
	Chhatradhar told us that the leaders of the committee were given specific responsibilities for funds collection. For example, Jatin Pratihar, the homoeopath from Kantapahari, collected money from primary school teachers, and the president of the committee, Lalmohan Tudu, was in charge of extorting high school teachers. This system was in place for the past 10 months, said an officer in Calcutta.        
	A West Midnapore police officer said: From the Lalgarh and Binpur police station areas, we have got a rough estimate that Rs 80 lakh was forcibly collected every month.         
	He also said that the letters demanding money that were sent to people of the area were signed by Tudu and committee secretary Sidhu Soren.        
	Around Rs 15 lakh was collected every month from teachers of 16 state-aided high schools, Rs 5 lakh from employees of 10 post offices and Rs 5 lakh from the staff in 10 banks, the police claimed. Forest officers, doctors, rice mill owners and gram panchayat members, all had to pay. (See chart)        
	A large part of the money went to the Maoists with which they purchased laptops and cameras for surveillance as well as arms, the police said. The Maoists used the cameras to record interviews given to journalists. They also recorded proceedings in kangaroo court trials. We have got some CDs, the officer added.        
	Members of the Maoist action squad who were recruited locally were paid between Rs 2,000 and Rs 3,000 a month. Villagers who participated in agitations got between Rs 50 and Rs 100, a source said.         
	In Calcutta, Mahato today identified some Maoist leaders from photographs and sketches the police showed him. The CID refused to disclose the leaders he had identified.        
	Mahato, however, could not identify a photograph of Kishanji, the chief of the Maoist guerrilla wing, and another of action squad leader Bikash.         
	We have an old photograph of Kishanji whom Mahato failed to identify. We know it has no similarity with Kishanjis face now. He could not recognise a picture which we think is of Bikash, said an officer.

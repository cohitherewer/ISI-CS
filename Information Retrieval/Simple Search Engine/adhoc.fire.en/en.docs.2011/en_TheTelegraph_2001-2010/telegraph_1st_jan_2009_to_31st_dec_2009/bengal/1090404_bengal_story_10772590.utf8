The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Power tonic for CPM cadres
                                                                                                               Power tonic for CPM cadres
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, April 3: The third front may or may not come to power but the CPM is keeping the option of joining a central government open to boost cadres and improve its poll prospects.        
	A state committee meeting today reviewed the Left Fronts prospects in the 19 Bengal districts and found it vulnerable in at least 16 seats. But state CPM secretary Biman Bose refused to be drawn on the numbers: Why should I go into numbers when we are fighting to win all the 42 seats? We want our rank and file to be confident.        
	Instead of figures, Bose, also the Left Front chairman, focused on the growing response from people on the partys campaign for a third front government. He said any decision on joining a central government would be based on the nature of the coalition after the polls and the Lefts strength in Parliament.        
	A state committee member from Burdwan hinted at the possible gains. Our supporters want us to share responsibility at the Centre. This will increase our standing among people and make the alternative (government) credible. Now its up to the party to decide.        
	Other leaders at todays closed-door meeting confirmed that the party was testing the waters, and spoke of having got positive feedback from the people.        
	Bose underlined the difference between the historic blunder of 1996, when the politburo had rejected Jyoti Basus stand in favour of joining the United Front government, and now. The Left has taken the initiative to forge unity among the third (front) forces (this time). The situation is different now.         
	The willingness of Bengal leaders, many of whom had opposed Basu in 1996, to look at a question that has long haunted the party reflects the change in their thinking but, at the same time, betrays their desperation to counter the threat from the Congress-Trinamul Congress alliance.        
	The Left had won 35 of Bengals 42 Lok Sabha seats in 2004. Its worst performance in its 32 years in power in the state was in 1984, when the tally fell to 26.        
	Bose today expressed apprehensions about stiff fights in several former strongholds. He urged Left cadres to go door to door and ensure that the usual monologue of the leaders was replaced by a a dialogue with the people.         
	Sources in the CPM said many of the 16 seats where the party was vulnerable were spread across south Bengal  North and South 24-Parganas, East Midnapore, Hooghly, Nadia and Calcutta.        
	The picture appears relatively better in north Bengal where the CPM hopes to gain at the expense of the Congress. A section of the party is hopeful about snatching Murshidabad, Malda North and Raiganj thanks to infighting in the Opposition ranks. The Congresss Mausam Noor, Deepa Das Munshi and Mannan Hossain are its main contenders in Malda North, Raiganj and Murshidabad.

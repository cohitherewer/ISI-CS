          OUR BUREAU                               
	Jan. 15: A WBCS officer was sacked today after the state vigilance commission found him guilty of misappropriating government money and forging documents.        
	An official in Writers Buildings said the chief minister had signed the order terminating the services of Abhijit Roy yesterday. The 1979-batch civil servant is posted as senior deputy collector in Birbhum.         
	Bisweswar Maity, the Birbhum district magistrate, said he had not received the order. Roy... is temporarily overseeing the job of the regional transport officer, he said.         
	Roy could not be contacted for comment.        
	An official in the chief ministers secretariat said Roy had allegedly misappropriated government funds during his tenure as a regional transport officer in Howrah in 1992-93. The official did not mention the amount.        
	The official was again hauled up for forging government documents as managing director of the West Bengal Scheduled Cast and Tribes Development Corporation in 2004. His job was terminated after a probe by the vigilance commission found him guilty of financial and other irregularities, he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Maoists slay CPM leader
                                                                                                               Maoists slay CPM leader
                            
	Midnapore, Aug. 26: Maoists last night slit the throat of a schoolteacher who had earlier been made to hold his ears and promise to dissociate himself from the CPM.        
	At Pirakata, 25km from Lalgarh town, Ratan Mahato, 50, had distanced himself from the party since but not quit.        
	About 20 people surrounded Ratans house around 9pm, said neighbour Bharat Mahato. They had rifles and were kicking the door. Ratans wife Sabita opened the door and they stormed in, said Bharat.        
	Ratan tried to escape through the rear but the attackers caught him, tied him up and took him away. We saw from behind a bush Ratan was made to kneel. We asked you to quit the party, you didnt, one of them barked. Then they started hitting him, said Bharat.        
	West Midnapore police chief Manoj Verma said supporters of the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities were also among the attackers.        
	In July, Ratan, who taught English and Bengali in the local high school, had been forced to do squats holding his ears. He became aloof from the party after that but did not put up posters declaring his dissociation with it, an officer said.

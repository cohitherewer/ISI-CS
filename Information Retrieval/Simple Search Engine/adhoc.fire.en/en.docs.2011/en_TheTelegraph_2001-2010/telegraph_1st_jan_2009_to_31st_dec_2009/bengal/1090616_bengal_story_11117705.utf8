          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, June 15: Calcutta High Court today asked the government to explain why it had failed to pay the court-ordered compensation to those injured and raped during the police firing in Nandigram on March 14, 2007.        
	Chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti has been asked to file an affidavit specifying the reasons by the first week of August.         
	A division bench of Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice P.C. Ghosh passed the order on a contempt petition by Kalyan Banerjee, who represents 146 villagers who were injured that day and three rape victims.         
	The court had ordered the compensation on November 16, 2007, while dubbing the firing unconstitutional. The money was to be given within six months.         
	The governments lawyer claimed that the delay was because the process of identifying the injured, as directed by the court, was not over. Many are making false claims that they were injured.        
	The payment was fixed at Rs 5 lakh each to the next of kin of the 14 people killed, Rs 2 lakh each for the rape victims and Rs 1 lakh each to the injured.        
	Banerjee said the payments to the families of the dead had been made, but not to the others. Not a singe rape victim or injured person has been paid yet, he said.

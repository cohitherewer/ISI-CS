The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Somnath barb from Cong ally Mamata
                                                                                                               Somnath barb from Cong ally Mamata
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, May 4: Mamata Banerjee today said Speaker Somnath Chatterjee had not done the right thing by defying the CPM whip during the trust motion moved by the government.         
	I may differ with the Congress in this regard. I feel Somnathbabu did not do the right thing when he defied the partys whip and did not quit the Speakers chair, the Trinamul Congress chief told STAR Ananda.        
	She was asked if Chatterjee was right to continue as the Speaker when the party had asked him to step down.         
	The government had called the trust vote on the nuclear deal, which the CPM had opposed.         
	The CPM central committee expelled Chatterjee from the party.         
	Asked about Trinamuls tie-up with the Congress, Mamata said the alliance was more firm this time than in the 2001 Assembly elections.        
	This time our alliance with the Congress is more firm than in the 2001 Assembly polls. In 2001, the Congress workers did not work with the us well and Independents were fielded against official nominees, she said.        
	Asked if she was unhappy with some Congress leaders, like Shankar Singh who had not yet participated in any joint campaign in Nadia, Mamata said: I dont like to comment on the Congresss internal matters. Congress workers and Nadia Congress president Ajoy De were with me while I was there.         
	She also called her former ally, the BJP, communal.         
	I hate the BJP for its communal politics. Now, the CPM is helping the BJP in Bengal by writing its graffiti, she said.

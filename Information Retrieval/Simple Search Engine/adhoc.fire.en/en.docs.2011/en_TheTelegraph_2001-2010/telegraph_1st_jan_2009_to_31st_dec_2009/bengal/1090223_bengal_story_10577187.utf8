	Calcutta, Feb. 22: Pranab Mukherjee today accused some people of putting up self-created obstacles on the road to the states development at the foundation stone laying for the East-West Metro, two days after Mamata Banerjee urged him not to attend the programme.        
	When Mukherjee, foreign minister and state Congress president, spoke in Salt Lake, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee was by his side. It is sad that some people are putting up self-created (atmakrita) obstacles on the road to the states development. One shouldnt bring narrow politics into development activities. Our main objective is to work for peoples welfare, he said.        
	Mukherjee had asserted yesterday that he would attend the programme, no matter what Mamata, his prospective election ally, said.         
	In the pre-election season, such posturing is not uncommon. Leaders of prospective allies are known to adopt seemingly irreconcilable positions in public to strengthen respective bargaining positions before formal seat-sharing talks begin.        
	On Friday, the Trinamul Congress chief said: Its un-fair to unveil projects with the polls round the corner. I appeal to Pranabda not to share the dais with the chief minister.         
	Today, Mukherjee had a word of caution for Mamatas brand of politics. People dont accept those who try to stall development projects simply for oppositions sake.         
	On the dais, Mukherjee and Bhattacharjee were seen speaking to each other for some time. Mukherjee said: We may have political differences but they have to be put on the backburner for development projects. Those voted to power have to be accepted this is the cardinal principle of our democratic set-up.        
	At a news conference in Mamatas house this evening, MLA Partha Chatterjee said Banglar nayak (Bengals hero) was acting as the CPM mouthpiece. We didnt see him in Nandigram or Singur. But he is often with CPM leaders in foundation stone-laying ceremonies now.        
	Asked if Mukherjees statements could jeopardise talks on the alliance, Chatterjee said: That is a different issue. The decision will be taken at the highest level.         
	The chief minister heaped praise on Mukherjee. With- out him, the East-West Metro would not have seen the light of day. He saw to it that the Centre cleared the project.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Darjeeling, Dec. 24: A day after the Centre said there would be wide-ranging consultations on Telangana, the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha piped down its agitation programme.        
	Morcha general secretary Roshan Giri said: The hunger strike from December 26 will be a relay fast with the minority forum starting it the first day. Each batch will be on fast for 24 hours. He did not mention a fast-unto-death.         
	The Centres announcement had given the impression that Telangana was being put on the back-burner.        
	An indefinite Morcha hunger strike began on December 11 after the Centre announced the formation of Telangana. It was withdrawn on December 19 after an appeal from the home minister.        
	The change of plan is because of the present scenario, Giri said, without elaborating on it.

   Nexus cry and challenge
          PRONAB MONDAL                          Left supporters stall the chief secretarys car in Midnapore protesting an alleged breach of the CMs security during a Trinamul demonstration on Saturday                                        
	Midnapore, Nov. 8: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today said Operation Green Hunt would not take place in the Maoist-hit areas of Bengal.        
	No, it (Green Hunt) will not take place in our state. It is for the other three states (seven are, in fact, listed as affected), the chief minister said, replying to questions.        
	Operation Green Hunt, though there are doubts if it indeed is the official name of the joint operation with states the Centre proposes to conduct, was expected to cover all Maoist-hit regions by the end of the year.        
	Bhattacharjee, who was on a two-day visit to Midnapore town to review development projects and law and order in the troubled tribal belt of West Midnapore, Bankura and Purulia, said the central forces (23 companies) deployed were enough to combat the Maoists. We are ready to start an extensive operation.        
	Last night, Bhattacharjee held a meeting with police officers from the three districts, including inspector-general (western range) Kuldiep Singh, and DIG (Midnapore range) Peeyush Pande on an intensive action against the Maoists. Security forces will now enter deep inside jungles and into villages. I cant tell you anything more on this, the chief minister said.        
	Asked if he supported Union home minister P. Chidambarams stand to come to a logical conclusion about Maoists, Bhattacharjee said: This is not the right time to talk about all this. I cant explain where we meet, where we differ. This is the time to work together.        
	Chidambaram has criticised the CPM-led government for not thinking it necessary to crack down on the Maoists until now because it felt the fight should be conducted on ideological grounds.        
	Bhattacharjee, however, said Chidambaram was happy with what the state was doing to fight the guerrillas. We have got support from the Centre, he said, adding: I agree with the Prime Ministers observation that the Maoists are the greatest threat to internal security.        
	In reply to a question, the chief minister ruled out talks with the Maoists as well as the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities. They are not Maoists, they (the Maoists) are criminals. There is no question of holding talks with the committee either.        
	The chief minister addressed one of the major concerns of the local people about the forces continuing to occupy schools. The public health engineering department will complete the construction of police camps by November 15. I want them to vacate the schools as soon as possible, he said.         
	Addressing a rally later, Bhattacharjee said the committee and the Maoists were the same. I have kept their (the committees) Chhatradhar (Mahato) in jail. He is actually a Maoist. His brother is also a Maoist. He (Chhatradhar) used to bring people to processions at gunpoint. I will keep him in jail for many more days.        
	Trinamul links        
	Bhattacharjee said the rebels were indulging in criminal activities in the name of Mao Zedong and the Trinamul Congress was helping them identify their CPM targets.        
	The Maoists are entering the villages with the help of Trinamul men. Trinamul is showing them the way and identifying CPM workers. They are working hand in hand, the chief minister said.        
	The chief minister said he felt Trinamul was a bhayankar aparadhi (a deadly criminal). They (Trinamul) have joined hands with the murderers to destroy the CPM.        
	Asked if Mamata Banerjee had Maoist links, Bhattacharjee said: I cannot name a person. I can say about the party.         
	He mentioned meetings between Mamata and Chhatradhar in Lalgarh earlier this year. Trinamul chief Mamata and party MLA Partha Chatterjee had addressed several meetings with him.        
	Trinamul is saying there are no Maoists. Then who blocked the Rajdhani? Are you feeling ashamed to name them? Are they your friends? That is why they were not named in the FIR (filed by the railways, under Mamata)? Bhattacharjee asked and added: A party which is part of the central government is helping the Maoists. Trinamul is making a dreadful mistake.        
	Trinamul general secretary and junior Union shipping minister Mukul Roy tonight challenged the chief minister to prove the alleged Maoist links. He should come out with the proof or quit.

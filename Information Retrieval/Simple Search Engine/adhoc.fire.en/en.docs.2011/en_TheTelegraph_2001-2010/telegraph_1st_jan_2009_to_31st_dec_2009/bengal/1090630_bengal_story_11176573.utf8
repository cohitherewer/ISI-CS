                                                                                                               Search for homoeopath
          NARESH JANA                          Pratihars chamber. (Samir Mondal)                                  
	Kantapahari, June 29: The first person police looked for in Kantapahari today was a homoeopath with roaring practice suspected to have raised money for Maoists and treated them.        
	But they were an hour too late. Jatin Pratihar, who was seen providing drinking water to the jawans with the help of a pipe fitted to a tap in his two-storey house around 10am, was missing by the time a second batch arrived with a list of the wanted and surrounded his house.        
	They also mounted a futile raid on his chamber, about 30m away. The doctors help, Prasanta Mondal, was detained.        
	CID DIG S.N. Gupta had led the first team to Kantapahari from Ramgarh at 10am. However, the second, headed by Midnapore DIG Praveen Kumar, which came from Lalgarh around 11, had the list of people the police wanted to question.        
	Pratihars wife Sulekha told the police he could be at the relief camp at the high school a stones throw away.         
	But Pratihar, 52, who had got his degree from Calcutta University according to Sulekha, wasnt there either. His main task is to raise money for the Maoists from businessmen, farmers and teachers, said Shyam Singh, the Malda additional superintendent who was part of the team that drank water from his house.         
	The eight-bedroom house is about 50 metres from the metalled road connecting Ramgarh with Lalgarh.         
	An officer said: The Maoists used to come to him for treatment. Some of them came after being injured in the gun battle with police near Kadashole on June 20.         
	Sulekha denied her husbands Maoist links. My husband is a doctor and his duty is to treat sick people.        
	A villager said Pratihar was a messiah for them. He is the only qualified daktarbabu here. We can approach him any time of the day or night. If called, he travels several kilometres to see a patient and distributes medicines free, said Jharna Hembram, 30, of Harulia, 3km away.        
	New task force         
	The task force to develop tribal regions was today reconstituted with nine secretaries from key departments. R.D. Meena, its secretary, said they would prepare development packages based on reports from the Purulia, Bankura and West Midnapore district magistrates. The chief minister attended the panels first meeting.

                                                                                                               Advani soft on Mamata
                            
	April 29: L.K. Advani today indicated his partys doors were still open to Mamata Banerjee, though she had dumped the NDA for the Congress.        
	The BJPs prime ministerial candidate did not mention Mamata or the Trinamul Congress in his speeches at Uluberia, Barasat and Krishnagar today, even while speaking on the Nano plant  shifted after her violent land agitation. Instead, Advani blamed the state government for the fiasco.        
	Advani suggested it was up to Mamata to decide whether she would return to the NDA. Mamata Banerjee was with the NDA, she left the NDA and aligned with the Congress. Now its up to her to decide.        
	A BJP leader said Mamata had also refrained from attacking the BJP during campaigns.

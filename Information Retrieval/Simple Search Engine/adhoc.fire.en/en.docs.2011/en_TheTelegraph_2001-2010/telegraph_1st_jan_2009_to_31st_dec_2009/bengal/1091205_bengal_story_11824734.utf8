  - Villagers shot for uniting tribals against Maoists        OUR CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	Belpahari (West Midnapore), Dec. 4: Three villagers in Belpahari paid with their lives apparently for uniting tribals against Maoists.        
	Around 10.30 last night, some 15 people descended on Simulpal village, surrounded a cluster of huts on an undulating, hilly terrain and called out the names of Nimai Singh and Phaniram Singh.         
	As neither Nimai, 35, nor Phaniram, 34, emerged from their homes, the gang banged on the doors.         
	When they stepped out, Nimais father Hadi Ram was by his son. The gang tore Nimai and Phaniram away and beat them with the butts of their guns and the back of axes.        
	They were screaming, Hadi Ram said. They were cursing my son, saying they would have to pay for campaigning against the Maoists.        
	According to Hadi Ram, the Maoists said: You think you are the netas (leaders) here and that is why you are going village to village to tell the villagers to fight the Maoists. Be prepared to pay with your lives for your daring.        
	Then the Maoists dragged them to a clearing inside the jungle and Hadi Ram heard gunshots.        
	From the bullets shells we have found, it is clear that they were shot with 9mm pistols, a police officer said. They were shot in the head and face and must have died instantly.        
	For many hours after they heard the shots, the villagers did not venture near the clearing. But once they were sure that they Maoists had left the spot, they went into the forest.        
	What they were unaware of was the fact that possibly the same gang had visited nearby Dakai village half and hour before to target a member of tribal outfit Bharat Jakat Majhi Marwa, 50-year-old Bagrai Soren.        
	He was crouching inside his hut, when the attackers stormed in. They pulled him out, dragged him away into a forest and shot him.        
	Like Nimai, a CPM branch committee member, and Phaniram, an activist of the Jharkhand Party (Aditya), Bagrai had also launched a campaign to rally villagers against the rebels.        
	Two days ago, a schoolteacher had been shot dead in nearby Goaltore for the same offence. Three villagers who were in a huddle with him were battered with iron rods.        
	The teacher, Satyanarayan Hansda, 37, was a member of the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities until he dissociated himself from the outfit realising that the Maoists were dictating terms to innocent tribals.        
	A BA from Goaltore College, he had been working in villages like Shirishboni, Porakanali and Metala to mobilise peoples opinion against Maoist atrocities.        
	District police chief Manoj Verma said: The Maoists cant tolerate any opposition.        
	The police said the killings were to deter anyone from campaigning against the Maoists. That has always been their tactic, an officer said.         
	However, the killings also signify increasing resistance to the rebels in some pockets and a realisation among a section of villagers that their presence has not helped development of their region by any means. As a Peoples Committee member, Satyanarayan used to pay a levy of Rs 2,000 a month to the Maoists.         
	He stopped paying the money as his disenchantment with the outfit grew, a police officer said.

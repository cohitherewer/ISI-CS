	Calcutta, May 17: Moon Moon Das, a homemaker from Haripal in Hooghly, took a train and travelled for over two hours this morning to reach 20B Harish Chatterjee Street for a glimpse of the woman behind the Lefts rout in Bengal.         
	After over seven hours outside Mamata Banerjees Kalighat home, the 20-something womans wish came true as her leader emerged from her house for a news conference in the adjacent party office.         
	I came here at 9am, but it has been worth the wait, said Moon Moon, who added that she was not a Trinamul activ- ist. She took a bus to Howrah station on her way back home around 4.45pm.         
	I have seen her several times on television I wanted to see the woman behind the CPMs defeat in person, explained the woman in a yellow cotton sari, cherishing the few seconds she stood in front of Mamata, surrounded by three security guards and party colleague Madan Mitra.         
	The woman who has made white cotton saris famous had a brief message for Moon Moon and several other people who spent most of the day sitting in the shade of a pandal erected for journalists outside the Trinamul office.         
	I want to thank all of you for your support. Thank you for coming to meet me, Mamata said while accepting the bouquets and hugging the old and young surrounding her.        
	Then she handed over the bouquets to the guards and hurried into the office, leaving Moon Moon and the rest in a daze.         
	I cant believe this This is yet to sink in, smiled Moon Moon. She summed up the feeling of most Trinamul supporters, struggling to come to terms with the mandate.         
	This is like a dream. So unexpected and so sweet, said a Trinamul supporter sipping tea at a nearby stall.         
	Harish Chatterjee Street saw heavy traffic today. It started with a VIP visitor  Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs sister Parmeet Kaur. The Behala resident reached early in the morning to avoid the media but could not meet Mamata. After having sweets at the party office, the family left, leaving a bouquet and a congratulatory message.        
	Although there were many visitors, yesterdays drums and bugles were missing.         
	Unlike yesterday, when Mamata stepped out of her room several times, she stayed indoors till 4.30pm today.         
	She was awake till six in the morning and had several rounds of discussions with Congress leaders in Delhi, said a Trinamul source.

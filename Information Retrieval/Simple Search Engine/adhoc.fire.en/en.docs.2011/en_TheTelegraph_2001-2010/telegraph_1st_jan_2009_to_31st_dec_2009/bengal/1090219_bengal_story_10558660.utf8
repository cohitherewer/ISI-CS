	Durgapur, Feb. 18: A school head was arrested today after she snipped the hair of five girls wearing single braids.         
	Around 1,000 guardians descended on Gopalmath Girls High School as word spread and blocked a national highway on the outskirts of Durgapur town.         
	Some of the guardians stormed the school, leading to pandemonium. They disconnected power supply to the school and demanded Manisha Roy be handed over so they could also give her a snip.         
	Roy, who teaches Bengali, locked the staff room from inside and hid with 12 others.         
	The parents of the five girls lodged a formal complaint when a large police team arrived and Roy was picked up.        
	We have arrested the teacher but we are yet to decide what charge to press against her, said Burdwan superintendent R. Rajsekharan.        
	Criminal lawyer Jayanta N. Chatterjee said snipping hair was not a cognisable offence under any law.         
	However, the police can make an arrest to prevent a cognisable offence, if it appears that without it a serious breach of peace can take place. But Roy has to be produced in court within 24 hours, said Chatterjee.        
	The district inspector of schools suspended Roy following a recommendation by the school managing committee.        
	She became angry seeing the girls  three from Class VI and two from Class IX  during the morning prayer. Roy, the acting principal of the school, wanted girls with long hair to sport double braids.        
	She called the five, made them stand in a line and cut off portions of their hair with a pair of scissors around 7am.         
	The two Class IX students ran home after the incident and told their parents about it. I felt so ashamed that I ran, said Mamoni Badyakar.         
	Tomorrow, a prospective groom is supposed to see me for my marriage. How can I present myself before him? asked Mamoni, 16.         
	The law, however, bars her from getting married before she turns 18.        
	Her aunt Krishna was one of the demonstrators. How can a teacher be so cruel. We want to snip the principals hair, said Krishna.        
	Roy said she had instructed students a week ago to wear long hair in two simple braids. I have cut off their hair as part of the punishment. I never realised that I will have to face such mob fury, she said.        
	The secretary of the school managing committee, Dulal Ghosh, said: I feel she could have called their parents and warned them. So, I recommended her suspension.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, May 14: A Sealdah railway employee was shot dead last night resisting robbers who targeted a train from Calcutta in Bihar.        
	Motilal Yadav, 55, had apparently refused to hand over his money to the gang of 20 to 22 men that barged into the AC compartments of the Poorvanchal Express, a railway official said. The incident took place between Jamui and Bhalui stations in Bihar around 10pm.         
	According to an official of the Hajipur-headquartered East Central Railway, under which the area falls, Yadav succumbed to the bullet injuries on the train itself.         
	The resident of Dakshindari Road in Lake Towns Golaghata was going to his native Baila in Uttar Pradesh. Yadav was a train driver but had been shuttling wagons around Sealdah station, having been taken off longer-haul duties after a physical problem. Yadavs family left today to bring the body.         
	Five passengers in the AC compartments were robbed of three cellphones, cash and ornaments. An FIR has been filed.

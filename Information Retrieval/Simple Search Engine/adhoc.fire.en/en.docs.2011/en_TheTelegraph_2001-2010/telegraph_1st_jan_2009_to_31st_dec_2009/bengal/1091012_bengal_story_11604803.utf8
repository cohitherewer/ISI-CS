                                                                                                               Maoist scare helps train robbers
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Dumka, Oct. 11: A gang robbed passengers on a Delhi-bound train from Howrah today, taking advantage of the absence of guards who were unwilling to man an express running through a Maoist zone.        
	Seven passengers on the Howrah-New Delhi Janata Express were injured during the robbery. The robbers hit some with the butts of their country-made pistols. Others were stabbed with knives the 14-member gang was carrying.        
	The robbers boarded the train around 3am in Jasidih, Jharkhand, where the train made its scheduled stop. They targeted the passengers in the S2 coach, snatching nearly Rs 48,000 in cash as well as cellphones and jewellery.        
	Among the injured were three people from Bengal  Sumit Mondal from Kulti, Burdwan, Ekbal Ashik and Dipankar Sarkar from Calcutta.        
	The train had no guards when the youths, said to be aged between 16 and 25 years, boarded and started threatening passengers with daggers and pistols.         
	A GRP officer said there was no guard because the area the train was crossing was a rebel stronghold. Guards avoid this section because of the Maoist threat.        
	Manohar Shaw, a 45-year-old resident of Munger, in Bihar, suffered serious injuries and was admitted to Jhajha primary health centre this morning. He was shifted to Jamui sadar hospital when his condition deteriorated.         
	Passengers said the gang boarded the train at Jasidih, said the officer-in-charge of Jasidih station S.K. Sinha.        
	They pulled the chain and got off at the nearby Tulshitard halt. The group robbed approximately Rs 48,000, he said, but passengers claimed that more than Rs 1.5 lakh, besides valuables, were stolen.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Tamluk, Nov. 16: A panel that includes a Trinamul leader who had spearheaded the anti-land acquisition movement in Nandigram today passed a resolution for the takeover of 4,000 acres in Haldia.        
	Subhendu Adhikari, who defeated in the Lok Sabha polls Lakshman Seth of the CPM who had issued the acquisition notice that triggered the Nandigram unrest, is now a member of the Haldia Development Authoritys board. It was headed by Seth until his defeat.        
	Everyone at the meeting agreed to the proposal to acquire 4,000 acres to replenish the HDAs land bank, which now has only 50 acres, Sarad Dwivedi, the chief executive officer of the authority, said after the meeting chaired by chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti.         
	Adhikari said he was not against land acquisition for industry. We are against forcible acquisition. We want acquisition through discussions. Farmers who lose land must be compensated at market rates. If this is followed, we have no objection.         
	In Singur, his party had opposed the Tata Motors project, though farmers had been paid more than prevailing market rates, because it said the acquisition of 400 acres was forcible.        
	Railway minister Mamata Banerjee conceded at a programme in Hooghlys Nalikul yesterday that she, too, needed land, but only from farmers who were willing to part with their plots.        
	At todays meeting, Adhikari said: We should give identity cards to landlosers so they get priority during employment in industries on their land.        
	Among the others at the meeting was Seths wife Tamalika, the chairperson of Haldia municipality.

	Behrampore, Aug. 27: Six armed robbers looted Rs 20 lakh from the manager of a rural bank in Murshidabad this afternoon.         
	Police said Achinta Sarkar had withdrawn the money from the State Bank of India branch in Raghunathganj town and was taking it to his bank in Sagardighi, about 35km from Behrampore town.         
	A Tata Sumo and two motorcycles intercepted his car on the way back. When the gang was snatching the bag, the manager resisted. One of the them then hit on Sarkars right hand with a chopper.         
	Three persons have been arrested but the money has not been found.

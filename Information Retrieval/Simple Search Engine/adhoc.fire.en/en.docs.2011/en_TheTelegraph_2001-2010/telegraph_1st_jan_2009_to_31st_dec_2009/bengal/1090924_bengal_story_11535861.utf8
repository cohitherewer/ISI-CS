The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Cong rings, Partha sets date
                                                                                                               Cong rings, Partha sets date
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 23: Trinamul Congress leader Partha Chatterjee today agreed to go to Siliguri on Friday for talks on the mayors selection after an assurance from the Congress that its state leaders will not meddle in the process.        
	K. Keshava Rao, the Congresss in-charge of Bengal, today met Pranab Mukherjee, the state Congress president, and after that called up Chatterjee and other Trinamul leaders.        
	After the meeting with Pranabda, I assured the Trinamul leaders that state Congress leaders would stop meddling in the selection of the candidate for Siliguri mayor. Pranabda also did not like the manner in which some of our leaders had started lobbying for the post before discussions among councillors started, Rao said.         
	Partha had put off his visit to Siliguri on September 21 to protest state Congress leaders move to jeopardise the alliance.         
	Rao came to Calcutta today after coming to know that Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjee was upset with the state Congress leaders attitude.        
	He made it clear that the high command would accept whatever decision was reached at the councillor level. My primary concern is to take forward the alliance with Mamataji to the 2011 Assembly polls so that we can oust the ruling CPM from Bengal, he said.

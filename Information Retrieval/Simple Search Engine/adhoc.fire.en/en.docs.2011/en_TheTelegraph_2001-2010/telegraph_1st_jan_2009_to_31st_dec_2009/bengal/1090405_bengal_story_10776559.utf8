                                                                                                               Youth shoots at girl, then his own heart
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Krishnagar, April 4: A young man allegedly shot and injured a schoolgirl who had spurned his advances and then killed himself with the same weapon this afternoon.        
	The 14-year-old girl, a student of Class VIII and resident of Govipur village, about 45km from Krishnagar, was rushed to Krishnagunge block hospital and shifted to Shaktinagar block hospital in the evening.        
	Late at night, doctors treating her said she was out of danger.        
	The girl, daughter of a farm labourer, was returning after a dip in a river around 2pm when she was shot at. Her grandmother was with her.        
	The bullet hit the girl in the lower back and she collapsed in a pool of blood.        
	The sound of firing left people bathing by the river stunned for some time. When they fanned out looking for the shooter, another shot rang out from the bushes near the bank.        
	The villagers rushed there to find Sujoy Ghosh, a youth in his 20s and a resident of the same village, lying dead with a bullet wound in the chest.        
	Villagers said Sujoy, who was from a middle-class family, was jobless. One of his brothers works outside Bengal.        
	Paban Ghosh, the girls father, said the youth used to follow his daughter everywhere, often trying to make conversation with her on some pretext or the other.        
	According to Ghosh, Sujoy had stopped his daughter on her way home from school a few days ago and told her he loved her.        
	His daughter stood quietly without replying, Ghosh said. Feeling insulted by her silence, Sujoy threatened to shoot her if she rejected him.        
	Ghosh said: After reaching home, my daughter narrated the incident to us. We never thought he would actually do this and so did not take his threat seriously.        
	It is too early to say why and how the shooting happened, said Annappa E, the additional superintendent of police, Nadia.        
	Officers are trying to ascertain the exact motive and the body has been sent for post-mortem.         
	Personnel at Krishnagunge police station said they would talk to the girl once she recovered.        
	Escape from home        
	A nine-year-old girl who ran away from a government shelter after alleged beatings was found loitering on National Highway 34 in Krishnagar yesterday.        
	Today, some residents took Asha Sardar back to the district welfare home for women and children, which denied that inmates are beaten.

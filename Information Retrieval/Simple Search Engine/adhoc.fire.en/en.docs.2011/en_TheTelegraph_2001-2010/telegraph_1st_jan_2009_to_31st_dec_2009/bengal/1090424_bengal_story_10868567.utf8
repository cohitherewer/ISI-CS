The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | HC seeks fresh probe on MP in murder case
                                                                                                               HC seeks fresh probe on MP in murder case
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, April 23: Calcutta High Court today set aside the judgment of a Suri court that had cleared the name of a CPM MP in a murder case.         
	The courts order followed a petition by Shibu Mistry of of Mohammedpur, Birbhum , who had accused MP Ramchandra Dom of killing his father.        
	In his petition, Mistry alleged that Dom, the Birbhum MP, along with 250 CPM cadres had attacked his home and mercilessly beaten up his 70-year-old father Bandhu Mistry, who succumbed to injuries.         
	My father was murdered and Dom, the local MP, was involved in it, he said in the petition.         
	On the basis of the complaint lodged in April 2007, the Mohammedpur police started a murder case against Dom and 34 others.         
	In the trial at the chief judicial magistrates court in Suri, Birbhum, Doms name was removed from the list of the accused.        
	On August 13 last year, the magistrate acquitted all the 34 other accused from the charge of murder.        
	Against this judgement, Mistry moved a revision petition before Calcutta High court in the first week of this month.         
	The petitioners lawyer claimed that the magistrate had passed the verdict without hearing his client.        
	In the wake of the high courts order, Dom, who has now shifted to the Bolpur (SC) seat, will have to face criminal proceedings on the charge of murder.         
	Today, Justice Partha Sakha Dutta of the high court asked the chief judicial magistrate of the Suri court to hold a fresh trial, this time with Doms name among the accused.        
	Dom was elected from the Birbhum (SC) seat in the 2004 Lok Sabha polls when the constituency was reserved for Scheduled Caste candidates.         
	For the 2009 Lok Sabha election, the adjoining Bolpur seat has been reserved for SC candidates after delimitation.         
	In Birbhum, the legislator said: I am not aware of the courts order but the law should take its own course.

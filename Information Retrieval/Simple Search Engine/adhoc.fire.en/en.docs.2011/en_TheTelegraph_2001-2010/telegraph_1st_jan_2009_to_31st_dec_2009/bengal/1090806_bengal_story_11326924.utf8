	Durgapur, Aug. 5: A final-year engineering student of Asansol Engineering College was found hanging in her hostel room this evening.        
	Police said the hostel warden found Piu Ghanti hanging from a window grille during her routine inspection. She studied electronics and communication engineering.        
	Her door was bolted from inside. The warden peeped through a crack in the window and saw her hanging, said Asansol deputy superintendent of police U.S. Mukherjee.         
	Piu was an orphan, brought up by her maternal uncle in neighbouring Ranigunj town.         
	Her uncle said he was not ready to accept it was a suicide. But he will wait for the post-mortem report and decide whether to lodge a complaint.        
	The police did not find a suicide note in the 22-year-olds room. Piu had been in the hostel since first-year.         
	Her present roommate has been away since Wednesday, the officer said.

	Ranaghat, March 31: Madhabi Ghosh finds the judgment in the Dhantola bus robbery case incredible.         
	Sitting in the courtyard of her house at Noapara in Dhantola, the widow of slain bus driver Samir Ghosh asks: Is this any justice?         
	My husband is killed, so many people are robbed and raped and, at the end of the day, only four people are convicted? Incredible.        
	The Ranaghat court today sentenced Kurban Ali, Chinu Sardar, Pute Sardar and Lodhai Sardar to life imprisonment. Lodhai was also held guilty of rape and Pute of molestation.        
	They killed my husband, reduced me to penury and a life of misery, and yet none of them has been given death. Is this justice? Madhabi breaks down as she speaks.        
	Police had accused CPM leaders Subol Bagchi and Saidul Karigar of masterminding the highway heist. Both were acquitted yesterday along with 16 others for lack of evidence.         
	On February 5, 2003, Samir, who was at the wheel of a bus packed with wedding guests, was shot dead apparently after he recognised some of the robbers.         
	Wedding guests on two buses were robbed for over three hours, until three in the morning. Six women were raped and many more molested.         
	How is it possible for only four-five people to commit such a daring heist? The police should investigate further. It cannot be that such a small group carried out a strike of this scale, says Madhabi.        
	Two of the chargesheeted goons are missing and the another is still on trial.        
	Madhabi said her husband was a brave man. Everyone loved him for his nature. He had tried to save the passengers that night. He wanted to drive on despite the dacoits asking him to stop. Then Chinu Sardar managed to climb onto the bus and shoot him. Chinu should have been hanged, said Madhabi, tears streaming down her cheeks.         
	Swapan Ghosh fondly remembers how Samir, youngest among five brothers, loved cars. We had a car when we lived in a joint family. Swapan had learnt to drive in that car.         
	He revealed how smart Samir was when at the wheel. Nearly 20 years ago, he was taking us somewhere when robbers tried to block our way with bullock carts. Swapan skillfully dodged them and drove past, the robbers looked on.         
	Samirs elder daughter Sushama, who was 13 when he died, got married last year.         
	For the first two years after her husbands death, Madhabi was dependent on Swapan, 55, a hardware merchant, for a living. She is now an anganwadi worker looking after mother and child care in the village, 70km from Calcutta.

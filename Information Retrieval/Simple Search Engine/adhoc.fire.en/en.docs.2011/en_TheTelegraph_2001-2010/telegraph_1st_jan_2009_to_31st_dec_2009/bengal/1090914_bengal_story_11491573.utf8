                                                                                                               Hint at effort to get land for Infy
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 13: CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury today indicated that the state government would try to ensure land for Infosys and Wipro in Bengal but defended the scrapping of the IT township supposed to host them.         
	We would have liked them to be here and lets see if in some way they can remain here. I think both the companies want to stay here, Yechury told reporters in Calcutta on the way to the Northeast.        
	The IT township project was scrapped after murky land deals by the state governments two partners in it, including the promoters of Vedic Village, came to the fore. We know how the land was being acquired there, Yechury said.        
	Housing minister Gautam Deb has offered to make room for the two IT giants at New Town, Rajarhat, promising 10 acres each to them close to the airport for multi-storeyed towers. However, many are sceptical about whether the firms would be interested in 10 acres when they had wanted 90.        
	Assam is said to have already invited the two companies to invest in that state. Yechury said: We hope it doesnt happen. If Bengal becomes a loser, we know why it is a loser.        
	He left no doubt that his finger was pointing towards the Trinamul Congress, which was accused of driving out Tata Motors from Singur last year and whose leaders were said to have been involved in the Vedic land deals. However, he was evasive on the Oppositions role in Rajarhat, apparently because the CPM knows it wont be able to get away from the mess blaming the Opposition alone.         
	Yechury said: We have seen it in case of Nano. Now we see it... not only in Vedic Village but also in what came out later.         
	Mamata Banerjee iterated her demand that Infosys and Wipro be provided alternative land in Rajarhat. The government has thousands of acres at New Town, she said.

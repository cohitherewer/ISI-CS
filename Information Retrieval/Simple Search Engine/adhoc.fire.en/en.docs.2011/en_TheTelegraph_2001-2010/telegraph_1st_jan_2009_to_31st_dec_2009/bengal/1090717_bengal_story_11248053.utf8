The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CM admits police lapses
                                                                                                               CM admits police lapses
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, July 16: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Nirupam Sen today admitted lapses on the polices part for yesterdays attack on nine Congress MLAs in a Burdwan village.        
	The police could not assess that the situation would flare up in such a dangerous manner. I would be failing my responsibility if I merely condemned the attack on Congress legislature party leader Manas Bhuniya and other legislators accompanying him yesterday. Lapses on the part of the police, if any, are being looked into, the chief minister said in the Assembly.        
	Moreover, stern action will be taken if any of our local leaders are found to be involved. Our party does not have a considerable presence in Dhanyarukhi village, he added.        
	Yesterday afternoon, eight Congress MLAs, led by their legislature party leader Bhuniya, were chased across paddy fields by armed CPM activists at Dhanyarukhi in Mangalkot, an area rocked by political clashes after the Lok Sabha elections.        
	Bhattacharjee said eight persons had been arrested.        
	Industries minister Sen said intelligence failure had led to yesterdays attack.         
	I dont understand how an attack was organised on the MLAs at Dhanyarukhi village where they had gone after informing the district administration. I feel ashamed as I am a cabinet minister from Burdwan, Sen said in the Assembly lobby.         
	We may not be a force to reckon with in that village but we cannot deny that we have a large number of supporters there. We have sought a report from the district to ascertain if local-level leaders had joined those who had masterminded the attack.        
	Bhuniya started the discussion in the House today by accusing Sen of being a part of a conspiracy that he said was behind yesterdays attack. I am convinced the industries minister conspired with other CPM leaders in Burdwan to steer the attack, he said.         
	Bhattacharjee rubbished the allegation and sought a discussion with the Opposition to end the sudden spate of political violence. Our five ministers were not allowed to enter Khejuri last month, he said.         
	Later, Bhattacharjee spoke to Bhuniya in his Assembly chamber. I had a meeting with Manas babu. Nirupam Sen was there. I am appealing to the Opposition to discuss problems. They (Trinamul) arent willing to talk, he said.

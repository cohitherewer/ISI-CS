The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Mamata wants order
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Mamata wants order
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 23: Mamata Banerjee today asked Trinamul core committee members not to miss its weekly meetings if they were in Calcutta.        
	If a member skips three consecutive meetings, the person will cease to be a member of the body, she said, days after MP Kabir Sumans public outburst against the party triggered allegations of lack of discipline within Trinamul.         
	The core committee has over 100 members, including ministers, MPs, MLAs and party functionaries. It is supposed to meet every Friday.        
	Ours is a disciplined organisation. I want our workers and leaders to place their grievances at the weekly meetings instead of going public, Mamata was quoted as telling a meeting at her home tonight.        
	Suman and Union minister Sultan Ahmed are among the prominent leaders accused of skipping the meetings.        
	A party general secretary said Mamata had censured Sultan. She refused to buy his argument that he was busy with his ministerial programmes in Calcutta.         
	Mamata may have asked leaders to place their grievances before the core committee, but at least one MLA knows it is not the best thing to do. Sadhan Pande was suspended from the party last year for telling the committee how the party was making a mistake by opposing the Singur project.

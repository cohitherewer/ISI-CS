                                                                                                               Lalgarh cops face probe
                            
	Midnapore, Dec. 31: Cases have been started against several Lalgarh policemen, including a former inspector-in-charge, who had been accused of harassing tribals and molesting women while raiding villages in search of Maoists.        
	District superintendent of police R.K. Singh confirmed the case against inspector Sandip Sinha Roy, who had been asked to go on leave after the tribals launched an agitation against the alleged atrocities, but refused to identify the other officers who went on the raids. Cases of assault, molestation and ransacking have been started against Sinha Roy on the basis of complaints lodged by tribal women, he said.        
	The women today refused to attend a hearing called by the Midnapore range deputy inspector-general at Kharagpur, over 50km from their village, Chhotopelia.        
	The Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities said the DIG should visit the village if he wanted to talk to them.         
	The tribals have threatened to block roads and rail tracks if Singh does not apologise for the atrocities by Friday.

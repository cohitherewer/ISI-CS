The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Mahato spills training beans 
                                                                                                               Mahato spills training beans 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 3: Around 400 youths from Lalgarh and its adjoining areas were trained by Maoists to use firearms and plant improvised explosive devices, Chhatradhar Mahato is said to have revealed to police.        
	The arrested leader of the Maoist-backed Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities, police sources said, also explained how and where the Maoists trained the youths.        
	He broke down during an interrogation session that started last night. We are looking for more specific information about the Maoist leaders camping in Lalgarh, said a senior CID officer.        
	Top CID officers, including additional director-general Raj Kanojia and inspector-general Somen Mitra, interrogated Mahato throughout the day. Director-general of police Bhupinder Singh too questioned him, the sources said.        
	According to CID sources, Mahato, who is the brother of Maoist leader Sashadhar, said the leaders of the banned outfit used to visit Lalgarh occasionally before the November blast on the chief ministers convoy route in Salboni.         
	They swung into action after the police arrested three school boys on the charge of exploding the IED in Salboni. They managed to win over many tribals during secret meetings in the villages, Mahato reportedly told the police.        
	He also confirmed that he was first a spokesperson for the Maoists. Forming the peoples committee was their (the Maoists) brainchild and initially I was not involved in it. I was later told to issue statements on behalf of the committee. But there was mass support for the committee and the Maoists in Lalgarh, a source quoted him as saying.        
	According to Mahatos statement to the police, the Maoists chose boys between 14 years and 25 years of age for the training. We found out that the boys were first given fitness training through physical exercises before they were handed firearms. The training was conducted in the forests of Pingboni, Kadashole and Jhitka in the nine months when Lalgarh became inaccessible to the administration, another officer said.        
	Chhatradhar also disclosed the names of villages where Maoists leaders Kishanji and Bikash often camped. He told us that after sunset, the top leaders of the outfit leave their hideouts and roam along the metalled road between Lalgarh and Ramgarh. They come to Barapelia bazaar where a TV is kept to watch the news, said the officer.         
	Mahato, however, did not disclose the names of the villagers who allowed Kishanji, to stay at their houses.

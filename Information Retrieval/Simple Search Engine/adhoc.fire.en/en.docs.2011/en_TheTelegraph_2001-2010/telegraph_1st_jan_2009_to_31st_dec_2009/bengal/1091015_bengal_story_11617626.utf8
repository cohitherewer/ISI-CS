The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Pranab makes light of hitches in alliance
                                                                                                               Pranab makes light of hitches in alliance
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Pranab Mukherjee with MP Deepa Das Munshi at the Congress office. (Amit Datta)                                  
	Calcutta, Oct. 14: Pranab Mukherjee today dismissed complaints of state Congress leaders that Trinamul Congress supporters were working against them and insisted that the alliance between the two parties must be kept going.        
	State leaders also told Mukherjee that Trinamul had decimated the Congress in Nadia by inducting all 16 party councillors of the Congress-run Ranaghat municipality into its fold.         
	But the state Bengal Congress president, who chaired an extended secretariat meeting of the state unit, made it clear that they were minor hitches. He reminded the leaders how the CPM had tried to back-stab the Congress by withdrawing support to the Manmohan Singh government over the Indo-US nuclear deal.         
	Sort out the minor problems in the alliance (with Trinamul) through talks. We will have to take the alliance forward to the 2011 Assembly polls, Mukherjee said.        
	State Congress general secretaries Kanak Debnath and Binodananda Banerjee accused Trinamul men of attacking their alliance partners in Nadia, Howrah and other places, and wanted to know if the tie-up could be strengthened in such a situation.        
	Another general secretary, Jagadish Mitra, pointed out Trinamuls Ranaghat stab and pleaded with Mukherjee to please do something to prevent Trinamul from destroying our party.         
	MP Adhir Chowdhury had complained last week that Trinamul was posing a threat to the Congresss existence.         
	In an apparent bid to lift party workers morale, Mukherjee announced a chintan baithak (brainstorming session) in Nadias Krishnagar in the second week of November.        
	The Congress has accepted Mamata Banerjees seven-three formula and agreed to contest only three of the 10 bypolls on November 7. So there will be no problem in conducting a joint campaign. We are optimistic about winning all 10 seats, Mukherjee said.        
	Mamata on Maoists        
	The Trinamul Congress chief tonight backed the Centres planned offensive against Maoists after Diwali, but opposed its joint action with the state in Lalgarh.         
	There is nothing wrong if the Centre starts a fresh offensive against the Maoists. We are opposed to the killings (by Maoists), Mamata said, adding that the central forces should be pulled out of Lalgarh.         
	The chief minister had accused her of speaking in a different tone from the Prime Ministers on the Maoists.

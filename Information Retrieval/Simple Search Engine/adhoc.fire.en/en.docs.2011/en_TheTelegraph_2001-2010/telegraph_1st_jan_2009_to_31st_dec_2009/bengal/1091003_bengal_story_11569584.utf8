	Calcutta, Oct. 2: A woman officer posing as a journalist would have interviewed Chhatradhar Mahato before whipping out a 9mm pistol, had police stuck to their first plan to nab the Lalgarh tribal leader.        
	The plan to send a woman was devised because the police thought she would have easier access to Mahato.         
	Accordingly, a woman constable would have called up the leader of the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities posing as a reporter. She would request for an interview. Done with the assignment, she would take out her 9mm pistol and arrest him.        
	But the plan was abandoned because of security concerns.        
	We changed the plan because if it backfired, we did not want the woman officers life to be be in danger, a senior officer said. So, two male officers were deputed for the task.        
	Two two constables who went to interview the Maoist-backed committees leader were from the special task force of Calcutta police.        
	They disguised as journalists of a Singapore-based TV channel.        
	In order to get permission for the interview, the duo also met two local reporters who arranged an interview with Mahato.        
	Mahato succumbed to the temptation of appearing on an international TV channel, an officer said.        
	For one month, under the supervision of STF chief Rajeev Kumar, every detail of the plan was worked out before the two officers were sent for the task.        
	We had been told that we would have to get Chhatradhar Mahato at any cost so we worked out this plan, the officer said.        
	After selecting the two officers, the police identified two Jhargram-based journalists, one of whom routinely organised interviews between Mahato and reporters of other papers and news channels.         
	It was through these two local reporters that the policemen approached Mahato and arrested him. The reporters were present when Mahato was caught on September 26.        
	Today, Mahato was brought to the headquarters of Criminal Investigation Department (CID) in Bhavani Bhavan from Jhargram. He is serving seven days in police remand.        
	Mahatos eyes were tied with a black cloth when he was brought to Bhavani Bhavan as the CID did not want him to know the layout of the building.        
	He was put in the lock-up as soon as we brought him here, said a CID officer.        
	Senior CID officials, including additional director-general Raj Kanojia, and inspector-general Somen Mitra, interrogated him.        
	A CID officer claimed Mahato had confessed to links with CPI (Maoist) leaders Kishanji and Bikash.         
	He will be interrogated tonight by senior officers as he is the biggest catch since the security forces entered Lalgarh. He has confessed to his links with Maoists and the outlawed outfits leaders like Kishanji and Bikash. Our target will be to collect information about the Maoists movements in the Lalgarh area before centre starts its offensive against them in November, the officer said.

	Tamluk, July 1: The government has called a meeting on Friday to try and end the impasse that has partially stalled loading and unloading operations at Haldia port.        
	Labourers engaged by contractors for export-import firms have been blocking the approach road to the port demanding higher wages since yesterday.        
	Told by the state chief secretary, Ive called a meeting on Friday with the port authorities, contractors, companies and the labourers. Ive also urged the agitators to call off the blockade, said district magistrate C.D. Lama.         
	Some of the workers ransacked a CPM youth wing office this evening after talks to end the deadlock failed.

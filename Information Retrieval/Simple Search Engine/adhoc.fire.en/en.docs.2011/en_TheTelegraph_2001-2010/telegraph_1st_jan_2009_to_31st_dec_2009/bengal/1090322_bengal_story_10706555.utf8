The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Biman twin salvos at poll panel and US
                                                                                                               Biman twin salvos at poll panel and US
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                Biman Bose    
	Calcutta, March 22: Biman Bose today hit out at the Election Commission and the US consulate for conspiring against the Left.        
	The poll panel which was in the city earlier this week, Bose alleged, had given Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee more time  40 minutes  and allowed the Left partners only 10 minutes each, he said.          
	This is not a small thing but discrimination against us. The EC must explain why Trinamul was given preference. The EC cant continue doing such things after donning the cloak of impartiality, the CPM state secretary said.        
	Asked about Boses bites criticising the Election Commission, state chief electoral officer Debashis Sen said: We will wait for a formal complaint. The letter sent to the Trinamul Congress had allotted 10 minutes to the party.        
	Bose also alleged that US consulate officials had held a clandestine meeting with 48 minority community leaders at a Calcutta hotel recently.         
	But he would not say much more.        
	They can hold such discussions at the US consular office as they did earlier. The US officials had met us at our office. But why was the meeting held in a hotel just before the polls? he asked.         
	The director of the American Centre, Calcutta, Douglas Kelly, denied that any secret meeting was held with minority community leaders.         
	The charge is baseless and absurd. No such clandestine meeting took place recently. We do meet leaders of political parties and communities openly to have better knowledge of the local situation. But we dont interfere in the internal affairs of the country, Kelly said.        
	Buxla to contest        
	Joachim Buxla, who resigned from the RSP after being denied a ticket, has said he may fight from Alipurduar as an Independent.        
	Buxla, who has won Alipurduar four times for the RSP, today said: There is every possibility that I shall contest the Alipurduar seat as an Independent candidate, probably backed by an apolitical organisation. Negotiations are in the final rounds and the formal announcement will be made within a couple of days.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Left slams governors tandava salvo 
                                                                                                               Left slams governors tandava salvo 
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Aug. 7: The Left Front today again questioned governor Gopalkrishna Gandhis neutrality following his expression of concern about the spiral of violence in Bengal since the parliamentary polls.        
	We would humbly like to submit that the constitutional head of the state should exhibit more apparent neutrality while making statements in public, the front said.         
	Gandhi had described the bloodbath as a veritable tandava last night and said: I believe, those who can act are not doing so.         
	The government today stressed the chief minister was as concerned as the governor about the violence and that steps to contain it were being taken in earnest.         
	The front shared the grief expressed by the governor but, pained and compelled, it complained that he had failed to make the distinction between the killers and the killed. A team of Left MLAs had met the governor earlier and alleged atrocities by the Trinamul Congress-led Opposition.        
	Todays front statement pointed out that the governor had not expressed his concern in public about the violence unleashed by Maoists, particularly against CPM sympathisers. We have no knowledge of any public statement released from Raj Bhavan after the their attempt to kill the chief minister of the state, it said.         
	The CPM had also questioned Raj Bhavans stand after Gandhi expressed his cold horror following the police firing in Nandigram on March 14, 2007, that left 14 dead and condemned the partys recapture of Opposition-held areas that November. It accused Gandhi of turning a blind eye to crimes committed by Opposition supporters in the run-up to the firing and the recapture.        
	His role during Mamata Banerjees highway blockade in Singur to resist the Nano project also came under fire.        
	If (the) worship of force in all its forms has be to eradicated, the way (the) highest office of the state behaves should also call for a meaningful change, the front said today.        
	Governor Gandhis tenure is scheduled to end in December. While the CPM would like to see his back, Mamata would like to ensure his second term, todays reactions of the two camps suggested.        
	In Delhi, the railway minister said the governor was absolutely true. The CPM-led government that sponsors violence has no moral right to continue in power.        
	The front said the violence since the announcement of the Lok Sabha polls had been targeted against the CPM in particular. It claimed 74 CPM and two Forward Bloc workers had been killed and listed four Jharkhand Party (Naren) supporters, two villagers and three polling personnel among the other victims.        
	Referring to Gandhis mention of a perceptive Indian, the statement said such a person would not have missed the difference between the victims and the perpetrators.         
	While leaving Writers for the day, the chief minister did not respond to queries.        
	Chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti said: Our chief minister is as concerned as the governor....         
	Home secretary Ardhendu Sen and police chief Bhupinder Singh have been asked to take immediate steps to contain the violence. They will particularly focus on districts like West Midnapore, Purulia, Bankura and Burdwan, where clashes have been frequent. We are not sitting idle, the chief secretary added.        
	Mamata criticised the promulgation of prohibitory orders in violence-racked Mangalkot in Burdwan on the eve of a Trinamul teams visit.

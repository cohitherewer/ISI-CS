	Midnapore, Feb. 11: A seven-month baby was orphaned this morning when her parents, who had escaped with bruises when their jeep overturned, were crushed to death by a trailer while being taken for first aid minutes later.        
	Little Khushi, who had suffered scratches, had been carried across the road by a villager when her parents were hit a second time on a foggy stretch of National Highway 6 in Kharagpur.        
	Anshuman Roy, 30, a resident of Belpahari, had set out for Haldia with wife Subhomita, 25, and their baby around 5am. Police said the petrol pump owner was supposed to submit a bank draft to an oil company. They had also plan-ned to spend the night in the port town, 200km from home.        
	Roy was at the wheel of his Mahindra Bolero. There was dense fog and he was going slow. At Khemashuli (near Kharagpur), a truck from the opposite direction hit the Bolero. It turned turtle on the roadside, said an officer of the Kharagpur police station.        
	Villagers in a dhaba across the road rushed to help. We found the couple groaning in pain and the child crying, said Radhamohan Dolai.         
	The villagers straightened the jeep and yanked the doors open. Anshuman had a cut on his forehead and Subhomita had a swollen arm. The baby was almost unscathed.        
	The man gave his phone and asked one of us to call his father, said Radhamohan.         
	The trucks cleaner, Mirajuddin Ansari, 21, was helping Subhomita to the dhaba when the trailer pierced the fog and ran them over. Anshuman, a few feet away, also went under the wheels before the monster screeched to a halt.        
	Subhomita and Mirajuddin were killed on the spot. Anshuman died in hospital, said Jaleswar Tiwari, the officer in charge of Kharagpur.        
	Anshumans parents arrived two hours later. Their granddaughter was still at the dhaba, cheerful in the arms of a village woman.         
	They went to the hospital in Kharagpur and broke down. Anshuman usually went to Haldia alone. Today, he took his wife and child, said Anshumans father Swapan, 55.

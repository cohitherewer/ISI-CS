The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Coal towns to be shifted
                                                                                                               Coal towns to be shifted
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, July 30: The cabinet committee on infrastructure today approved a master plan to relocate Jharia and Raniganj towns at a cost of Rs 9,657 crore to save the areas from underground.        
	A fire has been burning under the Jharia coalfields for nearly a century. Buildings and roads have caved in because of the slow-burning fire whose fumes cause breathing disorders among the local people.         
	Burdwans Raniganj, the oldest coal mining area in the country, is less affected by the fires but the long-term danger to the area is as much.         
	The fires can start at rather low temperatures but if not checked early can burn for many years.

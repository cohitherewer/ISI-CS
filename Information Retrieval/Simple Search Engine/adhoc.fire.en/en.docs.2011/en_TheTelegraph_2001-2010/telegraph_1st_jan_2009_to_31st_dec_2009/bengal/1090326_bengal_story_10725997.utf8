The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Hostel head charred
                                                                                                               Hostel head charred
                            
	Midnapore, March 25: The superintendent of a girls school hostel was found in flames in her room last night, desperately looking for the door bolted from inside.        
	Archana Giri, 36, managed to open the door before horrified teachers and boarders but she died in hospital.        
	Police said a guard of Da- shagram Mangalbharati Khajuri Balika Vidyalaya, about 150km from Calcutta, saw smoke billowing out of Giris room around 11.30pm. He screamed for help and others rushed in. They found the lady in the room with her sari ablaze. The door was locked and they tried to douse the flames throwing water from the window, said an officer.        
	After Giri managed to open the door, she started run-ning towards a pond in the school compound but collapsed midway. The boarders had last seen her chatting to two teachers around 9.30pm.         
	Nearly 1,500 people, including guardians, gathered in front of the school today and alleged Giri was murdered.

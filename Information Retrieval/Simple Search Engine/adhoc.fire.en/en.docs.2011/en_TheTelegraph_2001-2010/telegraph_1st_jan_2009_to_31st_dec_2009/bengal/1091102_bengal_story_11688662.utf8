The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Kishanji peace sermon to PC
                                                                                                               Kishanji peace sermon to PC
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 1: Maoist leader Kishanji today said his outfit did not believe in violence and asked the Union home minister to shun confrontation, seeking to crank up a public relations war in the run-up to a planned security offensive.        
	In a four-page statement, the guerrilla leader said: Chidambarambabu you shun the path of violence. Violence has never been an agenda of our organisation and it will never be. You ask your Congress party and others like the Trinamul Congress and the CPM to shun violence.        
	The guerrillas have killed 58 people in West Midnapore alone in the past four months.        
	Asked earlier about the killings, the Maoists military wing chief had said: The organisation has punished those who betrayed the poor. The government had failed to bring justice to them, we did.         
	Kishanji had also claimed that he was considered soft within the organisation and had killed only 50 per cent of those who should have been.         
	On Friday, Union home minister P. Chidambaram had offered to include issues like land acquisition, forest rights and development in talks if the Maoists abjured violence  a last-ditch bid at peace before a full-blown offensive.        
	Operation Green Hunt is set to be launched against the rebels in Chhattisgarh and it is likely to cover several states by the year-end.         
	Delhi had earlier stressed the need for the rebels to lay down arms for any dialogue.        
	Kishanjis reaction to the offer was ambiguous. He said: At the same time, you are describing us as the prime enemy and threat to countrys internal security. Now you decide what will be the agenda if we hold a dialogue with the government.        
	A senior home ministry official said in Delhi the Maoists had been speaking about state-sponsored terrorism and violence in different languages at different points of time.        
	Almost confirming what the official said, a guerrilla leader called Azad issued a sta- tement in Hyderabad today. The armed struggle against the oppression of the poor and the tribals is the backbone of our philosophy, he said, adding that the CPI (Maoist) had the stamina to withstand the combined attack of all forces.         
	Kishanji said Chidambaram had rightly ruled out the CPMs allegations about the guerrillas nexus with Mamata Banerjee.        
	However, he added that Mamata had her own armed cadres. What is your reaction to the thousands of armed cadres of your cabinet colleague Mamata Banerjee? he asked.

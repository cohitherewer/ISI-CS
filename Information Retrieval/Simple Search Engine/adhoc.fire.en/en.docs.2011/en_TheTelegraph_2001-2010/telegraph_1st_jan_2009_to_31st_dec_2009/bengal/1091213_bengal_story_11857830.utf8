The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Hill protests spoil year-end holiday
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Hill protests spoil year-end holiday
          VIVEK CHHETRI                               
	Darjeeling, Dec. 12: Tourists once eager to spend Christmas and the New Year in the hills have started leaving after the Gorkha Janmukti Morchas announcement of strikes in the hills demanding statehood.        
	December does not fall in the regular tourist season in the hills but travellers still reach Darjeeling between December 22 and January 1.        
	However, after the Morcha started hunger strikes in the hills yesterday and announced a four-day bandh from Monday, tourists like Vinayak Shah from Gujarat do not want to take chances.        
	I wasnt told all liquor shops were shut and now with this tense situation in town, I have decided to cut short my holiday and leave Darjeeling on Sunday, Shah said.         
	He barely managed to stay two days, having reached Darjeeling only yesterday.        
	Some vacationers who dont want the New Year spirit to get dampened have chosen to go to neighbouring Sikkim or Bhutan.         
	A hotelier said: Instead of cancelling their stay, many of my clients are asking us to divert their vacation to Sikkim and also Bhutan if we can.         
	Even sudden snowfall, an event coveted by hill tourists, might not be enough of an attraction to keep the tourists this time, the hotelier said.        
	But a hotel owners association that backs the Morcha made it clear that the demand for Gorkhaland took precedence over the need for tourists. Although there arent many tourists now, a strike always affects business. But our priority is the demand for statehood, said Sangay Tshering Bhutia, president of the Janmukti Hotel Owners Association.         
	The students wing of the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha has said its activists will launch hunger strikes from December 19. If the four-day bandh fails to evoke a positive response from the Centre, the students will take the lead to intensify the agitation, said Kismat Chhetri, president of the Gorkha Janmukti Vidyarathi Morcha.         
	In every statehood agitation, be it for Jharkhand or for Telangana, the students played a major role, said Keshav Raj Pokhral, general secretary of the Vidyarthi Morcha.         
	 A womens delegation led by Asha Gurung, wife of Bimal Gurung, left for Delhi today. She will be joined by 70 more members of the Nari Morcha in a relay hunger strike at Jantar Mantar from Monday.

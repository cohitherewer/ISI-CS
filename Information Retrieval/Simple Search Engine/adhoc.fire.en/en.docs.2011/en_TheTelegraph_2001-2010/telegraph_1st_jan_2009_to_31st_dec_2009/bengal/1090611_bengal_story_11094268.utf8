The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CPM report to play safe
                                                                                                               CPM report to play safe
          BISWAJIT ROY                              
	Calcutta, June 10: Preliminary assessments by the CPM state secretariat and district units have blamed national as well as local factors for the Lok Sabha poll debacle but a report to be submitted before a meeting is expected to desist from pinpointing the issue that played a greater role.        
	The factors mentioned the report will be discussed by the two-day CPM state committee meeting beginning tomorrow. It will be attended by general secretary Prakash Karat and politburo member Sitaram Yechury. S. Ramachandran Pillai, a politburo member known to be close to Karat, is also expected to join them.         
	CPM state secretary Biman Bose, who will present the report at the meeting, will not stress on any particular reason as there are differences of opinion within the party.         
	Party sources said Bose would blame the huge erosion in the Lefts support base among all sections of people on the combined effects of all factors  implying that the success of the Trinamul Congress-Congress alliance cannot be attributed to their unity alone.         
	The report from the districts have also indicated multiple factors.         
	These include voters rejection of Karats cherished anti-Congress, anti-BJP third front as well as farmers discontent over land acquisition and the state governments poor record in rural development and implementing social sector projects.        
	Nepotism, corruption, arrogance of party, panchayat and municipal leaders also led to the CPMs growing isolation from the people, according to the party reports.         
	Its not Muslims alone, but a large section of the rural poor of all communities who used to vote for us deserted us this time. Also, we failed to offset the Nandigram effect by the Nano effect. Even a large section of urban middle class which we had expected to support us on industrialisation voted for the Opposition, said a state secretariat member.        
	Karat had defended his focus on the third front while Yechury had felt that the formation of such a combine could not be a cut-and-paste job.         
	Yechury, along with Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Bose, were also said to have opposed attempts to burn bridges with the Congress in the post-poll scenario.

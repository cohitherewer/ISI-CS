                                                                                                               Patrol off, Nandi in fear
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Nandigram, May 6: CPM and Trinamul Congress supporters living in pockets of Nan-digram dominated by their rivals are on the edge since half the 300-odd policemen who patrolled the villages were pulled out last night for poll duty elsewhere.        
	Around 500 paramilitary personnel have been deployed in Nandigram since Sunday for tomorrows polls but they have only been patrolling the main roads.        
	We were forced to withdraw the police from the camps because the additional forces we received were inadequate, a senior East Midnapore officer said.        
	Many villagers, living under threats even when the police patrolled the area regul-arly, said they were too scared to venture out to vote.         
	Kalipada Haldar, 38, of Sonachura, a farm labourer and CPM supporter, lives in a Trinamul fortress. There are 30 others like him in the village of several hundred. We are living under constant threats. Today, we heard many policemen have been withdrawn. The central forces have not come into the village. How are we going to vote? asked Kalipada.        
	In CPM-dominated Satengabari, Trinamul supporters face a similar situation. As soon as the police left, CPM cadres started going door to door, asking us not to vote, said Sambhu Das.        
	District police chief P.K. Ghosh said five companies of central forces would guard the booths and half a company patrol 200sqkm of Nandigram with state police and EFR personnel. However, theres nothing to be afraid of, there will be enough patrolling, he added.        
	Maoist boycott call        
	The CPI (Maoist) has called for a poll boycott in Nandigram. A statement issued by the secretary of Nandigram zonal committee, Selim, said the Maoists had led the Nandigram movement for 11 months and Trinamul had nothing to do with the peoples resistance.

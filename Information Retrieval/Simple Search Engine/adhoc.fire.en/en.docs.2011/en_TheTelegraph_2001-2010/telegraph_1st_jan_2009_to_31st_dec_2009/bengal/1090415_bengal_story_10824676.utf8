The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Power-share pill in Karat dose
                                                                                                               Power-share pill in Karat dose
  - CPM will seriously consider joining govt, says party chief          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Karat in Calcutta on Tuesday. Picture by Amit Datta                                        
	Calcutta, April 14: Prakash Karat today said the CPM would seriously consider joining the Union government after the elections.         
	He didnt stop at that. At a media conference in Calcutta this afternoon, he kept open the possibility of the CPM projecting Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee as a possible replacement for Manmohan Singh.         
	The question of participation in the government at the Centre is open. If a non-Congress, non-BJP government can be formed at the Centre, the issue will be seriously considered. The matter will be discussed after the polls, Karat said.         
	The CPM leader, instrumental in enforcing the historic blunder that denied Jyoti Basu prime ministership in 1996, had made a tentative statement on the possibility of sharing power a few weeks ago but todays was more emphatic.        
	Asked about Bhattacharjees prime ministerial prospects, he said: I am not saying anything on it. We are not putting forward any name. Let us decide first on participation in the government, then we would ponder whether to lead it.        
	Although cautious not to touch any raw nerve in prospective partners like Mayavati, who nurse aspirations to replace Singh, Karats statement on joining and leading the government shed some light on the CPMs poll strategy. The move is being seen as an attempt to better poll prospects by reassuring party supporters that their vote would not go waste and boosting the morale of cadres who are fighting a tough battle this time in Bengal.        
	Bhattacharjee was more forthright in declaring the Bengal leaderships position. If the people want, we will join the third front government. Thats why we need to strengthen the Left presence in Parliament, the chief minister told a rally at Birlapur.         
	Karat made it clear that he wouldnt mind if the Congress extended support to a Left-led third front government but refused to offer help to any Congress-led dispensation in case of a hung Parliament.         
	There is no question of any understanding with the Congress after the polls as the chances of forming a secular alternative are bright, he said.         
	I hope the Congress will have the wisdom to (support the Left-led front), the CPM leader added. Earlier, we supported them for a secular government. This time, the Congress has to take the call.        
	The third front will not have a problem picking a Prime Minister if it gets the numbers, he said. Ours is a federal alliance and all the constituents in our 10-party combination have leaders with experience. They have a right to project their prime ministerial candidates as (Mayavatis) BSP has done. But it has also been agreed that the matter will be decided by common consent after the polls.         
	The CPM is facing a tough fight both in Bengal and Kerala, but Karat said the Lefts seat-strength would not decide the future of the third front government. Its role and political understanding will shape the alternative.        
	The Congress-Trinamul alliance and issues like Nandigram will make an impact, he admitted.         
	Confident that the anti-Congress, anti-BJP parties would be in a position to stake claim to form the government, Karat pinned his hopes on a post-poll realignment of the non-Congress secular forces.

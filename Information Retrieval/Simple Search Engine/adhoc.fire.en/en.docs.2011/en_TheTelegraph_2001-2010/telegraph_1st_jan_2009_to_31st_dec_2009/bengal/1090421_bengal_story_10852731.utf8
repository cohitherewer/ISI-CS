The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Air force halts Pranab
                                                                                                               Air force halts Pranab
                            
	Calcutta, April 20: Rally-hopping Pranab Mukherjee was stuck for 40 minutes at Calcutta airport today because his chopper pilot had not obtained a mandatory clearance from the air force.        
	The foreign minister had to wait for two hours yesterday when the chopper ran out of fuel while he was touring north Bengal with Mamata Banerjee. Unlike Mamata, though, he did not blame the CPM for trying to sabotage his campaign schedule. He flew to Purulia after the 40-minute delay today.        
	It is mandatory for the pilot or his authorised representative to submit an application in person and get the clearance from the air force unit in the airport, a defence official said.

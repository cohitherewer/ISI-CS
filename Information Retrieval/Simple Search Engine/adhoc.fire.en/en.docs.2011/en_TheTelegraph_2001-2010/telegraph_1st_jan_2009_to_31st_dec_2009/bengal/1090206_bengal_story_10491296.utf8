                                                                                                               Girl electrocuted on way to school
  - Power department accused of negligence, blamed for the death of 9-year-old          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Balurghat, Feb. 5: A nine-year-old girl was electrocuted today on way to school.        
	Rumpa Oraon, a student of Sishu Sikhsha Kendra at East Maheshpur in Bolla, 30km from here, was going to school around 11am when she stamped on a 11,000 volt high-tension wire lying on a field.        
	Local people alleged that the wire had snapped yesterday and they had informed the power department about it. But the power supply had not been disconnected, a resident said.        
	Rumpas father has been missing for the past few years. Her mother who has been staying with her grandparents is too shocked to react. Charan Oraon, the girls grandfather who ekes out a living by farming, said they were too poor to take up the mater with the authorities.         
	According to Charan, police did not take any initiative to disconnect the line. The body had to lie there for long as no one could touch it.        
	Zilla parishad member and local RSP leader Lakshmi Oraon said he had contacted the divisional manager of the West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (WBSEDCL), Subhendu Sarkar. But no one had come to disconnect the line till 3pm.        
	So I had to call up district magistrate Ashok Banerjee and subdivisional officer Krishna Murdi seeking their intervention. They sent the police and the body was brought out of the field around 4pm, the RSP leader said.        
	Residents of the area have expressed their resentment over the body lying unattended for long. The zilla prasihad member alleged that the girl had to die because of the negligence of the electricity department.         
	This is inhuman. We demand exemplary punishment of those responsible for the premature death of a little girl. Had they disconnected the line in time, the tragedy would not have taken place, Lakshmi said.        
	The divisional manager of the WBSEDCL described the incident unfortunate. I will inquire into the matter and take departmental steps against those responsible for it, he said.         
	The department would also consider paying compensation to the bereaved family, the official said.        
	Trinamul Congress supporters today demonstrated at the block development office in Balurghat demanding punishment of the guilty and compensation for the girls family.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Deepa touch to protest
                                                                                                               Deepa touch to protest
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 5: More than 100 Youth Congress members, said to be the supporters of Deepa Das Munshi, demonstrated at the party headquarters here today, asking the leadership not to surrender the Congress at Mamata Banerjees feet for the sake of an alliance ahead of the Lok Sabha elections.        
	The protest took place when All India Youth Congress general secretary Nadim Yadav, who was on a days visit to the city as an emissary of Rahul Gandhi, was holding discussions with party workers.         
	Yadav looked on helplessly as the protesters resorted to sloganeering for nearly half an hour.         
	Yadav was sent here by Rahul Gandhi to know Youth Congress members opinion about a possible alliance with Trinamul. But we felt ashamed at the way he had faced protest from a few party members, said state Youth Congress president Amitava Chakraborty. He claimed the demonstrators dispersed only after he intervened.         
	Sources in the Pradesh Congress Committee said the demonstration had been engineered by those owing allegiance to Deepa Das Munshi, the Congress MLA and the wife of Union minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi.         
	Deepa had last week held a rally in south Calcutta, considered to be Mamatas political turf, saying the leadership should not surrender the organisation to Mamatas feet for the sake of alliance with her party.         
	Our demonstration was to protest against the manner in which the leadership was busy forging an alliance with Trinamul, sacrificing the ideals of the Congress. We were here to iterate what Deepa Boudi had earlier said on the alliance with Mamata, said Tapan Agarwal, a Youth Congress general secretary.         
	The PCC leaders admitted that the party was divided into two camps: one favouring the tie-up at any cost, while the other opposing any alliance in which Mamata will be allowed to dictate terms.         
	While Deepa, Congress Legislature Party chief Manas Bhunia and PCC general secretary Shankar Singh belong to the first camp, two PCC working presidents, Subrata Mukherjee and Pradip Bhattacharya are in the opposite camp.        
	Trinamul, however, refused comment.

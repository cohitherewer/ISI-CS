          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Haripada Mahatos wife holds a saline bottle while he was stretchered into hospital. (Samir Mondal)                                  
	Midnapore, May 10: Suspected Maoists today gunned down in Lalgarh a rebel who had quit the guerrilla ranks and even got himself a decent job.        
	Five bullets were pumped into Haripada Mahatos head, chest, stomach and back when he was bathing in a pond early this morning. He was taken to Midnapore Medical College and Hospital, where he worked as a guard. From there he was referred to Calcutta. He died on the way.        
	He (Haripada) needed a complicated surgery and that is why we referred him to Calcutta, said S.K. Santra, the superintendent of the Midnapore hospital.         
	The police said Haripada used to be an action squad member of the Peoples War Group, which merged with the Maoist Communist Centre in 2004 to form the CPI (Maoist).        
	Charged with planting land mines and involvement in murder of CPM workers, he was out on bail. After the formation of the CPI (Maoist), he gradually distanced himself from the outfit and got the job with the help of then district police chief Ajay Nanda, an officer said.        
	The police believe Haripada was shot dead by Maoists. Son Chandan, 17, said: My father had been a Maoist. He would always be on the run as the police were after him. There were many raids on our house. But gradually, he dissociated himself from the rebels.        
	Haripada, 48, had come home on a two-day leave. He was to join duty today.         
	Chandans sister Anjana, 22, said their father was being threatened by Maoists. The Maoists were asking him to return to their fold , she said.

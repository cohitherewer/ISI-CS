                                                                                                               Teachers duster hit kills girl
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Babli Ghosh, from the family album                                  
	Durgapur, May 15: A Class V girl died last night after her Bengali teacher threw a duster at her because she had failed to do her homework.        
	Babli Ghosh, 11, lived with her grandfather in Andal, Burdwan, and had been admitted to Andal Girls High School on May 5.         
	Teacher Rekha Bhakat had asked her students to memorise a poem at home but Babli told her she had not been able to buy her Bengali book yet. The duster hit Bablis head and she fell unconscious, classmates said. This was around 12.15pm yesterday.        
	She slipped to the floor. The teacher sprinkled water on her face and she came back to sense, a classmate said. Bhakat escorted her to the staff room and asked her to rest. The girl started vomiting around 2.30pm.         
	A peon said the headmistress asked her to be taken to a nursing home.        
	Bablis grandfather was informed around 4.30 that she had been taken to the nursing home after she fell ill because of the heat. I found her gasping. She whispered to me the Bengali teacher had thrown a duster at her, the sobbing grandfather said. Bablis condition worsened and she died on the way to a private hospital in Durgapur.        
	Her parents live in Barasat, North 24-Parganas, where her father trades in two-wheeler spares. Shibendranath Ghosh came to Andal and lodged an FIR against Bhakat. The headmistress, too, lodged a police complaint against her. Police said they were looking for Bhakat, who did not come to school today.        
	The police rescued the headmistress and her colleagues and escorted them home after they remained gheraoed for over three hours by guardians.        
	We have repeatedly told teachers not to beat up students. Action will be taken against the teacher, schools minister Partha De said.

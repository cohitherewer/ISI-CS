          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 12: Angry supporters today abused Congress leader Subrata Mukherjee, calling him Mamatas middleman when he went to Bishnupur West to oversee the withdrawal of the party candidates nomination for the February 26 bypoll.         
	On Tuesday, the Congress said it would withdraw its candidate, Mumtazuddin Gazi, a gesture seen as a step towards a possible Congress-Trinamul alliance for the general election.        
	They called me Mamatas dalal (middleman), Mukherjee said. He had to bundle Gazi into a car to avoid the demonstrators, he said.        
	Asked if Deepa Das Munshis supporters were involved, Mukherjee said: Ask local Congress workers. I will not say anything about it.         
	Deepa, Union minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshis wife, is opposed to an alliance with Trinamul. Her supporters have denied involvement in the protest.

	Calcutta, July 20: The rejuvenation of the Congress received Rahul Gandhis touch today with a GeNext face of the Grand Old Party making her presence felt near the seat of power during a protest against the assault on party MLAs in Burdwans Mangalkot.         
	Over 300 Youth Congress activists  including Mahua Moitra, who chucked her job with financial services firm JP Morgan Chase to be a part of Rahuls youth brigade  surprised the men in uniform outside Writers Buildings by breaching Section 144 and courting arrest.         
	We are protesting against the attack on our legislators in Mangalkot. Despite promising action, the government hasnt yet arrested the accused in the case, thundered Mahua, in her 30s, as she was being packed into a van.         
	Last week, the GenEx  led by Subrata Mukherjee, who earned his political spurs under Rahuls grandmother Indira Gandhi and remained a strongman in the time of his father Rajiv  did their bit on Mangalkot by forcing a total shutdown on the state.         
	Mukherjee had claimed that the involvement of supporters in street protests  during which public buses were smashed and burnt  was a clear indication that the party was in a resurgent mode in Bengal.         
	But todays mode of protest  courting arrest instead of attacking cops or burning public property  had the signature element of the Congresss First Family.         
	The government diverted the attention from the main issue by highlighting the burning of buses but they did nothing to arrest the people who assaulted the MLAs. So our protest today was to highlight the issue and start a constructive dialogue with the government, Mahua explained after her release.         
	Nine Congress MLAs were chased across paddy fields and stoned on Wednesday when they went to distribute relief among supporters at a village in Mangalkot where many homes have been torched in political clashes since mid-June.         
	The police today held 107 activists  including Youth Congress state president Amitava Chakrabarty  and sent then to the central lock-up at Lalbazar from where they were released four hours later.         
	Although the cops had a tip-off about the protest, the number of protesters took them by surprise and a senior officer admitted that they did not expect such a strong turnout at a Youth Congress initiative.         
	The party workers are feeling rejuvenated in the state and we are trying to involve more young people in our activities, said Mahua, who courted her first arrest today.         
	More than 10 Youth Congress units took part in the protest, which was planned barely 24 hours ago, she added.         
	According to her, the Youth Congress will carry out a slew of anti-government programmes in the next few months, starting with a march to Lalbazar on July 28.

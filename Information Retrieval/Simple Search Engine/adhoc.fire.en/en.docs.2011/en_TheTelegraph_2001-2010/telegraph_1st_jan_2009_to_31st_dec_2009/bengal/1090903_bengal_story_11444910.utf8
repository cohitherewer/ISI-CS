The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Jumbo illusion in Lalgarh lab
                                                                                                               Jumbo illusion in Lalgarh lab
										      SUJAN DUTTA      BACK TO LALGARH                        A schoolboy looks back at jawans on a Lalgarh street crawling with police. (File picture)				                                 
	Lalgarh, Sept. 2: Shots that ring out in the night are like tracers in the darkness. They spray panic among villagers. The villagers were chasing hungry elephants; the police mistook them for Maoists.        
	The men and women of Kantapahari were raising a hue and cry because the animals were too close to their homes.        
	As if life in the Lalgarh laboratory  as the Centre describes it  were not already difficult, a people and a police that have a tenuous relationship now have to contend with elephants.        
	Kantapahari, 4km north of Lalgarh police station, was also a suspected Maoist hub. Three hungry elephants emerged from the forests one night last week. The people shouted and came out with flaming torches.        
	A road patrol of Bengal and central police, which could not see the elephants, was as scared as the villagers. It thought a Maoist-led mob was heading towards it to mount an attack on the Kantapahari Vivekananda Vidyapeeth, where the police have set up camp.        
	The police opened fire  that is what the villagers thought  in the direction from where they heard the noise. The police say they only fired tear gas.        
	It was some time before a villager telephoned one of the policemen he had got acquainted with and pleaded with the force to stop because elephants were on the rampage.        
	In the morning, the remains of three mud and half-pucca houses marked out the depredations of the elephants. Three families are shelterless. And it is raining.        
	Lalgarh is the laboratory for the kind of operation we will carry out in Chhattisgarh (and elsewhere), Union home secretary G.K. Pillai had said on August 20.         
	In Lalgarh, he said, the security forces had been by and large successful but the operation was still incomplete because the wanted Maoists were absconding.        
	This was surprising after Bengal home secretary Ardhendu Sens August 6 admission of failure. He said Phase I  the opening of main roads in Lalgarh between June 17 and June 29  was successful but since then the offensive had run aground.        
	If Lalgarh is a laboratory, the people and the police (and even the elephants) that inhabit the place must be its guinea pigs. The scientists are drawing different conclusions. But whatevers fizzing inside the experiments is slated to become the template for the Centres anti-Naxalite offensive, being planned with seven states.        
	Life in a laboratory flask is constantly on the boil. Take Kantapahari, for instance, where The Telegraph correspondent was on August 26.        
	The people lead you to the forecourt of the temple, the Harimandir. By the temple tank, a group of burly men in underwear are soaping themselves at the community tube-well. They are policemen camping at the high school. They bathe elaborately, spraying lather, their wet underwear and flimsy towels all but exposing their buttocks.        
	By the same well and from its second tap, village women fill metal and earthen pots with drinking water. They try to turn their backs to the men and pretend not to see.        
	How would they like it if we men do this in front of their wives and mothers and sisters? asks a shopkeeper.         
	We have repeatedly asked them to stop but this is the scene here from morning till evening.        
	There is a tube-well inside the school where the police are camping. But that is either not enough for the number of men who need to bathe or there is more fun in bathing at the tube-well by the temple.        
	For the local people, it is as if their world has been invaded. Its not funny, says Deepak Pratihar, a security guard of a mobile service providers tower on the school grounds, to be felt up by them every time I go to check the machines. He pulls up his lungi and drops it for emphasis.        
	Pratihar may or may not be politically motivated but the people who have gathered around in the tea stall nod agreement with much that he has to say.        
	Inside the school, the central forces are having lunch, a simple but freshly cooked meal of rice, dal and a vegetable. Commandant Pankajs cellphone buzzes, he excuses himself  which in any case he wanted to because it is best to shut out the media. He is told of two more improvised explosive devices that have been found.        
	The presence of the rebels is pervasive. Here it manifests itself in a lump of gelatine and chemical packed into a tin can that many people store cereals in.         
	It weighs you down as you lift it in one hand. It weighs 6.5 kilos. If it detonates under a normal four-wheel passenger car, the vehicle would blow up, tearing its occupants limb from limb.         
	On the other hand, it may be a dud, a dummy. In Lalgarh, you never know till it explodes.

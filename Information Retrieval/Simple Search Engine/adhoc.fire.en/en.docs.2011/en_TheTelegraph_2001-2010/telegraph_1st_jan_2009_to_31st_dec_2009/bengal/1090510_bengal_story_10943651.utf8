The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Mercury past 42, no relief in sight
                                                                                                               Mercury past 42, no relief in sight
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, May 9: Calcuttans endured the hottest day this summer as the mercury crawled up to 42.1 degrees Celsius and the Met office warned that respite from the sticky heat wont come soon.         
	Todays maximum tempe-rature was six degrees above normal and the highest in May since 2003. Calcuttas hottest day ever was May 28, 1958, when the mercury read 43.7C.        
	A weather official said: There is no respite in sight as weather conditions are likely to remain the same for the next 24 to 48 hours.        
	A heat wave is prevailing, said G.C. Debnath, the director of the regional meteorological centre.        
	With loo-like conditions this afternoon, the discomfort index shot up from the equivalent of 64C yesterday to that of 69.6C today, the highest in the season.         
	The discomfort index is calculated on the basis of temperature, wind-flow pattern, humidity and other factors. The normal discomfort index in Calcutta in May is equivalent to 55C  that is, a person would be as uncomfortable as he would feel if the temperature were 55C but all other factors were at the highest comfort level.        
	Hot, dry westerlies blowing from central and western India are pushing the mercury up, a Met official said. The only change is the development of a low-pressure trough over north Bengal but the city will not get any rain from this. Instead, it will push up the humidity, the weather office said.

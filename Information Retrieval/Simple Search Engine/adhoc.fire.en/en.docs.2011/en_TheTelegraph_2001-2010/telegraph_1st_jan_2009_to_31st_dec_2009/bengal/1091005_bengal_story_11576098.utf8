The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Cong to clear misgivings 
                                                                                                               Cong to clear misgivings 
          BARUN GHOSH                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 4: The Congress leadership wants to speak to Mamata Banerjee to clear misgivings about the Siliguri mayors election.        
	K. Keshava Rao, the Congress general secretary in charge of Bengal, today said over the phone from Hyderabad that he would meet Mamata in a day or two. Mamataji has misunderstood us. But she is a best friend of mine and I shall talk to her on my return to Delhi to clear her misgivings on Siliguri, he said.        
	Raos reaction came hours after Mamata told a meeting in Siliguri that her friend, the Congress, had become greedy. She also said that her allys decision to take the Lefts support was taken by national-level leaders.        
	Congress sources said Bengal party president Pranab Mukherjee, before leaving for abroad, had asked Rao to speak to the Trinamul chief.         
	Rao also said the party would probe under what circumstances the party councillors in Siliguri had sought the Lefts support to bag the Siliguri mayor and chairpersons posts.        
	We dont like to antagonise Mamataji when we are facing a string of elections in the next two years. We want to keep the alliance with her intact and take it forward to the 2011 Assembly polls to put an end to the CPMs misrule in Bengal, Rao said.        
	Asked about Mamatas allegation about Congress councillors being greedy, he said: It may be that Mamataji is hinting at party councillors lust for power. This is why we have sought a report from our district leaders to ascertain why they had failed to reach a consensus on the mayoral candidate in consultation with Trinamul functionaries.         
	A Congress leader said from Delhi that efforts were still on to persuade Trinamul councillors to share power with the Congress in the civic board. We have sent necessary instructions to the new mayor to take Trinamul councillors into confidence, he said.         
	Mayor Gangotri Dutta said over the phone from Siliguri she would wait for the Trinamul councillors for a few more days so they would co-operate with us. We have not decided about mayor-in-council members yet on the assumption that some posts might be offered to Trinamul.

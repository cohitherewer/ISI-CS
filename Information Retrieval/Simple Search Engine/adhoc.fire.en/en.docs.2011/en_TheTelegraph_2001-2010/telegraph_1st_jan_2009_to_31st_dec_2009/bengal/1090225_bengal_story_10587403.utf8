	Calcutta, Feb. 24: A schoolboy was pushed off a moving train at Liluah station after he jumped onto a ladies compartment this morning.        
	Rishabh Bhartiya, 13, fractured his arms. Father Rakesh said he was going for private tuition and boarded the ladies compartment because the others were crowded.

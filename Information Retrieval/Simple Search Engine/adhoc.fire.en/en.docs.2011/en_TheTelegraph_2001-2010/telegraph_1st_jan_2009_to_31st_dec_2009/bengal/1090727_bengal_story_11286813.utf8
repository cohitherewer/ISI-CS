	Calcutta, July 26: A passenger was tonight thrashed by auto drivers at Baguiati for refusing to pay nearly double the usual fare.        
	Businessman Pradeep Basu was asked to cough up Rs 12 for a ride from Ultadanga that usually costs him Rs 6.50. The excuse: a traffic snarl at Keshtopur.         
	When Basu, 35, refused, the driver called for his mates and together kicked and punched him. Then they tried to force Basu into an auto and whisk him away. When he resisted, they hit him with rods. Bystanders came to his rescue when he fell with a bleeding head. Basu has been hospitalised.

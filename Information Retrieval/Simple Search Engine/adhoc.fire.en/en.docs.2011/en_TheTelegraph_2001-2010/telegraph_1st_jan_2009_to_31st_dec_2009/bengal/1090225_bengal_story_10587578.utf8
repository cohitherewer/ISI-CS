The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Bridge course rescue for teacher schools 
                                                                                                               Bridge course rescue for teacher schools 
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 24: The National Council for Teacher Education has accepted a Bengal government proposal to conduct special bridge courses to try and salvage the careers of teacher trainees from institutes declared illegal by Calcutta High Court.         
	Trainees from illegal institutes that ran one-year cour-ses instead of the mandatory two-year curriculum will be considered qualified to teach if they clear the bridge course, the human resource development ministry hinted today.         
	The proposal, aimed at legalising degrees earned by students from the institutes declared illegal, has received in-principle approval from the council, junior HRD minister M.A.A. Fatmi told the Lok Sabha today.         
	Only those with 50 per cent marks in their 12th standard board examinations and the one-year degree will be allowed to sit for the bridge course, Fatmi said.         
	The state government said around 70,000 of the 75,000 affected students would benefit despite the conditions. Most of the remaining 5,000 candidates belong to SC, ST and other backward categories, said Sukumar Mahapatra, joint secretary of the state school education department.        
	All teacher training institutes must be recognised by the council for their degrees to be valid for teaching jobs. Institutions seeking recognition must adhere to course requirements set by the council. Its rules say courses must be of two-year duration.         
	Over a hundred teacher training institutions, running one-year courses in Bengal, were declared illegal last year. The decision put the careers of around 75,000 students  past and present  in jeopardy. The certificates on the basis of which thousands had obtained jobs in primary schools suddenly became illegal. Existing students, too, were in trouble.        
	In-principle approval does not immediately allow Bengal to start the bridge course. It has to wait for a formal nod. However, what Fatmi said was an indicator of the HRD ministrys decision to bend its own rules.         
	Ministry sources said the formal notification from the council, allowing Bengal to run the one-year bridge course could be issued as soon as later this week.         
	In Calcutta, Mahapatra said the council had informally informed us about its decision to allow the state government to conduct the bridge course last month.         
	We have written to the Centre requesting it to find a solution for those who have not scored 50 per cent in their Class 12 exam, the official said.        
	The impact of the HRD ministrys notification, when it comes, is likely to extend beyond Bengal, sources hinted.         
	Institutions in several other states, especially in the Northeast, also run one-year courses that have no legitimacy but have not yet been challenged in a court like in Bengal, an HRD ministry official said.

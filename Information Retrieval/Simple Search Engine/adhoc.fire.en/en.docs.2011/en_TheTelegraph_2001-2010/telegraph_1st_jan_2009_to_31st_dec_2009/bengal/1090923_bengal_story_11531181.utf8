	Enayetpur (West Midnapore), Sept. 22: Villagers of Enayetpur, which witnessed an encounter between Maoists and CPM activists last evening, and several adjoining areas have dug in their heels, preparing themselves for a bigger resistance battle.        
	Having repulsed the attack by the Maoists, villagers here are sending away women, children and the elderly so that the men can concentrate on neutralising the rebels.        
	Instead of fleeing, as has been the case in many villages in this district, the CPM activists here have decided to stay back and fight this time.        
	Today, at least 5,000 people left more than a dozen CPM-dominated villages like Enayetpur, Manidaha, Faridchak, Tikarpara, Ulta, Kenja, Berapal and Palashia for their relatives homes in Midnapore town and some villages in Jhargram and Kharagpur.        
	CPM activist Bikash Chalak, a farmer, saw off his wife Anjali and five-year-old son Anupam at the ferry ghat on the Kangshabati river. His family left for Kharagpur where his brother Rajesh is a cook in a hotel.        
	We sent off all our women and children today because we feel that the Maoists will attack our neighbourhood again and we will have to defend ourselves. It becomes difficult to fight with women, children and elderly people around, said Bikash.        
	Another CPM supporter, Aurobindo Ghosh, sent his father Anup and mother Anima to Khalshiuli village in Jhargram to his aunts house. I have two more brothers and we will stay at home to face the Maoists. If the Maoists come again, we will fight tooth and nail, said Aurobindo.        
	A CPM local committee member in Enayetpur said another reason the women, children and the elderly people were being sent away is to prevent them from being used as shields by the Maoists. The rebels are known to use hostages as human shields during confrontation with the security forces.        
	CPM district secretariat member Dahareswar Sen, however, said: The villagers are running away because they are scared of Maoist attacks.         
	Yesterday, CPM activists sheltered in the Enayetpur party office, 12km from Midnapore town, repulsed the attack by the Maoists. Shooting from both sides continued for several hours.        
	Security forces, who reached the spot only around midnight, were also engaged by the Maoists for a short while. The rebels then retreated into the forest.        
	Home secretary Ardhendu Sen said this evening that firing had taken place but added that no one was killed.        
	Yes, the CPM office in Enayetpur had been fired upon but there were no deaths; three persons were injured, Sen said at Writers Buildings. We have no information that there was firing from the people who were inside the party office and no arms or ammunition were found on the premises.        
	Sen said he was not aware of the political identities of those who were injured in the firing.        
	The injured, including two women, have been admitted to the Midnapore Medical College and Hospital. All three  Sombari Besra, 30, Dulali Besra, 23, and Kuthli Singh, 32  were at work in the fields when they were caught in the crossfire         
	Fearing trouble, authorities of two high schools at Gurguripal and Manidaha have declared them closed two days before the puja holiday starts.        
	In Enayetpur, the CPM activists have turned the party office into a virtual fortress. Sandbags have been placed on the roof of the two-storey building under a tarpaulin shed to provide cover if a shootout breaks out. The front wall of the building bore marks of at least a dozen bullets slammed home during yesterdays encounter.        
	The jungle of Enayetpur begins 200 metres away from the party office and spent cartridges were strewn on the ground in between.        
	On the roof of the party office, around a hundred Bermuda shorts and T-shirts were hanging from clotheslines  an indication of the mobilisation inside.

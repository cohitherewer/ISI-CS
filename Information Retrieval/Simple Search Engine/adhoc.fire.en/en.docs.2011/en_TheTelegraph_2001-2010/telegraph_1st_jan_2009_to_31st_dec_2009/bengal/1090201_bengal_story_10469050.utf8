The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Prayers for sons return futile
                                                                                                               Prayers for sons return futile
          A STAFF REPORTER                          A police sniffer dog scans the place where Yashs body was found. (Gopal Senapati)                                  
	Howrah, Jan. 31: The Lakhotias were praying for the safe return of Yash around a yagna fire yesterday. Less than 24 hours later, they had to consign their seven-year-old son to flames.        
	Father Anil, inconsolable all day, had to be taken away by a relative to the banks of the Hooghly so the funeral at Shibpur crematorium could go ahead.        
	Uncle Yash refused to leave his nephew as priests implored him to allow the last rites. Eventually, he had to, and the pyre was lighted.        
	Why do they (the kidnappers) have to take the life of an innocent little boy so brutally to settle their own scores? cried Ashok Kumar Shaw, one of the hundreds who lined the street outside the crematorium this evening.        
	Many who came did not know the family. Some wore black badges and were seen wiping away tears. They had arrived much before the hearse carrying Yashs body pulled in at 5pm. Many were discussing the way he was murdered. Others appeared too stunned to talk.        
	Yash was his fathers darling, said Madhulika Bhattacharjee, Yashs aunt who accompanied the hearse for a while before returning home to be with his mother Anita. He (Anil) had so many hopes from him and we never imagined he (Yash) would meet such a fate.        
	Trinamul Congress leader Mamata Banerjee arrived, too, and immediately blamed police for failing to save the boy.

                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Human shield finger at rebels
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Midnapore, Dec. 21: Residents of a Jhargram village where innocent people were caught in a crossfire between security forces and Maoists last evening today alleged that they had been forced to assemble to serve as a human shield for the guerrillas.        
	Two suspected Maoists were shot dead by the forces yesterday, but six villagers were hit by bullets. A third body was found inside Boira forest today, but police had not been able to identify him till late tonight.        
	Hundreds were surrounding the police, protesting arrests at a place where mines were found yesterday afternoon, when the guerrillas opened fire from a forest behind them.         
	Shots rang out as we started lobbing tear-gas shells to drive the villagers away, an officer said.         
	Three men  Gurucharan Tudu, Tapan Mahato and Surajit Singh  who took bullets in their legs are now at the Midnapore Medical College and Hospital. Three others  Pradip Midya, Gostobehari Midya and Durgesh Mahato  have been referred to a Calcutta hospital with gunshot wounds in their back or chest.         
	A relative of one of those shot said the guerrillas had gone to their village  Chandipur  on Saturday night and asked them to assemble at Boira, about 4km away, on Sunday. They told us to go there in the morning for a meeting. Even a five-month pregnant woman was forced to go, said Chameli (name changed on request).        
	Villagers, many of whom went to the Midnapore hospital to see the injured, said the Maoists had laid two improvised explosive devices around 1pm. Around 3pm, the joint forces reached the spot, spotted the IEDs and defused them. When the security forces advanced towards Boira village to conduct a raid, nearly 1,000 villagers surrounded them.         
	As the police tried to drive them away using tear gas, the guerrillas hiding in the forest skirting the village started fi-ring. The Maoists used us as a shield. They had told us to block the security forces. When we tried to gherao the jawans, the Maoists started firing at the forces from the jungle behind us, said Ratan Mahato, a resident of neighbouring Sirshi village.

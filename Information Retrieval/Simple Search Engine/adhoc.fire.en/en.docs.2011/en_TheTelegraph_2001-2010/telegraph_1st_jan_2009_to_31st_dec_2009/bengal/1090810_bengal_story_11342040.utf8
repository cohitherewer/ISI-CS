	Karimpur, Aug. 9: Primary schooling done, but alphabets not yet learnt.        
	Rubina Khatoon has studied till Class IV, the register in her village primary school testifies, but she does not know her alphabets  Bengali or English.         
	The reason: Rubina hardly came to school; she stayed at home and collected firewood.        
	Rubina is one of 45 students at her school in Barbakpur, Nadia, who cant read the alphabets. All are aged between 10 and 11 and have been on the rolls of Dakshin Barbakpur Primary School for four years.        
	Their illiteracy came to light when some of them sought admission to Class V in Barbakpur Madhyamik Shiksha Kendra, 180km from Calcutta.        
	Rubinas father Rasul Sheikh, a labourer, said: I have never been to school, nor has Rubinas mother. So, it is not possible for us to guide our daughter at home. She collects firewood and helps her mother with household chores.        
	Ditto for Harun Sardar, Rubinas classmate at the primary school. He spent his time collecting firewood and grass for the goat, his father Fazal said.        
	The Dakshin Barbakpur Primary School offers children free education and a midday meal. But this does not seem enough to convince poor families like Rubinas to send their children to school.        
	All the 45 illiterate children fall in the 6-14 age group, which means they are entitled to subsidised elementary education from the government under the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Bill, passed on August 4.        
	At the Barbakpur Madhyamik Shiksha Kendra, Sirajuddin Mondal, a teacher who took their test, said: We were shocked when we asked the students to read out a paragraph from a Class IV Bengali textbook as part of a test conducted by the zilla parishad. They did not know their alphabets.        
	When Abdul Majid Malikha, the headmaster of the primary school, was asked how the absence of the 45 students had escaped the teachers notice, he said: It is quite possible that 45 students could not learn the alphabets at the primary level. We have 309 students but there are only three teachers, including me. It is not possible to look into the academic progress of every student.        
	Schoolchildren from Class I to IV are not failed in class, so they dont have to face the stress of examinations.        
	The Class IV syllabus includes seven subjects  Bengali, English, mathematics, science, geography, history and environmental science. The children are to be taught poems and stories in Bengali, rhymes and sentence construction in English, elementary arithmetic, science and the basic geography of Bengal.        
	But all is not lost for Rubina and her classmates. Habibur Rahman, the headmaster of Barbakpur Madhyamik Shiksha Kendra, said his school had organised a crash course for the 45 so they would be able to follow the Class V lessons.        
	We have referred the matter to the zilla parishad as the admission process in Class V is held on the basis of instructions of the parishad, Rahman said.

                                                                                                               Boy rides into convoy
                            
	Calcutta, March 28: A 16-year-old motorcycle rider was caught after a police chase that began when he breached the governors convoy on the AJC Bose Road flyover and ended near Birla Planetarium.        
	Frightened by the police hooters, the boy flouted signals and dived into no-entry roads.         
	Police identified the boy as Mohammad Amanullah of Mominpur. He did not have a licence but the papers of his friends bike were in order.        
	This is the third breach of a VIP convoy this month. On March 19, a youth hit the last car of the chief ministers convoy. Three days later, a state bus almost hit his pilot car.

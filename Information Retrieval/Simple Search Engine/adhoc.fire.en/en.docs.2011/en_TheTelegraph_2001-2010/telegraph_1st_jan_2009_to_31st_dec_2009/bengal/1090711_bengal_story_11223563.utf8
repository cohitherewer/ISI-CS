	Midnapore: Two CPM supporters were abducted from a village 25km from Lalgarh on Friday evening and killed.        
	Police said the butchered bodies of Noni Mahato and Boren Mahato were found on the fringes of Sirish village, not far from Dherua where central forces marching towards Lalgarh had encountered their first resistance.         
	About 50 suspected Maoists torched the CPM office in the village and dragged away six CPM supporters. The four others are missing. The nearest paramilitary camp is at Dharampur, 11km away.

  - Discussion on early election demand         OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee				                                       
	Calcutta, Nov. 14: The CPM has decided to discuss with Left Front partners on Tuesday the drubbing in the bypolls and the allies demand for holding Assembly elections before 2011.        
	The CPM, which did not win a single seat in the byelections, has faced criticism from its partners, some of whom have demanded that the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government call mid-term polls.         
	The Left Front, unlike the CPM secretariat, does not meet at regular intervals. The partners assemble only if an issue requires discussion.        
	On Thursday, Socialist Party leader and state fisheries minister Kiranmoy Nanda had demanded that the Assembly polls be brought forward. Kshiti Goswami, an RSP secretariat member and PWD minister, had joined him, saying the people had rejected the front by giving a mandate against us in the recent elections.        
	Yesterday, Abdur Rezzak Mollah, a senior CPM leader and land and land reforms minister, too, said: The people have rejected the CPM. They wont vote for our party. That is the situation now and it will not change in the 2011 Assembly elections.        
	Goswami today said: We have been pressing for an emergency front meeting to discuss the successive debacles, starting with last years panchayat elections. Something has to be worked out to stem the rot.         
	He said front chairman Biman Bose had informed him about Tuesdays meeting. A thorough discussion is necessary to identify the weaknesses that have crept into the front and the government.        
	A CPM secretariat member said Tuesdays session would take note of the front partners opinion about the dos and donts the ruling coalition should implement.        
	People have voted us to power for over 32 years in an uninterrupted manner. But what is the reason for their sudden disenchantment with us? he said. We will have to repair the damage at any cost.        
	Some CPM functionaries and ministers today said the partys continuous attack on the Opposition merely because it is the Opposition had not gone down well with the people.        
	We will have to take the Opposition into confidence for development work in a democratic system. Constant criticism of them will not help the government, claimed junior panchayat minister Bankim Ghosh.        
	Ghosh, who is from Nadia, was perhaps referring to Bhattacharjees allegation that Trinamul had links with the Maoists.        
	A state committee member said Bhattacharjee should have verified the facts before pointing fingers at the Opposition. We should not oppose them for oppositions sake.        
	Home secretary Ardhendu Sen has said the government does not have any proof linking Trinamul to the Maoists.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Singur jab to deflect pullout punch
                                                                                                               Singur jab to deflect pullout punch
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, June 14: CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan today drew flak from his Bengal comrades for withdrawing support to the UPA over the Indo-US nuclear deal, but he blamed the state governments blunders for the Lefts worst electoral drubbing ever.         
	The Left fared poorly in Bengal for failures, mistakes and blunders of the state government, particularly its wrong ways of pursuing the goal of industrialisation in Singur, Nandigram and elsewhere, Bardhan said.         
	Unlike his CPM counter-part Prakash Karat, who had skirted the media after his state units post-mortem of the debacle, Bardhan spoke at the end of the CPIs two-day deliberations.         
	According to him, the partys Bengal council agreed that the opposition to the nuclear deal was correct. But the comrades felt the withdrawal of support was not correct as we were neither part of the government nor the UPA but had been supporting them from outside. What was the point in the withdrawal? We could have continued the suppo- rt while campaigning against the deal.         
	He added that the Bengal governments industrial policy was equally to blame for the rout. If the Left has suffered here, it is not because of the withdrawal of support but wrong ways of land acquisition and industrialisation. The governments moves in Singur and Nandigram were not correct.        
	However, Bardhan declined to hold chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee alone responsible for it. All of us should have acted to secure the lost ground.        
	Bardhan admitted that his comrades found the call for an anti-BJP, anti-Congress third front a wrong slogan. At the meeting, sources said, he was self-critical on the Delhi pullout, something Karat is yet to do despite pressure.        
	However, since the demand to fix individual responsibilities has shown the potential of snowballing into a call for change of guard, the CPI veteran kept his public admission pending till the meeting of the partys national council in July. We should not... look for scapegoats.... If there is any change (in leadership), it will come in the normal course.

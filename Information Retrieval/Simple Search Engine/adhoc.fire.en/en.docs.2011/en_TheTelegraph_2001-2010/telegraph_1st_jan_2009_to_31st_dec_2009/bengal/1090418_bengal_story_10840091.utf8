The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Force first batch to spare Lalgarh
                                                                                                               Force first batch to spare Lalgarh
  - Cops in Maoist-hit areas from April 22        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Calcutta, April 17: Central paramilitary forces will move into the Maoist-affected areas of West Midnapore and Purulia on April 22 but not Lalgarh.         
	The states chief electoral officer, Debashis Sen, said the decision to spare Lalgarh for the moment was taken because talks were on between the Election Commission and the local tribal leadership on the deployment of forces.         
	At a meeting between the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities, which is spearheading the resistance to police in Lalgarh, and Sen on Sunday, the poll panel had proposed that central forces be allowed to enter the area on polling day, April 30.        
	The tribal leadership will meet tomorrow to take a final decision on the proposal.         
	Some 500 booths in the Jhargram and Purulia Lok Sabha constituencies have been declared sensitive because of the Maoist menace.        
	Sen said: Of the 500 booths, 40 are in Lalgarh and we havent taken a final decision on sending central forces there immediately as we are waiting to hear about the stand of the tribal leadership.        
	However, a section of the state police administration is upset at the soft treatment that Lalgarh is receiving, especially in view of the fact that they have intelligence about Maoists shoring up their strength in the area in the absence of the security forces.        
	Some personnel of the state armed police were today stopped and heckled by a group of tribals demanding money because their goat had been bitten by a dog that allegedly strayed from a camp in Salboni, adjoining Lalgarh.        
	The state government should decide whether they want the police or the Maoists in Lalgarh, a senior officer said after the release of the policemen being held hostage for the goat. We should have been given more authority in dealing with them. The way we have to capitulate is humiliating.         
	The police believe precious time is being wasted by not allowing them to move in and deal with the Maoists calling the shots in the area.        
	A member of the Peoples Committee indicated that tomorrows meeting might decide to let the police enter Lalgarh on the polling day.        
	We may allow the police to enter Lalgarh for a day, committee member Shyamal Ma-hato said. The final decision will be taken by the majority at the meeting, but I dont think the stalemate will continue on the polling day.         
	After a meeting with inspector-general of police (law and order) Raj Kanojia at Writers Buildings, Sen said: We are all aware of the Naxalite menace and yesterdays Maoist strikes in neighbouring states have made us more alert. Keeping that in mind, we have decided to send the central paramilitary to the affected areas early so they get a week to get things worked out.         
	Yesterday, home secretary Ardhendu Sen had said the government would request the Election Commission to send an additional 40 companies of the central forces specifically for deployment in the districts of Purulia, West Midnapore and Bankura.

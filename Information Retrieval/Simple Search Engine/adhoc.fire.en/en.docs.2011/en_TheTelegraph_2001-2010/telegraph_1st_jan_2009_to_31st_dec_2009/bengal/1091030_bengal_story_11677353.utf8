The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | VC seeks PM help
                                                                                                               VC seeks PM help
                            
	Calcutta, Oct. 29: Visva-Bharati vice-chancellor Rajat Kanta Ray today appealed to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to initiate a probe into the charges levelled against him by the universitys staff and said the root of the trouble was his bid to weed out corruption.         
	I have sent a report to the Prime Minister (the chancellor) on the state of affairs at the university. I have requested him to start the inquiry at the earliest and take the necessary measures to restore normal academic activities, Ray told a news conference.        
	He would not buckle under pressure and quit, the VC made it clear.        
	No classes have been held in the university since last Friday. The breakdown of mutual trust at Santiniketan and cessation of work and study at Visva-Bharati are a matter of the deepest concern, governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi, the universitys rector, said in a statement today.        
	The VC denied the charges against him  diverting student welfare funds, selling copies of unpublished Tagore paintings at a throwaway price and running up Rs 10 lakh in personal medical expenses.        
	They want me to quit because I had tried to establish transparency in the universitys governance, Ray said.

	Goaltore (West Midnapore), Dec. 1: Suspected Maoists last night shot dead a schoolteacher who had been trying to unite tribals against the rebels.         
	Three villagers who were in a huddle with him were battered with iron rods.        
	Satyanarayan Hansda, 37, who was earlier with the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities, had dissociated himself from the outfit after realising that the Maoists were dictating terms.

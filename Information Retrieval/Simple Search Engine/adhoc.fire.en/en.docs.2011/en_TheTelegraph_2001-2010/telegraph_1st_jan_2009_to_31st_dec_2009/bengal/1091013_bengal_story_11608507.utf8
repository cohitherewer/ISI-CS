The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Mahato a siege tool for Maoists: Police
                                                                                                               Mahato a siege tool for Maoists: Police
          KINSUK BASU                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 12: Maoists had taken Chhatradhar Mahato to several places in Orissa, Jharkhand and Bengals Purulia to help replicate the Lalgarh model there, police sources have said.        
	After the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities succeeded in turning Lalgarh into a police-free zone for several months, the Maoists wanted to try out the experiment elsewhere, the sources said.        
	Mahato, now in custody, was taken to Latehar in Jharkhand sometime in April to hold a meeting in the Manika police station area as well as in Hehegarh, considered a Maoist stronghold.        
	In May, Mahato went to Bhubaneswar from where he was driven to a distant pocket in Kalinganagar to address a section of farmers and tribals protesting against land acquisition for industrialisation.        
	The Maoists wanted to cash in on the model of armed resistance in Lalgarh, where an independent committee of tribals and a few leaders, enjoying the patronage of both the Maoists and their frontal organisations, had been successful in thwarting police entry for over six months, said an officer.         
	 Apart from Lalgarh, few Maoist-infested places in India had been out of bounds for the police for such a long period. The (Maoist) central committee was, therefore, very upbeat about this model, the officer added.        
	Admitting that Mahato had some oratory skills, the police claimed that he told interrogators he had visited Purulia to address members of the Adivasi-Mulbasi Public Committee and help them build up resistance along the lines of Lalgarh. Abohr Hembram, one of the leaders of the committee, was present when Mahato went to address the members. Hembram was later arrested, an officer added.         
	After Purulia town, Mahato was asked to visit Balarampur in the same district for a similar assignment.         
	The underlying motive was clear  to fan out from Lalgarh to the adjoining areas and to the bordering states, one of the officers in the interrogation team said.        
	The Maoists, however, had never asked Mahato to participate in any armed struggle. They never had any plans of even imparting any training to him in guerrilla warfare. Apart from addressing the masses and meeting the media, Mahatos other job was mobilising different units at work in Lalgrah to collect money.        
	The police claim that in the past year, the Maoists had managed to collect over Rs 1 crore through extortion and this was utilised mainly to procure arms and ammunition.         
	Binpur murder        
	Suspected Maoists shot dead Jharkhand Party (Naren) supporter Kanai Murmu, 48, in West Midnapores Binpur last night. Three men called Kanai out of his house, marched him for a kilometre to the bank of a canal and shot him twice in the chest.

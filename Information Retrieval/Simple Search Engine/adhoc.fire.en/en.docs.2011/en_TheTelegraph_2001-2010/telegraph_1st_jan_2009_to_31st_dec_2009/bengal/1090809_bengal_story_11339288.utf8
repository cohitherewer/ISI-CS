The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Longer JEE list to fill seats
                                                                                                               Longer JEE list to fill seats
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 8: The state joint entrance examination board plans to extend its merit list beyond the 60,000 rank for the first time because over 2,700 seats are still vacant after the first two rounds of counselling.        
	The West Bengal Joint Entrance Examination Board will hold a third round of counselling on August 13, 14 and 16. If the seats still dont fill up, the merit list will be extended beyond 60,000.        
	Candidates placed between 1 and 60,000 on the merit list had attended the first two rounds of counselling held in July. But nearly 2,700 seats are still vacant because over 50 per cent of the students did not attend the two rounds, a board official said.        
	Those who were absent from the first two rounds will be called to the third session. But they are unlikely to turn up since most may have enrolled in other courses, like the pure sciences.        
	The list needs to be extended to ensure that seats in the private colleges do not stay vacant though such an extension would force the institutions to fill up the seats with students of lower merit.        
	We will submit a report to the state government after the third session because to extend the merit list we need to get its clearance, said Siddhartha Dutta, the board chairman.        
	Last year, the merit list had ranked 45,000 students. There were three rounds of counselling that filled up all but 100 seats. This time, even a longer merit list has not helped.        
	To study engineering, students must score at least 50 per cent each in physics, chemistry and mathematics in their higher secondary or equivalent exam, apart from securing a rank in the merit list.        
	We wonder whether the extension of the merit list will help because last years records show that more than 100 seats in various private engineering colleges could not be filled up. Many students placed between 35,000 and 45,000 on the merit list had not scored the minimum 50 per cent in physics, chemistry and mathematics, a state education official said.Fewer students want to study IT this year because of the economic downturn. Nor are there too many takers for pharmacy, food technology, computer science and engineering, or bio-medical engineering.

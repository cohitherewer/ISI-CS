          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 9: State home secretary Ardhendu Sen today said the government had no report of any Maoist links with Trinamul, striking a note different from the chief ministers.        
	Addressing a rally in West Midnapore yesterday, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had said: The Maoists are entering the villages with the help of Trinamul men. Tri- namul is showing them the way and identifying CPM workers. They are working hand in hand.        
	Asked whether the state had got any evidence of the alleged Maoist-Trinamul nexus, the home secretary said: The state government doesnt have any report of Maoist links with Trinamul or any political party.        
	Reminded that the chief minister had himself spoken of such links, Sen added: He (chief minister) might have spoken about that at a political level. But we in the government dont have any such reports.        
	Earlier, the chief minister had spoken in the Assembly about Trinamuls alleged links with the Maoists, triggering a walkout by its MLAs. He told the House: Chhatradhar Mahato (leader of the Maoist-backed Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities) calls up the Trinamul headquarters in Calcutta in the morning and flees into the jungles of Jharkhand in the evening. The Maoists and Trinamul are hand in glove.        
	Speaking at a gathering at Esplanade today, the railway minister expressed shock about the chief ministers charge and threatened a defamation case. I was shocked to hear Buddhababu saying our party has links with the Maoists. Does he have any proof of such an association? Why did he make such remarks? I am asking my party MP Kalyan Banerjee to initiate a defamation suit against the chief minister.        
	We have ideological differences with the Maoists and are not on their side, Mamata asserted.         
	CPM state secretary Biman Bose parried questions on the purportedly contradictory statements of the chief minister and the home secretary on the Trinamul-Maoist nexus.         
	Should I comment when the chief minister and the home secretary are speaking differently? he asked.         
	Bose, however, dared Mamata to go to court against the chief ministers charge. Let her file a thousand defamation cases. Her links with the Maoists are clear from her public address at the rally organised by Chhatradhar Mahato (on February 4), he said.        
	The chief minister had yesterday cited the railways failure to name in the FIR the Maoists and their supporters who held the Rajdhani Express hostage for over six hours on October 27 to buttress his allegation.

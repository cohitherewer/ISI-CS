The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Dunlop power impasse
                                                                                                               Dunlop power impasse
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 19: Dunlop opened its doors to employees at Ambattur today, but the fate of around 1,200 workers at Sahagunj continues to hang in the balance with the company claiming it had done the needful to ensure power supply to the plant.        
	The company said the supply had not been restored, though it had provided a letter of credit (LC)  a banking instrument that ensures a supplier gets paid for the service or goods it provides directly from the bank in case the buyer falters  to the state power utility.        
	Here we are still debating the clauses of (the) LC while power has been restored at Ambattur following a court order and the plant started today. I dont know when it will start in Bengal, Dunlop India chairman Pawan Ruia said today.        
	Of the 650 workers at the Ambattur unit near Chennai, 542 reported for work today. Production is expected to start within a week.        
	However, West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company chairman Malay De said Dunlop had failed to comply with regulatory norms. According to the West Bengal State Electricity Regulatory Commissions rule, a letter of credit must be confirmed, irrevocable, revolving and non recourse.        
	Dunlop has inserted a clause, which means that its LC is neither non-recourse nor revolving. We have asked them to remove it. We cant accept the LC, De explained.        
	He added that Dunlop had been told about the condition long before but the company did not make the LC of Rs 53.77 lakh accordingly.        
	The development comes soon after the state power distributor agreed to restructure Rs 12 crore worth of dues that had held up resumption of work at Sahagunj.        
	Ruia said that if the power utility could repose its trust in Dunlop for the payment of Rs 12 crore, it should not be too worried about Rs 53.77 lakh. There are no dues from the time I took over the company in late 2005. I have also agreed to pay the dues of the previous owner, he added.        
	Instead of the LC, De said, Dunlop can also pay its three months possible bill in advance or provide a bank guarantee. Ruia said he would ask for a prepaid meter instead.

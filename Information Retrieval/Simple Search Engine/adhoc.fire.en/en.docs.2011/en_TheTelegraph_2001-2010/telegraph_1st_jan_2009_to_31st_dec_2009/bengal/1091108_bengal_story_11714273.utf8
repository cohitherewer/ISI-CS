	Calcutta, Nov. 7: Two persons who apparently managed to coax personal identification numbers from bank account holders and siphon off money from ATMs have been arrested from Dalhousie.    
	Safikul Islam and Riazul Seikh, both in their forties, sometimes also promised female escorts to prospective victims to persuade them to part with the confidential numbers over phone, police said. The police said they were also investigating if casual employees of some banks were involved in the racket.

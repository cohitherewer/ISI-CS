	Lalgarh, June 18: A CPM activist and three members of an anti-Maoist resistance group abducted last night were found dead today in Goaltore.        
	The four had been buried in a field half-a-kilometre from their homes in Pingboni village, which is about 35km from Lalgarh, where police and central forces have started an operation this afternoon against the Maoists.        
	The four were identified as Badal Ahir, 55, Dubraj Soren, 53, his son Dasharath, 35, and brother Chaitanya, 40. Their throats had been slit, heads smashed and bones broken.         
	Police said Badal was a member of the CPMs Pingboni local committee, Dubraj had joined the Bharat Jakat Majhi Marwa, a tribal organisation to counter the Maoists. His son and brother were also members of the anti-Maoist outfit.         
	West Midnapore police chief Manoj Kumar Verma said Maoists were behind the murders. We have come to know that Maoists were involved in the murders and a search is on to nab the miscreants, he said.        
	The four murders came a day after three CPM activists, who were part of an anti-Maoist resistance group formed by the police, were gunned down near Jhargram, about 60km from Lalgarh.        
	The seven murders within 48 hours has the CPM top brass in West Midnapore worried.         
	This is alarming, the way Maoists are targeting us because we put up a resistance, said Dahareswar Sen, a CPM district secretariat member.         
	A police officer said villagers out to relieve themselves in the field this morning saw two mounds of earth with flies buzzing over them. When the soil was dug up, two bodies were found in each one of them. We have sent them for post-mortem, Verma said.        
	Dubrajs brother Tarun, who survived the attack, identified the bodies. Tarun said an armed gang of about two dozen Maoists  six of them were women  in military fatigues surrounded Badals house in Pingboni last night.         
	We all woke up. Badal kaku fled using the rear door of the house and hid behind nearby bushes. But the Maoists spotted him and dragged him away holding him by the neck. They then raided our house and forcibly took away my elder brother, his son and my another brother. The gang had arms with them, Tarun said.        
	An elderly village woman, who had also seen the Maoist gang take away the four said: I did not raise an alarm fearing an attack.         
	 Members of the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities, which led the Lalgarh protest, tonight raided the CPMs Dahijuri branch committee office in Binpur, 5km from Jhargram town.        
	About 700 tribals armed with bows and arrows broke all the furniture inside the one-storey office, then piled them outside and set the heap ablaze.         
	No complaint has been lodged against anyone, said a police officer.

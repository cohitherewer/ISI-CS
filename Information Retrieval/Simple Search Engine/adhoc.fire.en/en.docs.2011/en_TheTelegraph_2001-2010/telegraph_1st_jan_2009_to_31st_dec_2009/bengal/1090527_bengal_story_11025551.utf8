The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Railway boss takes charge
                                                                                                               Railway boss takes charge
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, May 26: The train to Digha will leave from Howrah instead of Shalimar for that is what people want, Mamata Banerjee announced after taking charge of the railway ministry today.        
	The Trinamul Congress leader kicked off her new innings from the Sealdah division-al railway managers office in Calcutta and not her own office in Delhi, but said in English: It does not mean I will work only for Bengal. I will work for the entire country.        
	She promised monthly tickets at Rs 20 for those in the unorganised sector earning less than Rs 500 a month and completion of the Ludhiana-Howrah freight corridor in record time to stress she was not the railway minister for Bengal only. It (the corridor) will benefit UP, Bihar, Delhi, Punjab and Bengal, she said.         
	She added special attention would be paid to Jammu and Kashmir and modernisation of stations.        
	But Bengal, she has promised, will be her focus. That is why she did not got to Delhi to take charge of Rail Bhavan after yesterdays calamity.        
	A lot of people face inconvenience travelling to Shalimar, so I have decided that the train to Digha will now leave from Howrah station, Mamata said. Today being Nazrul Islams birthday, I am naming the train Kandari Express (after the famous poem Kandari Hunshiyaar).        
	Minutes before, she garlanded a portrait of the poet.         
	There was popular resentment about the Digha train originating from the ill-connected Shalimar station, 15km from Howrah.        
	The seven days-a-week service from Howrah will start within a month.         
	At Sealdah, Mamata listened to a presentation by Railway Board chairman S.S. Khurana, flipped through files, had a chat with some of the officials and rose to address railway employees.

	Durgapur, March 13: Citu supporters allegedly slapped and pushed around Durgapur Steel Plant managers who protested the din they were creating over the recruitment of labourers.        
	Some of them were said to have been chased, caught and ordered out of their offices when they tried to flee.        
	About 200 people who work under contractors started demonstrating around 9am in protest against the Intuc unions alleged bid to have its supporters recruited.         
	Personnel manager Barit Mondal was the first to ask the agitators not to disturb those at work. Some of the protesters walked up to Mondal and allegedly slapped him.         
	Deputy general manager A.K. Nandi and assistant general manager S.R. Kar were greeted with abuses when they rushed to help Mondal. They surrounded and shoved them. Nandi fell. All three ran to their offices but the protesters chased them, dragged them out and drove them away, said an officer. Then the mob raided the offices of assistant general manager R.L. Majhi and senior manager Aveek Dastidar.        
	The management accused Citu of creating trouble. Contractor workers owing allegiance to Citu were trying to disturb work. Officers who protested were assaulted. They were forced to stay away from their offices and production was affected for over two hours, spokesperson B.R. Kanungo said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Maoist dies while making bomb
                                                                                                               Maoist dies while making bomb
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Aug. 30: A suspected Maoist died today when the improvised explosive device he was making to blow up a culvert burst in a field on the outskirts of Behrampore town.        
	Sambhu Dolui, his accomplice who had joined a Maoist action squad six months ago, was seriously injured in the blast. The dead rebel has not been identified.         
	Maoist literature was found on Sambhu, who told the police the duo had planned to blow up a culvert on National Highway 34 to disrupt traffic between Siliguri and Calcutta.         
	Sambhu told us he had joined a Maoist action squad six months ago. He doesnt know the name of the person he was working with. A Maoist leader called Rabi went to Sambhus house last night and introduced the man to him, said Murshidabad superintendent of police B.L. Meena.        
	Sambhu, who pulls a cycle van for a living, suffered splinter injuries in the right leg and face. One finger on his right hand was blown away.         
	Police sources said there had not been a Maoist strike in Murshidabad district yet. In Naoda, about 40km from Behrampore, the Maoists are active. A CPM party office was set on fire by them there two years ago, a source said.        
	Yesterday, in their stronghold of Purulia, the Maoists killed a CPM leader, accusing him of being an informer.         
	Bharat Hembram, 40, a former CPM branch committee member, was shot twice, barely an hour after the rebels killed another party leader, in Arsa, also in Purulia district.        
	The two killings yesterday were the first attacks on CPM men by the Maoists in Purulia since the joint forces began an operation against the rebels in Lalgarh in June.         
	Bharat, who is believed to have severed ties with the CPM after threats from the Maoists, was at home in Mahalitar village, about 300km from Calcutta, with sister-in-law Kajoli and her two children when 60 armed Maoists in olive green fatigues called out for him.         
	A frightened Kajoli rushed out and was held at gunpoint. They (the guerrillas) asked me to call my kids out. Bharat came out with them. Three men pushed Bharat inside the house. I heard two shots, then the men came out and left on foot towards the Ayodhya hills shouting Maobad zindabad, Kajoli said.

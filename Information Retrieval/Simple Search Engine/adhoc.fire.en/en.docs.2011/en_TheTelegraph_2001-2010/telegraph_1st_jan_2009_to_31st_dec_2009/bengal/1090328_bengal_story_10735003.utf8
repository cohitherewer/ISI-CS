The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CPM plays down Pandhe remarks
                                                                                                               CPM plays down Pandhe remarks
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, March 27: The Bengal CPM unit today did not attach much importance to politburo member M.K. Pandhes remarks on Nandigram that may have offered fresh ammunition to the Opposition in the run-up to the general election.        
	What Pandhe said matters little, state party secretary Biman Bose said.         
	While maintaining that measures for the benefit of workers and farmers in Bengal and Kerala should bring more seats to the Left, Pandhe had yesterday said: But we have committed some errors. Some mistakes.         
	He referred to the police firing in Nandigram that left 14 dead as a mistake and pointed out the chief ministers own admission of it.        
	Bengal industries minister and Pandhes fellow politburo member Nirupam Sen said: Why should we be embarrassed (by the remarks)? The matter has already been discussed in the party.        
	Central committee member Shyamal Chakraborty said: The chief minister has said he wouldnt have sent the police had he been aware that it would lead to the firing.         
	Nandigram, though, continues to haunt the CPM. Allies RSP, Forward Bloc and CPI, which had threatened to quit the government after the firing, are now opposed to any mention of Nandigram or Singur in the Lefts joint appeal.

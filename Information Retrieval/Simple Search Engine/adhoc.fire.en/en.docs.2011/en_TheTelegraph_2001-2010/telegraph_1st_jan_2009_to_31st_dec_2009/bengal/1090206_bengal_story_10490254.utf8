                                                                                                               Robbers strike same train again
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Raiganj, Feb. 5: Passengers of a Siliguri-bound train were robbed of cash and valuables between Gaishal and Aluabari stations last night, barely 24 hours after a similar incident on the same train at the same spot.        
	Around 10pm, a gang of five dacoits raided Katihar-Siliguri Passenger Train and snatched away cash and valuables worth over Rs 50,000 from the passengers. Three persons were injured in the attack.        
	Arun Gupta, a resident of Katihar who was travelling in the train, said the dacoits boarded the moving train as soon as it left Gaishal station. There were hardly 25 passengers in the compartment at that time.        
	Brandishing choppers, swords and pistols, the dacoits snatched wrist watches, gold rings, mobile phones and moneybags from us, Gupta, a trader, said.        
	Some passengers tried to resist and were beaten up. As the train slowed down near Gunjaria station, the robbers jumped off the running train and ran towards Bihar.        
	Half-an-hour later, when the train reached Aluabari station, the passengers lodged complaints with the GRP.        
	On Tuesday night, a gang of five-seven dacoits had raided the same train at the same spot and robbed passengers of valuables worth Rs 35,000.        
	Paritosh Singha Roy, the officer-in-charge of the GRP at Dalkhola, said they were worried about the incident occurring at the same place two nights in a row. I have appealed to the higher authorities to deploy additional force on this route.        
	Shankar Singha, the North Dinajpur district police chief, echoed him. The incident cannot be taken lightly. I will speak to the railway authorities and try for joint surveillance, he said.         
	The divisional railway manager of the Northeast Frontier Railway at Katihar, B. Raikwar, however, said: It is not possible to provide security to every train. However, let me see what we can do about it.

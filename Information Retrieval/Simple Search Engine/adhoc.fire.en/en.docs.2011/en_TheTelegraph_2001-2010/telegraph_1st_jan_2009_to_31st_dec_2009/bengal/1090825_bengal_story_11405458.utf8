The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Party makes tamasha tool
                                                                                                               Party makes tamasha tool
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Actress Debasree Roy at the Metro show on Saturday                                  
	Calcutta, Aug. 24: The CPM today launched a drive to expose Mamata Banerjees use of railway projects to campaign for the 2011 Assembly elections with a rally in front of Tollygunge Metro station, re-named Mahanayak Uttam Kumar by the railway minister.        
	The partys move to go hammer and tongs at Mamata came a day after chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee suggested that the railway minister had made a tamasha (fun) of Bengals icons at a Metro programme.         
	The great sons of Bengal are being insulted, Bhattacharjee had told a rally, referring to the icons after whom some stations had been named and whose pictures were used in an ad for the inaugural programme for Metros extended run from Tollygunge.         
	CPM state secretariat member Benoy Konar today said the party and its frontal organisations would visit every corner of Bengal to drive home the chief ministers message about Mamatas tamasha. We shall expose Mamata to the masses, underlining how she had opposed work on the extension of Metro near Tollys nullah in 2002, he added.        
	Basudev Acharya, the partys leader in the Lok Sabha, said he would raise in the House Mamatas design to use railway projects to serve her political interests.         
	In Delhi, politburo mem- ber Sitaram Yechury wrote to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh objecting to the use of the Trinamul Congress symbol in railway ads. Citing a half-pager that appeared today announcing free monthly tickets for students, Yechury said public funds should not be used to promote partisan interests of a political party.         
	I was aghast.... Surely you will agree that this is a brazen effort at utilising government funds for promoting the political interests of a particular party which happens to be a member of the ruling coalition under your leadership, Yechury wrote.        
	He also asked the Prime Minister to ensure that such ads were withdrawn.        
	CPM state secretary Biman Bose complained that the ad was in bad taste.         
	CPM ally RSP did not comment on the ad but found nothing wrong in renaming Metro stations after the great sons of Bengal. I feel there is no tamasha in renaming Metro stations after the great sons of Bengal, PWD minister Kshiti Goswami said.        
	That should be music to Trinamul ears. Party MP Sudip Bandopadhyay said the CPMs protests were an outburst of its frustration after successive electoral setbacks.

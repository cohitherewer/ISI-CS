The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Subhas loyalist for transport
                                                                                                               Subhas loyalist for transport
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 7: The CPM today chose Naihati MLA and Citu leader Ranjit Kundu to succeed Subhas Chakraborty as transport minister after daylong parleys to balance factional equations in its North 24-Parganas unit, to which the late leader belonged.        
	Kundu, a Chakraborty loyalist, was up against Kamarhati MLA Manas Mukherjee, a one-time Chakraborty-baiter who is close to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.        
	With the party anxious to milk Chakrabortys popularity and avoid disgruntling his camp followers, state CPM secretary Biman Bose is said to have opted for Kundu. Party sources said the chief minister wanted to make room for Mukherjee by leaving him in charge of sports and youth welfare, also held by Chakraborty, but failed.        
	A party statement issued in the evening did not mention Kundus portfolios, citing only a recommendation to include him in the government.         
	CPM sources said Kundu would take charge of transport while sports and youth welfare would go to Sunderbans affairs minister Kanti Ganguly, a leader from South 24-Parganas who too was known to be close to Chakraborty.        
	Party insiders admitted that the vaguely worded announcement reflected the difficulties the government and the party leadership faced in picking Chakrabortys successor.         
	Although the CPM state secretariat had decided the inclusion of Kundu in the morning, the one-line announcement had to wait till late evening despite daylong talks between the partys state and North 24-Parganas leaders.        
	The sources said Bhattacharjee had wanted to take charge of transport himself with the help of a junior from within the current ministry. But North 24-Parganas leaders and the powerful Citu lobby mounted pressure for a new face.         
	The sources said Kundu won because of his relatively low profile and the patronage he received from Citu state president and state secretariat member Shyamal Chakraborty as well as former MPs from the district such as Tarit Topdar, Amitava Nandi and party district chief Amitabha Basu.         
	Mukherjee, once close to Nandi when both belonged to the anti-Chakraborty camp, later fell out with Nandi, who then mended his relations with Chakraborty.         
	Mukherjee had sided with the chief minister during his proxy war with Chakraborty over the Cricket Association of Bengal election.        
	 Party leaders close to Kundu, who is 60-plus, stressed his seniority as an MLA and his role in the trade union movement. The supporters of Mukherjee, in his mid-50s, rued that his chances were scuttled by rivals despite the leaderships call to promote the younger generation.

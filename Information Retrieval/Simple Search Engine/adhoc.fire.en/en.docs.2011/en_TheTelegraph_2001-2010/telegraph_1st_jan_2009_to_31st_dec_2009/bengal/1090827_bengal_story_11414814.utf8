	Indrani (Murshidabad), Aug. 26: Dilruba Bibi is a sought-after woman in her village in Murshidabad.        
	An illiterate housewife till a year and a half ago, she has now taught four other women how to read and write.        
	The woman who never went to school learnt to scribble her name and spell some basic words from her son Shubho last year. Educating parents was part of a work education project in his school.        
	Over 500 parents, like Shubhos father Ruhul, 45, had got the same lessons, but most never cared to follow it up. In a few months, they forgot what their names looked like on paper.        
	Not Dilruba. She kept pestering Class IX student Shubho for more.         
	Now she reads his Bengali textbooks, and newspapers. She has learnt the letters of the English alphabet and can write them too. With a little difficulty, she can even write in English her name and that of her village, Indrani, around 250km from Calcutta.        
	Her interest in studies made her approach other women in the neighbourhood. Wouldnt you want to read and write like me? she asked.        
	Hasina Bibi, a labourers wife, was the first to respond to her call. Halima, Samsunnahar and Khadija followed. I started a coaching class of sorts at home early this year, said Dilruba.         
	The woman has an amazing knack for studies. It is a pity that she never went to school, said her son. If she did, she would have done well. My mother sits with me every evening when I study and picks up her lessons fast. She is studying my geography book now and whenever she fails to grasp something, she asks me.        
	Dilruba finishes her chores by 11am and starts taking her class. I have to finish my cooking early so I can sit with them. My husband is away in the field, my son is in school then and it is the best time for me, said Dilruba.        
	She uses the same Bangla primer  Varna Parichay  that her son had used to tutor her. It has been the first book for millions of Bengalis since Ishwarchandra Vidyasagar wrote it in 1855.        
	At Indrani, where most of the 1,500-odd families earn their living from farming or menial labour and the majority of those above 30 have never attended school, Dilruba is regarded with respect.        
	Hasina, 30, and her mates call her bubu (elder sister). It is thrilling to go to the class, she said. I can read simple sentences. I want to learn more.         
	More women have expressed their wish to join the class. Tunu Bibi, 40, would like to be there with the Hasinas. They seem so much smarter now, she said.        
	Dilruba doesnt charge a paisa for her effort.         
	She thanked her sons school, Indrani Hasna Mayanee High School, for what I am today. Had the school not given the project to students, I would have remained illiterate. When my son started teaching me the alphabet, a new horizon opened up in front of me. I want to learn more and read my sons books, she said.        
	Hearing her, a question popped up. Who is the better teacher? Dilruba or her son?         
	Headmaster Krishnendu Banerjee said: The mother embodies the success of our project. Well ask students to do the same project next year.

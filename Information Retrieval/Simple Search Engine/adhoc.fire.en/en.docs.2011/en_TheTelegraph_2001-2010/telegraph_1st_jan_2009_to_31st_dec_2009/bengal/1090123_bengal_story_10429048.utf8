The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CM works on peasants to minimise land effect 
                                                                                                               CM works on peasants to minimise land effect 
          OUR BUREAU                           Bhattacharjee                                  
	Jan. 22: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Nirupam Sen today defended their drive for industrialisation before a gathering of CPM peasant supporters at a time the Opposition was readying to make land acquisition the key poll issue.        
	Addressing the inaugural rally of the state conference of the partys peasant wing, the Krishak Sabha in Burdwan, both leaders insisted that the drive for industry was neither at the expense of farmers or agriculture, nor was it inconsistent with the partys legacy of peasant movements and land reforms.         
	There is an effort to dislodge the Left Front government by inciting the farmers against us since our strength comes from them. Can you name one village where they (Opposition) have ever stood by farmers, bargadars or agri-labourers? Now they are shedding crocodile tears for farmers, Sen told the rally at his hometown.        
	The chief minister and the industry minister said the Krishak Sabha session would discuss how to deal with the land issue during the election campaign, reflecting the concern within the party over erosion in its rural base after Nandigram. We have to chalk out our course of action in the conference, Bhattacharjee said.         
	The chief minister said his governments drive for industry was meant to help the new, educated generation from farmer families. Land, getting increasingly fragmented, would not be able to sustain the surplus rural population, he added.        
	However, farming and rural development would not be ignored, he assured the audience.        
	Bhattacharjee and Sen slammed the Opposition for inciting people against development projects.        
	What should I tell the investors, not to come to Bengal? Just because the Opposition here does not understand anything beyond potato cultivation? Should I tell the educated youth that we could not do anything for them because of our quarrel with the Trinamul? Bhattacharjee said.        
	Reacting to the ethnic tension in the Dooars and Darjeeling, the chief minister said he would not allow Bengal to turn into Assam where people live in fear following such clashes.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 5: Police have arrested five persons said to be involved in a five-day-long antique theft in one of the citys oldest homes  the 123-year-old house of the Law family in north Calcutta.        
	An overnight raid led the police to seize 28 of the stolen articles  paintings, sculptures of brass and bronze, Chinese vases and three robes. The articles were found in the home of Shamim Haoladar alias Hassan in Betberia, South 24-Parganas.         
	According to the sleuths, Hassan was the kingpin and his arrest and interrogation led to four other arrests today.         
	Hassan confessed to the police that seven days before they started stealing the antiques, they climbed up a drain pipe to the Law bari rooftop in Bidhan Sarani.         
	The police had earlier said the thieves had removed a tile to enter a room where the antiques were kept. No one noticed them because room is hardly opened, said an officer.        
	The gang used a narrow lane at the rear of the house. For five days, they took out articles from the room and transported these to Hassans house in taxis, Damayanti Sen, deputy commissioner, detective department, said today.        
	The theft came to light on December 1 when guards outside the house noticed some moving shadows on the roof in the wee hours.        
	The five had already contacted a few antique dealers in and around the city, the police said. We have recovered 28 stolen articles from them. We are yet to ascertain whether they have already sold some of them, said Sen.        
	The antiques were collected by Bhabani Churn Law, an artist and the grandfather of Lakshmi Law, who stays in a portion of the estate.         
	An officer said: Hassan was arrested in 2006 for stealing antiques. We first tracked him down and quizzing him. He broke down and confessed he committed the theft.

                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Girl on job hunt loses jewellery 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 28: A girl who was supposedly selected for a job in a car showroom on the citys fringes was allegedly robbed of gold jewellery worth Rs 2.5 lakh when she went to collect her offer letter from a hotel yesterday.        
	Twenty-one-year-old Riya De lodged a case with Baguiati police station today.        
	Riya, resident of Liluah in Howrah, told the police that about a fortnight ago, she had applied for the job of an office assistant in a car showroom in Kestopur after reading an advertisement in a newspaper.        
	She said she received a phone call two days ago from a man who identified himself as Anand Sharma.        
	He told her she had been short-listed for the job and asked her to come to a hotel near Joramandir, off Baguiati, with her CV and collect her offer letter, a police officer said.        
	Oddly, Sharma also told her to bring her jewellery as there was to be a party for fresh recruits like her.         
	Riya went to the hotel, gold jewellery stashed in her bag, and was taken to Room 308. The room had been booked by a woman, Riya told the police.         
	Sharma told her to do her make-up and get ready for the party. Riya, who found nobody else in the hotel, went to the toilet for a few minutes, leaving her bag in the room.         
	The officer said: Sharma took her to a restaurant, about a kilometre from the hotel and ordered some snacks. Riya insisted on seeing her offer letter. At this juncture, Sharma left the restaurant while talking to someone over his cellphone.        
	After waiting for half an hour, Riya tried to call Sharma but his mobile was switched off. She then opened her bag to pay the bill and realised her gold ornaments were gone.        
	Riya, whose father deals in the sale of second-hand cars, went back home on Friday night and told her family.         
	The police said they had obtained a picture of Sharma from the surveillance camera in the hotel.        
	The girl is a commerce graduate from a Howrah college and has done a diploma in computer applications.

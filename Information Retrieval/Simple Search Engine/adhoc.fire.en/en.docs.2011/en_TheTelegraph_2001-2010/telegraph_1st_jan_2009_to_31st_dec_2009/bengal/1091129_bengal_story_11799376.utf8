                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Maoists kill close to camp
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Midnapore, Nov. 28: Maoists have shot dead three persons in West Midnapore since last night, killing one of the victims close to a security camp to thumb their nose at the troops vigil in Lalgarh and its neighbourhood.        
	In Jhargram, the Maoists dragged Karuna Sindhu Mahato, the CPM pradhan of Salboni gram panchayat, from his home at Jitusole village and shot him dead.        
	They had never targeted a pradhan before in this district. Earlier, they had killed the pradhan of Sonachura panchayat, Nishikanta Mandal, in Nandigram (East Midnapore), a police officer said.        
	Manoj Verma, the West Midnapore superintendent of police, said: Mahatos bullet-riddled body was found today on a state highway connecting Jhargram to Mumbai Road.        
	Another victim was timber merchant Bomkesh Giri. He was found on the metalled road in front of the Koima police camp late last night. The Maoists shot him dead on the road, a few metres from the police camp and about 2km from Bhimpur High School where joint forces have been staying since June, an officer said.        
	According to the police, 62-year-old Giri, his two managers and six labourers had gone to the Kalaimuri jungles to buy logs from the forest department.        
	After loading the logs on his vehicle, Giri was returning to his godown in Lalgarh bazar. On the way, a group of Maoists intercepted them and beat up the managers and labourers. The attackers allowed them to go, but not Giri, said a Lalgarh police officer.        
	The Maoists took Giri through a jungle path to the metalled road in front of the Koima camp. It seems the decision to kill Giri near the camp was meant to prove their strength in Lalgarh, the officer said.        
	This morning, the Maoists shot dead Brajokishore Mahato, member of the CPMs Salboni branch committee. Mahato was abducted last night when he was returning home from a party meeting.

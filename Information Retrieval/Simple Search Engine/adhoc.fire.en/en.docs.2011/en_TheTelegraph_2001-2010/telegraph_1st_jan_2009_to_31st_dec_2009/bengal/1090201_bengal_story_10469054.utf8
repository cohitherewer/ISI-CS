	Chinsurah, Jan. 31: The 22-year-old son of a Mumbai jeweller from Hooghly was rescued last night after police set a trap and arrested two of his abductors near Calcutta airport.        
	Police found Sheikh Suleman in a village in Nadias Dhubulia, hours after Souvik Ghosh and his driver Bapi Ghosh were held trying to take ransom from his father Sultan. Sultan, who had helped the police set the trap, had brought Rs 4.8 lakh and 300 grams of gold for the kidnappers.        
	Suleman had been kidnapped on January 22 by Sukumar Biswas, who was known to his father.         
	Hooghly superintendent of police Rajeev Mishra said Biswas was absconding.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Politics hurting guerrilla hunt: PC
                                                                                                               Politics hurting guerrilla hunt: PC
          OUR BUREAU                          Chidambaram                                   
	Sept. 6: Union home minister P. Chidambaram has said political factors are affecting the crackdown on Maoists in Bengal.        
	I think there are political factors in the West Bengal go-vernment which are affecting the command and control of the operation, he told television network NDTV.        
	There are a number of factors. The way state police are organised, the way state police are deployed.        
	Asked why the Centre was not conducting the anti-Maoist operations in Bengal, Chi-dambaram said: I cannot, unless the state government says we cannot do it, you do it.        
	The states ruling Left is divided on a crackdown on its militant cousin in Lalgarh.         
	They (Maoists) are not our class enemies, the CPMs allies had said before the crackdown began. The party, too, had appeared split after chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee declared his intent to enforce the Centres ban on the CPI (Maoist).        
	The state police are now engaged in a joint operation against the guerrillas with central paramilitary, but officers on the ground admitted having to work under constraints.        
	It is the states job to chalk out a specific strategy to flush out the Maoists and execute it with the help of the central forces. But we dont have any such plan, an officer said.         
	He suggested the government was reluctant to take a hard decision following Nandigram. Fourteen villagers were killed in the police action there in 2007 and the Left has had to pay a political price for it.         
	In Lalgarh, villagers are providing all sorts of support to the Maoists and some of them have been trained to handle guns by the guerrillas. During an operation, if the villagers stand as a shield, how can we guarantee they wont be hurt, the officer added.        
	State home secretary Ardhendu Sen was not available for comment today, but he has already admitted that operation Lalgarh has been only partially successful. The administration has regained control of the area but the rebels have been killing people at will outside the polices area of domination.         
	However, a section of the Left still feels the Maoists should be dealt with politically and not by force.        
	Chidambaram said talks could be held only if they abjured violence. No government in India could accept armed liberation struggle.... So we have said if you abjure violence, give up armed liberation struggle, we are willing to talk to you... about your grievances, structures of local administration, development, money, corruption... any issue.         
	Maoists kill four        
	Maoists have killed four people around Lalgarh since last night. Timber merchant Apu Singh and contractor Rajib Singh were dragged away from their homes this evening and shot in the Kotwali area of Midnapore. Last night, a CPM leader was killed in Belpahari and a supporter in Salboni.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Pat from CPM amp; stale punch
                                                                                                               Pat from CPM amp; stale punch
          BISWAJIT ROY                              
	Calcutta, July 3: The CPM today grudgingly patted positive measures in Mamata Banerjees rail budget but rapped her for lacking fresh ideas to tackle falling revenues in times of recession.        
	The politburo welcomed her move not to hike passenger fares and to introduce the Rs 25 monthly ticket for people earning up to Rs 1,500 a month. At the same time, it demanded reversal of moves towards privatisation and outsourcing that purportedly got a major thrust in the budget.        
	It also appreciated Mamatas promise to provide more rail jobs to women, minorities, SC/STs and the physically challenged, though it was clear the move was aimed at further denting the Left Fronts support base among the Muslims and SC/STs in Bengal.        
	The politburo, however, felt the positive measures were overshadowed by Mamatas lack of innovation in tackling falling revenues.        
	Mamata has failed to come up with any fresh ideas and turn around the declining revenue situation the statement said.         
	The railway ministers reliance on several PPP (public-private partnership) projects, from development of 50 world class stations, new freight and coach terminals, logistics parks, special purpose rolling stocks, perishable cargo centres etc seems completely misplaced at a time of economic recession when private investment is hardly forthcoming.        
	In Delhi, CPM leader Basudev Acharya minced no words when he said some of Mamatas measures had been taken with an eye on the 2011 Bengal elections. New trains, most of them for Bengal, have been announced keeping the (2011) elections in mind....        
	Prodded if the budget was the Trinamul Congress manifesto for the Bengal poll, he said: Yes, it is almost that.        
	In Calcutta, Bengal CPM secretary Biman Bose admitted the populist edge but added: She has remained silent on 124 pending projects and did not speak on filling vacant posts. She spoke of taking over (sick press) Basumati. What about the underused railway printing establishments?        
	He parried questions on the projects proposed for Bengal. I have not gone through the details. I have a flight to catch, he said.

                                                                                                               Saucers waterlogged
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, May 29: The government today said the post-cyclone situation in south Bengal was improving but some areas were still inundated.        
	Water that had entered villages in Patashpur and Bhagabanpur in East Midnapore still remains as the places are like saucers, finance minister Asim Dasgupta said after a meeting called by the chief minister to review the situation.        
	District officials said water had also not receded from South 24-Parganas Gosaba, Basanti, Joynagar, Kultali and Canning for the same reason.        
	The toll in the cyclone and the floods that followed has gone up to 117. Over 50 lakh people have been affected in the two 24-Parganas, East Midnapore, Howrah and Hooghly.        
	With competition among political parties over post-calamity compassion, the chief minister will visit Gosaba on Sunday.

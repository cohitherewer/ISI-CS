          OUR BUREAU                              
	July 27: A shopkeeper in the prime of his youth died of heart attack in Burdwan after a bandh enforcer held a sword to his throat for refusing to shut his shop.        
	Supporters of the Jharkhand Disham Party were trying to enforce a 12-hour statewide bandh that threw road and rail traffic out of gear in Burdwan and Hooghly, which has tribal pockets that support the outfit. The bandh was called to protest alleged police torture in Lalgarh and press for various demands.        
	Around 9.30am, members of the party, armed with swords, spear and bows and arrows, tried to force 21-year-old Arghya Samanta to close his hardware shop in Burdwans Raina market. When he resisted, a tribal held a sword to his throat.         
	Arghyas uncle Sabyasachi Samanta said: I was passing by when I saw the bandh supporters going around the market area. They were asking shopkeepers to shut their shops. Arghya tried to protest and one of them drew the sword pointing it at his throat. Arghya panicked and collapsed. Seeing him fall, the mob fled.         
	Other shopkeepers rushed Arghya to Burdwan Medical College and Hospital. He was declared dead. The cause stated was heart attack. Thirty-four supporters of the party have been detained for interrogation.        
	Bandh supporters blocked the Durgapur Expressway from 8am to 11.30am, halting hundreds of vehicles.        
	Six MA Part II examinees who had hired a car to go to Burdwan University from their homes in Chandernagore were caught in the blockade.        
	 We requested the bandh supporters with folded hands but they would not listen, said Mousumi Mukherjee. The university called an emergency meeting and deferred the exams by an hour.        
	Among others stuck was former Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee who was on his way to Bolpur.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Ragging stick after helpline complaints
                                                                                                               Ragging stick after helpline complaints
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Durgapur, Sept. 4: The National Institute of Technology, Durgapur, today suspended 20 students for ragging in the first instance in Bengal of action on the basis of complaints being lodged over a helpline set up recently by the Centre to curb the menace.         
	The suspended students, whose identities the college refused to disclose, were told to vacate their hostel within 24 hours.         
	Our colleges anti-ragging committee conducted a probe and found them guilty. They will again attend classes after October 30, said A.K. Mitra, the NITs dean of administration.         
	Never before in Bengal have so many students been suspended at one go on charges of harassing juniors.         
	An official of the institute said the students would have to appear in the semester exams in November without attending classes.        
	Eighteen of the 20 punished are from the second year and two from the third. Sources said they were civil, mechanical, computer and electronics engineering students hailing from Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Delhi and Bengal.         
	The institute refused to identify the victims or elaborate on the complaints.         
	The sources said five first-year students had been stripped and forced to dance in the buff. They were made to stay in the seniors hostel rooms all night and slapped when they failed to perform.         
	The toll-free helpline  1800-180-5522  and email complaint forum  helplineantiragging.net  which were launched together on June 20 have registered over 200 complaints, sources in the Union human resource development ministry said.         
	Some among these complaints turned out to be prank calls, but inquiries have been launched in all the remaining cases, the sources claimed. Last month, Jawaharlal Nehru University rusticated nine students for two years and expelled 10 others from their hostel.         
	The anti-ragging rules laid down by the Supreme Court allow authorities to pick from a range of penalties they can impose on students  from discontinuing scholarships to filing a criminal complaint. The penalty is to be decided by the colleges anti-ragging authorities.         
	After receiving the comp-laints from Durgapur, the HRD ministry had asked the NIT to submit a an action-taken report.         
	The dean said: Well lodge a police complaint against the guilty if the victims are not satisfied with the action we have taken. If we get a fresh complaint from the victims, well lodge the FIR.

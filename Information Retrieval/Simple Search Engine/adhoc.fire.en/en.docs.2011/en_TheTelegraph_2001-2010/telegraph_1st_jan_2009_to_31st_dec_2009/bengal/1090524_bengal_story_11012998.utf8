The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Delhi skips Bengal heat
                                                                                                               Delhi skips Bengal heat
  - CPM state committee to do poll post-mortem today        OUR BUREAU                                    
	Calcutta, May 23: CPM general secretary Prakash Karat avoided coming to Calcutta and chose to go to Kerala instead apparently to avoid the embarrassment of facing Bengal party leaders at the state committee meeting tomorrow.        
	Karat had attended several meetings of the committee, including the one immediately after the panchayat elections last year in which, too, the party had fared badly.        
	It was expected that Delhi would send another senior politburo member, possibly Sitaram Yechury, to the meeting. But sensing that it would send out a wrong signal, Alimuddin Street requested the central leadership not to send anyone from Delhi.        
	It had earlier been indica-ted that Karat would come to the meeting to get to know first-hand the state units views on the poor poll showing.        
	One interpretation of the decision not to send a senior leader from Delhi is that the presence of the Delhi leader at the meeting may become a red rag to the Bengal leadership.         
	Differences between the leaders in Bengal and Delhi came out in the open immediately after the election results were announced. Several Bengal leaders, including some of the defeated candidates, publicly criticised the central leadership, Prakash Karat in particular, over the partys withdrawal of support to the UPA government and the idea of a third front. These leaders felt these two factors played a big role in the partys defeat both in Bengal and Kerala.        
	Sources in Alimuddin Street, however, said there was never any question of a Delhi leader attending the state committee meeting this time. It does not usually happen in Bengal, a state committee member said. Sometimes, the general secretary may choose to attend such a meeting but there was no proposal this time.        
	Two politburo members from Delhi  Brinda Karat and M.K. Pandhe  were in Calcutta yesterday for the wedding of late politburo member Chittabrata Mazumders daughter. But both have left the city.         
	State party secretary Biman Bose, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and industries minister Nirupam Sen  all politburo members  will attend the meeting called to identify the reasons behind the CPMs rout.        
	Issues that we wanted to believe did not exist are now staring at us, like the aggrieved Muslim minority and land acquisition, said Abdur Rezzak Mollah, senior minister and a member of the committee.        
	It has over 80 members, including representatives from the partys district units. The meeting will analyse the district-wise results, the huge vote swings away from the CPM and their impact on the coming elections.        
	The pre-poll seat projections by the district units, which went way off the mark, will also be taken up. They either lied or had no idea about the vo-ters deep disenchantment with us, a leader said.         
	A meeting of the partys Calcutta district committee today held a daylong preliminary post-mortem of the debacle. It found that misgivings among Muslims and the middle class marred the CPMs poll prospects in the city.         
	The Opposition candidates got leads in all the Assembly segments, whether middle-class or Muslim-dominated.         
	The city unit blamed Kar-ats anti-Congressism and misplaced zeal to stitch up a third front for the Muslims rejection of the Left. To them, the Opposition offered a better bulwark against the BJP, a CPM minority leader said.

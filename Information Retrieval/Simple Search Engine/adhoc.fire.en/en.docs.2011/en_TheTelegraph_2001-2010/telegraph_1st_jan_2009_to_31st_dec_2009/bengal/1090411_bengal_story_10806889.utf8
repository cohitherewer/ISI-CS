	Santiniketan, April 10: Prime farmland should be kept for farming, agriculture scientist M.S. Swaminathan who is often called the father of the Green Revolution, said today.        
	Swaminathan, who is advising the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government on drawing up an agriculture policy, said all states and the Centre should have their own land-use policy. A land-use policy should be developed by the nation as well as the states. Prime farmland should be kept for farming, Swaminathan said in reply to questions on whether the state government had taken the right step in trying to set up industry on multi-crop land. He did not say what he meant by prime farmland, though.         
	Land is precious and there should be proper planning to utilise it in various sectors, including housing and agriculture, ensuring its optimum use, he said.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, June 18: A Maoist landmine killed eight policemen from an elite unit and their driver in Orissa this morning at a time security forces in Bengal are cautiously advancing on a Naxalite-held zone in West Midnapore.        
	Orissa authorities acknowledged that the blast in Koraput district displayed the rebels ability to strike at will against police vehicles, and said search parties would now travel on foot.        
	One company of security forces has left for the site (Palur, 440km from Bhubaneswar) on foot. We arent using any vehicles to avoid more landmine blasts, said Koraput police chief Deepak Kumar.        
	The state director-general of police, M.M. Praharaj, said: Nine personnel are missing. The bodies of eight have been recovered so far.        
	He added that the dead included eight personnel from the Orissa Special Striking Force (OSSF) and their driver.        
	The team was returning from night patrol at the volatile Narayanpatna block when, sometime between 8.30am and 9am, a landmine planted under a culvert threw their jeep 50 feet above the ground, eyewitnesses said. Four more explosions were heard in the area at small intervals.        
	Television images showed burnt and mutilated bodies scattered across the blast site and the jeep burnt to ashes.        
	Security forces reached the blast site in the evening and began searching the area. Only the driver, Sukant Sahoo, has been identified so far.

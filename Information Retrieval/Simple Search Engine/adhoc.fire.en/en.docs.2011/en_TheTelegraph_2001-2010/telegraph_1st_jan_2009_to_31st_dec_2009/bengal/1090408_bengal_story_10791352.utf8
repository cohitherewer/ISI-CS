                                                                                                               Maoists run from villagers arrows     -  Vigil party nabs two attackers
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                      Suri residents called police on Tuesday morning after noticing a bundle wrapped in red cloth lying near the gate of Vidyasagar College. Across the gate was a CPI (Maoist) banner telling people to boycott the polls. The suspicion: the red bundle was a bomb.    The police came, but instead of waiting for a bomb squad they started poking the bundle with bamboo sticks. We were scared to see how the policemen were working. It could have been a bomb, said Mridul Thicker, a resident.    If the police were careless, one youth was too eager. After throwing stones at it, he picked up the red bundle and took out a container filled with sand (picture above).    Asked why a bomb squad was not called, Birbhum SP LN Meena said: In this case it was not required. We would have called one if it were something serious.

	Midnapore, April 7: Suspected Maoists out to gun down a CPM leader last night had to scoot when villagers with bows and arrows gave them chase in their stronghold of West Midnapore.        
	The villagers caught two of the six attackers of CPM local committee secretary Chandi Karan and handed them over to police.        
	The other four  the police claim all were Maoist action squad members  jumped into the Kangshabati river, firing intermittently at the 30-odd villagers who shot arrows at them.        
	The guerrillas targeted Karan a little past mid- night while he was climbing the stairs of his two-storey house in Lachhipur, about 200km from Calcutta, after dinner.        
	The shot missed him and hit a wall. Karan, who narrowly survived a landmine attack on March 13, ducked.        
	Crouched on the stairs he yelled for his bodyguards  three armed police constables have been posted outside his house after the previous attack in March.         
	Hearing the shot I sat down on the stairs. I called my guards and shouted for help. The guards started firing in the direction from which the shot was heard, Karan said.         
	Some villagers patrolling the area  a vigilante group also heard the shot. About 30 of them gathered outside Karans house.        
	The shot came from a bamboo grove behind a huge haystack. The security guards took cover behind the stack and started firing. The guerrillas returned the fire, said Karan. The villagers started shooting arrows towards the bamboo grove.        
	Sensing stiff resistance, four of the attackers ran towards the Kangshabati.        
	We saw four of them, in trousers and shirts, running away. When we shot arrows, they ran zigzag and jumped to avoid getting hit. On the bank of the Kangshabati, they stopped, turned and fired at us again. When we took cover behind the trees, they jumped into the river, said one among the villagers who gave them chase.        
	The water level was knee-deep in the river. The four kept turning back and firing towards the bank as they waded in. After making it to the opposite side, they disappeared into the jungles, the villagers said.        
	While the four attackers were being chased, another group of villagers had ringed Karans house to guard it.         
	Suddenly, another shot rang out about 100m from the house. The villagers ran towards the spot and saw two men emerge from behind the bushes and start to run. They chased the duo and caught them.        
	West Midnapore superintendent of police (SP) Manoj Verma identified them as Haradhan Duley, 45, and Anil Duley. Both are Maoist action squad members and we found a revolver on one of them, Verma said.        
	A police officer said Haradhan had cases of murder and robbery against his name. Haradhan was involved in the murder of CPM leader Nandalal Pal in Lalgarhs Murar village in February, the officer said.        
	In another incident last night, suspected Maoists burnt a truck belonging to a local CPM leader in Salboni. The SP said a police team had been sent to investigate.

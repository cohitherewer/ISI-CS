                                                                                                               Karat plays to gallery
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Prakash Karat at the Gujarati Samaj. (Bishwarup Dutta)                                   
	Calcutta, May 9: Prakash Karat can be a Roman when in Rome.        
	Speaking at Shree Calcutta Gujarat Samaj in Lansdowne, the CPM general secretary stressed the partys business-friendly credentials.        
	We are not anti-business as we are being accused of being. There has been a misinformation campaign regarding the role of the Left parties in the last five years. But our economic policies are different, they are based on self-reliant development, he told a gathering of mostly Gujarati businessmen.         
	We are not opposed to foreign direct investment in principle but object to unrestrained FDI entry in all sectors because this will endanger the jobs of lakhs of people, he added, trying to explain the Lefts opposition to the entry of foreign capital in retail. Keeping in mind the apprehensions of his audience, Karat said that a Mumbai business cham- ber had first alerted him about the dangers of FDI in retail.         
	Karat also played swadeshi, taking pride in the Lefts opposition to the Manmohan Singh governments moves to make more room for foreign funds in the financial sector.         
	He addressed a string of rallies in Calcutta South, where the CPMs Rabin Deb is pitted against Mamata Banerjee.         
	When the audience was different, his focus was the eff- orts to form a non-Congress, non-BJP government and the impossibility of a bipolar polity. Its not an easy task because they (the regional parties) have their different interests. There are good and bad regional parties, he said.

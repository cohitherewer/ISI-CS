The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Distress, from distance
                                                                                                               Distress, from distance
          IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                               
	Gosaba, June 7: A central team on a recce of the Sunderbans to assess the damage wreaked by the cyclone was made to sail for eight hours but not taken to most of the worst-hit areas.         
	By the end of the day, the team had been to only two of the 13 villages in its original plan.        
	We had requested the district administration to take us to the worst affected areas. It was up to them to take us to those parts, said home ministry joint secretary Asoke Lavasa, who led the group of five. They made brief halts at Lahiripur and Rangabelia in Gosaba block but left out places like Kumirmari, Chhotomullakhali, Satjelia and Amtali.         
	A senior block official told The Telegraph it would have been easier for the state to justify its claim of Rs 1,000-crore aid from Delhi had the team been taken to places like Kumirmari.        
	South 24-Parganas district magistrate Khalil Ahmed declined comment on why so many areas were skirted. We had drawn up the tour plan keeping in mind the spring tide and time factor, he said.         
	Lavasa suggested the team, whose report would help Delhi decide the quantum of aid, would look at the full picture. Two other teams are also here and well make a collective assessment, said Lavasa, referring to the North 24-Parganas and Darjeeling delegations.        
	A source in the Gosaba block office said the 13-village itinerary had been drawn up last evening. But little of the plan seemed to have been followed. The officials left Gosaba ghat around 11.30am and anchored at the scheduled first stop, Lahiripur. There, a barrage of complaints greeted them  jol nei, khabar nei, oshudh nei (no water, no food, no medicines)  leaving the district officials red-faced.         
	Why cant they get drinking water? Lavasa asked a local official. The official pleaded helplessness, saying tube wells werent working, pipes had been swept away and ponds were flooded with seawater.        
	Kolkatar lokjon eshe amader khabar dite pare, kintu block office dite pare na, (People from Calcutta can come and distribute food but our block office cant), said a woman.        
	Lavasa and the others were dissuaded when they tried to go deeper into Lahiripur. Sir, there are other places to go to, said Bhishmadeb Dasgupta, an assistant district magistrate.         
	After that, the next halt was round 6.30pm. At Rangabelia, too, they were swamped by complaints similar to those in Lahiripur.         
	Maybe the administration had more to hide than to show, said a block official.

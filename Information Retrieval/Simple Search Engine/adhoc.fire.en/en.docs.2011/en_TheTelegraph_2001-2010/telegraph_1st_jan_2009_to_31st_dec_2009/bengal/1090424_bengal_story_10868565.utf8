          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Villagers arrange logs for Gopinath Murmus funeral. Telegraph picture                                        
	Dubrajpur (Lalgarh), April 23: Suspected Maoists have beaten to death a CPM supporter and grievously wounded seven others in Lalgarh in attacks apparently aimed at breaking into the last remaining strongholds of the party in the besieged belt.        
	Dubrajpur and Shaluka  where the incidents occurred  as well as 10 other villages of CPM supporters have an average population of around 5,000 each. None of the villages has a single member of the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities, which is leading the tribal movement in Lalgarh.         
	Around 7.30pm yesterday, around 25 armed men came to 49-year-old Gopinath Murmus house in Dubrajpur village, about 180km from Calcutta.         
	Eyewitnesses said the Maoists told Gopinath, crippled by gout, to come out. When the CPM supporter hobbled out, they pounced on him and beat him with bamboo sticks in front of his wife and brother.         
	While beating my husband, they kept shouting that he was being beaten for not supporting the tribal committee and for staying with the CPM, said Gopinaths wife Chuni. They kept repeating that he will have to pay the price for not becoming a member of the committee.        
	When Gopinath slumped to the ground, the men left for the nearby forest. But before leaving they warned that those who support the CPM will meet the same fate, said Panchanan Mandi, Gopinaths next-door neighbour.        
	Chuni said: The goons went on thrashing my husband for over an hour. They left only when he slumped to the ground, blood oozing from his wounds. When my brother-in-law and I rushed to protect him, they aimed guns at us.        
	Gobinda said the Maoists did not listen to his brothers pleas that he was not an active CPM member anymore. They warned that we should not get in touch with police as they are not allowed to enter the villages. They also told us to cremate my brother in the village and not take him to a hospital for post-mortem.        
	Gopinath died in the courtyard of his house.        
	Hours before flogging Gopinath to death, the same gang allegedly broke the limbs of seven CPM supporters in Shaluka, about half a kilometre from Dubrajpur and a hamlet of CPM families. The Maoists called their victims to a kangaroo court, then took them to a nearby forest and beat them with bamboo sticks and iron rods till their limbs broke.        
	Anuj Pande, the CPM Salboni zonal committee secretary, said the Maoists, in collaboration with members of Chhatradhar Mahatos tribal committee, were involved in both the cases. Mahato is sending his men to a dozen villages in Lalgarh and Salboni to check if people have become members of his committee. He (Mahato) is after those who are still unwilling to enrol with the committee, he said.        
	Mahato, in Calcutta today, denied the allegation.                
	Suspected Maoists shot dead two CPM leaders in a Purulia village tonight. Baikuntha Mahato, a CPM zonal committee member, and Bibhuti Singh Sardar, the Darda local committee secretary, were in a fair when three bike-borne persons shot them dead.

                                                                                                               Son kills, buries mom
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Durgapur, Feb. 22: An elderly government clerk and his wife allegedly killed his 82-year-old mother and buried her body in his quarters courtyard in Burdwans Jamalpur.         
	Police exhumed Shantilata Devis body this afternoon after neighbours called to say she had been missing for a few days and they smelt a rat.        
	Madanmohan Nag, 59, head clerk at the irrigation office in Memari, and his wife Maniprabha, 50, have been arrested and charged with murder.        
	The couple claimed Shantilata had committed suicide and they buried the body fearing police harassment. Their son Amar, 29, a casual employee at the Memari block office, was missing from home today.        
	The old woman was possibly throttled to death. We also found some burn injuries on her body, which was wrapped in a polythene sheet and stuffed in a gunny bag, said Humayun Kabir, Burdwan additional superintendent of police.         
	Shantilata had raised her only son single-handed after her husband abandoned her when he was one.         
	Neighbours became suspicious when Shantilata, who was sociable, went missing all of a sudden. She used to come to us everyday and have lunch when her family refused her food, said Chandibala Samanta of Jamalpur, 90km from Calcutta.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta Aug. 8: Kanti Gangulys appointment as Subhas Chakrabortys successor in the sports and youth affairs department is part of the CPMs plan to protect the late ministers support base and prevent the fragmenting of the North 24-Parganas district unit.        
	Ganguly, a CPM state committee member and Sunderbans affairs minister, is one of two Chakraborty loyalists to be picked to continue the work that Chakraborty handled.         
	Yesterday, Ranjit Kundu, a Citu leader and district secretariat member from North 24-Parganas, was chosen the transport minister.        
	Kundus induction into the transport ministry was announced by state party secretary Biman Bose, but Gangulys appointment in the sports and youth affairs department is yet to be formally announced.        
	Ganguly had informed the party early this month that he wanted to quit his ministry berth and work for the party.         
	All I can tell you at this moment is that the chief minister (Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee) informed me on Friday that he would add sports and youth affairs to my responsibilities, Ganguly said.        
	I told him I would do my utmost to live up to his and the partys expectations.         
	Today, Ganguly called on Jyoti Basu at his Salt Lake residence and sought his blessings. Try to carry all sections of people with you, Basu told him.         
	Basu, state secretary Bose and a few key leaders had feared that Chakrabortys death might impact the fractious North 24-Parganas unit in many ways.         
	Chakraborty was one of the key leaders of the unit and the party leadership would have found it extremely difficult to manage his pool of supporters, which ran the risk of either getting fragmented or hijacked by the Trinamul Congress or the Congress.         
	By picking Kundu and Ganguly, the party has also assuaged the fears of Chakrabortys supporters, who have been nervous about their future.

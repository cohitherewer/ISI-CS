                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Murder for thrashing protest
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bolpur, Dec. 28: A retired college librarian was stabbed to death in Birbhum last night after he protested his grandsons thrashing by a group walking in a Muharram procession.        
	Police said 62-year-old Abdul Hais protest had snowballed into a clash between two groups in Rampurhat in which one of his neighbours and another man was also injured.        
	Rahul Sheikh, 16, was apparently watching a tazia from the roadside when a gang allegedly led by neighbour Raja Sheikh beat him up. Soon Abdul, his son and a group of local people went there and wanted to know why Raja beat up Rahul. An altercation led to the clash in which bombs and knives were used freely, a police officer said.         
	Caught in the melee, Ab-dul had tried to flee, but one of the miscreants chased him and stabbed him in the chest and throat. He died on the spot, the officer added.         
	The warring groups fled when they realised that former Rampurhat College employee Abdul, a CPM member, had died.

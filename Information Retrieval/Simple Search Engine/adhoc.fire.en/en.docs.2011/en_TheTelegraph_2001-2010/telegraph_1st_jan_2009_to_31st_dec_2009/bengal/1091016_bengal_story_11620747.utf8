The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CM preens, party moans   Buddha confident after talks with PM
                                                                                                               CM preens, party moans     Buddha confident after talks with PM
          OUR BUREAU                          Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee                                        
	Calcutta, Oct. 15: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today told CPM leaders he was satisfied after his meetings with the Prime Minister and the Union home minister on the planned offensive against Maoists, sources said.        
	The chief minister is believed to have spoken about the Centres agreement with Bengals concerns on the proposed crackdown on the rebels. I am satisfied that the Centre has appreciated our concerns about Maoists and their nexus with Trinamul. We agreed on the crackdown as the Maoists need to be countered politically and administratively, a CPM North 24-Parganas district committee member quoted the chief minister as saying at the closed-door meeting.         
	Participants at the meeting felt Bhattacharjee today exuded a new confidence that was lacking after the worst setback the Left suffered in the Lok Sabha elections.        
	Bhattacharjee referred to the electoral setbacks but said factors like withdrawal of Left support to the UPA and third front experiment could not be used to downplay the impact of the organisational and political weaknesses behind the rout.         
	He cited the example of the state governments decision to shelve the Salim groups Barasat-Raichak expressway project that would have connected North and South 24-Parganas to Haldia.         
	The Opposition compelled us to shelve the Salim road project because of our organisation weakness. It was bad. But the expressway is needed for industrialisation, irrespective of Salims role in it, the chief minister is learnt to have said. Let us see whether we can rework the project.

                                                                                                               Rulers rail like rival 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          CPM leader Anil Basu at the rally. (Ananda Das)                                  
	Khanakul, Oct. 15: Senior leaders of the CPM today hurled accusations of inaction at police and threatened them in a party stronghold in Hooghly, the rally speeches sounding like their Trinamul rivals.        
	We have observed that our workers are being murdered and beaten up by Trinamul supporters and the police are watching silently. Trinamul workers recently thrashed two women CPM workers in Pursurah but the police did nothing. Then why should the government maintain a police force and pay them salaries? asked CPM central committee member Shyamal Chakraborty at the rally at Goldigrui.        
	Hooghlys Khanakul  the rally was organised near the area  witnessed an exchange of fire between CPM and Trinamul activists last Sunday. Three Trinamul workers suffered bullet injuries. Six people were arrested, five of them CPM supporters.         
	Today, district CPM leader Anil Basu accused the additional superintendent of police and the sub-divisional police officer of arresting innocents. The additional SP and the SDPO arrested innocent villagers instead of the Trinamul workers, he said.        
	Basu said a CPM worker coming to the rally was beaten up today by Trinamul Congress workers in Khanakul. I give the police half an hour to catch the culprits. If they dont, then party supporters will take the law in their own hands and the additional SP will be to blame, he warned.         
	After getting off the dais, Basu pointed to the acting officer-in-charge of Khanakul police station, Sukomal Das, and said: I am giving you half an hour, or else the situation will go out of control.

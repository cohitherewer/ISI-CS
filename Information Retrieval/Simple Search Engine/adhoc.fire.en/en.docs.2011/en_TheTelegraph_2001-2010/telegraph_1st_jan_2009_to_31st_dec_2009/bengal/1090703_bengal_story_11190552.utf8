          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, July 2: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today accused Chhatradhar Mahato of providing an open platform to Maoists in Lalgarh and backed his home secretary who had said the tribal leader should be arrested.        
	Chhatradhar Mahato is not a Maoist but his Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities is providing an open platform to the Maoists to carry on their activities in Lalgarh, the chief minister told the Assembly today.         
	Yesterday, Mahato had said if the government wanted talks with the Lalgarh tribals, they should drop plans to arrest him and pull out the security forces from the area. His statement came two days after home secretary Ardhendu Sen said Mahato should be arrested. Sen also ruled out talks.        
	Bhattacharjee said: There was nothing wrong in the home secretarys statement when he said Mahato was not officially connected with Maoists. But still, Mahato would be arrested, the chief minister said.

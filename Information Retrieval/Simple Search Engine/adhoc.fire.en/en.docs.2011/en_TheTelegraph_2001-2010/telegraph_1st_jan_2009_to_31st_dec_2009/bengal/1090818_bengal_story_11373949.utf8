	Calcutta, Aug. 17: Two cent-ral Calcutta seats that fell va- cant after their MLAs won the Lok Sabha elections are going to the polls on Tuesday.        
	Over 1.5 lakh voters will exercise their franchise in the byelections to the Sealdah and Bowbazar Assembly seats between 7am and 5pm. The results will be known on Friday.        
	Chief electoral officer Debashis Sen said offices and educational institutions in the two areas would remain closed on Tuesday.        
	Mamata Banerjees candidates are the main contenders in both seats. In Sealdah, she has picked Shikha Mitra, whose husband Somen held the seat earlier as a Congress MLA. In Bowbazar, the Trinamul nominee is transport union leader Swarnakamal Saha. We will win both, said state party president Subrata Bakshi.

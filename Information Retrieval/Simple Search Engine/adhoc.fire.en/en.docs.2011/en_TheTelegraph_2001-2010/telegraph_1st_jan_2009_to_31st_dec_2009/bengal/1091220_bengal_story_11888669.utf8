	Chandernagore, Dec. 19: A retired engineer and his wife and son were found hanging this afternoon from the ceiling of their house here.        
	The bodies were decomposed and police found a purported suicide note signed by Ujjwal Nandi, 31, dated December 15. It said no one was responsible for the deaths.         
	The police said Samir Nandi, 70, a BTech, had earlier worked with the public sector Heavy Engineering Corporation. His wife Sangeeta was 57.         
	A possible reason for the drastic step could be the debt that Ujjwal had run up because of his failed business. Neighbours said he was being hounded by banks.        
	Ujjwals pregnant wife Pampa had been sent to her parents 10 days ago. Their dog died on December 14, said Sukhomoy Chakrabarty, the OC of the local police station.

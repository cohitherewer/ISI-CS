The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Promise govt role before poll: Bloc
                                                                                                               Promise govt role before poll: Bloc
  - Call for blunder correction in campaign        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Calcutta, March 20: The CPM may be edgy about joining a government at the Centre but partner Forward Bloc wants the Left Front to assert its willingness do so in the election campaign.         
	We cannot escape the responsibility of running a government when we are asking people to vote for us to ensure a non-Congress, non-BJP regime. The Left must join it, Bloc general secretary Debabrata Biswas said after releasing the partys poll manifesto.         
	The party is fielding 23 candidates in the general election, including three in Bengal.        
	According to Biswas, the Left parties have realised that their credibility among new voters as well as their fortunes in traditional strongholds would be better if they focus on the Lefts participation in an alternative government during the campaign.         
	The participation in the government will be gradually made a part of our campaign across the country, he said.         
	Three days ago, patriarch Jyoti Basu had expressed the hope that his partys historic blunder of 1996 would not be repeated. Last time, we could not do it. Now, it seems we will be able to, he said.         
	However, Basu, who would have led the alternative formation as Prime Minister in 1996, had his fingers crossed on the difficult job of shaping a sustainable alliance out of disparate regional forces staking their own claims in the event of a hung Parliament.        
	CPM general secretary Prakash Karat, who had opposed joining the government at the Centre earlier, has not ruled out participation this time but declined to commit himself before the polls.         
	Many Left leaders feel the promise of joining the government will help them stem the post-panchayat poll erosion in support in Bengal and put a lid on infighting in Kerala, which has also taken a heavy toll.         
	The CPM, however, is not ready. Our call for a third front government is enough for the campaign. We had supported the UPA government from outside and helped sustain it in a responsible manner till the standoff on the nuclear deal, said Bengal state secretariat member Benoy Konar.         
	He indicated that the party was not sure about the results despite its claims that non-Congress, non-BJP parties would be in a position to form a government. We will consider joining an alternative government if it isnt dependent on any big party and on the basis of a common minimum programme with the Left having the power to influence it, he said.         
	MP and party candidate from Calcutta North Mohammad Salim hinted at the CPMs dilemma over post-poll relations with the Congress. There is no political or ideological impediment to joining an alternative government but we have to think twice if it needs Congress support.         
	The front will meet on Sunday to finalise its strategy.

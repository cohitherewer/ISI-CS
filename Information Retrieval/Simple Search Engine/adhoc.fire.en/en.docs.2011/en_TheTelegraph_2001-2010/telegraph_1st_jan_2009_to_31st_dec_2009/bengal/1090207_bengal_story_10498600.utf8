The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Morcha confines Darjeeling DM
                                                                                                               Morcha confines Darjeeling DM
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          The gherao outside the Darjeeling DMs office                                  
	Darjeeling, Feb. 6: Gorkha Janmukti Morcha activists today confined the Darjeeling district magistrate and other government officials to their offices across the hills for over four hours demanding permission to hold a public meeting in the Dooars.         
	The outfit, fighting for a separate Gorkhaland, also wanted 12 closed tea gardens to be opened immediately.         
	The gherao at the nine government offices was lifted around 5.45pm after district magistrate Surendra Gupta assured a Morcha team that he had sent a report on their demands to the government.         
	Around 11am today, slogan-shouting Morcha supporters surrounded eight block development offices across the hills and submitted their charter of demands to the BDOs.         
	In Darjeeling, at the same time, the outfit brought out a rally. District magistrate Gupta was not in his office when the rallyists came. When he arrived around 1.15pm, the 100-odd supporters assembled there allowed him to enter. Once in, members of the Nari Morcha squatted on the corridor leading to Guptas room. The office has been gheraoed and movement restricted. I have informed my higher authorities, Gupta said around 4pm.         
	Talks between chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Morcha chief Bimal Gurung had been inconclusive in Calcutta on February 4.         
	Gurung had then put forward the same demands that his supporters raised today.         
	He wanted the government to provide protection to all Morcha supporters in the Dooars. He also demanded the arrest of 14 Akhil Bharatiya Adivasi Parishad leaders who had allegedly attacked his supporters recently. He asked for the release of all Morcha activists arrested in the region and compensation for those whose properties were damaged in the clashes with the adivasis.         
	The parishad called a bandh in the Dooars and the Terai today. Tribals blocked traffic on NH 31C that connects Assam to north Bengal.         
	Team to Lalgarh        
	The Morcha has decided to send a team to Lalgarh in West Midnapore to express solidarity with tribals  a gesture to counter the protest of adivasis in the Dooars. Morcha secretary Roshan Giri said: We will send a team soon, may be in a couple of days.         
	In West Midnapore, Chhatradhar Mahato, who has been at the forefront of the tribal agitation, said: The movement by the Gorkhas in the Darjeeling hills is justified. We extend our full support.

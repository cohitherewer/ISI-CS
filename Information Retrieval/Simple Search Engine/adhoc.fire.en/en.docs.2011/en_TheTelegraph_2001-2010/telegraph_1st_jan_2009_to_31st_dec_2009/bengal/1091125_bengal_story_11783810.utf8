          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Midnapore, Nov. 24: A policeman on holiday pounced on a Maoist after the guerrillas shot his father on a field today and took two bullets himself.        
	Madan Ghosh, 56, was killed on the spot. Son Swapan, 30, is in hospital.        
	A state armed police jawan, Swapan had taken leave and come home to Aulia village in Binpur, West Midnapore, to work on his field.        
	He was at work when he heard a gunshot, looked up and saw five men standing on the adjacent field where his father had been toiling. The young man rushed towards the gang, taking the rebels by surprise, grappled with one of them and had almost snatched his pistol when he was shot at.         
	As he fell, other villagers came running and the Maoists fled.         
	The police said Madan was an affluent farmer and had possibly refused to pay extortion money. My regret is that I couldnt save my father, said Swapan, who is posted in Barrackpore, North 24-Parganas.         
	West Midnapore police chief Manoj Verma said he could not recollect such an act of bravery in recent times. The villagers came to his rescue emboldened by his courage.

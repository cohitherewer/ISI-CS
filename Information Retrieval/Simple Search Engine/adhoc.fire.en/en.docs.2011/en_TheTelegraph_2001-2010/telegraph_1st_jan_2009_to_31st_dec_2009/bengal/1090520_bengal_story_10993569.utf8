The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Labourers stall work at IISCO
                                                                                                               Labourers stall work at IISCO
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Durgapur, May 19: Labourers on contract engaged for the IISCO modernisation project have stopped work demanding a job for the family of a colleague who died in an accident at the plant.         
	The Rs 15,800-crore modernisation programme of the Burnpur unit was halted yesterday by about 900 workers affiliated to Intuc, the Congresss labour wing.         
	They were erecting a blast furnace when an iron rod pierced 22-year-old Kunan Kumars throat on Sunday.         
	The group of 900 forced about 6,000 others, employed by various contractors engaged for the revamp, to go on strike. We wont allow work to resume until a family member of Kunan gets a job at the plant, said Aloke Singh, a general secretary of the Intuc union.         
	CPM labour arm Citu supports the demand but opposes the strike.         
	The revamp deadline is end-2010 and only 40 per cent work has been completed. Work in the main plant, however, was unaffected by the strike.        
	IISCO ruled out offering a job. We dont give jobs to family members of workers employed by contractors. Its the contractors responsibility, said M.K. Routh, an IISCO general manager.

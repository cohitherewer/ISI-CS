          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Midnapore, Sept. 24: Two villagers who refused to cough up money for Maoists and instead asked them to pay cash for Durga Puja were shot dead by the rebels last night in West Midnapore.         
	Police said Samir Singh Mahapatra and Nimai Bishui, both residents of Harimara in Goaltore, were returning home from a puja committee meeting after 9pm when they were shot dead.        
	Krishna Prasad Dule, the CPM MLA of Garbeta (West), said the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities in December told each family to pay Rs 20 and give 20kg of rice every month. The two CPM supporters had all along refused to pay the committee, which imposed the diktat at the Maoists behest, Dule said.        
	On September 22, eight armed Maoists came to our village and demanded Rs 50-100 from villagers. Some paid. But Samir babu and Nimai refused. Samir told them that instead they should pay money to villagers for Durga puja. You always take money from us. Now you pay money to us for a change Samir said, said Aswini Saha, 50, a villager.         
	Samir, 57, was a vegetable seller and Nimai, 42, was a meat seller.

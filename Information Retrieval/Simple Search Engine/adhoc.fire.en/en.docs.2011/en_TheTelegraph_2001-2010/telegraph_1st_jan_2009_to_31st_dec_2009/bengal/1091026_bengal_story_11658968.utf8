          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 25: Bengal has the highest rate of non-compliance under the Right to Information (RTI) Act with nine in 10 applicants denied information ordered to be released, a survey has suggested.         
	The survey by the Public Cause Research Foundation, a Delhi-based non-government agency campaigning for transparency, has shown that only 39 per cent disclosure orders by information commissioners were complied with nationwide.         
	Bengals compliance rate was only 8 per cent.         
	The survey found that among 6,000 RTI appellants from across the country who had received orders in favour of disclosure from information officers during 2008, about 61 per cent did not receive satisfactory information.         
	We see a major problem of non-compliance of orders, said Arvind Kejriwal, an RTI activist and managing trustee of the foundation.         
	(Government) officials have all the incentives not to release information  penalties for non-compliance are rarely imposed.         
	The RTI Act has several provisions for its effective implementation. Information commissioners are empowered to penalise officials for not releasing information. Their salary can be cut and they can even be arrested.         
	The survey, which analysed over 34,000 orders that had favoured release of information sought by appellants, also found that in cases on non-compliance, only 2 per cent of officials had been penalised.         
	Information commissioners have powers to punish violators, but they are not invoking them, Kejriwal said. The survey did not cover Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and Sikkim for various reasons.         
	Karnataka and Kerala had the highest rate of compliance  60 per cent. This may reflect their mode of operations  information commissioners in both states do not close a case and have repeated hearings until an appellant reports satisfaction.         
	Mizoram had the highest deterrence rate with penalties imposed on 25 per cent of violations of RTI orders, followed by Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh.         
	Over the past three years, tens of thousands of people have filed RTI applications demanding information across a range of topics  from office promotions and policy decisions on genetically-modified crops to irregularities in IIT entrance tests.

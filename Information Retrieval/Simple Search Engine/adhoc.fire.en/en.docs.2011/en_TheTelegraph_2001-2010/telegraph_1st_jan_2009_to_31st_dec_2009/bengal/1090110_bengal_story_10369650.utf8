The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Ballot gap bothers Left
                                                                                                               Ballot gap bothers Left
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Jan. 9: The defeat by over 39,000 votes in Nandigram has got the CPM worried, Biman Bose hinted today.        
	The Lefts candidate, Paramananda Bharati of the CPI, lost to Trinamuls Feroza Bibi by 39,549 votes. The former CPI MLA in Nandigram, Md. Illyas, had won the seat by 4,823 votes in 2006  about a tenth of todays margin.        
	On the sidelines of the CPM central committee meeting in Kochi, Bose said there was a need for introspection on the margin of loss. He repeated the complaints of low-key terror of Trinamul but also said: It (the result) calls for introspection.        
	Bose said: We have to look into our organisational shortcomings and campaign deficiencies. The party would have to learn these lessons.         
	Ferozas victory margin is about two and half times more than the 16,000-vote win for Trinamul in the panchayat polls in Nandigram, which comprises two blocks. The aggregate votes that the Left bagged in the four zilla parishad seats in the two blocks was about 16,000 less than what Trinamul had polled.        
	The CPM lost in Maldas Sujapur, too, where the Congresss Mausam Noor beat its candidate Haji Ketabuddin by 21,205 votes.         
	The CPMs ability to retain Purulias Para with a margin of over 40,000 was the only face-saver.        
	In Calcutta, CPM state secretariat member Goutam Deb said: The factors behind such a result (in Nandigram) cant be identified without detailed analysis of booth-specific figures. But it cant be explained only in terms of the Oppositions terror tactics also.        
	Tamluk MP Lakshman Seth, the CPMs man in Nandigram, did not agree with Boses approach of introspection, at least in public, and blamed the Oppositions terror ploys.         
	What Bimanda said is a routine thing as our party always reviews every poll result, he said. I thought Trinamul would get a higher margin in view of the terror they had unleashed.... Our supporters voted for Trinamul as they knew we wouldnt be able to protect them.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Left plays land card
                                                                                                               Left plays land card
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Biman Bose                                  
	Calcutta, Aug. 31: The ruling Left today tried to win back farmers, warning them that they would lose their land if Mamata Banerjee came to power in Bengal in 2011.        
	The poor and landless got land because of the Left Front governments land reforms programme. Now, the Opposition is instigating the former big landlords and asking for their support and assuring them of returning their land. If these evil forces come to power, the poor farmers land would be snatched away. It happened after the United Front governments fell in 1967 and 1969, cautioned CPM state secretary Biman Bose at the first big post-poll rally by the Left.        
	The rally to commemorate 50 years of the food movement had another purpose  to counter Trinamul Congresss rally on its Martyrs Day on July 21.        
	If Trinamul chief Mamata succeeded in elections since 2008 by playing the land card  Singur and Nandigram  and fanning farmers fears of losing their land under the CPM-led governments land acquisition drive, Bose tried to use the same campaign against her.         
	The Left also aimed at revisiting its legacy of mass movement on issues of hunger and price rise by resurrecting the fears of the rural poor.         
	Relatives of martyrs of the food movement were honoured at the rally along with the families of those killed in Maoist attacks since 2006.        
	Some front leaders, however, felt that chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee failed to use todays opportunity to make an honest confession about what he had earlier described as our mistakes and wrongdoing.        
	The admission of mistake came from Jyoti Basu, who could not attend the rally and sent a message that was read out. Many people deserted us in the last election. We have to bring them back.... We also have to correct our mistakes, the CPM patriarch said.        
	Bhattacharjee did not speak on industrialisation.         
	Instead, he trained his guns at the Centre for the food crisis and price rise and the rise of an evil fascist force led by Mamata that is trying to hoodwink poor people by smooth talking while loathing the have-nots secretly.         
	Making it clear that the Centre was to blame for the rise in food prices, Bhattacharjee did not announce any step to check hoarding, as the Left Front allies had demanded earlier.

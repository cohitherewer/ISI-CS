The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Police in Lalgarh at any cost
                                                                                                               Police in Lalgarh at any cost
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          Committee Against Police Atrocities members stop a truck   at a checkpost in Barapelia, an entry point to Lalgarh.   Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya      
	Calcutta, April 4: Police will move into Lalgarh even if that means risking confrontation, home secretary Ardhendu Sen said today, hinting the government would possibly make a move within a week.        
	We have no option but to make the police enter Lalgarh at any cost, Sen said after a meeting of top police officers at Writers Buildings. If it leads to a confrontation, what can we do?        
	Sen promised that innocent people would not be harmed. We wont do anything that will endanger the lives of innocents. But the police cannot stay out of Lalgarh during the elections, he said.        
	Lalgarh will vote on April 30 but the Committee Against Police Atrocities, which is spearheading a tribal struggle against alleged police excesses, has said the police will not be allowed into this area of West Midnapore.        
	Sen claimed the police had been able to reach 11 or 12 of the 40 booths in Lalgarh. He accused the Maoists of fomenting trouble. Maoists are still operating there. Our priority is to hold elections. Police presence in Lalgarh is a must. At todays meeting we reviewed the situation. The picture will be clearer in a week or so and we plan to intensify police movement.        
	The home department has reports that firearms and ammunition are being stockpiled by the Maoists in Lalgarh and adjoining areas.         
	A few days ago, a car travelling from Asansol to Lalgarh was intercepted and three men ferrying an arms consignment were arrested. Firearms and ammunition were seized from these men and Maoist literature was found in their possession. This proves the presence of Maoists in Lalgarh, Sen said.        
	He added that the Maoists were using the Committee Against Police Atrocities as a front. Both the Maoists and the committee are against the police entering the area. Chhatradhar Mahatos outfit (the committee) is operating as a front, backed by the Maoists.        
	Asked about security deployment in Lalgarh, state chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti said: We havent been informed by the Election Commission about how many companies of central forces Bengal will get. We want deployment of paramilitary forces in every booth of Lalgarh.... The onus of conducting peaceful polls lies on the paramilitary and state police forces.        
	Chief electoral officer Debashis Sen, who has returned from a tour of the tribal belt, said: The Election Commission is keeping track of the developments in Lalgarh. Our intention is to ensure that every voter gets to cast his vote in a peaceful environment. We are in touch with the state government.

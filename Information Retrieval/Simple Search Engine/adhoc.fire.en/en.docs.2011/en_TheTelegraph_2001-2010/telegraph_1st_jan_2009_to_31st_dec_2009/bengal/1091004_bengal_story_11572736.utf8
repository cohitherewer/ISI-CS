The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | RSP seeks Left review on Siliguri
                                                                                                               RSP seeks Left review on Siliguri
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 3: The RSP today demanded a review of the Left Fronts support to the Congress in the Siliguri Municipal Corporation.         
	Censuring the CPM for its unilateral move without consulting the RSP state leadership, the party also felt that the move was suicidal as it helped Trinamul earn an image of a political martyr.        
	RSP state secretary Debabrata Bandopadhyay wrote to front chairman and CPM state secretary Biman Bose criticising the move to support the Congress and demanding an immediate meeting.         
	We will demand the review of the move to support the Congress, former RSP MP Manoj Bhattacharya said.         
	Both leaders accused the CPM of deceiving the RSP leaders in Siliguri by giving them the impression that Alimuddin Street had already obtained the approval from the state leadership.

                                                                                                               South Bengal toll at 42
          OUR BUREAU                              
	May 26: The toll in the south Bengal districts from yesterdays cyclone has gone up to 42 with reports of 22 more deaths coming from the two 24-Parg-anas, Birbhum, Murshidabad, Nadia and Burdwan.        
	Two air force helicopters dropped food packets in the 24-Parganas and two columns of army personnel (about 140) conducted rescue operations, chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti said.         
	In North 24-Parganas, seven of a family, including three children, were swept away last night by the swirling Ichhamati. In South, district magistrate Khalil Ahmed said five people died in Patharpratima.         
	Four deaths were reported from Birbhum. While a couple died in sleep after a portion of the mud wall of their house fell on them last night at Murarui, two farmers were crushed under trees in Nalhati and Suri today. Three persons died in Murshidabad, two in Nadias Chakdah and one in Burdwans Memari. Over 2,000 houses were damaged in the two districts, officials said.        
	The south Bengal toll of 42 does not include Calcutta and Howrah.        
	Large swathes are without power. Our engineers are conducting repairs on a war footing. In many places the damage is so huge, it will take three to four days to repair, said a power department official. Over 1,000 poles have been uprooted and wires have snapped at innumerable points.        
	Chakrabarti put the official death toll in the state at 64, but reports of casualties are pouring in.

	Aug. 8: Trinamul Congress supporters and police clashed in Mangalkot today, gifting Mamata Banerjee a chance to reclaim a sliver of political space the Congress had seized earlier and keep the pot boiling two days after the governor spoke of a tandava of violence.        
	Around 30,000 people had gathered for Trinamul MP Subhendu Adhikaris rally in Khudrun, on the periphery of the restive Mangalkot where Section 144 is in force after a series of political clashes.        
	What set off the clash this afternoon is not clear but Mamata was quick to announce her travel plan. She declared she would visit Mangalkot in two or three days and dared the police to stop her.         
	It was Mangalkot that brought the Congress out of Trinamuls shadow to enforce a successful bandh on July 17, two days after its MLAs were chased out of the area in Burdwan by CPM supporters.         
	I will visit Mangalkot in two or three days. Why has Section 144 been imposed there? I will hold a meeting at that very stage. Let the police try and stop me, Mamata said.        
	The governor is right in saying that a tandava of political violence is on. The other day, the Union home minister said (parts of) Bengal have turned into killing fields. When the governor and Union home minister say something, they talk on the basis of evidence. After all this, should the chief minister remain in power for a minute? she asked.        
	Mamata also alleged that CPM cadres, whom she called the suo motu action force, had fired from their party office at the Trinamul rallyists. The police denied this.        
	CPM state secretary Biman Bose said: The Trinamul is behind todays violence. This is part of the partys attempts to unleash anarchy all over the state. The Trinamul is always resorting to falsehoods. But the people will resist.        
	The clash broke out today when Adhikari had just finished addressing the crowd around 2.30pm in Khudrun.         
	Adhikari told his supporters repeatedly over the microphone that they should not violate Section 144. We wont violate Section 144. We have held a big rally and people have understood that we assembled here today to protest against the CPMs atrocities and state-sponsored terrorism. We will come back to Mangalkot on August 25, he said.        
	Minutes after, a section of the crowd rushed towards the Shyambazar area where prohibitory orders are still in force, defying Adhikaris instructions, the police said.         
	The force immediately formed a human wall to prevent the mob from proceeding but some rallyists began throwing stones at the cops, making them run for cover.         
	The police then began lobbing tear gas shells. A district police officer said the force did not expect the crowd to rush towards us and try to break barricades after Subhendu babu had asked them not to violate Section 144.        
	Some cops chased the people who fled through a marketplace. Within minutes (of Subhendu leaving) we found some of them shouting and asking others to throw stones at us. There was no alternative but to lathi-charge, the officer said.        
	But a Trinamul activist alleged that CPM supporters were behind the unrest. We suspect some CPM cadres were in our crowd and began hurling stones at policemen. Our leader had announced that we should not violate Section 144, so why would we defy it?         
	Adhikari brought another charge. He said CPM supporters were among the police and were attacking his partymen during the lathi-charge.         
	Two police vehicles were set on fire and two other vehicles damaged. Twenty-four people have been arrested.        
	Mangalkot has seen a series of face-offs since the murder of local CPM leader Falguni Mukherjee on June 15, allegedly by Trinamul activists. The same month, CPM activists blocked Trinamul leader Partha Chatterjee from visiting Mangalkot. On July 15, the Congress MLAs were chased out.

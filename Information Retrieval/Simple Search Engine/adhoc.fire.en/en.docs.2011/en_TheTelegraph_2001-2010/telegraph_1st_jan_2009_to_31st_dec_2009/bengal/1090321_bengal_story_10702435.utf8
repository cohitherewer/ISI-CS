The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Cuffs on son for wiping out family
                                                                                                               Cuffs on son for wiping out family
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bankura, March 20: A man in his mid-30s has been arrested in a Bankura village for allegedly wiping out his entire family.        
	According to police, Sadhan Ghosh, 35, smothered his mother, wife and daughter, strangulated his son and bludgeoned his father to death.        
	He had told the police on Wednesday that he returned home from a paddy field around noon and found all of them dead. Sadhan claimed that his mother Arati, 62, and children Krishna, 12, and Gauranga, 10, were in one room, wife Putul, 32, in another, and father Bi-bhuti, 70, in the compound of their house at Raipur, about 190km from Calcutta.        
	Sadhan was arrested on Thursday night. Bankura su-perintendent of police Vishal Garg said: We had delayed the arrest to allow Sadhan to complete the funerals.         
	He was interrogated through Wednesday night, released and kept under watch yesterday, and finally arrested at night.         
	The police said Sadhan has confessed to his crime. He is said to have told the police th-at he had an associate with whom he committed the multiple murders. The associate is from the same village but we cant name him at this point. We are looking for him, an officer said.        
	The Ghoshes have four acres of farmland. A police officer said: Bibhuti had told his son he would bequeath the land and their single-storey house to his grandchildren because Sadhan led a wayward life. Villagers told us he was a habitual drinker and gambler.         
	Sadhan apparently told the police he was angry with his father because Bibhuti had vowed to deny him the the property. Sadhan also had a bitter relation with his wife because she protested his regular drinking and gambling, which had resulted in mounting debts.         
	He had planned to kill only his father and wife. Sadhan told us he and his associate entered the house late on Wednesday night and killed the two of them. Sadhan told us they killed his children and mother later under the influence of liquor, an officer added.        
	A three-page FIR filed by his brother-in-law Nirmal Mondal says he used to torture his wife.        
	Sadhan has three sisters, all of whom are married elsewhere in Bankura.         
	A nephew, Ujjwal Pratihar, who attended the funerals, said: My uncle had run into debts in the potato wholesale business he started a year ago and wanted to sell portions of the familys land to pay them off. Uncle was under pressure to repay his debts.

                                                                                                               Vedic probe cry on bank 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 11: Trinamul Congress MP Sudip Bandopadhyay has written to the Centre seeking a CBI probe into a public sector banks funding of murky land deals by a partner in the scrapped Rajarhat IT township.        
	Bandopadhyay has sent a letter to finance minister Pranab Mukherjee saying Central Bank of India looks to have violated norms by lending to Amarnath Shroffs Diamond Group. It looks that the PSU bank has violated banking norms to finance the group which used muscle power to snatch land from farmers in Rajarhat. I have requested Pranabda for a detailed investigation through any agency, preferably the CBI, Bandopadhyay, a member of the parliamentary committee attached to Mukherjees ministry, said.        
	Bandopadhyay has cited a Reserve Bank circular forbidding loans to builders who set up projects on farmland. In terms of (the) circular of the Reserve Bank of India dated July 1, 2009, banks are not permitted to extend fund-based or non-fund based facilities to private builders for acquisition of (agricultural) land. Central Bank of India sanctioned around Rs 1,240 crore to a group of promoters/realtors based in Calcutta for purchase of agricultural land in specific.        
	I am referring to Kolkata IT Links project (Diamond Vedic Village Project) of Vedic Diamond IT Links Private Ltd for purchase/acquisition of 1,200 acres of farmland at Rajarhat, the letter adds.        
	The bank has sanctioned Rs 425 crore to the group for the IT township. Till December last year, it had disbursed Rs 164.34 crore. Total loans, including those for other projects, sanctioned to the group was Rs 1,240 crore  referred to in the letter  at the end of 2008, of which Rs 548.28 crore had been disbursed.         
	Bandopadhyay wondered how such a large sum was lent even before construction started for the project, in which Diamond was a partner with jailed Vedic Village promoter Raj Modi and the state-run Webel.         
	Central Bank officials declined comment.         
	10-acre proposal        
	Housing minister Gautam Deb today offered to make room for IT giants Infosys and Wipro at New Town, Rajarhat.         
	Emerging from the weekly CPM state secretariat meeting, Deb said he would offer 10 acres each to them close to the airport so they could build multi-storeyed towers. Deb said he would discuss his proposal with the chief minister once Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee returned to Calcutta.         
	Others sounded sceptical. We didnt discuss the proposal since the CM was not there, said a secretariat member.         
	IT department officials doubted whether the companies would be interested in 10 acres when they had wanted 90.

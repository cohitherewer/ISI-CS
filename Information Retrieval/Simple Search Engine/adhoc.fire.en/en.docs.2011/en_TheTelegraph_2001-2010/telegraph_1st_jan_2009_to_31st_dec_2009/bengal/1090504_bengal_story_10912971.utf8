          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Tamluk, May 3: Police today arrested a CPM worker in connection with the murder of a Trinamul Congress activist in Khejuri on Friday.        
	Chandra Shekhar Shi, the arrested man, is one of the 16 people accused in the FIR filed by Prasanta Mandals widow Parbati.        
	Shi is from the same Sherkhanchowk village as Mandal. The Mandals alleged that he and some others were waiting outside the house while four men, who were outsiders, executed the operation. We have arrested him and are trying to find out what his role was in the murder, said East Midnapore police superintendent Pallab Ghosh.        
	Around midnight on May 1, four men broke into Mandals house in Khejuri, a CPM pocket, and shot him in the head. Twenty-five-year-old Mandal died on the spot.        
	The four attackers allegedly molested Parbati and raped Mandals mother. The medical test report to ascertain rape is yet to come. Mandals mother was sent for tests. Doctors at Contai hospital are yet to send a report, said Ghosh.         
	Today, tension ran high in Khejuri when 2,000 Trinamul activists marched out in a procession with Mandals body.        
	They were taking it from the Contai subdivisional hospital to the Mandals home but on the way, the processionists threw stones at cops in Khejuri police station.        
	They also pushed officer-in-charge Bidhan Chakrabarty and accused the law enforcers of having a nexus with CPM cadres.        
	Later in the day, Trinamul activists kept four men, believed to be CPM workers, confined to a room for four hours at Nichkashba village in Khejuri. They said the four were making bombs to unleash violence on May 7, when Nandigram is scheduled to vote.        
	A police officer in Khejuri said: A bomb exploded in a bush in Nichkashba this morning. On a suspicion, the Trinamul activists gheraoed four persons  identified as Bibhuti Giri, Tapas Giri, Narendranath Bera and Natin Maity. The Trinamul activists suspected them because the explosion happened near Bibhutis house, the officer said.        
	A police team that went to the blast spot found 30 crude bombs hidden behind bushes near Bibhutis house. The four were immediately detained.        
	Forty companies of central forces have reached the district. Ten companies will be stationed in Nandigram and Khejuri.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Assault charge on tribals
                                                                                                               Assault charge on tribals
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, April 26: Police today accused the tribals of Lalgarh of trying to prevent a sergeant from taking lawful action when he stopped their vehicle for flouting traffic norms on Friday afternoon.        
	The armed tribals and their supporters had choked rush-hour Calcutta, blocking Theatre Road and Chowringhee for five hours after accusing the policeman of demanding a bribe and thrashing their driver.         
	Traffic sergeant K.N. Sanwar filed a complaint of assault today along with his version of what happened after he waved the bus to a stop that day. The trouble, he said, started when a bus bringing the tribals from West Midnapore for a rally jumped the signal. When I intercepted it and asked the driver to produce his licence, he could not. He told me the West Midnapore police had seized it 10 days ago. But he could not show a document to support his claim. Then how do I know if he has a licence at all? asked Sanwar.        
	Driver Rabindranath Bhuniya told the police his papers and those of the bus were taken away when the district administration requisitioned the vehicle for poll duty 10 days ago, but he couldnt show a slip supporting the claim.        
	As the sergeant initiated the process to seize the bus, the driver, helper and the passengers allegedly started scuffling with Sanwar. Then they blocked the road. Members of the Lalgarh Sanghati Mancha, a city unit backing the tribal resistance to the police in West Midnapore, was accused of cooking up the bribe charge.         
	Detective department deputy commissioner Jawed Shamim said: We will probe the sergeants charges. No case has yet been started on the basis of the bribe charge.

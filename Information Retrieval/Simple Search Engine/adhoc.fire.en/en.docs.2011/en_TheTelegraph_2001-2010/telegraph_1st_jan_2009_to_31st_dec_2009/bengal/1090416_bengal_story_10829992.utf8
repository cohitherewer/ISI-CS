          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Domkol, April 15: A police station in Murshidabad has issued notices to three brothers fighting over their mothers land asking them to come for an amicable settlement, a step held illegal by the high court but still frequently used.        
	The eldest of the brothers, Maula Bux Malitha, has lodged a complaint with the district police chief saying the force has no right to hold a shalishi (reconciliation) meeting.        
	The officer agreed. Such notices cant be served by a police officer. I have ordered an inquiry.         
	The notice, signed by an assistant sub-inspector and carrying the official seal of the police station, says: Please come to the police station at 9am on April 16 for an amicable settlement of the dispute over the land.         
	Calcutta High Court lawyer S.K. Rakshit said the police had no authority to settle any dispute between two parties. It can only register cases, arrest persons and send the dispute to court for settlement.         
	That may be the legal route, but Dilip Roy, the inspector in charge of Domkol police station, about 230km from Cal- cutta, said: We often settle such small disputes at the police station so that the poor do not have to go to a court and face harassment.

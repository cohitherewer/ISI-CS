The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Chinese interest in Tata land
                                                                                                               Chinese interest in Tata land
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, April 13: Representatives of the Chinese First Automobile Works today met Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and said they were exploring the possibility of setting up a car plant on the Singur plot from where the Tata Nano was to roll out.        
	However, the Chinese are unlikely to get any land in Singur as the Tatas are set to renew their lease with the government. Faw (First Automobile) wants about 600 acres in Singur but the lease with Tata Motors for the land is likely to be renewed by the state if the Tatas so desire, an industries department official said.        
	Industries secretary Sabyasachi Sen said: The Chinese company is now conducting a study on the Indian market. After completing the study, it will submit a proposal to the state government.         
	According to an official of the chief ministers secretariat, Faw officials would like to visit Singur to find out if a manufacturing unit can come up there. Their intention is not to set up only a small-car plant but to explore other options relating to buses and mini-trucks. If theres a manufacturing set-up in Singur, theyd want to do the assembling in Haldia, where Faw is working on an expansion of a bus-manufacturing unit with Ural India.

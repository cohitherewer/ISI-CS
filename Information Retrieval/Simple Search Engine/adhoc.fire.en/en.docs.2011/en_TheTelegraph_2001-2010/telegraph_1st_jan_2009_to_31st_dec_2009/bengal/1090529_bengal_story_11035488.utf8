The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Team wistful but Mamata gets what she has always wanted
                                                                                                               Team wistful but Mamata gets what she has always wanted
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                          Mamata with her ministers after the swearing-in ceremony on Thursday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, May 28: Her ministers may not have got what they wanted, but Mamata Banerjee has reason to be happy.         
	All six Trinamul Congress ministers of state have been placed under Congress cabinet ministers  Saugata Ray under Jaipal Reddy in urban development, Dinesh Trivedi under Ghulam Nabi Azad in health and family welfare, Sisir Adhikari under C.P. Joshi in rural development, Sultan Ahmed under Kumari Selja in tourism, Mukul Roy under G.K. Vasan in shipping, and C.M. Jatua under Ambika Sonia in information and broadcasting.        
	Mamata will also not have a deputy from the DMK  of the two ministers of state for railways, K.H. Muniyappa is from the Congress and E. Ahamed from the Muslim League.         
	During her negotiations with the UPA leadership, Mamata had made two requests: that her partys ministers should get slots under Congress cabinet ministers and that she should not have a deputy from the DMK in the railway ministry, allegedly to shield against allegations of corruption.        
	While Mamata has got what she wanted, sections in her party were quietly questioning the wisdom of seeking only one cabinet portfolio.        
	The fear is that the party may have missed a golden opportunity to use power at the Centre to deliver to Bengal. Politically, that would benefit us, but Bengal too is a loser, a Trinamul leader said.        
	Bengal goes to Assembly polls in 2011 and Mamata has said her partys focus will firmly remain on the state. She has told her partys ministers she wants them to spend most of their time in Bengal, rather than in Delhi.         
	But critics argue Mamata alone will head a ministry while other Trinamul members, as junior ministers, might not be in a position to prioritise development projects for Bengal. Such projects could have helped the party in the Assembly polls, they say.         
	Concerns voiced within her party suggest disappointment with Mamata, who negotiated alone with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi. No one, however, was willing to criticise her openly.         
	Trinamul with 19 MPs is the largest ally of the Congress in the UPA, but Mamata asked for only one cabinet berth and six minister of state posts, none with independent charge.         
	The DMK, with 18 MPs, got itself three cabinet posts and four ministers of state.         
	Even Sharad Pawars Nationalist Congress Party, with nine MPs, has charge of two ministries  one as cabinet minister and another as minister of state with independent charge.         
	Within Trinamul, there are also concerns that the portfolios assigned to the junior ministers do not lend to easily visible development projects. Shipping alone of the six is regarded as an infrastructure ministry.         
	If we had a cabinet minister or even a minister of state with independent charge taking control of roads and surface transport, for instance, Trinamul could have gained significantly ahead of the Assembly elections, rdquo; a source said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Home plan for house acquired 
                                                                                                               Home plan for house acquired 
          SAMBIT SAHA                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 27: A steel maker who wants to make a factory and power plant in Bengal has proposed a house-for-house plan for villagers who will have to give up their homes near Asansol for the project.        
	Bhushan Steel, which requires 2,500 acres for its 2 million-tonne steel unit and 1,000 mega watt power plant in Salanpur near Asansol, would have to displace 1,500 families from two villages.        
	This plot is homestead land  meaning it only has houses, no crops.        
	A senior official of the company, which is headquartered in Delhi, said each of the 1,500 families would be provided with a house. We have done the same in Orissa and will be doing it here too. Whoever parts with homestead land would be provided with an alternative house, the official said.        
	The nitty-gritty of the house-for-house plan is yet to be finalised but the companys intention makes it clear that the private sector is acknowledging the need to handle land acquisition sensitively.        
	The company has put the proposal before the government that is yet to give its nod.        
	The proposed township would not be part of the 2,500 acres. We need extra land for the colony, the Bhushan Steel official said, adding that it would be built away from the plant keeping in mind the aspect of pollution.         
	So far, the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC) has initiated the process for acquiring 1,100 acres for the steel and power plants.        
	The local authorities have issued the section VI notification under the land acquisition act for almost half the 1,100 acres  meaning that land would be taken has officially been announced in these areas.        
	For the rest of the area, the section IV notice has been issued. This means villagers have been told about the acquisition but hearings on the acquisition  during which prospective land losers may agree or disagree  are yet to be conducted.        
	Subrata Gupta, the managing director of WBIDC, said the Bengal government has been insisting that investors should rebuild houses if homestead land is to be taken. We generally try to avoid settlements. But if that is not possible while acquiring large tracts, we ask the investor to rebuild houses, Gupta explained.        
	Apart from building a colony for the displaced people, Bhushan is also planning a land-for-land in its rehabilitation scheme that will be over and above the monetary compensation.         
	Those who give up land would be compensated by land, those would relin- quish house, would be given accommodation in the colony, the company official explained.        
	WBIDC will also work on the alignment of the plot to take care of the concerns of Coal India. Salanpur is a coal rich area and Coal India plans to expand its mining.         
	Earlier, Sajjan Jindals JSW Bengal had offered a share, cash and jobs for acquiring land. Bengal Aerotropolis, building an airport city in Andal, not too far from Salanpur, is offering land for land as well.

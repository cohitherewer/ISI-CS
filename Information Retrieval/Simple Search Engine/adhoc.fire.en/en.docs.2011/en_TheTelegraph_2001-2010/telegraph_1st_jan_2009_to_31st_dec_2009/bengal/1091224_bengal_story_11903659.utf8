          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Dec. 23: The Centre has written to the Bengal government asking it to take urgent steps to stop political violence in the state, following a report from the home ministry team that went to Calcutta earlier this month.        
	Sources in Delhi said home minister P. Chidambaram sent the letter to Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee earlier this week.         
	However, the state government tonight denied having received any such letter. Home secretary Ardhendu Sen added: As the home secretary of this state, I should know if such a letter has been sent to the chief minister.        
	The central team, headed by additional secretary (Naxalite management) D.R.S. Chowdhury, had gone to Bengal following Mamata Banerjees allegations of a complete breakdown of law and order.         
	However, a Union home ministry source said Chidambarams letter had restricted itself to asking the Bengal government to take steps to end the violence between Trinamul and Left sympathisers. It has also asked the state to deploy more security personnel in violence-prone areas.         
	In Calcutta, the central team had left the Trinamul leader angry by not visiting the trouble spots as she had wanted them to, but restricting itself to talks with representatives of various parties and government officials.

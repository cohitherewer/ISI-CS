	Lalgarh, June 30: Two tribal women gave birth in a relief camp run by the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities here in the past week because they wouldnt accept help from the government.        
	In our village, hundreds of children are born at home without any medical super- vision. The government has never bothered about us. Now they are putting up a show of sympathy. We wont take their help, said Parbati Kisku, who got a daughter six days ago.        
	The aversion to anything to do with the government is understandable when the el- derly woman in charge of the daily needs of the camp between Kantapahari and Lalgarh says how an expectant Jasomani Mandi was kicked in the tummy by policemen raiding their village last November.        
	It is that series of raids af- ter a blast on the chief ministers route that gave birth to the Lalgarh agitation.        
	Jasomani, 22, gave birth to a son last night.         
	The camp at Narcha Primary School was set up on June 19 when committee supporters started fleeing villages like Barapelia, Chhotopelia and Dalilpur as the security forces started advancing to reclaim Lalgarh.        
	The camp housed around 250 people until yesterday. The men fled after the forces entered Kantapahari yesterday. There are about 115 women left in the camp now.        
	Jasomani, exhausted after labour, mumbled she wouldnt take her son to a hospital for check-up or vaccination.         
	Parbati, 30, was more vo- cal. I really needed a doctor and a hospital six days ago. Now my daughter and me are fine. The women in the camp helped me deliver my child. We are used to this kind of hardship, said Parbati, her daughter in her arms.        
	Six days ago, she could not have sought the help of a qualified nurse even if she wanted to. The health sub-centre 3km away at Kantapahari, there for mother and child care, has been closed for the past five months.         
	She could have gone to the block health centre in Lalgarh town, also around 3km away, but she did not.        
	We are supporters of the Peoples Committee, said Jasomani, with a sense of pride.        
	Parbati and Jasomani have to rely completely on the other women in the camp because their husbands were among the men who fled yesterday.        
	After the security forces took control of Kantapahari, Binpur I block development officer Saurav Barik had sent health workers to the sub-centre at Kantapahari to reopen it.         
	Hearing about the childbirths, he also sent an ambulance to the relief camp in Narcha to ferry the mothers and their children to the Lalgarh block health centre.        
	They refused to come. We will try again. Well also take the other women and children for check-ups and the necessary healthcare after speaking to local villagers, the BDO said. That wouldnt be easy.         
	Sombari Murmu, 58, among the women in charge of the daily needs of the camp inmates, said: The same police that tortured us all these years are trying to be our friends. We had wanted them to apologise for the torture inflicted on our women  like the kick to Jasomani and the rifle butt blow that almost took Chhitamoni Murmus eye  but neither the police nor the administration listened to us. How can we trust the government?

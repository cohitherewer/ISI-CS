The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Bengal the most misruled, says Rao
                                                                                                               Bengal the most misruled, says Rao
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, April 8: Days after Pranab Mukherjee read out a report card on the Left Fronts poor rule, the Congress ge- neral secretary in charge of Bengal went a step further and said Bengal was the most misruled state.        
	K. Keshava Rao said there were more murders during the Left Front rule than between 1952 and 1977 to drive home the most-misruled tag. Nine thousand murders took place between 1952 and 1977. But 40,000 murders took place during the three decades of the Left.         
	He did not clarify whether he was talking of political murders alone.        
	Asked for a reaction, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said at Writers Buildings: Who is Keshava Rao?         
	Rao alleged that the Left government had failed to tackle the problems of healthcare, nutrition and the high dropout rate in schools. The CPM has misruled Bengal in all fronts in the past 32 years. It has failed in primary education, health, nutrition, preventing the high dropout rates... implementation of the mid-day meal scheme and employment generation, he said during a stopover on his way to Ranchi from Guwahati.        
	However, Rao did not criticise Left Front chief Biman Bose, who had described Mukherjees report card as a bundle of lies. Biman Bose is basically a nice person and I respect him. He has been seeing his partys interest, said Rao.        
	While slamming the report card, Bose had said Mukherjee was an erudite and knowledgeable man parroting his party presidents views.        
	Rao met state Congress leader for almost an hour at a Salt Lake guesthouse.         
	Asked whether the party will put up a candidate against the SUCI in South 24-Parganas Joynagar, Rao said: We have reached a poll understanding with the Trinamul Congress, of which the SUCI is an ally. The AICC will take a decision considering all aspects.

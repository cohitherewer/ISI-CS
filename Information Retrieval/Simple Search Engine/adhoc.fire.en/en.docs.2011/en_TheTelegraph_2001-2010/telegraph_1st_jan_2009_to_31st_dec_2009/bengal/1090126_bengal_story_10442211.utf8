The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Cong key for CPM, Trinamul
                                                                                                               Cong key for CPM, Trinamul
                            
	Calcutta, Jan. 25: The CPM today announced its candidate for the bypoll to the Bishnupur (West) Assembly seat that Trinamul hopes to win.        
	It has fielded Iskandar Hossein for the constituency in South 24-Parganas.         
	His main rival would be Trinamuls Madan Mitra, a youth and taxi union leader who had lost to the CPMs Rathin Sarkar by around 4,500 votes in 2006. Sarkars death necessitated the poll.        
	Mamata Banerjee is smelling a victory in view of the partys recent success in snatching the zilla parishad. The mood in her party is also up-beat because of the thumping win in Nandigram in neighbouring East Midnapore.         
	The CPM refused to call it a test before the general elections, but admitted expecting a very tough fight in the Diamond Harbour, Mathurapur and Joynagar Lok Sabha seats.         
	The Congress could be the decisive factor in the three seats and in Bishnupur West, where it had won around 15,000 votes in 2006. The party has not made up its mind yet on whether to field a candidate.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Eye on land after murder 
                                                                                                               Eye on land after murder 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          PK Misra                                  
	Durgapur, Oct. 14: The murder of retired Durgapur Steel Plant general manager P.K. Misra may have been the fallout of a land dispute, police said today.        
	Last evening, Misra was shot in his neck and killed while he was watching TV in his living room. No one saw the assailants, but his wife, who was in the kitchen, came rushing to the room on hearing the shot.        
	The police said that other than the five cottahs of land at Bengal Ambuja Housing Complex where he was building a house, Misra had bought three acres at Sabujnagar, on the outskirts of Durgapur town through a couple of brokers.        
	There had apparently been some dispute between Misra and the brokers over their commission. Misra had recently had a feud with a couple of local land brokers, said Burdwan superintendent of police R. Rajsekharan.         
	The police will speak to all those involved in the land deal, but they are probing other angles as well.        
	Between 2007 and early 2008, Misra had served as general manager, maintenance, of DSP. As part of his work, he had to routinely deal with contractors and suppliers. We will find out if there was any dispute between them and Misra, said Joy Biswas, the Durgapur sub-divisional police officer. Misras former colleagues will be quizzed.        
	Some of his neighbours and domestic help Manju were questioned today. An official from the State Forensic Science Laboratory visited the place of crime, barely 500 meters from the police lines.         
	The police are looking into Misras assets. He had bought the five cottahs at the City Centre complex for Rs 40 lakh a year ago. There are three apartments in a City Centre highrise in his sons name, an officer said. Two of these apartments have been let out.         
	The officer said it appeared that Misra knew the assailant or assailants. Doctors told us he was shot point blank. We think he had time to raise the alarm, but he didnt.        
	Misras son Manish is a marine engineer working with a shipping company in Dubai. His daughter Priti Kataria is an executive of a software firm and married to a bank manager in Chennai.         
	Misras wife Subhra, who shifted to a relatives place in the town this morning, said: I have no idea whether he had any enmity with anyone. I have contacted my son, who is on a ship, and my daughter.

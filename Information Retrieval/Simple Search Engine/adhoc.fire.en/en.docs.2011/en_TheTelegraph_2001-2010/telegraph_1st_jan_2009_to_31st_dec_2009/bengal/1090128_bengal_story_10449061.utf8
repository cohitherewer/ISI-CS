The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CPM duo killed for hooch den protest
                                                                                                               CPM duo killed for hooch den protest
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Jan. 27: Two CPM leaders were butchered to- night after they apparently protested against a hooch den in a shanty off Dum Dum Cantonment station.        
	CPM supporters went on the rampage after the double murders and set fire to the alleged hooch den and adjacent shops and shanties.        
	Police identified the dead as Sujit Dasgupta and Shambhu Dasgupta. Sujit, in his 60s, was a CPM zonal committee member. Shambhu, ar- ound 36, was a Dum Dum municipality employee.         
	Around 8.45pm, they went near platform No. 2 following reports that hooch was being sold there.        
	Earlier in the day, five people had died in Maheshtala on the southern fringes of the city allegedly after consuming spurious liquor (report in Metro). The deaths sparked a mob outrage: several illicit liquor dens were pulled down and some set on fire.        
	The CPM duo were attacked minutes after they reached the station on the northeastern fringes of the city. The police said a gang of four led by a known criminal pounced on them with daggers.         
	Shambhu sustained a deep cut in his neck and several blows to his upper torso. Sujit had a serious abdomen injury. The assailants fled as the two collapsed.        
	The police did not say who the known criminal was.        
	Local people took the two to hospital. Shambhu was declared dead on arrival. Sujit died after admission.        
	CPM supporters went berserk as they heard about it.         
	A large police contingent and RAF personnel dispersed them. The force has been deployed to maintain order in the area. Efforts are on to nab the assailants, said the officer in charge of the area.        
	A probe has begun to ascertain whether hooch actually sold from the shanties.        
	The CPMs Dum Dum Cantonment local committee has called a 6am-6pm bandh tomorrow.         
	Leaders said airport-bound traffic would not be stopped and the Metro and other trains wont be affected.

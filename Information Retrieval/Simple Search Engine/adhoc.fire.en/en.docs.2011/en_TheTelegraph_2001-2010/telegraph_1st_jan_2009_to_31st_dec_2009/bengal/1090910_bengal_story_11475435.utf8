The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | IISCO strike off
                                                                                                               IISCO strike off
                            
	Durgapur, Sept. 9: The strike at IISCOs Burnpur plant was called off tonight after the management agreed to raise contract workers wages by Rs 700 a month and pay Rs 7,000 in arrears. The hike will apply only to contract workers engaged by IISCO and not those under contractors. All 9,000 of them had stopped work together under the aegis of Citu yesterday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | 300 deer washed away
                                                                                                               300 deer washed away
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Spotted deer: In distress                                  
	Calcutta, May 25: At least 300 captive deer were swept away as the cyclone battered the fragile Sunderban mangroves and foresters were worried that there might have been heavy losses to wildlife.         
	The deer washed away by the floodwaters were housed in two government-run breeding centres at Jharkhali and Bakkhali. They have all been swept away, said N.C. Bahu- guna, director of the Sunderbans Biosphere Reserve.         
	The extent of damage to the wildlife will only be clear after the waters recede. The storm pulled down embankments in the islands dotting the Hooghly delta and while people scrambled to higher ground, it was not clear how the wildlife coped with the calamity.        
	Forest officials said the worst affected would be the spotted deer, wild boars and birds. Tigers, the most famous resi- dents of the reserve, fend for themselves better and are likely to make for higher ground in time. Weve never heard of tigers being affected seriously as they manage to get to the natural humps in the forest, said Paranabesh Sanyal, a former Project Tiger director.        
	Monkeys, too, are likely to escape by picking stronger trees for shelter.        
	Our men will be on the lookout for the animals that have been washed away and rescue them if they spot any alive, Bahuguna said.         
	However, the forest department is not contemplating any search and rescue operation. The forest and its fauna have a remarkable ability to rejuvenate themselves after such calamities, said Bahuguna.        
	In the 1998 cyclone that hit coastal Bengal, the deer and birds took the worst hit. The rookery of mainly open-bill storks at Pakhiralay was flattened and thousands of birds were killed and eggs destroyed.         
	The birds never returned to Pakhiralay and instead relocated to a rookery 25km away. This time, too, rookeries would have been hit, said Sanyal.

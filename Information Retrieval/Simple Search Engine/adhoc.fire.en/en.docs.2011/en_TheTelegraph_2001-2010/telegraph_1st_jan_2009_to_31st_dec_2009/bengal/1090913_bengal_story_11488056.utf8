The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Poll today in Siliguri
                                                                                                               Poll today in Siliguri
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Siliguri, Sept. 12: The Left faces a test tomorrow in stronghold Siliguri where the Congress had for the first time snatched a slice of its pie in June.        
	Siliguri Municipal Corporation goes to the polls months after the elections to the Siliguri mahakuma parishad  the equivalent of the zilla parishad for Siliguri subdivision  in which the Left lost three of the seven seats.         
	Like the parishad, which the Left has controlled since its formation in 1988, the Marxists have always been in power in the Siliguri civic body.        
	But the big question being asked is: will it slip out of the Lefts grip? The election result will be out on Tuesday and the town will be agog till then.        
	Had the Congress bagged one more seat  where it had never won a single seat before  it would have been in control of the parishad now.         
	Like in the parishad polls, the Congress and the Trinamul Congress are fighting the civic elections unitedly.

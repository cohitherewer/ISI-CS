                                                                                                               CPM leader shot dead
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Midnapore, April 10: Suspected Maoists today shot dead a CPM branch committee member who had quit the party three years ago because of a threat to his life but rejoined.        
	According to eyewitnesses, Asim Mondal opened his footwear shop in Bhulabheda market around 6.45pm and went to an adjacent stall to have a cup of tea.         
	Asim was sitting on a bench when suddenly three men, in their thirties, surrounded him. Asim carried a gun to protect himself. But he did not get a chance to take it out. The three fired and left, said a villager requesting anonymity.        
	According to police, Asim died on the spot.        
	Asim had quit the party in 2006 and circulated leaflets announcing this after Maoists threatened to kill him. Last year, he rejoined the CPM as a branch committee member, a police official said.        
	Before leaving the CPM, he was a zonal committee member, which is a higher post.        
	West Midnapore superintendent of police Manoj Kumar Verma said a team had been sent to Bhulabheda, about 230km from Calcutta, and an investigation started. Ordinary people cannot fire 30 rounds. We think it is the handiwork of Maoists, he said.        
	After shooting Mondal, the three assailants walked towards Okhuldoba village, near the Jharkhand border. The police found a large number of spent cartridges near the blood-splattered body of the 46-year-old CPM leader.         
	He was hit by at least five bullets, a police officer said, adding that handwritten leaflets were found strewn around the body. The leaflets said that Asim was killed for organising a resistance group against Maoists.        
	District CPM leaders said when tribals in Lalgarh, not far from Bhulabheda, were blocking and digging up roads, a few resistance groups pointed out that people were being inconvenienced by the blockades. Mondal was a member of one such group.         
	Mondal is the third CPM member to be killed in Bhulabheda since March. On March 18, two CPM members, Durgapada Deshwali and Santosh Mahato, were shot dead.        
	A police officer said they had no information that Mondal carried a firearm. We dont have any such information. No gun was found on the spot. We also cant say whether the assassins stole it.

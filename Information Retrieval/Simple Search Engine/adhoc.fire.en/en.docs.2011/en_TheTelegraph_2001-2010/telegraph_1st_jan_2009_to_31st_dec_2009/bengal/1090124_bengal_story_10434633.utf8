The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Trinamul with NDA
                                                                                                               Trinamul with NDA
                            
	Bolpur, Jan. 23: Mamata Banerjee told a rally in Bengals Birbhum district today that she neither supported riots nor the BJP, but clarified later that she was referring specifically to the 2002 Gujarat riots.        
	In Gujarat, there has been investment to the tune of Rs 75,000 crore in 2006-07. States like Gujarat are way ahead of Bengal in investment. But I dont support riots and I dont support the BJP, the Trinamul Congress leader said in Bolpur town.         
	Flooded by phone calls for clarifications, Mamata, who is officially still part of the BJP-led NDA, grabbed the microphone again about half an hour later. Some TV channels are distorting my statement. Have I ever said I have severed ties with the NDA? she said.         
	On her behalf, MLA Saugata Roy told The Telegraph: She wanted to say she was opposed to the BJP as far as the riots in Gujarat were concerned. She did not say she was leaving the NDA.

	Behrampore, Feb. 10: CPM supporters started working on a road this morning before a Congress panchayat could announce the list of villagers to be employed under a job scheme, triggering a clash in Murshidabad that killed one.        
	Bengal police said Congress supporter Niras Mondal, 50, was killed. A bomb hit him.        
	Labourers for the project under the Centres rural employment guarantee scheme were to be chosen from among below-poverty-line people at Sitanagar, 240km from Calcutta. But the CPM supporters started digging the earth on their own, an officer said.

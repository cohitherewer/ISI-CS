The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Minority barb in Rahuls Salvo II
                                                                                                               Minority barb in Rahuls Salvo II
  - Development amp; land grab heat on Left        OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Rahul in Domkal on Saturday. (Susmita Sinha De)                                        
	Domkal/Behrampore, May 2: He did not compare Bengal with Uttar Pradesh this time but Rahul Gandhi today pointed to the plight of the minorities on a tour of Muslim-dominated Murshidabad.        
	The communists talk big but they have done nothing for the minorities, the Congress MP said in Domkal on his second trip to the state.        
	The Left Front, he said, had not implemented the recommendations in the Sachar committee report to improve the lot of the minorities.        
	The report, released in 2006, said that in Bengal, where over 25 per cent of the population is Muslim, the community had only 4.7 per cent of employees in higher positions in government jobs and only 1.8 per cent in lower categories. Bengal fared worse than even Gujarat in this regard.        
	I am in the knowledge that communists are pro-poor. But what kind of communist government is this which forgets the poor, backward classes, the farmers and the minorities? the Congress general secretary asked the crowd of over 70,000 in Domkal while campaigning for Mannan Hossain, the Congress candidate for the Murshidabad seat.        
	Rahul, who had visited Purulia and Malda on April 24 on his first election tour in the state, also addressed a rally in Behrampore town for Congress MP Adhir Chowdhury. In both places, he slammed the Left for not doing anything for the minorities.         
	A report card that the Congress released recently on the Lefts 32-year rule in the state had mentioned that Murshidabad, where 63 per cent of the population is Muslim, is the poorest district in the country.        
	Rahul reached Domkal an hour behind schedule at 1pm, but over 70,000 people waited for him at the Basantapur College ground, about 240km from Calcutta, in the scorching sun.         
	Rahul repeated a charge he had made against the Left on his first trip  that of poor implementation of central welfare schemes, particularly the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme.        
	I was surprised to see that against eight lakh job cards, only 60 were given jobs under the 100 days work scheme. While they were supposed to get jobs for 100 days, they only got jobs for 17 days, he said, giving statistics for Murshidabad.        
	During his visit last month, Rahul had said the state was worse than Uttar Pradesh. I work in UP and thought UP was backward. I saw that the situation here is far worse than UP, he had said.         
	Today, after speaking for 12 minutes at Domkal, Rahul flew to the Friends Union Club ground in Behrampore town, 40km away, to address an equally large rally.         
	Repoll in 6 booths        
	Chief electoral officer Debashis Sen has said repolls have been ordered in six booths in the Jhargram, Bishnupur and Darjeeling Lok Sabha constituencies tomorrow.

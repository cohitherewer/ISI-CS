The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Drunk gang shoots children near Alimuddin Street
                                                                                                               Drunk gang shoots children near Alimuddin Street
          A STAFF REPORTER      
	Calcutta, Sept. 23: A child was shot in the temple and another in the hand 150 metres from the CPM headquarters on Alimuddin Street in Calcutta tonight when a group tried to kidnap three youths.        
	Farhan Aadil, the 10-year-old boy hit in the head, is in ICU and his condition is critical. The child, vacationing with his grandmother in Calcutta, is a student of a Darjeeling school and hails from Bihar, neighbours said.        
	Vicky, aged 11 and shot in the right hand, was released from hospital after first aid.        
	Around 9.30pm, a group of 60  most of them drunk  came running from the Sandal Street area near Alimuddin street and dragged three youths from adjacent Mehndibagan while they were dancing in the street.         
	When a crowd chased the armed group, they let go of the youths and opened fire. The two kids were hit then, said Damayanti Sen, deputy commissioner (central).        
	Sources said the brawl could be related to football match played recently. But the police said they were investigating the cause and no conclusion had been reached.        
	The prime accused, Gadar, and two alleged accomplices from Howrah have been arrested. At midnight, the police were searching for another suspect.        
	Residents demonstrated at the spot  the crossing of Alimuddin Street and Sandal Street where blotches of blood were still fresh  to protest alleged police inaction.        
	The incident happened right beside a police kiosk where there were no cops. Also, as the youths opened fire, the cops on guard outside the CPM headquarters themselves ran for cover and did not come to our help. This is the third such incident in three months when the group has got into a brawl with our kids and have opened fire, said Nasim Akhtar, a resident.        
	A relative of one of the injured children recounted the horror. I heard commotion outside my residence where Vicky was playing with his friends. When I ran outside, I found a number of men dragging away a few youths of our locality at a distance. I searched for Vicky but someone told me that he followed the mob. I sent a neighbour to get him back but later heard that he was hit by a bullet. We rushed him to the hospital, said Shabina Begum, the relative of the 11-year-old boy.

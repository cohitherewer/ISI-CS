	Hooghly, Sept. 29: A woman who stuck her head out of a speeding buss window to spit was yanked off her seat by another bus that grazed past and crushed her head under its wheels.        
	Thirty-two-year-old Arzuna Begum died on the spot near Dankuni. Her severed right hand lay 50 yards away.        
	How or to what Arzunas head got entangled is not clear.         
	Co-passenger Janardhan Kundu said the bus (route number 26) they were on was racing another bus. She (Arzuna) stuck her head out of the window to spit. Her right hand was also outside the window. Just then, there was a loud screech as a third bus from the opposite direction grazed our vehicle. We dont know what actually happened but we saw the woman scream and she was wrenched out of the bus within a second, said Janardhan.        
	The bus stopped and the driver and conductor fled immediately. We got off and found the womans head crushed and her right hand lying about 50 yards away.        
	Arzuna was travelling with her two children  Amina Khatoon, 11, and Sajid Haldar, 8. Amina was sitting beside her mother with her brother in her lap.         
	I dont know what to do. I was sitting with my brother in my lap when suddenly I heard my mother scream. I saw her being dragged out of the bus within seconds, Amina sobbed.         
	She tried to rush out of the bus to see her mother, but co-passengers prevented her from witnessing the gory sight.        
	Arzuna, who boarded the route 26 private bus at 10am at Chanditala, was going to her fathers house in Sheoraphuli, about 30km from Calcutta, with children.        
	Close to 11am, when the bus was in Dankuni it tried to overtake another one of route 40.         
	Both buses were running at breakneck speed down Delhi Road. passengers said. At Jagannathpur, the route 36 bus swerved to the left to overtake the other bus. But another bus was coming from the opposite direction.        
	Late tonight, the police arrested the driver of the bus in which Arzuna was travelling.        
	Amina wept inconsolably but had the presence of mind to borrow a cellphone from a passenger and call up her father, Sabir Haldar, a jewellery shop worker in Mumbai, now at home for the pujas.         
	Sabir later took his son and daughter away from Dankuni police station.        
	A 2,000-strong mob set fire to four buses and blocked Delhi Road for about three hours, about 25km from Calcutta.         
	The mob first set fire to the two buses. Two other private buses that were passing the spot were also set ablaze.        
	The police arrived about half an hour later and found they were outnumbered.         
	They called for reinforcement and a huge force from five neighbouring police stations  Serampore, Chanditala, Bhadreswar and Chandernagore and Rishra  arrived.        
	They resorted to a lathi charge to disperse the mob that did not allow Two fire tenders from Serampore put out the flames.         
	The angry residents also stoned a dozen trucks parked on the side of the road.        
	A preliminary probe has revealed that two buses were trying to overtake each other when the mishap occurred. We have learnt that the victim had stuck her head and hand out of the bus to spit. We are looking for the other bus driver, said Ajay Thicker, sub-divisional police officer of Serampore.

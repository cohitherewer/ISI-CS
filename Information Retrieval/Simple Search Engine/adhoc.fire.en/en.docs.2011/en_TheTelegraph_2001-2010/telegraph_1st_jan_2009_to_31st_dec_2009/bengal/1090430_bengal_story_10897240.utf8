The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Failed crop and debt drive mom to death
                                                                                                               Failed crop and debt drive mom to death
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Burdwan, April 29: Half of her potato crop ruined by disease and her sons struggling to repay a debt of Rs 30,000, a widow drank pesticide in Burdwans Mangalkot.         
	Tulsi Haldar, 50, died in hospital last night.        
	The Haldars had grown potato on most of their seven bighas, hoping for a 20-tonne yield. Dhosha (blight) dest- royed half the crop, said Ramtanu, 30, the elder of Tulsis two sons. We had spent all the money we had on the crop besides the Rs 25,000 we borrowed from a moneylender. We also took Rs 5,000 worth of seeds on credit.        
	The family had spent around Rs 45,000 on potatoes but not a paisa on anti-fungal sprays essential to prevent blight, an infection caused by fog and inadequate sunshine.        
	Officials blamed it on lack of awareness and high fungicide prices. To cover their five bighas, the Haldars would have had to spend Rs 40,000 more.        
	Almost half of Burdwans annual potato yield has been destroyed by blight this season. Principal agriculture officer Sukumar Roy said most farmers did not use fungicide because of the huge cost. They take chances and hope their crop will escape the disease. We have organised awareness camps but the situation isnt improving.        
	The government does not subsidise fungicides. Farm minister Naren De admitted that he had not given it a thought before. The time has come to give it a serious thought, he said.        
	Tension had mounted in the Haldar household as it became apparent that repaying the loans would be impossible. Ramtanu said he had frequent fights with brother Krishna of late. Ma used to intervene.        
	Tulsi had apparently stopped talking to her sons a few days ago. She used to eat less and say she was trying to save money, her elder son said.        
	When the brothers returned from the fields on Monday, they found their mother groaning in pain.        
	Hundreds of potato farmers in the region are riddled with debts, said Kripasindhu Ghosh of Mangalkot, about 175km from Calcutta.        
	Officials were quick to de- link the farmers plight from the suicide. We havent received a complaint saying the woman committed suicide because of the crop failure, said S. Som, the police officer in charge of Mangalkot.        
	Although in Burdwan district, Mangalkot is part of the Bolpur Lok Sabha seat. The Congress candidate there vowed to make the suicide an election plank. The government gives low-interest loans to farmers, but only supporters of the ruling party get them, alleged Asit Mal.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Plea for more poll forces
                                                                                                               Plea for more poll forces
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, April 16: The state government will request the Election Commission to deploy an additional 40 companies of of central forces in three Maoist-infested districts after Naxalite violence in three states in the first day of voting.        
	The poll panel has allotted 240 companies for the entire state of which about 20 companies (approximately 2,000 jawans) would be deployed in Bankura, Purulia and West Midnapore  all Maoist hotbeds.         
	After todays violence in Jharkhand, Orissa, Bihar and Chhattisgarh that claimed 19 lives, the state government said it would need more forces.        
	After todays meeting, convened by chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti on instructions of the chief minister, home secretary Ardhendu Sen said: The incidents that occurred in our neighbouring states, including the killing of policemen today, are certainly a cause of concern for our government. Three Maoist-affected districts are going to the polls on April 30 and so we have to beef up security there. It was decided at todays meeting that we will ask the EC to give us an additional 40 companies (a company has around 100 men) of central forces for Purulia, Bankura and West Midnapore.        
	He said combing operations in the three districts would begin after April 20, the day the first batch of paramilitary forces is expected to arrive.         
	We expect about 14 companies of central personnel by April 20 after which combing and search operations will be launched in the Maoist areas. Aerial surveillance will also be done and the EC has already issued directives in this regard, Sen said.        
	The state government had first asked for 400 companies of central forces but was told 240 companies would be deployed for the three-phase elections in Bengal.         
	After reviewing the law and order situation in the three districts, particularly after the Maoist attacks in Bihar and Jharkhand, we thought it would be better to ask for additional forces as the security aspect cannot be compromised, a senior police officer said.        
	Sen said there was a strong possibility of the Maoists involved in todays attacks in the neighbouring states taking shelter in the three Bengal districts.         
	Todays bandh call by the Maoists in the three districts could have been an excuse to let Maoists enter one or two of these districts, taking advantage of almost no police activity there, Sen said.

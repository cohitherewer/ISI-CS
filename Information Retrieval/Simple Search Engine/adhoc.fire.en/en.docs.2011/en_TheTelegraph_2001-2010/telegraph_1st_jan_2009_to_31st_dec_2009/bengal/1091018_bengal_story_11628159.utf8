The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Maya lobs Amar cases to Calcutta
                                                                                                               Maya lobs Amar cases to Calcutta
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Lucknow, Oct. 17: The Mayavati government today said it would transfer the money-laundering case against Amar Singh and his wife to Calcutta police as most of the companies they have been accused of amalgamating illegally were registered in the eastern city.        
	We are transferring the case to Calcutta since none of the companies mentioned in the FIR is registered in Uttar Pradesh, cabinet secretary Shashank Shekhar Singh said this evening, appearing to distance the government from the case after Amars threat of legal action.        
	In Delhi yesterday, the Samajwadi Party general secretary had alleged a political vendetta and said he would file a contempt suit against the BSP government.        
	Kanpur police had registered the FIR against Amar and his wife Pankaja on a complaint by a social worker on Thursday that the couple had taken liberties with the companies act and amalgamated some two dozen firms for converting black money into white.        
	The complaint, which alleged a Rs 500-crore fraud, also mentioned actor Amitabh Bachchan.        
	The FIR had accused them of amalgamating companies for converting black money into white between 2003 and 2008, additional director-general of police (law and order) Brij Lal said yesterday.        
	But the BSP regime appeared to wash its hands of the controversy today when cabinet secretary Singh said the state government had been unnecessarily dragged into the case.        
	The state government has nothing to do with the FIR, PTI quoted the bureaucrat as saying.        
	The state police acted on its own after getting some substance in the FIR, he said.        
	Singh said the social worker, Shiv Kumar Tripathi, had no link with the government. It was a normal, defined legal process followed by the police and now, as a part of the same process, we are shifting this to Calcutta.        
	In Calcutta, joint commissioner, headquarters, Jawed Shamim said no one from Uttar Pradesh police had contacted them yet. It is the UP police which will investigate the matter. We will provide them assistance if they seek any help from us.        
	It was not clear why Tripathi, a resident of Lucknow, filed the FIR in Kanpur.        
	Last night, media persons spotted Tripathi in a house in Lucknow with two policemen on guard.        
	Asked why Tripathi had been provided security, Singh said he might have asked for it.         
	The cabinet secretary said the police in Kanpur should have advised the complainant to go to Calcutta to file the complaint.

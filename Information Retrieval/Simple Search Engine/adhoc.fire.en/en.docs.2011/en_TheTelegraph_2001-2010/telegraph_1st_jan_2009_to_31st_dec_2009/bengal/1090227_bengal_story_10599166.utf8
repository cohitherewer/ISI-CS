The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Plan for first port on reclaimed land 
                                                                                                               Plan for first port on reclaimed land 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Calcutta, Feb. 26: The state cabinet has cleared a deep-water port to be built on reclaimed land, the first of its kind in the country, in the Hooghly river estuary.        
	The port, with a depth of 21 metres, will allow big ships carrying crude and other cargo to offload near Haldia and Nayachar, a region where Bengals new petrochemical zone, the PCPIR, is taking shape.        
	Earlier, a deep-sea port was planned in the Bay of Bengal. But now as the port will come up in the Hooghly, it will be called a deep-water port.        
	The New Kolkata International Development, a consortium led by Indonesias Salim group that is building the chemical hub in Nayachar, has been chosen the contractor.        
	Land will be reclaimed from the riverbed to set up the port, which will have a tail connecting it to the shoreline of East Midnapore district.        
	Cargo is expected to move in the following sequence. Once a ship offloads, the cargo bound for the Nayachar island will be taken away in barges. If the cargo is for Haldia or elsewhere, the consignment will take the tail link (see graphic) to East Midnapore and move by road or rail further on.        
	The project will cost about Rs 10,000 crore and take three to five years to build. The state wants to build the port not only for the upcoming PCPIR (the Haldia petrochemical zone) but also for all cargo. Bengal needs a deep-water port because of the declining draught in Calcutta and Haldia, a source said.        
	The Denmark Hydraulic Institute, regarded a leader in consultancy and research on ports and terminals, has done a study on the project and given its nod. A technical feasibility study is being done by L amp;T Ramboll. Sources said L amp;T might build the port.        
	The government has not said anything officially, but Beni Santoso of the Salim group today discussed the port plan with Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at Writers Buildings.         
	After the meeting, industries secretary Sabyasachi Sen said: The chief minister was happy to learn from the Salim group that they are interested in setting up a port near Nayachar. The government wanted one for a long time.

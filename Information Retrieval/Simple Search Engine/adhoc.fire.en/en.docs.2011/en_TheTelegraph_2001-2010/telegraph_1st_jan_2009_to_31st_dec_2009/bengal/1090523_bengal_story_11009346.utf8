The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CPM reviews minority plan
                                                                                                               CPM reviews minority plan
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Calcutta, May 22: The state CPM today decided to review the effectiveness of the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee governments approach to minority empowerment as part of a renewed bid to regain the trust of Muslim voters.         
	At a meeting of the state party secretariat today, the leaders stressed their concern about the erosion of the minority vote base and laid emphasis on winning back Muslim voters, whose en masse rejection is believed to be a prime reason for the Lefts rout.         
	As a first step, sources said, the government would ascertain how far the welfare schemes run by the minority development authorities had succeeded in channelling the benefits to economically disadvantaged families. There are reasons to believe that despite the governments best intentions, thousands of such families have remained untouched by the schemes.         
	Several secretariat members apparently cited examples of how bureaucratic indifference and, at times, copybook approaches pushed poor Muslim voters towards the Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamul-Congress alliance.         
	Sources said the partys attention had been drawn to numerous cases in which government agencies routinely initiated legal proceedings for recovery of unpaid loans, though, in reality, the families had paid a few instalments and sought restructuring of their payment schedules before defaulting.         
	Many poor families apparently got mired in litigation and were forced to blow the amount they had borrowed in fighting lawsuits. There was no attempt to sit with them and find out how we (the government or its agencies) could earn some breathing space, a leader said.         
	Rebuilding bridges with Muslims, who comprise over 25 per cent of the states population, over the next few months is crucial in view of the string of approaching elections, several party leaders pointed out.         
	Industries minister Nirupam Sen, who is believed to have unsuccessfully advocated fielding a new and non-controversial candidate in place of Lakshman Seth in Tamluk before the elections, referred to it today and said the partys decision to pick Seth cost it several seats. However, Sen did not push his point.         
	In a way, the party secretariat set the tone for the Sunday meeting of the 94-member state committee, which will analyse the performance in the 19 Bengal districts.

                                                                                                               Fist greets peace bid
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                        A woman follows the CPM team out of Samsur rsquo;s house      
	Natungram, Aug. 2: The CPMs first attempt to bridge the us versus them divide in bastion Burdwan unravelled today when a group of party MLAs were shoved and shouted at in the home of a slain Trinamul Congress leader.        
	The daughter of Sheikh Samsur Rahman, thrashed to death in Natungram on Wed-nesday, charged, fist clenched, at a CPM legislator when he appealed for patience.        
	The group of around 20 women at Samsurs house then erupted seeing the local CPM legislator who they accused of not responding to their distress calls as Samsur, another Trinamul supporter and a villager were being hacked, allegedly by CPM thugs.        
	Todays incident turned the tables on the CPM, whose supporters had chased Congress MLAs in Mangalkot, also in Burdwan, on July 15 claiming the killer of their local leader was among the legislators.         
	The showdown in Natungram  a rare instance of CPM leaders visiting the family of a rival since Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had used the us versus them phrase after the 2007 recapture of Nandigram  left the party stunned.         
	Uday Sarkar, a CPM district committee member and the zilla parishad chief, said: This is the first time we went to the house of a rival party (supporter). We wanted to ensure peace.         
	Syed Mohammad Masih, the Left Fronts chief whip, found himself the target of the fury. The CPM has brutally killed my abba and you ask us to maintain peace? Samsurs 18-year-old daughter Shyamali lunged at him with a fist of fury. Samsurs widow Parula glowered at Masih when he appealed for patience till action was taken.         
	Matters reached a flashpoint when some of the women spotted Pradip Tah, the local CPM legislator. Where were you that day? I had called you on your mobile for protection. But you never responded, Samsurs sister-in-law Ruby yelled. As Tah denied having received any such calls, cries of murderer and thief rent the air.         
	Alarmed, Burdwan police chief R. Rajsekharan, accompanying the delegation, requested the MLAs to come out but the women followed them shouting abuses.         
	The MLAs also visited the house of the other Trinamul man killed on Wednesday, Zafar Ali, and spoke to his son Rafiqul.

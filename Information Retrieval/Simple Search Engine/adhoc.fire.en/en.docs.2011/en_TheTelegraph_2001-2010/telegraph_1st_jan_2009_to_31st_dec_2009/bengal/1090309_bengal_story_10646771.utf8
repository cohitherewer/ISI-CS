	Tamluk, March 8: Four members of a family, including a mother and her eight-year-old son, were killed in East Midnapores Panskura when their Tata Indica ran into a stationary oil tanker this evening.        
	The car was trying to overtake another vehicle on National Highway 6 when it lost control and rammed into the tanker. The car turned into a mangled metal heap, said a police officer. Susmita Mallik, 33, her son Akash, her sisters husband Shyamal Manna, 42, and another relative, were killed. Akashs twin sister Asmita escaped with minor injuries.        
	Susmitas husband Ashok, a businessman in Midnapore who owned the car, did not take it because it was packed.

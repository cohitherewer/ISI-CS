	Howrah, July 4: Bankim Setu, the site of the accident today, acts as a fatal attraction for bus drivers because of the hundreds of passengers Howrah station regurgitates into the flyover.        
	Drivers step on the gas as they reach the flyover to catch the passengers streaming out from the old Howrah station.         
	In recent times, Bankim Setu, built in the eighties, has become a virtual death trap, accounting for as many as three similar accidents and loss of 16 lives, including the deaths today.        
	All the buses which come from GT Road are lured by the huge number of passengers waiting outside the station. Drivers try to overtake on the flyover in a bid to pick up the maximum number of passengers, a police officer said.         
	During peak hours, 500 to 1,000 passengers wait at the Howrah station end. Nowhere in the city do we have such a huge flock of passengers at one point and this makes a bus driver desperate to have an edge over the others, the office said.        
	In August 2007, a similar accident had taken place on the flyover. A minibus plying on the Howrah Maidan-Baishnabghata route tried to overtake another bus, crashed into the railing and fell. Only one person died as the bus settled on the roof of a shop, breaking the fall.        
	In 1996, a bus on the Ramrajatala-Rajabazar route fell from the flyover at the same spot where the bus fell today. Four persons died then.         
	Most buses plying the bridge are not fit for roads. The buses have bald tyres and faulty breaks, leading to many minor accidents almost every week, a police officer said.         
	Residents in the neighbourhood alleged lack of police vigil on the flyover to monitor vehicle movements.         
	A police kiosk was set up just few feet away from todays accident site. However, not a single policeman could be seen there, said Om Prakash Agarwal.

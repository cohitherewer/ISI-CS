                                                                                                               Essential status for potato
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, July 12: The government is set to make the potato an essential commodity to prevent hoarding.        
	Finance minister Asim Dasgupta said he would issue a notification tomorrow declaring potatoes new status under the Essential Commodities Act, 1956.        
	This will help us take stringent action against hoarding, he added.        
	Potato prices have spiralled from around Rs 10 a kilo six months ago to Rs 18 and the government has been wracking its brain to bring prices down.        
	Since yesterday, it has been selling potatoes at Rs 13 a kilo from 13 places in the city.        
	We are getting an overwhelming response from people, Dasgupta said. A similar exercise will begin in Burdwan tomorrow.         
	In Burdwan, the Rs 13-a-kilo potatoes will be sold at 90 places. Hooghly will be next, from Tuesday. We shall cover all the districts in phases, said food minister Paresh Adhikari. In Calcuttas Garden Reach, a potato stall will open tomorrow.        
	A finance department official said the state would introduce certain sub-rules in the central law to make potatoes an essential commodity.

          OUR BUREAU AND PTI                          Chidambaram                                        
	Nov. 5: P. Chidambaram today said he had impressed upon Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee that it is the duty of the state government to maintain law and order.        
	The Union home ministers statement in Delhi came in reply to a question on the spiralling violence in Bengal where Assembly by-elections are scheduled for Saturday.        
	I did speak to the chief minister and impressed upon him that whatever be the cause of the inter-party clashes, it is the duty of the state government to maintain law and order, Chidambaram said.        
	I did tell the chief minister that you must ensure that law and order is maintained whatever be the provocation for the clashes.        
	On Tuesday, alleged CPM cadres descended on Santra village in Nanoor that had slipped out of the partys grip to terrorise people. A day before, CPM activists were accused of running riot in Khanakul.         
	Yesterday, while Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee addressed a rally in Arambagh, her alleged supporters chased CPM women activists holding a street-side meeting.        
	Chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti said he was unaware of Chidambarams conversation with Bhattacharjee. I dont know if Chidambaramji spoke to the chief minister on Arambagh. Nor did Bhattacharjee comment on it.         
	But Left Front chairman Biman Bose reacted sharply. I have not gone through what Chidambaram said. If he has advised the government to look after law and order, the state should follow it seriously. But I dont think the government is reluctant.... The Centre should also come out with all help the state wants.... The Centre should fulfil its obligation to stop the anarchy and violence perpetrated by the Trinamul-Maoist combine.         
	Trinamul leader Subrata Bakshi said the CPM was responsible for the violence in Arambagh. Chidambaramji is right that law and order has to be maintained by the chief minister. But here the chief minister is instigating CPM cadres against workers of Opposition parties, said Bakshi.

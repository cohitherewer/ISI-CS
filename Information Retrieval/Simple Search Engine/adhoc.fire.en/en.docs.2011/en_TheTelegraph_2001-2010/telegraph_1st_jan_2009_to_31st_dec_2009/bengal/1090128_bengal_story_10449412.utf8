	Malda, Jan. 27: A woman was killed in an Old Malda village last night allegedly after being branded a witch.     
	Arati Maddi, 35, was alone at home when attacked. Her husband works in Delhi. Her mother Churki said many villagers thought she was evil because she was childless eight years after marriage. Aratis in-laws, too, apparently suspected her of being a witch. No arrests had been made till late tonight.        
	Behrampore: Nineteen Bangladeshis, on their way home after a year in Gujarat, were caught in a border village in Murshidabad on Monday night. District police chief Basab Dasgupta said they belonged to six families from Rajsahi that went to Surat to work as labourers. The group had five children. They were trying to cross the border at Raninagar (250km from Calcutta), the officer added.

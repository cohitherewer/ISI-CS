                                                                                                               Poison krait in babies lunch 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Nalhati (Birbhum), June 12: A mother who had sat down for lunch with her two-year-old baby in her lap screamed out as a man scooped out steaming hot khichuri with a slimy black snake in it.        
	At least 50 children and five pregnant women were taken ill after Shantona Konai spotted the dead snake in her daughters meal at an anganwadi centre at Banior village in Nalhati, 300km from Calcutta.        
	All of them were released from hospital after being kept under observation for a few hours as they apparently did not show any sign of illness.         
	The districts chief medical officer, Sunil Bhowmik, said the reptile was the venomous Chite (common krait). But because it had been boiled, the poison got neutralised.        
	The centre run under the Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) feeds about 100 children up to three years of age and pregnant women every day. Today, 94 persons were supposed to have khichuri, boiled eggs and vegetables.        
	When the second batch was eating at 12.45pm, Shantona had the horror of her life.        
	Some of those having the meal at that moment started throwing up, some clutched their stomachs more out of apprehension than pain while others rushed to see the 18-inch snake, boiled to death along with the rice and dal and eggs and broken into pieces.         
	Among the curious onlookers were the cook and her helps. Supervisor Maya Konai, who has been on the job for two years, said sheepishly: I dont know how the snake entered the food.         
	Ambulances and rickshaw vans were summoned to take the ill to the Rampurhat Subdivisional Hospital, 4km away.         
	Subdivisional officer Amitava Sen said those who hadnt been hospitalised were also kept under observation.        
	New Birbhum MP Satabdi Roy visited the hospital and promised measures to improve standards of cooking and distribution of meals.        
	Debdwaipayan Chattopadhyay, a former chief surgeon of SSKM Hospital, confirmed what the Birbhum medical officer said: Snake venom loses potency if boiled.

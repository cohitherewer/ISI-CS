                                                                                                               Cops get life for encounter
                            
	Krishnagar, Feb. 3: A former officer-in-charge and a sub-inspector of Kalyani were today sentenced to life by a local court for a fake encounter killing in 1997.        
	Shankar Chatterjee, now a Nadia district intelligence officer, and sub-inspector Ajoy Roy had shot dead Khagen Majhi, 40, after telling him he could avoid arrest by paying Rs 25,000. Majhi was wanted for murder and heists.         
	On the night of April 29, 1997, the duo collected the money and two bottles of liquor from Majhis house in Kalyani, about 50km from Calcutta, and then took him to an abandoned factory shed, where he was shot. Police recorded it as an encounter and said the shooting was in self-defence.        
	An NGO had moved the human rights commission against the officers.

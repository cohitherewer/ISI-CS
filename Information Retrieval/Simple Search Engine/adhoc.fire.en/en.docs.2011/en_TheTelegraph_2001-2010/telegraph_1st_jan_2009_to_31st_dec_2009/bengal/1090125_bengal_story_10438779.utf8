The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | 18-year fetters
                                                                                                               18-year fetters
                            
	Howrah, Jan. 24: A man who was allegedly chained and confined to a room for 18 years by his family was rescued in a Howrah village today.        
	Police raided the house in Domjur, 20km from Calcutta, following a complaint by Mahadeb Pandits neighbours. His father Ramchandra and cousin Sahadeb, both day labourers, have been arrested.        
	Ramchandra said Mahadeb was kept in chains because he was mentally deranged and often tried to flee home, said BDO Sujoy Sarkar.        
	Mahadeb, 47, will be kept under observation in a hospital for two days.         
	Neighbours brought to light the alleged torture after so many years probably because of a rise in awareness, a policeman said. When the rescue team entered his room, the bearded and sickly Mahadeb was in shackles.

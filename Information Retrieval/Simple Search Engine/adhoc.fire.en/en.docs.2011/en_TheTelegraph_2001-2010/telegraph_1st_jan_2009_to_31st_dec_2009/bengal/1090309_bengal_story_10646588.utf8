The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Why should a girl study? The boy brings the money

	Krishnagunj (Nadia), March 8: Ashalata Biswas is heartbroken but cant speak up against her father, who made her quit school after she failed Class V.        
	Her father Kumar, a farm labourer who makes Rs 50 a day, says he didnt have a choice: Ashalata had to stop studies so her elder brother Sukdebs could go on.        
	The education of Sukdeb, who scored 89 per cent in last years Madhyamik from Shibnibash High School and is now a science student at Krishnagar Collegiate School, is more important to the family of six.         
	The 45-year-old father ar- gues that Ashalata, 13, the yo-ungest of the siblings and one who will eventually be marr-ied off, neednt study more. Sukdeb, likely to take care of the family, needs all the attention, and its money.         
	My daughter will be married off and it is my son who will ultimately run the family. So I asked Ashalata to quit school and put her in a tailors shop, says Kumar.         
	At Shibnibash village of Krishnagar, about 110km from Calcutta, Ashalata now earns Rs 20 a week doing the stitching jobs.        
	Kumar doesnt try to hide the fact that his sons college must take priority but chooses not to say that Ashalata, a student of the same school Sukdeb passed out from, didnt have four textbooks.         
	She failed in the subjects for which she didnt have the books: Bengali grammar and literature, English grammar and geography.        
	I cried a lot when my father and mother asked me not to go to school. But I couldnt make my family understand that I failed because I didnt have the four books. People wont believe I had only two exercise books. So, I was not surprised with my results, she says.        
	When she is not stitching clothes, Ashalata is busy in domestic chores. She sees her brother preparing for his examinations.         
	Sukdeb has recently got Rs 2,000 from a trust run by his former school. His father and brother provide him with around Rs 1,000 a month for four private tutors, training him for his higher secondary examinations in 2011 and medical and engineering entrance tests. He wants to be a doctor.        
	His father says: I need money for my family. I think my son will ensure that.        
	Ashalatas family isnt the only one. To many in Bengal, boys education gets a priority over that of girls. Often, the girls prefer not to speak up because they love their brothers.         
	Ashalata says she did not protest because she loved Sukdeb too much to grudge him the privilege. My father was only able to provide for his (Sukdebs) books. I am happy that he has come out with flying colours.        
	There are exceptions, too. Amita Mondals brother Naresh quit college to become a labourer in Mumbai so she could continue her studies.         
	Nineteen-year-old Naresh, from nearby Nakashipara, had secured 80 per cent in Madhyamik 2005 and 75 per cent in higher secondary two years later. The Telegraph had reported Nareshs sacrifice on July 29 last year.         
	Ashalatas mother Purnima says she did not want her to drop out of school initially but, after her sons impressive results, the family decided to throw in our lot behind Sukdeb.        
	Her eldest son Subrata quit after Madhyamik  he had second division  to help his father. Eldest daughter Supriya, who left in Class VII, was married off last year.        
	Purnima says she had approached the local panchayat member for help and requested the school to take the responsibility for Sukdebs education so Ashalata could continue. The schools help came, but it was possibly a case of too little too late.        
	Headmaster Shankar Biswas said the story of Sukdeb and Ashalata was pathetic.         
	We had helped the girl with some books. But we did not know the situation was so bad until Ashalata dropped out, he added.        
	Today is Womens Day. There must be hundreds of girls like Ashalata across India who turn women with their future almost entirely determined by the men around them.

                                                                                                               Techie rampage at exam centre
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          A glass door that was smashed. (Ganesh Chakraborty)                                   
	Durgapur, July 19: Over 400 engineering graduates went on the rampage in a Durga- pur school after realising it could seat only around half the 1,070 called to a SAIL job exam.        
	Following the rampage, during which the private sc-hools headmistress fainted, the test was cancelled at the centre. A fresh date will be announced tomorrow through media advertisements, said SAIL.        
	The exam for the recruitment of 400 management trainees (technical) in the public sector unit was held across the country today.         
	SAIL had invited the job applications through an external agency, which was also tasked with conducting the exam.         
	The candidates who arrived at Bidhan School for the 9.30am exam found the school authorities had made arrangements to seat only 600. The rest were asked to sit on moulded chairs and tables in an open veranda.        
	It was raining heavily and it was impossible to sit in the veranda. We paid Rs 525 as exam fee but were not provided proper sitting arrangement. We waited for 45 minutes and then came out in protest, said a candidate who did his BTech from the National Institute of Technology in Durgapur. Another, from Asansol Engineering College, said: Our answer scripts would have got wet.        
	Windowpanes were smashed, chairs and tables overturned and flowerpots tossed away in the 45-minute mayhem.         
	The examinees barged into the office of headmistress Ramanishi Pradhan and started thumping on her table demanding proper arrangements. Pradhan became nervous and fainted in her chair. She regained consciousness a while later and was taken home by colleagues.         
	Police rushed to the school and tried to pacify the examinees.         
	B.R. Kanungo, chief of communications at SAILs Durgapur plant, blamed the school. It is the duty of the school authorities to organise sitting arrangements. We have briefed our headquarters in Delhi.        
	The headmistress and the other teachers didnt say why the school had failed to make proper arrangements.

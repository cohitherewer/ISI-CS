The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CM surrender pinch to Cong
                                                                                                               CM surrender pinch to Cong
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, March 16: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today revealed the CPMs anger and disappointment with the Congress for cutting the deal with Mamata Banerjee.         
	Addressing Left Front workers at Salt Lake Stadium this evening, he said: What will I say about the Congress? Its workers themselves are feeling ashamed seeing their leaders surrender to Trinamul.         
	The chief minister accused the Congress of tying up with a party trying to destabilise the state and stall development. Trinamul is uniting all divisive forces, from Darjee- ling to areas close to Jharkhand. Theyre trying to split Bengal while we are trying to develop it. Let the people judge.        
	There is no going back on industrialisation, he suggested, but mentioned agriculture in the same breath. We have reached a point of no return in the pursuit of progress in industry, agriculture, education and health. Let us stand face to face and try out our strengths, he said to applause.         
	The party had tried to bring patriarch Jyoti Basu to the meeting to boost confidence in the cadres, low on morale after a series of setbacks since the rural polls last May. The 94-year-old could not make it.         
	In a video-recorded speech, Basu called the alliance immoral and anti-development and underlined the continuity of the Left governments policies from his term to Bhattacharjees  a bid to pre-empt criticism against his successor for having deviated from the fronts professed path.         
	Basu said the Left took the unthinkable decision to support the UPA to stop the BJP but severed ties after a Congress betrayal.

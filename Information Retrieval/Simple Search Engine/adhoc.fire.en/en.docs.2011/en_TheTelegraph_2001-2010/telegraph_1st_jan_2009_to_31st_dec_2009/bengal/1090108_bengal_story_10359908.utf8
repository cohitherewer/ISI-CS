          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Siliguri, Jan. 7: The body of Md Abdul Aziz, who was found dead at a hotel here yesterday, was handed over to his father by Siliguri police today.        
	The 16-year-old Bangladeshi boy was a Class X student of Delhi Public School here and the police suspect that he had committed suicide.         
	The post-mortem on the body was conducted at the North Bengal Medical College and Hospital.        
	Alhar Muhammad Shafi, the deceaseds father, said he did not know why the boy had taken such a drastic step. I was here last month with my wife Rokeya Begum and we had a nice time. When we went back to Bangladesh on December 20, we had no hint that our son would take such an extreme step within a few days, the inconsolable Shafi said on the premises of the Siliguri police station.         
	Shafi, who arrived here today with brother-in-law Md Ansarullah Mian, took the body to Chittagong.        
	Shafi, a member of the Chittagong Stock Exchange, said he had come to know about his sons death around 10.30am yesterday. Initially, he had no idea of what to do and how to react. Later, he informed his relatives and started fulfilling the formalities for the journey to India.        
	I have nothing against anyone and I consider this as my misfortune. I pray that such thing never happens to any other family, said Shafi.         
	S. Biswas, the transport organiser of Delhi Public School, was present at the police station. Aziz was good in sports. It is hard to believe that a student like him can kill himself, he said.         
	Mian said they had got full co-operation from the Indian government. We started from Chittagong around 4.30pm yesterday and reached Siliguri this morning, crossing the border at Changrabandha. Aziz was the youngest child of my brother-in-law. Osman Gani is his elder brother and Hasina Begum is younger sister.         
	On January 1, the body of Sayeri Bose, another student of the school, was found hanging at her flat in Deshbandhupara.         
	The 13-year-old had been found roaming around in a dazed state the previous day and had been brought to the police station from where she was sent home.        
	Both Sayeri and Aziz lived in private hostels.         
	The two suicides within five days has brought security in private hostels under scanner.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Colour code for morning walkers

	Calcutta, Jan. 24: Morning walkers should wear bright colours and drivers should have working lights and wipers to avoid accidents, Calcutta police said today, as the weather office issued a dense-fog warning.        
	The Met alert is for the next 48 hours, though there was dense fog this morning, too. The moisture over central India and Chhattisgarh has drifted towards Bengal, helped by a north-westerly wind, an official said.        
	The police have come up with suggestions for motorists and pedestrians to prevent accidents, which have already killed 58 people this season. The figure last winter was 63.        
	Poor visibility in the early morning is dangerous both for pedestrians and those in cars. By the time a driver realises that his wheels are going to crush a pedestrian, it is too late. We suggest people follow our advice, said deputy commissioner (traffic) Dilip Banerjee.        
	Motorists have been ad- vised to blow the horn before going through intersections and flash indicators before turning.         
	Drivers should switch on headlights during foggy weather, not keep them off to save on their batteries, as is often observed, the officer said.         
	Morning walkers would do well to wear bright colo- urs, especially red and pink, which are easy to spot from a distance, he added.         
	They should also avoid stepping on to the main roads. They should never come on the main road while jogging or walking, the deputy commissioner said.        
	Another officer warned that those who didnt take precautions would be prosecuted. There will be a special drive in the mornings. If we find a cars indicators or wipers not functioning, the driver will be prosecuted.        
	Almost a third of the winter accidents occur in the early hours and most of them because of fog.         
	On many occasions, drivers crash into the railing along the roads or climb on to the boulevard because of very poor visibility, an officer said.

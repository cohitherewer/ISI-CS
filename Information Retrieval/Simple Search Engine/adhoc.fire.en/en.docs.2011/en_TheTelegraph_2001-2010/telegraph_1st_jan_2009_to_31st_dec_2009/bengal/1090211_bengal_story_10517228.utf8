                                                                                                               3 years for hub kick-off
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 10: The Bengal government today said it would take some three years for construction to begin after the Centre gave its final nod to the Nayachar chemical hub.        
	The state government wants the project work to start in two to three years if the Union cabinet gives the clearance in the next few weeks. However, land filling, which will take a few months, can start with the approval. A layout is being prepared, on the basis of which work will begin, said industries secretary Sabyasachi Sen.        
	On the lines of the Haldia Development Authority, a new authority will be set up to monitor work on the project.        
	After an inter-ministerial panel gives a formal clearance to the project, it will be placed before the cabinet committee on economic affairs. An environment impact study, which will take a year, will follow.

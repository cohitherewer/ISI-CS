The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Arrest for Durgapur abduction
                                                                                                               Arrest for Durgapur abduction
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Durgapur, Jan. 4: A trader who allegedly has contacts with Calcutta call girls has been held in connection with the alleged kidnap of Durgapur businessman Santanu Mukherjee, who went missing from a pub where he went to party on the night of December 30.         
	Mukherjees new Honda City was found near Bokaro station in Jharkhand yesterday.        
	A police source said the kidnappers had called a relative of Mukherjee, 35, last night and demanded Rs 1.5 crore as ransom. Burdwan superintendent R. Rajsekharan declined comment on the amount.         
	Mukherjee, a fish wholesaler who also owns half-a-dozen dumper trucks and deals in iron ore, had allegedly spoken to a girl in a Calcutta red-light district before he went missing. It appears that she was involved in the kidnapping, said the SP. The abductors could have used the girl to lure him.        
	The man arrested is also a fish wholesaler, though not as big as Mukherjee.

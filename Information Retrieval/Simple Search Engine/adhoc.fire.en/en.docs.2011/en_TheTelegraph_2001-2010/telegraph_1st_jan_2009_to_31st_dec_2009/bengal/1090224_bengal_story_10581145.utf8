	Malda, Feb. 23: A woman was raped and 16 homes set afire in Kaliachak last night in a sequel to a rivalry between two groups over a game that was played on Saraswati Puja day.         
	Today, the deputy superintendent of police of Malda, Abhijit Banerjee, went to Rajnagar village about 35km from here, to hold an inquiry. No one has been arrested so far. However, there is tension in the area.        
	The Congress gram panchayat pradhan of Birnagar II, Mafiur Rehman, said on January 31  on the day Saraswati Puja was held  there was tremendous rivalry between the residents of Ghoshpara and Mondolpara. The people of Mondolpara attacked one of the youths belonging to the rival camp. They alleged that the youth, who was the winner of the game, had cheated with the help of other villagers. The youth was hacked with a chopper the next day. The people of Mondolpara fled the area fearing reprisals, the pradhan said.        
	On February 13, Maya Mondol, Helu Mondol, Chanchala Mondol  all residents of Mondolpara  had written to the police superintendent of Malda, seeking protection, said a local Congress leader, Jagadish Chowdhury. He said had the police reacted to the complaint, last nights incident would not have happened.        
	Yesterday evening, Binoy Ghosh, Uttam Ghosh and Anarul Haq entered the house of Premlal Mondol, but he was not there. They found his wife and gangraped her. They also took away whatever they could lay their hand on and set the house on fire, Jagadish alleged.        
	 He said the gang then proceeded to set some of houses, which were already deserted since the villagers had fled, on fire. While 11 huts were totally burnt, five were partially damaged in the blaze. The attackers then left the village.        
	Malda police chief Satyajit Banerjee said the senior officers were at the spot.         
	Some houses were set on fire in a Kaliachak village late last night. We have received a complaint that there was looting too. A woman has been raped, Banerjee said.        
	He said the woman had been sent to the district hospital for a medical examination. He added that it was a sequel to the violence that had rocked the village on Saraswati Puja.         
	There was an altercation between two groups of people on that day and one person was attacked with a chopper. The revenge act took place last night. We are trying to arrest those involved in the rape and the arson, but none of the accused are in the village, the officer said.        
	Banerjee said two fire engines were sent from Malda town to Rajnagar to fight the fire. The villagers also helped to put out the fire, he added.

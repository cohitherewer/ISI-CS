The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Union ministers on state duty
                                                                                                               Union ministers on state duty
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Mamata outside her house on Saturday. (Bishwarup Dutta)                                  
	Calcutta, May 23: No Trinamul Congress minister will stay in Delhi for more than two days a week.        
	My priority is Bengal, Mamata Banerjee told a large crowd in front of her Harish Chatterjee Street house on her return from Delhi this evening.         
	I have made it absolutely clear to my ministers (who will be sworn in a few days later) that they will have to spend five days a week in Bengal. The countrys new railway minister will do the same herself. For me, becoming a minister is not important, Mamata said. The maa, mati, manush of Bengal are more important.         
	At the airport, where hordes of supporters had gathered  and some even sneaked into the restricted area  Mamata had the same message. Ill work for the people of Bengal, she said as she literally pushed her way through the crowds.         
	On the way to her house, Mamata was stopped thrice by her supporters  in front of Haldirams on VIP Road, at Salt Lakes Sector V where even techies were in the crowd, and finally at the foot of No. 4 bridge on the Park Circus Connector. She did not step out but waved at the crowd.        
	After reaching home, she touched her mothers feet and asked for her blessings.

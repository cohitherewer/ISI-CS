The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Ploy to cover nexus: CPM
                                                                                                               Ploy to cover nexus: CPM
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Calcutta, Oct. 16: CPM leaders called todays siege of the chief ministers chamber by the Trinamul Congress a piece of drama to divert peoples attention from the increasing unity of purpose between the Congress-led Centre and Left-ruled Bengal on a planned crackdown against Maoists.        
	Mamata is getting unnerved as her hobnobbing with the Maoists is getting exposed. She now wants to subvert the anti-Maoist campaign by raising her bogey of complaints against us, said CPM state secretariat member Mohammad Salim.         
	According to him, the spate of Mamata Banerjees con-frontationist moves is also meant to reassure her supporters about the continuity of her brand of politics ahead of the 10 Assembly bypolls across the state on November 7.         
	CPM state secretary Biman Bose referred to the inconvenience caused to Calcuttans, caught unawares by Trinamuls sudden protests this evening, and urged people to defeat the forces of anarchy and terror.         
	Sources said the party was all geared up to try and drive a wedge between the Congress and Trinamul by harping on the latters Maoist links after chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee told leaders in North 24-Parganas yesterday that the Prime Minister appreciated the states concern about the Mamata-Maoist nexus.         
	The CPM has also decided to match Mamatas belligerent politics by asking its ranks to adopt a tit-for-tat policy. The CPMs recent armed resistance to a Maoist raid in West Midnapores Enayetpur was hailed by party leaders as the beginning of a new chapter.         
	Leaders like Anil Basu, Shyamal Chakraborty and Salim in Hooghly and Sushanta Ghosh and Dipak Sarkar in West Midnapore yesterday exhorted cadres to give a fitting reply to the Trinamul-Maoist combine.         
	Organised resistance will continue because our workers and supporters have the right to self-defence, Salim said.         
	Bose said the pre-planned sit-in by leader of the Opposition Partha Chatterjee was aimed at encouraging further fascist-like attacks on Left parties across the state.         
	Bose has written to the chief electoral officer alleging that Trinamul minister Mukul Roy and MP Subhendu Adhikari have violated the model code of conduct by turning up at an election rally in Serampore, Hooghly, in cars with beacons and demanding the heads of CPM leaders.         
	The CPM also defended its leaders public criticism of a section of police. With Mamata Banerjee and her men now part of the central government, some in the police have started behaving like weathercocks. We must remind them that we are still in power here, said a CPM veteran.

                                                                                                               Kids rally for Sir
                              Kundu. (Gour Sharma)                            
	Durgapur, Aug. 25: Students who had started loving math because of their teacher or idolised him sat on the road in Durgapur today because he had been transferred.        
	Nandakumar Kundu, the assistant headmaster of Ichhamati NC High School, has got a promotion. He will be the headmaster of another school in the same block.        
	But Kundu, 42, wasnt sure if he should be happy as students armed with placards saying Sir, we wont let you go stood at the school gates.         
	Beauty Chatterjee of Class XI said it was because of Kundu that none of her friends was scared of math.         
	To Sheikh Zahirul Alam of Class X, Kundu was a friend. Friend, philosopher and guide, he insisted. Sir monitored our performance in class and told us individually what to do. He was never irritated or angry, even if we failed to understand something.        
	Sunil Mukherjee of Class VII was crying. Two years ago, when he almost fell unconscious in school, Kundu had carried him in his arms to the local health centre and sat there until the boy felt better.        
	The teacher was a tad overwhelmed. I have been in this school for 20 years but never realised I was so loved. I dont know what to do, he said.         
	The inspector of schools said Kundu could stay back if he wished to but wouldnt get the promotion.

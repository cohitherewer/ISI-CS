                                                                        Thursday , November 19 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                              Trinamul friends at work to dissuade Suman
          BARUN GHOSH                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 18: Trinamul MP Kabir Suman today indicated that his problems with his party were in the process of being resolved by saying it was possible to sort out the differences.         
	I have no problems with Mamata Banerjee. To my mind, it is possible to resolve the differences that have cropped up. I dont want Mamata to be hurt or a shadow to be cast over her, Suman said this morning after a meeting last night with some Trinamul-backed authors, activists and artists led by painter Suvaprasanna.        
	I know amar dalanetri (my party leader, referring to Mamata) would speak to me at an appropriate time to put things in the right perspective, Suman added.         
	Author Mahasweta Devi initiated the dialogue between the Jadavpur MP and the party to take the process forward and persuade him to join the Parliament session starting tomorrow. Suman had yesterday vowed to skip it.         
	She invited Suman to her residence this afternoon at the behest of Mamata, now in Delhi. I had invited Suman for talks to resolve the issues that he had raised. I am convinced there would be no problems with him henceforth, she told The Telegraph tonight.         
	The one-to-one with Suman was preceded by a four-hour huddle in which Suvaprasanna, poet Joy Goswami, environmentalist Kalyan Rudra and socialist scientist Asokendu Dasgupta were present.        
	Realising that things were going out of control, we went to Sumans place around 8 last night. We left only when he was convinced he would not be sidelined in the party and that Mamata did not mean any insult when she referred to him as a guest. He assured us he would join the Lok Sabha in a few days, Suvaprasanna said.        
	I called Mamata past midnight to convey what transpired at the meeting. Mamata said she would speak to Suman in a day or two, he added.        
	Today, Trinamul minister Mukul Roy claimed from Delhi that things had been sorted out. He will attend Parliament from Monday. Our friends ironed out the differences.        
	According to Suvaprasanna, Suman had admitted that he should not have gone public against party leaders from South 24-Parganas.         
	But how would the issues Suman raised be resolved?        
	According to those present at last nights meeting, a three-pronged plan has been worked out. First, Trinamul leaders like South 24-Parganas party president Sovan Chatterjee and Bhangar MLA Arabul Islam will not interfere in the disbursement of money from the MPs development fund. Suman had resented the manner in which they had been dictating terms to him.         
	Second, Mamata will herself supervise the allotment of funds henceforth. Third, the party will involve the MP in its programmes so he does not feel sidelined.

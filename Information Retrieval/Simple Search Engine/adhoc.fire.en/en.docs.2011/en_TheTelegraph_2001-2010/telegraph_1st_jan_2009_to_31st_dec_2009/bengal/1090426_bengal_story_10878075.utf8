The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Being CPM on rebel turf
                                                                                                               Being CPM on rebel turf
  - Party machinery put to test in guerrilla pocket        SUJAN DUTTA                          Slain CPM supporter Shaktipada Sens wife at Nadariya village in Lalgarh. (Swarup Mondal)                                        
	Road to Nadariya        
	A drop of orange ice lolly rolls down Hablu Khans hairy paunch when he draws it in to ask where we are headed.         
	Khan is in charge of the barricade on the road from Midnapore to Goaltore. Behind him stones are placed across the tar road.         
	He notes the number of the vehicle, sticks a mobile phone between his shoulder and his left ear and crosschecks with the barricade we have left behind  where his comrades checked the press card. Things in order, he asks his cronies, to let us pass.        
	Are you sure this is enough, there wont be any further trouble, what about police?         
	Hanh, he says and licks the lolly, melting fast at 42 degrees. The police are mine, he says. The stones are removed and we drive through.        
	On Tuesday, Trinamul Congress workers were nearly killed in Keshpur. Mamata made a big issue of it but there is nary a protest here.         
	When we were in Baromessa (Keshpur), a CPM worker was beaten to death in Nadariya (Lalgarh) and on Thursday, the party called for a protest  the barricades are in response to that call.         
	This is the party machinery at work. The Trinamul has none of note in these parts.        
	Dissent isnt new to Bengal, to Midnapore, to Keshpur, to Jhargram. Discipline is old. And it is always the CPMs. Come April 30, it is this party machinery that will be at work to ensure the turnout that Bengal is famous for. Not Mamatas.         
	Simply put: she has none here. But others do. And they arent contesting the elections.              
	Nadariya        
	CPM activist Shaktipada Sen was killed here. Ranjit Singh, his comrade, is fighting for his life. Hambir Mandi, a CPI activist, was dragged out of his house  he did not go to attend a meeting called by Maoists  and was beaten to death on Tuesday.        
	A day later, there is a deathly silence. In Nadariya, the CPM machinery has been overcome. Trees have been felled to block four-wheelers from entering.         
	At Babuibasha, a few kilometres before, there are CPM and Congress graffiti  in support of their Jhargram candidates  Pulin Behari Baske and Amrit Hansda. There are also printed posters of the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities.         
	At the entrance to Nadariya, there are two announcements. One official, the other is chilling.        
	The first: The kuchcha road has been made possible from the Prime Ministers funds. The amount sanctioned was Rs 1.5 lakh at least 48 people were employed.        
	Next to it, an unsigned leaflet pinned on the stem of a date palm tree. Boycott the vote in jungle land, it is headlined. The water, the land, the forests are ours, do not sell them to this eras kenarams and becharams (traders), it says.        
	There is no one on the red mud road that cuts through the village. The dogs bark out the presence of a stranger. They bring out the people who go scurrying back into their houses. Nobody wants to talk to reporters. Nobody even wants to offer water to drink. A woman offers a glass, points to a handpump and says: You can take water from there.         
	In Bengals countryside today, every stranger is a suspect. Even in Babuibasha, they had pointed to the handpump.         
	Gathering information in a village a day after political murders is more difficult. But two families talk. The elderly women plead that they are not identified. This is their story.        
	Nadariya has 80 and 90 households, almost equally divided between tribals and Bengalis. The tribals are mostly Santhals. Among the Bengalis are Kumhars, Tantis, Mals, Telis and Goylas. The panchayat member is a tribal, Nagendra Hansda. The Jhargram seat is also reserved for tribals.         
	Shortly before noon on Tuesday, about 30 (mostly men but, in some accounts, also some women), came to the village from the jungle. At least six of them were carrying rifles or pistols. They split into groups and went house to house.         
	They revisited the houses of CPM workers and repeatedly asked the families to ensure that the partymen attended the meeting to be held at two in afternoon under a big tree outside the village.        
	By two, nearly 200 men and women had gathered. Of the 30, about five or six were, what the villagers say, educated. They lectured the villagers on 32 years of oppression by the CPM, but did not ask them to vote for any party. They asked the villagers to form committees of 10 men and 10 women in each locality, with whom they would keep in touch.         
	They also warned that if you go to the police or give shelter to the Harmaad Bahini (the lingo used to describe CPM-led goons) we wont pardon you.        
	While the meeting was on, one group went around the village looking for Left workers who had not turned up. That is how they found Hambir.         
	The hit list the band went around with included other names: among them, Singh and Sen, who were at the meeting but were dragged to the bamboo grove.         
	Each one on the list was accused of being agents of the CPM and traitors who had supplied information to the police. Some of them had fled their village hearing about the meeting.        
	Asked if the Maoists have influence in the village a day later, the residents said: How could they have so much inside information if they did not already have people who keep in touch with them? Can they identify anyone? No.        
	Nadariya does not know if it will vote. The leaflet stuck on the date palm tree has not been removed.

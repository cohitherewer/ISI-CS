The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Russia to build nuke power plant in Bengal
                                                                                                               Russia to build nuke power plant in Bengal
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 17: Russias state-owned Atomstroyexport will build Indias first nuclear power station in Bengal for which the Nuclear Power Corporation hopes to begin civil construction activities by 2010, a senior NPC official said today.         
	The NPC had more than two years ago picked Haripur in East Midnapore among new sites for nuclear power stations with foreign collaboration made possible by Indias nuclear pacts with the US and the International Atomic Energy Agency.         
	The government had announced earlier this month that Russia would help build a nuclear power station at Haripur, while US companies would be involved in nuclear plants at new sites in Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat.         
	The NPC has already signed an agreement with a French company to build 1,600mw unit nuclear power plants at Jaitapur in western Maharashtra.         
	The NPC plans to build two 1000mw power plants in Haripur. We hope to begin the civil works in 2010 and complete the construction within five years, said Sudhinder Thakur, executive director of NPC. At each of these sites, we may follow up with additional two to four reactors, depending on the site potential.         
	Atomstroyexport has already helped India build two 1,000mw reactors at Kudankulam in Tamil Nadu, which are currently in advanced stages of construction.         
	NPC officials had earlier said Haripur was considered a good site because it met the technical criteria for selection and it had a relatively low population density compared to the rest of the state.         
	India currently has 17 operating nuclear reactors with an installed capacity of a little over 4,100mw nuclear electricity. But six reactors are under construction, including the 500mw prototype fast breeder reactor.         
	The NPC has also signed agreements with US companies Westinghouse and GE, but has not decided which would work in Kovada and which one in Gujarat.         
	If all goes according to plan, the NPC hopes to add 6,000mw to 8,000mw of installed nuclear electricity capacity through the four new sites between 2015 and 2016.

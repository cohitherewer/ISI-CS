The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Sen reveals govt land fix
                                                                                                               Sen reveals govt land fix
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, July 14: The government today laid bare its helplessness on land acquisition for industry, saying critics were blaming it either for being slow or too fast.         
	In his reply to the debate on the industry budget, minister Nirupam Sen told the Assembly: We are faced with a strange situation. If our government takes a long time in acquiring land companies leave the state. The government had tried to make the acquisition process in Singur as fast as possible but the company decided to close shop amid the Oppositions allegations that everything had been done through coercion.        
	He elaborated on the problem: Tata Metaliks had asked us to get land for their unit in Kharagpur. We began scouting for it, prices soared and the company didnt want to buy it at the high price. By that time four years had passed and the company decided to leave. We were blamed for going slow.        
	In Singur, it was the opposite. The Trinamul Congress was successful (in the polls) as the Singur agitation served its political interests and paid dividends. But the image of the state was tarnished and job opportunities were lost.        
	The industries minister iterated that the ideal role of the state was as a facilitator of deals between plot owners and investors but its intervention was essential when a huge amount of land was involved. This is because the government cant allow landowners or farmers to be left at the mercy of land sharks.        
	The state is working on a policy on compensation and rehabilitation of those who lose land or livelihood because of acquisition but that, he added, has to be on a case to case basis.        
	Leader of Opposition Partha Chatterjee told the minister to publish a white paper on the nature and amount of land the government had taken over for industries in the past three years. Then we will know how much of agriculture the government has destroyed.        
	Sen did not respond to that. Replying to Opposition queries on the proposed chemical hub on Nayachar island, he said the fate of the project hinged entirely on the Centres environment clearance.

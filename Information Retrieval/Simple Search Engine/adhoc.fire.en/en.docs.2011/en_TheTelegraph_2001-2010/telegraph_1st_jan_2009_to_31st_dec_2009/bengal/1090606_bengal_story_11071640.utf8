The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Civic election misses LS ties 
                                                                                                               Civic election misses LS ties 
          BARUN GHOSH                              
	Calcutta, June 5: The Congress-Trinamul Congress alliance, which reaped a rich harvest in last months Lok Sabha elections, has not worked out in 12 of the 15 municipalities going to polls this month.        
	We have not been able to firm up the alliance despite our sincere efforts because of Trinamuls decision to field candidates against our people, state Congress working president Subrata Mukherjee said after the deadline for withdrawing nominations passed this afternoon.        
	Bengal Congress president Pranab Mukherjee has called a meeting of state party general secretaries tomorrow.         
	Trinamul blamed the Congresss demand for more seats for the lack of understanding. Our leaders in the districts had tried their best, but the Congress did not co-operate and continued to press for more seats, state party president Subrata Bakshi said.        
	Mamata Banerjee, Trinamul sources said, has expressed her unhappiness about the development to Pranab.         
	Besides the 15 municipalities, the Siliguri Mahakuma Parishad is going to polls on June 28. Nineteen local bodies were supposed to be elected but the polls would not be held in Darjeeling, Kurseong and Kalimpong because no one filed nominations there under threats from the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha, which has been demanding a separate state.        
	In Mal (Jalpaiguri) and Kaliaganj and Islampur (North Dinajpur), the allies are fighting each other in all 49 wards.        
	Trinamul has hardly any presence in Kaliaganj and Islampur and that is why we had offered two seats to them (out of 34). They declined the offer, said district Congress president Mohit Sengupta.        
	Trinamuls Tilak Chowdhury blamed local Congress MP Deepa Das Munshi for scuttling the alliance. She is the one behind the Congress-Trinamul fight. She had also opposed the alliance before the Lok Sabha polls, he alleged.        
	In North 24-Parganas, the allies are pitted against each other in a majority of the seats in Dum Dum, South Dum Dum, Madhyamgram and Rajarhat-Gopalpur.         
	In Dankuni  a new civic body on the fringes of Calcutta  the allies are contesting each other in all 19 seats.         
	The alliance, however, has survived in South 24-Parganas Maheshtala and Rajpur-Sonarpur, and Egra in East Midnapore. In Burdwans Asansol, the two have struck a deal on most seats.

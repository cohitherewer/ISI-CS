The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Routed, CPMs allies cry for unity
                                                                                                               Routed, CPMs allies cry for unity
          BISWAJIT ROY                              
	Calcutta, Jan. 12: The Forward Bloc and the RSP appear to have brushed aside their differences with the CPM, realising after the rout in Nandigram that the Lok Sabha polls could be difficult.         
	The allies had spurned the CPMs call for unity during the anti-land acquisition protests in Singur and Nandigram and held the Big Brothers industrialisation overdrive responsible for the violence.         
	However, the Trinamul Congresss victory margin of over 39,000 in last weeks Nandigram byelection and the fronts setbacks since the rural polls last May must have left the allies worried about their own prospects.        
	Bloc veteran Ashok Ghosh expressed his worries about the tough fights ahead and likely loss of a few seats at a party central committee meeting that ended yesterday.        
	Unlike on earlier occasions, the communiqu on the meeting mentioned every issue, from Gaza to Mumbai, but not Singur and Nandigram.        
	Party general secretary Debabrata Biswas insisted that Left unity was important in the interest of the state as well as the country.         
	Nandigram, he said, was an aberration. It would not affect the polling pattern in the rest of the state. People will realise that (Trinamul chief) Mamata Banerjees politics is headless politics.        
	RSP Rajya Sabha MP Abani Roy joined the unity chorus. This time, the Left parties should iron out their differences at the local level.        
	RSP and CPM supporters have been engaged in violent clashes in South 24-Parganas since the rural polls.        
	The Left has 35 of the 42 Lok Sabha seats from Bengal. The RSP, CPI and the Bloc hold nine of them.

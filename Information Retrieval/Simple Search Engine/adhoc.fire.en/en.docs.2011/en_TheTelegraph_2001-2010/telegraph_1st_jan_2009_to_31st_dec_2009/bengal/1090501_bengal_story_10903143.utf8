The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Rivals swap   unfair poll slur
                                                                                                               Rivals swap   unfair poll slur
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Calcutta, April 30: The Left and the Opposition today traded charges of unfair polling in complaints that centred on the Darjeeling, Ghatal and Jhargram constituencies.        
	Left Front chairman Biman Bose alleged that Gorkha Janmukti Morcha supporters did not allow CPM polling agents to move around in the hills, but stopped short of demanding repolls. Jaswant Singh is the Morcha-backed BJP candidate there.         
	The polls in the hills were not free and fair. How could the voting percentage go up despite showers since morning? Why did the voting end at 4pm while people in the plains were waiting in queues till evening? Bose asked.        
	In Malda North, Bose claimed that an election agent of the CPMs Sailen Sarkar was manhandled. He did not give details. Mausam Noor is the Congress nominee from the seat.        
	In south Bengals Ghatal constituency, Boses allegation was not about a CPM worker, but about a presiding officer being slapped by Trinamul candidate Nure Alam Chowdhury.        
	Bose turned on the poll panel, too, suggesting it had not done enough to get voters out of homes in the Maoist-infested West Midnapore, Bankura and Purulia.        
	Lalgarh, part of the Jhargram seat, was cited as an example. The Election Commission took so much pain (to ensure smooth polls) during its discussions (with the anti-CPM Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities). So it should have made proper arrangements (to ferry Lalgarh vo- ters to booths outside the troubled area), Bose said.        
	For Mamata Banerjee, the problems were in Keshpur and Garbeta, both in the Ghatal constituency.         
	She alleged that home guards, instead of central forces, were deployed to help CPM cadres rig the polls.         
	AICC general secretary K. Keshava Rao has brought the matter to the notice of Election Commission, she added.         
	State Congress working president Pradip Bhattacharya, echoed Mamata. The elections turned out to be a farce in Keshpur and Garbeta after CPM men rigged the polls.

  - Pranab in Bengal with one eye on Mamata, another on Marxists        BARUN GHOSH                              Pranab and Mamata: Will they strike a deal?				                                       
	Calcutta, Jan. 23: Sonia Gandhis decision to pick foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee as the Bengal Congress chief ahead of the Lok Sabha elections was prompted by three key factors, AICC sources said today.        
	First, she was disturbed after being told about a spurt in factionalism in the beleaguered organisation in the wake of Priya Ranjan Das Munshis hospitalisation.        
	Less than a fortnight ago, a state Congress team had called on Sonia to complain that the 11 PCC general secretaries were squabbling among themselves as working presidents Pradip Bhattacharya and Subrata Mukherjee had failed to define their assignments.         
	Das Munshi, who was appointed state party chief in February 2008, has been out of office since last September.         
	Madam (Sonia) was dis- turbed to hear from us that the general secretaries were sitting idle as our two working presidents had failed to properly distribute jobs to them in the districts. Their failure led to fights among ourselves, said a general secretary.         
	Subrata blamed lack of co-ordination between him and Bhattacharya for the failure to assign tasks.        
	Second: the Congress president put Pranab on top after receiving feelers that Mamata Banerjee would not talk to state-level leaders for a tie-up.         
	Bhattacharya said: We had informed Sonia that Mamata was only willing to talk to senior AICC leaders about an alliance. We hope Mamata will now agree to talk to a senior leader like Pranabda.         
	Another Bengal Congress leader said Mamatas relations with Pranabda had turned cordial after she called on him thrice in Delhi and Calcutta.         
	The third reason for Pranabs appointment was apparently Sonias desire to keep the door ajar for a possible post-poll understanding with the Left.        
	Pranabdas relations with the state CPM leadership have remained warm even after the Left withdrew support to the UPA government over the Indo-US nuke deal. Less than a week ago, Pranabda lambasted the Trinamul chiefs agitation against land acquisition for industry without naming her, a party leader said.        
	Sources said Pranabs immediate headache would be to decide whether to back Mamatas candidate or field a party nominee for the February 26 bypoll to the Bishnupur West Assembly seat.         
	Pranabda will chair the PCC executive committee here on February 7 to discuss a possible alliance with Mamata. A decision to field a consensus candidate for Bishnupur will lay the ground for an understanding with Mamata during the Lok Sabha elections, a Congress leader said.        
	Mamata announced her candidate for the bypoll (in South 24-Parganas) tonight. Trinamul youth wing chief Madan Mitra, who had contested the seat and lost to the CPM in 2006, has been renominated.        
	Although Mamata was not available for comment on Pranabs appointment as state Congress chief, a Trinamul general secretary said: Didi has conveyed to some of her aides that she does not have a problem in discussing a seat-sharing deal with Pranab Mukherjee if she is invited for talks.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Dakshineswar vigil after Diwali bomb scare
                                                                                                               Dakshineswar vigil after Diwali bomb scare
                                          
	Devotees queueing at the Dakshineswar temple compound on Saturday were frisked by army personnel after Calcutta police got a bomb threat in an email.        
	The police arrested 27-year-old BPO employee Arup Karmakar in the afternoon from his Howrah home for sending the email. The email was a hoax.        
	But those who had gone for puja on the morning of Diwali faced a thorough search.        
	The army personnel scanned the crowds, checked the dalas (small baskets of flowers and sweets for the goddess) with metal detectors and joined the police in searching all the vehicles arriving at the temples parking lot.         
	All visitors were told to enter through a metal detector door.                   
	Achinta Das, a Dakshineswar committee member, said: We asked visitors not to use mobile phones and even not to take pictures.         
	Karmakar, police sources said, had just come out of jail after he was arrested on the charge of beating up his wife.         
	He was released on September 28 after a month in prison.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Siliguri, Feb. 23: An injured makna (male elephant without tusks) roaming the forest of Apalchand near Malbazar has put the forest staff on alert.         
	The 9.5ft tall elephant is around 30-35 years old and has been spotted in Compartment IV of the forest, 50km from here, with injuries on its left knee and shoulder.        
	We had informed the wildlife wing which sent us two trained elephants and two vets, said Sailesh Anand, the divisional forest officer of Baikunthapur.         
	Yesterday, Anupam Rakshit and Sweta Mondal, the vets, accompanied by the foresters and two kunkis brought from Gorumara National Park, had scoured the forest till they spotted the animal.        
	The national park is around 25km from Baikunthapur.        
	They approached the injured elephant and checked its wounds. The injuries are two-three months old and have nearly healed, Anand said.         
	There was no puss or blood and they also checked its dung which was normal. The vets have suggested some medicines and said the animal did not need to be tranquillised for treatment, he added.        
	The medicines would have to be administered orally thrice or four times a day and the elephant kept under observation for the next one week, the vets said.         
	Our men have been instructed to mix medicines with fodder. It is a tough job but the elephant is helping us in that it is moving within a 1km or so. We also have information that it is not limping right now, Anand said.        
	Wildlife NGOs are satisfied with the foresters initiative, but had a word of caution.         
	Officials are keeping the elephant under observation and also offering it medicine. But at no point of time should they become indifferent, said Sujit Das, the secretary of the Odlabari Nature and Adventure Society.

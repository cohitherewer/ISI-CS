          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Dhaniakhali (Hooghly), Feb. 22: A group of men came looking for a CPM leader in a tribal pocket of Hooghly and set his four-year-old daughter and wife ablaze when they did not find him this evening.        
	Little Sumana was declared dead at the Chinsurah Imambara Hospital. Her mother Jharna, 22, is battling death.        
	Police said the assailants poured petrol on the two and set them afire at Goborhara village, 55km from Calcutta.        
	Panchayat member Loncho Mandi, 32, had gone to the bazaar when the attackers came around 6.45pm.        
	Local CPM leaders said the Jharkhand Desam Party, which has grown in influence in the tribal-dominated areas of the district in the past few months, was behind the murders. We know the killers were from the Jharkhand Desam Party. The police must track them down, said Rupchand Pal, the party MP from Hooghly.        
	District police chief Rajeev Mishra said: We know 10-12 men entered Loncho Mandis house around 6.45pm, poured petrol on his wife and daughter and set them on fire. But it cannot be said for certain that they were Desam Party activists. We have got four names and a probe is on.        
	The CPM has called a 12-hour bandh in Dhaniakhali block on Tuesday.        
	Local Desam Party secretary Lakkhi Mandi said the deaths could have been accidental. Maybe the fire started while they were lighting lamps. We doubt whether anybody attacked them.

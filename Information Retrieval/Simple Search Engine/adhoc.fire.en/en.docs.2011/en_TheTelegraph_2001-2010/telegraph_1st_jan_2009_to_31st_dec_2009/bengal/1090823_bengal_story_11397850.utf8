          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Burdwan, Aug. 22: Six higher secondary students in Burdwan were today expelled from school for drinking alcohol during class hours on the premises.         
	Iswar Chandra, headmaster of Vidyarthi Boys High School, said seven students of Classes XI and XII were caught drinking in a garden on July 14.        
	We have rusticated six students and suspended another boy after a thorough probe. We took time to probe the matter before taking such a harsh decision because it involves the reputation of our school, Chandra said.        
	The expelled boys are Dipak Das, Subham Guha and Suman Das of Class XI and Soumya Adhikari, Swarup Mondal and Sudip Burman of Class XII.        
	Prasenjit Das of Class XI, who had confessed to the offence, has been suspended for three months. The school handed a lighter punishment to Prasenjit because he confessed to the act in a letter. The six others denied the charges, Chandra said.        
	The authorities said assistant headmaster Ramkrishna Garai, while taking a stroll on the premises on the afternoon of July 14, caught the seven drinking.         
	All seven were brought to the headmasters room. An empty bottle was found on one of them. A blood test on the students confirmed that they had been drinking alcohol, said a teacher.         
	Soumya, one of the six expelled boys, denied the allegation today.         
	We were not drinking in the garden. We were studying in a secluded spot because we had no classes at that time, he said.

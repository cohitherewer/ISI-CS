The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Bloc pinch to Buddha
                                                                                                               Bloc pinch to Buddha
                            
	Calcutta, April 20: Forward Bloc leader Ashok Ghosh today seemed to suggest Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had ordered the Nandigram police firing that left 14 people dead, gifting fresh ammunition to Mamata Banerjee and raising eyebrows in the CPM.        
	The chief minister has admitted at a Left Front meeting that he had committed a mistake by ordering the police firing, Ghosh said and went on to laud Bhattacharjee for the admission.         
	The Opposition seized on the part of the statement that referred to the order to fire. Mamata said Ghosh was right but unfortunately, they (CPM allies) become one after saying all this.        
	The CPM said chief min- isters do not issue orders on the field. I will speak to Ashokda. Nowhere does a chief minister personally order firing. Officials present at the spot do that, CPM state secretary Biman Bose said.        
	It was not clear whether the 86-year-old Ghosh meant the chief minister had personally ordered the firing or that the overall security operation had the approval of Bhattacharjee. Asked, Ghosh did not shed more light.

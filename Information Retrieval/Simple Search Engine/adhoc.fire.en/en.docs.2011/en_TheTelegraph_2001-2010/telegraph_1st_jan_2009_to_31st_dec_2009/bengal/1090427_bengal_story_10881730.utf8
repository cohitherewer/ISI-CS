The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Police run out of ration
                                                                                                               Police run out of ration
                            
	Midnapore, April 26: A police camp in Salboni might have to be wound up because local tribals are not allowing the personnel to buy essentials from bazaars in the area.        
	The policemen havent been able to buy any provision for four days. If this goes on, well have to close the camp, West Midnapore police chief Manoj Verma said. The personnel are also being prevented from travelling 10km to Goaltore for the stuff. The camp, set up to combat Maoists, is 15km from Lalgarh, the epicentre of the tribal resistance allegedly being guided by the rebels.

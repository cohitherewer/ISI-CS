	Calcutta, March 18: Four CPM leaders were killed today  two in Maoist-infested Belpahari and the others in Burdwan and Behrampore.        
	Local committee member Durgapada Deshwali, 45, and branch committee secretary Santosh Mahato, 40, were shot dead by masked men while sipping tea in a stall at a Belpahari bus stand this evening.        
	They took several bullets. Comrade Palaram Deshwali, 35, was hit in the leg, said the partys West Midnapore leader, Dahareswar Sen.         
	The trio were on their way home to a nearby village after a party meeting. The audacity of the strike, Sen said, suggested a Maoist hand.        
	On the outskirts of Behrampore, Murshidabad, a local committee secretary was killed by helmeted men who came on motorcycles.         
	Gopal Mondal, 48, was walking towards a local club to play cards after lunch with his daughter, an HS examinee, when the goons pulled up next to him, opened fire, hurled bombs and fled.        
	His partner at the cards table, tea stall owner Shibu Sarkar, saw the attack from behind a tree.        
	A clash with Trinamul Congress supporters left Mir Sairab Ali Dewan, 48, dead in Burdwans Raina.         
	A police officer said bombs hurled at a CPM election meeting from a Trinamul procession triggered the clash.

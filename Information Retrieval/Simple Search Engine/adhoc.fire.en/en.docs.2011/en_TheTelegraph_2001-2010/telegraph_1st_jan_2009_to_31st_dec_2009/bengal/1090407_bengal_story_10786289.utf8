The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Ball in poll panel court
                                                                                                               Ball in poll panel court
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, April 6: The government has fallen back on the Election Commission to carry out a spot inspection of Lalgarh and submit its views, reflecting the indecisiveness in the administration since the Nandigram fiasco and an undeclared reliance on a constitutional body once reviled by the CPM.        
	After a meeting with the chief minister and the chief secretary at Writers Buildings, home secretary Ardhendu Sen said: We have made our stand clear  police presence in Lalgarh is a must for peaceful and fair polls. However, we have requested the EC to send Bengals chief electoral officer or any other senior official to find out the exact situation as they need to know the ground realities there.         
	The EC official can talk to political parties, those in the district administration and also the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities to form an impression of its own. Accordingly, the EC can instruct us on what steps should be taken to ensure peaceful polls in Lalgarh, he added.        
	The police bid to regain control of Nandigram had burnt Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees fingers. Fourteen people were killed on March 14, 2007.        
	Wiser after Nandigram, the government has pushed the ball to the poll panels court. If the apolitical commission finds a solution in Lalgarh, the government can breathe easy. If the panel concludes that force is the only option, the government can then say that it is merely implementing the commissions recommendation and try to cushion the impact of any untoward incident.        
	The same Election Commission had earned the CPMs wrath by announcing a five-phase Assembly election in 2006 and banning poll graffiti.         
	Much has changed since. The CPM has welcomed the split Lok Sabha polls and, apparently under pressure from political parties, the panel has allowed wall writing with owners consent.        
	But the home secretary said: Its not a case of shifting responsibilities. Our stand is that the police must move into Lalgarh for the parliamentary elections to be held. Similarly, we want the EC to have its views, on the basis of which the state government can act.        
	Sen met the chief electoral officer and briefed him. The electoral officer later said: We are keeping track of the developments in Lalgarh and the EC has been kept posted on that. He declined comment on whether he would go to Lalgarh.

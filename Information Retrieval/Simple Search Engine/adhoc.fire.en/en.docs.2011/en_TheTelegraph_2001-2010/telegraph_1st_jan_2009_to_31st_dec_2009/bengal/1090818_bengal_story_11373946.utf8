The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CPM leader shot
                                                                                                               CPM leader shot
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Canning, Aug. 17: A CPM leader was killed today in a Trinamul Congress-dominated South 24-Parganas pocket he often visited to meet party colleagues.        
	Police said four youths pumped bullets into Madar Mollah near Cannings Ghutiari Sarif station, 2km from his Narayanpur village where he was a CPM local committee member. Like other days, the 65-year-old man, a former gram panchayat pradhan, had come to meet party workers at Ghutiari Sarif, around 60km from Calcutta, when he was shot.         
	Mollahs Narayanpur is controlled by the CPM but Ghutiari Sarif became a Trinamul stronghold after the party snatched the adjoining Harda panchayat in last years rural polls.         
	Mollahs daughter-in-law Rukia, the Narayanpur panchayat pradhan now, alleged that Trinamul activists targeted her father-in-law after he refused to give Rs 30,000 (to their party fund) a fortnight ago. Trinamul activists had kept him confined to a room for nearly an hour demanding the money. He was rescued by our party activists, she said.         
	Assistant superintendent of police Nishat Pervez said Mollah was first rushed to the Canning subdivisional hospital, 4km from the spot. He was referred to a Calcutta hospital but was declared dead on arrival this evening. One person has been detained for interrogation, Pervez said.        
	Santimoy Bhattacharya, the CPM district secretary, blamed local Trinamul workers for the murder. Trinamul district chief Arup Bhadra dubbed the murder a fallout of CPM infighting.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                      A villager rsquo;s bike floats in a pond in Durmuth, Mangalkot, after police action. (Arup Sengupta)                           
	Burdwan, July 16: A police lathicharge and tear gas offensive allegedly killed a farm labourer in a Mangalkot village today.        
	The police, whose intention was to break a bamboo road block set up by Congress supporters, said 38-year-old Jiabur Rahman Mondal died of heart attack in Durmuth village after a tear gas shell burst too near him.        
	But residents of Durmuth, about 35km from Dhanyarukhi village, from where Congress MLAs were chased away, gave another version.         
	Congress agitator Inamul Haque, who is the pradhan of the Koichor-II panchayat, said Jiabur was not running but standing too near the trouble spot. One shell burst near Jiaburs feet. He was watching the commotion. He fell into a drain and collapsed. Policemen started poking him with batons after that, Inamul said.         
	Jiabur was taken to a hospital but was dead by then.        
	A 90-year-old villager alleged he was assaulted by the police who barged into his house. I was sitting in my courtyard when six policemen came. They hit me with their batons and demanded to know where the agitators were hiding. They slapped my teenaged granddaughters, said Abdul Hakim Sheikh.        
	Around 7.30am, the 30 policemen moving from Burdwan town to Katwa had to stop as the road was blocked near the Durmuth bus stop.         
	Supporters of the Congress, which had called a Katwa bandh today, were protesting the CPM attack on their leaders. The police said they asked the people to clear the road but the villagers started throwing stones that damaged the windshield of their vehicles. We lathicharged and burst four tear gas shells. We arrested two persons, an officer said.

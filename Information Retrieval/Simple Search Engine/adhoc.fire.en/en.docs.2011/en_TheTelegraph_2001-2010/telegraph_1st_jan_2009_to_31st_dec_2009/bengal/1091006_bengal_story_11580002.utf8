          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 5: The government today said Chhatradhar Mahato would be charged under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act.        
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee held a meeting with chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti, home secretary Ardhendu Sen and director-general of police Bhupinder Singh before arriving at the decision.        
	After interrogating Chhatradhar Mahato and on the basis of evidence collected regarding his involvement in various activities in Lalgarh and its adjoining areas, the government has decided to book him under the UAPA, Sen said.         
	Mahato today refused to identify any youth shown in Maoist training video clips.         
	The police, however, said all the youth in the videos were from Lalgarh and its adjoining areas.        
	The police admitted that it would not be possible for them to recognise fugitive Maoist leaders if Mahato did not identify them.

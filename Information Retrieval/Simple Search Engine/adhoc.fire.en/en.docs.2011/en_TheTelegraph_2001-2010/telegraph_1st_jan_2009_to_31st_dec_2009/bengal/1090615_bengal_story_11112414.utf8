The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Mamata promises Janata Khana, holiday deals 
                                                                                                               Mamata promises Janata Khana, holiday deals 
          A STAFF REPORTER                      Mamata Banerjee salutes during a guard of honour at Howrah station. (Pabitra Das)				                                 
	Calcutta, June 14: Mamata Banerjee today promised Janata Khana at stations and complained that Rs 7 for a plate of puri-sabzi on a train was too much.         
	Flagging off a Howrah-Digha train, the railway minister also promised a janata package for holidayers to the seaside town.         
	Kandari Express, which leaves Howrah at 2.10pm everyday and takes three-and-a-half hours to cover 188km, has a pantry that serves fish curry and rice for Rs 30 and puri-sabzi for Rs 7.         
	The rates are very high. It is very expensive, said Mamata. IRCTC (Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation) fixed the rates on its own. I will reduce the prices in two-three days.        
	She also promised to ask the Railway Board to arrange for Janata Khana at stations. I have been told that in Delhi and many other stations the price of food is very high. I will ask the Railway Board to ensure that puri-sabzi and other janata khana are available at easy-to-afford rates. They must also ensure drinking water is available at all stations, the minister said.         
	Railway sources said the price of food on the Digha train had been kept as low as possible. The food is being served warm in a casserole. It is difficult to sell it at a lower rate, a senior catering official said.         
	Mamata wants the food cheap, but lip-smacking. She alleged that the quality of food at stations and on trains had gone down, as had cleanliness, safety and security. People dont get confirmed seats even on Tatkal schemes. We have to restore the situation. Railway police must behave well with passengers. They must come up with a human face.        
	From Monday, two trains with AC and non-AC chair cars will run daily between Howrah and Digha. Kandari will leave Howrah at 2.10pm and Digha at 6.10pm. Tamralipta Express will start from Howrah at 6.40am and reach Digha at 10.05am. It will leave Digha 20 minutes later. Both trains will have five stops: Santragachhi, Mecheda, Tamluk, Contai and Ramnagar.         
	The minister promised holiday packages for Digha and nearby Shankarpur, which will include train rides with snacks on board, hotel accommodation and half-day sightseeing. Within a month, I will announce low-priced packages for Digha. They will include food, accommodation and other facilities.        
	IRCTC today published indicative tariffs. We are yet to fix the rates. Talks are on with hotels of various grades in Digha and Shankarpur for possible tie-ups. The deals will be finalised soon, an official said.         
	Tourists will have the option of choosing hotels from budget to luxury grades.         
	Bookings can be made through irctc.co.in or the IRCTC office in Calcutta. Other modes of booking are also being considered, the official said.

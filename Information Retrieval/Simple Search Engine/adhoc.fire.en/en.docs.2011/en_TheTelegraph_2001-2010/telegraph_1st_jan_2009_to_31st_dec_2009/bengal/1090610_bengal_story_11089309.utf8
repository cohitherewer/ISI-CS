The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Trinamul takes Khejuri
                                                                                                               Trinamul takes Khejuri
          ANSHUMAN PHADIKAR                                            
	Khejuri, June 9: Khejuri, the launch pad for the CPMs bloody recapture of Nandigram in November 2007, fell to the Trinamul Congress today when its supporters smashed and burnt the partys zonal office at Hedia and declared it their territory.        
	There was no resistance from the CPM, many of whose leaders had fled after the Trinamul victory in the recent Lok Sabha polls. Police, accused of siding with the CPM two years ago, stood by and watched as the Trinamul hordes rejoiced.        
	The Trinamul plan was simple: target CPM offices and prominent leaders but spare the villagers, even if pro-CPM.         
	After the polls, we realised that if we target its big leaders, the supporters would switch over, a leader said.        
	By early this morning, the 20-odd CPM offices in Khejuri had been stormed and the homes of several leaders razed.         
	What remained was the jewel in the Khejuri CPMs crown: its zonal office in Hedia. Around 10am, some 700 people attacked the CPM capital here. They smashed doors, tore open grilles and set the building on fire.        
	The last CPM citadel in Khejuri fell with a police outpost barely 200 meters away and Tamluk Trinamul MP Subhendu Adhikari declared: Justice has finally been done.        
	This is the place from where the CPM had launched its attacks on the people of Nandigram and today its ours, said Subhendu, whose father Sisir, the Contai MP, represents the area in the Lok Sabha.         
	A group of CPM ministers heading to Khejuri this morning was stopped by Trinamul supporters 8km away. The police persuaded them to return to Calcutta so the situation did not spin out of control.        
	In Calcutta, ministers Partha De, Rekha Goswami, Rabilal Moitra, Binay Biswas and Chakradhar Maikap said party supporters in Khejuri were being terrorised. We want to rescue them but cant.         
	The CPMs allies complained they had not been kept in the loop about the decision to send the ministers. We have lost Nandigram because of some irresponsible moves. Now we are going to lose Khejuri, Socialist Party leader and fisheries minister Kiranmoy Nanda was quoted as telling a Left Front meeting. The chief minister said the decision to send the team was taken in haste.         
	Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi expressed regret and anxiety. Reports of violence between supporters of different political formations in the wake of elections is a matter of regret (and) anxiety. In a mature democracy... neither vengeance and vendetta nor bragging and bravado can be allowed either by the victorious or the defeated. I urge all to halt this cycle of violence and spare our people of distress.        
	Home secretary Ardhendu Sen pleaded helplessness. We dont have the resources to ensure that the violence does not erupt.         
	Four men, including CPM panchayat chief Subrata Kar, have been arrested in Khejuri. Kar, whose house a Trinamul mob raided last evening, was accused of stockpiling arms.        
	East Midnapore police chief P.K. Ghosh said: We could not prevent todays attacks as people blocked our way.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Rigging but happy
                                                                                                               Rigging but happy
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, May 13: The CPM and the Trinamul Congress today accused each other of indulging in rigging and violence, but said they were happy at the way the day went.         
	CPM state secretary Biman Bose, who had warned of large-scale violence in the last phase of the polls, congratulated voters for foiling the conspiracy of Trinamul harmaads (cadres) to incite trouble.        
	Mamata Banerjee said: I am happy that people exercised their franchise in many places resisting the CPMs terror tactics to rig the polls. This is a good sign for us.        
	However, the Trinamul chief accused chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee of encouraging his CPM goons to rig todays polls in a number of booths in his Jadavpur Assembly segment. Its a shame on Buddhadebbabu. But I am grateful to the electorate of Jadavpur for casting their votes by ignoring terror tactics let loose by CPM cadres, she said.        
	Mamata alleged that CPM cadres had also captured or jammed booths in Bongaon, Joynagar, Barrackpore and Kalyani. Trinamul has demanded repolling in 47 booths, of which 44 are in Jadavpur.        
	Mamata said she called Union home secretary Madhukar Gupta in the afternoon to request him to seek a report from the state government on the basis of our complaints about the CPMs rigging.         
	Mamata said Jyoti Basus decision to not vote for the first time in his life was a (show of) no-confidence against the CPM.        
	Bose ridiculed the complaints. She has been suffering from rigging-mania for a long time. If anyone knows a medicine to cure her of it, they should send it to her.        
	Bose was also dismissive of the exit polls carried out by some TV channels today. I dont believe in exit polls or psephology, he said.         
	The CPM had petitioned the poll panel against the telecast of the exit polls as it feared they could influence the voters of 101 booths in the Mandirbazar area of Mathurapur, where the polls could not be held today because of a snag in electronic voting machines.         
	The elections in Mandir-bazar there will be held tomorrow.                    
	CPM politburo member Brinda Karat said: The projections (about the Oppositions success) are mythical. There will be no major reversal of results. The people of Bengal are politically conscious and wont let the Singur-Nandigram issue determine the outcome of the Lok Sabha polls.

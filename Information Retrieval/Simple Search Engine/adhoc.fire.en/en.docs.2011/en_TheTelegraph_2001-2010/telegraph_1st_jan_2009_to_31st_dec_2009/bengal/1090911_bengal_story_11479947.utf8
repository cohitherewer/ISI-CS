          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bankura, Sept. 10: A CPM leader was killed by suspected Maoists in Sarenga this evening.         
	Police said Krishna Kundu was a party whole-timer and the secretary of the Sarenga local committee in Bankura.         
	The 72-year-old former primary school teacher, who was also a party zonal committee member and chairman of the block krishak sabha, was returning home on his cycle from the party office when five men on two motorcycles stopped him.         
	Kundu was shot from close range and died on the spot. The attackers used handguns and shot him thrice, a police officer said.         
	The assailants fled in the darkness towards Khayerpahari, which is not far from the border with West Midnapore, sources said.        
	Krishna babu had finished some work at the party office and had left a little after 5.30 this evening. We are shocked that he has been killed, said Nemai Mahato, a zonal committee member.         
	On Tuesday, two other CPM members, Baneswar Murmu and Ramdas Murmu, were shot dead near Habra under Sarenga police station.         
	A bandh was called in Sarenga and neighbouring blocks yesterday to protest the murders.

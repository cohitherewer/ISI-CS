The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Trinamul sets foot on Lalgarh
                                                                                                               Trinamul sets foot on Lalgarh
          PRONAB MONDAL      
	Lalgarh, July 28: Over 150 Lalgarh residents who were once active CPM supporters today chanted Trinamul Congress zindabad and crowded around a team from Mamata Banerjees party.        
	What the Trinamul men saw was a far cry from what Congress MLAs had encountered in Burdwans Mangalkot barely a fortnight ago.         
	Union ministers Mukul Roy and Sisir Adhikary and MLA Partha Chatterjee heard the CPM supporters complain about their corrupt party at the Lalgarh bazaar.        
	Those who believe in Mamata Banerjees ideology are most welcome, Roy said later.        
	In a region where the fear of Maoists has been forcing CPM leaders to disown their party, they huddled together to hear the Trinamul leaders where the towns Puja is held.         
	Unlike in Mangalkot, where the Congress team was chased and stoned, Lalgarh is a former CPM stronghold. The Maoist-backed Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities now calls the shots here.        
	Mamata Banerjee is against the operation by the joint forces (in Lalgarh). There has been no development here in 32 years. But now an attempt is being made to capture political turf with the help of the police. We demand the immediate withdrawal of the forces, said Chatterjee.        
	Minutes after the Trinamul team left, the committee took out a procession of 10,000 people led by women to push for the pullout of the forces. The police batoncharged them and used tear gas when they tried to break through barricades outside the police station.        
	The committees leaders dubbed the Trinamul visit a political gimmick.

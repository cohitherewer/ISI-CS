The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Cong stops rural work
                                                                                                               Cong stops rural work
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Behrampore, July 24: The Congress today stopped work for an indefinite period in nearly 150 gram panchayats and the dozen panchayat samitis it runs in Murshidabad, demanding the release of a leader held on a murder charge.        
	Shiladitya Haldar, the chief of the Behrampore panchayat samiti, was picked up on the night of July 21 in connection with the murder of a CPM local committee member last month.         
	The shutdown forced on development work across most of Murshidabad comes days after Congress ally Mamata Banerjee needled parties that call for strikes at the drop of a hat.        
	The Congress, which won all three Lok Sabha seats in Murshidabad, controls 147 gram panchayats of the 254 in the district and 12 panchayat samitis out of 26. I have instructed Congress workers to stop work in all our rural bodies. They cannot sit idle when police are arresting our leaders on false charges, Behrampore Congress MP Adhir Chowdhury said.         
	Additional district magistrate Debjyoti Bhattacharya said a large number of employees who today took the trouble to attend duty from far-flung villages despite the bus strike were not allowed to enter offices. All development work in a major part of rural Murshidabad will be stalled if this continues, he added.        
	The payment of around 50,000 poor villagers now engaged in digging ponds or building roads and homes will take the worst hit if the strike continues. We wont be able to disburse the funds, said a subdivisional officer.         
	Anjana Mondal, who came to collect a birth certificate for her one-month-old son spending Rs 5 on an auto ride, went back seeing the Bhakuri gram panchayat locked and Congress supporters demonstrating.

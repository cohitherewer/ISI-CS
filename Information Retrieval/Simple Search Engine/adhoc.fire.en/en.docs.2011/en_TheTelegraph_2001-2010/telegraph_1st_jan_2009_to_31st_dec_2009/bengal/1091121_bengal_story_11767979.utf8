          OUR BUREAU                          Mahasweta with Suman on Friday. (Amit Datta)                                  
	Calcutta, Nov. 20: Partha Chatterjee and Kabir Suman today hugged each other and posed for the cameras claiming the confusion between the Trinamul Congress and its singer MP was over.         
	We had an open discussion on the issues I had raised. I have now decided to join the winter session of Parliament by next week, Suman said af-ter two rounds of talks with Chatterjee and a host of Trinamul-backed artists, authors and activists.        
	A smiling Suman, peeved with the party days ago, said: My primary objective is to see the CPM out and Mamata (Banerjee) take over as chief minister in 2011. Im a Trinamul member like others and ours is a common goal.        
	A meeting was convened at writer Mahasweta Devis Golf Green home  the second in three days  to persuade Suman to call a truce.         
	Earlier this week, the first-time MP from Jadavpur had threatened to quit the party, alleging that a section of its leaders was clamouring for control over his local area development funds and stalling development work.        
	Trinamul sources said Suman handed over a three-page letter to Chatterjee listing his grievances and requesting Mamata to initiate a clean-up in the party. He also wanted restrictions on the entry of people with a CPM background.         
	Although Mamata had steered clear of the episode and fielded her friends from the world of arts to assuage Sumans concerns, her comment  that he is a guest and not really a party member  had triggered the resignation threat.         
	Chatterjee today gave Suman a reason to smile. He (Suman) is very much a Trinamul man and not an outsider, said the leader of the Opposition in the Assembly. I have briefed Mamata about the developments, he added.         
	The meeting, originally scheduled at Suvaprasannas Salt Lake house, was shifted to Mahaswetas as Suman and some others did not want the painters involvement.         
	In the presence of some of Mamatas most trusted associates  theatre person Bratya Basu, painters Jogen Chowdhury and Samir Aich, poet Joy Goswami, academic Sunanda Sanyal and social activist Sujato Bhadra  the meeting went on for over two-and-a-half hours in two rounds.         
	Sumans complaint about lack of development in his constituency is true. We agree with him, said Mahasweta.         
	When Suman and his friends emerged from the meeting, they tried to underplay his grievances against the Trinamul rank and file and highlighted how the singer was peeved with the Centres offensive against tribals (meaning Maoists). I dont agree with Union home minister P. Chidambaram on the deployment of forces in Lalgarh and I shall raise it in Parliament, said Suman.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Biman defence in vote share
                                                                                                               Biman defence in vote share
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 16: The CPM today tried to downplay the political importance of its debacle in the Siliguri municipal elections after 28 years in power.        
	Party state secretary Biman Bose refused to take questions pending a detailed report from the district Left Front on the fallout of the defeat that came after setbacks in panchayat, Parliament and an earlier round of civic polls.         
	But he claimed that there was not much difference in the vote share of the Opposition combine of Trinamul-Congress and the Left Front  47. 14 per cent and 46.13 per cent, respectively.         
	He said the Left did not suffer any big erosion in its support base despite losing in over half the wards it had held earlier.         
	The Left combine won in 17, a slide from 36 wards.        
	Bose also made it clear that the CPM was in no mood to step down as demanded by Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjee yesterday.         
	It was no Assembly poll but a civic election involving two and half lakh people only. So the question does not arise, Bose said after the Left Front meeting this morning.

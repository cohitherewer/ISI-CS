The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Morcha peace pledge, threat
                                                                                                               Morcha peace pledge, threat
          OUR BUREAU                          Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee: Fingers crossed                                  
	Jan. 19: Hundreds of Gorkha Janmukti Morcha supporters marching to Malbazar for a meeting today were stopped 8km away by police, apprehending a standoff with Adivasis who had assembled flouting restrictions to foil the hill outfits rally.        
	Morcha president Bimal Gurung, who led the march to the Dooars, announced that the party would continue to bring out processions till the administration granted them permission to hold a public meeting in Malbazar, about 70km from Siliguri.         
	He promised non-violence, but laced it with a threat. The Morcha will never indulge in violence. But if anybody disturbs a peaceful rally, the situation might change. We are not against any community, Gurung said.        
	The Morcha supporters had set off for Malbazar after a meal that the party president helped cook at Dalim Fort, a Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council guesthouse in Gorubathan that the Morcha has been forcibly occupying.        
	Led by the womens wing, the Morcha supporters had walked 6km to Meen Glass Tea Estate when the police stopped them.         
	The leaders appeal to be allowed to walk 1.5km more was granted but they were not allowed to go beyond Saili More. Faced with barricades outside Saili Tea Estate, the hill outfit started a demonstration.         
	Around 8km away, a few thousand members of the Akhil Bharatiya Adivasi Vikas Parishad had gathered at College More and the adjacent Chalsa More. Many of them were armed with bows and arrows.        
	They dispersed on hearing that the police had stopped the Morcha procession.        
	Adivasi leader Rajesh Lakra said: Our people were prepared. If the police had not stopped the Morcha, we would have taken charge. The administration shouldnt give them permission to hold any meeting in the Dooars because it might result in violence.         
	Gurung told a news conference: It is all a conspiracy hatched by the CPM to drive a wedge between the Gorkhas and the Adivasis.         
	The Morcha chief added: The government should realise that the region we live in is surrounded by four countries, and any turmoil here could be detrimental to the interest of India.         
	Houses torched        
	Suspected Morcha supporters stoned the house of an Adivasi leader in Banarhat, 20km from Saili More, around seven this evening.         
	In retaliation, Parishad supporters barged into Morcha houses in Lakkhipara Tea Estate and allegedly set fire to at least three of them. Policemen and fire engines rushed to the spot.

                                                                                                               Unions want VC to resign
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Santiniketan, Oct. 25: Striking Visva-Bharati staff today demanded the resignation of vice-chancellor Rajat Kanta Ray for the sake of a fair probe into allegations of corruption they have levelled against him.        
	The university, open on Sundays, did not have classes for the second consecutive day because the teachers union is supporting the strike.        
	Visva-Bharati had yesterday accepted their main demand and promised to ask the Centre to probe the charges. But those on strike said they had not been formally informed about the decision.         
	It has also not approached the Centre yet for the probe. We are yet to decide when we will send the proposal to the Centre. We have started the process, said public relations officer Amitabha Chowdhury.        
	Debabrata Sarkar, a leader of the non-teaching employees union, said: We are demanding the VCs resignation because we dont think a proper probe is possible with him in the chair.        
	The VC declined comment.        
	Students owing allegiance to the Congress and the Trinamul Congress  in the majority in the institution  have decided to support the strike from tomorrow.        
	State Congress leader Subrata Mukherjee visited Santiniketan today and said I have full support for those seeking the VCs resignation. I will sit in a dharna in front of Raj Bhavan along with scholars to expose him, he added.        
	Ray has been accused of diverting student welfare funds to another project and selling a CD containing copies of Tagores unpublished paintings at a throwaway price.

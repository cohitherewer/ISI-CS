The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Front tries tested hands in Bengal
                                                                                                               Front tries tested hands in Bengal
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, March 3: Faced with a new enemy, the Left Front has reposed trust in old hands.        
	The front has a mountain to cross, chairman Biman Bose said, releasing its list of candidates for the 42 Lok Sabha seats in Bengal. And the best bet to meet the challenge  94-year-old Jyoti Basu.         
	The list had 18 new names. Even these changes were mostly because of delimitation of seats and alterations in their reservation status.        
	Flanked by representatives of all nine front partners, Bose ducked questions on the new enemy: a united Opposition. The alliance scene is still not clear. All I can say is that it will be a tough fight for us and we have to cross a mountain of obstacles.        
	We had also faced a tough fight after Rajiv Gandhis death (in 1991). But the people of Bengal co-operated with us, he added.        
	Chinks in the Left had come to the fore during the trouble in Nandigram and Singur, which helped the Opposition win three zilla parishads and almost half the gram panchayat seats last May. This time, the front will face the challenge as a rock. Committees will be formed for all the 62,919 booths in the state, Bose said.         
	Unable to stem the slide in the Nandigram and Bishnupur West Assembly bypolls held this year, the front expects the ailing Basu to rejuvenate the rank and file. He will address them on March 16. CDs with his message will play across the state during campaigning.         
	Bose refused to link the Opposition successes to the general election but his allies were worried. Singur and Nandigram will have a negative impact. But the chief minister has admitted his mistakes and we will campaign unitedly to restrict the impact, Forward Bloc veteran Ashok Ghosh said.         
	The CPM, which holds 26 seats in Bengal, has re-nominated 17 MPs, many of them five- to eight-timers. Among the old hands are Basudev Acharya (Bankura), Mohammad Salim (Calcutta North), Rupchand Pal (Hooghly), Hannan Mollah (Uluberia) and Lakshman Seth (Tamluk).         
	Birbhum MP Ramchandra Dom has been shifted to neighbouring Bolpur, held by Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee. Rabin Deb will be fielded in Calcutta South.        
	The party, whose leaders champion 33 per cent reservation for women in Parliament, has fielded only two women, down from five in 2004. The allies dont have a single woman in the fray.        
	New candidate Pulin Be-hari Baske will replace Rup-chand Murmu in Jhargram, to stem the growing tribal unrest in West Midnapore. Jibesh Sarkar, the second man to Asok Bhattacharya in Siliguri, will contest from Darjeeling, another trouble spot for the government and the party.         
	From South 24-Parganas, where Trinamul has pulled the rug from under the CPMs feet, Mathurapur MP Basudeb Burman has been moved to Ranaghat in Nadia.         
	The CPI has retained all its three MPs. The RSP and the Bloc, however, have gone for an overhaul, dropping five of their six MPs.         
	Much of the Oppositions recent success has been attributed to its popularity among Muslims. The number of front candidates from the community has gone up to five from two.        
	Satabdi in Birbhum        
	The Trinamul Congress chief informed actors Satabdi Roy and Tapas Pal today that they would be fielded from Birbhum and Krishnagar respectively.

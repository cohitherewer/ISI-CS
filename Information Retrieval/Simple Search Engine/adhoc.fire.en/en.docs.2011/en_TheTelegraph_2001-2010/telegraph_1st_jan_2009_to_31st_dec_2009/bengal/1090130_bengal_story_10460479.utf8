                                                                                                               Boy missing after school
          A STAFF REPORTER                            Yash Lakhotia and his mother. (Gopal Senapati)                          
	Calcutta, Jan. 29: The seven-year-old son of a businessman who owns one of Howrahs largest sweet shops did not return home after school this afternoon, prompting police to suspect kidnapping for ransom.        
	A classmate noticed Yash Lakhotia, a student of Class II at MC Kejriwal Vidyapeeth in Liluah, holding an unidentified mans hand and walking out of the school campus a little after 1pm. A pool car was to have taken him back home.        
	Yashs father Anil, the owner of Panch Bhog on Rameshwar Malia Lane, and paternal uncle Nandu, a real estate promoter, waited till 4pm to lodge a missing diary with Bally police station. We were hoping he would turn up with someone we know. We have received no ransom call so far, Nandu said.        
	School headmistress Mallika Mukherjee said she did not know Yash had left the campus with any unidentified person. Our students arent allowed to leave the campus with anyone other than the drivers of authorised pool cars or their parents. The driver of the pool car that was to take Yash home returned without him but did not inform us that he couldnt be traced.         
	But Kailash Saraogi, the missing boys friend, told the police that he saw Yash leaving the school with a man. I thought the man was someone from his family, he said.        
	Howrah SP Niraj Kumar Singh said someone known to the family might have kidnapped the boy. We have interrogated the pool car driver and his helper and are trying to find out whether they have told us the truth.        
	The driver, 45-year-old Ganesh Rai, reached the school around 1.20pm, 20 minutes later than usual. Nine of the students who take that car were waiting near the gate except Yash, he told the police.         
	When Yash didnt return home until 2pm  the drive from MC Kejriwal Vidyapeeth to the Lakhotias home in Howrah takes not more than half-an-hour  his family contacted the pool car driver.        
	He claimed to have informed a member of the school staff that Yash was missing and was told that my nephew had left with a relative. We contacted the school authorities immediately but they could not give us a satisfactory explanation, Nandu said.         
	Yashs uncle later met the superintendent of police.        
	Brothers Anil and Nandu live with their families in a 2,500sq ft flat on the sixth floor of a building at 547 GT Road. Anil and his wife Anita also have a daughter, Neha, who studies in Class III at Welland Gouldsmith School.

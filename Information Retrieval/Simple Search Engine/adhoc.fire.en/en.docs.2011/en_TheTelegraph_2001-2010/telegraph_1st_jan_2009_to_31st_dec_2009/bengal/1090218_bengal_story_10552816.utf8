	Haripal (Hooghly), Feb. 17: A college teacher who has seven alsatians and a spitz at home was today served a 10-day ultimatum by neighbours to get rid of six of her dogs after one of them bit a man.        
	Sunanda Sen, who teaches English at Jaipuria College in north Calcutta, was about to leave home around 9.30am when about 100 people locked her main gate from outside.         
	The residents of Hora village in Haripal, 55km from Calcutta, said the dogs were a menace. On Sunday, they killed a goat, said Tapas Majhi.         
	Sen admitted the charge but said her alsatians killed the goat because it had strayed into her premises. They did not go out and kill the goat in the village.        
	Sen lives on her sprawling four-acre ancestral property with helps. Her daughter lives in Mumbai.         
	Majhi, a CPM panchayat member, said: The premises has only a 4ft high wall, which the dogs cross at ease when let loose at night. The pack of eight roams the village, spreading terror. This has to end.         
	The villagers called police this morning. This is not the first time they have complained about Sens dogs, said Haripal officer-in-charge Suprakash Patnaik.        
	The police dispersed the protesters but took part in a village meeting this evening to resolve the dispute.         
	At the meeting, the villa- gers said Sen could keep only two of her dogs. We gave her 10 days to comply with the decision. Or else, well give all the dogs away to the forest department, said Nandalal Biswas, 60, who chaired the meeting.         
	Sen said she was forced to sign an undertaking. The villagers were angry but the dogs are dear to me and it will be difficult for me to get rid of them, she said.         
	At the meeting, she promised to raise her boundary wall and leash the dogs, but the villagers would have none of that.        
	According to the law, the charges against Sen are serious. She could be jailed for six months and fined if it is proved that her negligence had caused the dog bite. Her dogs offence of killing the goat could land her in jail for a longer period  five years.

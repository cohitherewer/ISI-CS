The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Left wants foreign funds
                                                                                                               Left wants foreign funds
                            
	Calcutta, June 14: The government will seek Central help in inviting foreign funds to the tune of Rs 10,000 crore for the construction of high, permanent embankments in the Sunderbans, the chief minister told an all-party meeting at Writers Buildings today.        
	He would raise the issue when he meets Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in Delhi on June 19, irrigation minister Subhash Naskar said.        
	The decision to seek foreign funds may surprise many as the Left parties have had reservations about foreign direct investment in sectors like retail. But Naskar said seeking assistance for infrastructure development would not be a problem. He cited instances of bridges built with Asian Development Bank funds in the Sunderbans.

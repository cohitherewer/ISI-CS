	Tamluk, Nov. 12: Citu contract workers blocked the two gates of Indian Oil Corporations Haldia plant and stopped about 600 employees from entering for about three hours this morning.        
	The workers were protesting the shifting of two drivers  also on contract and members of Citu  outside the plant yesterday.        
	The drivers had repor-tedly misbehaved with their superiors and were hence shifted.        
	Last night, drivers of 30 cars, all loyal to the Citu and who ply their vehicles inside the plant, resorted to a ceasework on the same issue. The drivers also called off their ceasework at night.         
	The Citu workers withdrew from the gates around 11am after being persuaded district magistrate C.D. Lama.

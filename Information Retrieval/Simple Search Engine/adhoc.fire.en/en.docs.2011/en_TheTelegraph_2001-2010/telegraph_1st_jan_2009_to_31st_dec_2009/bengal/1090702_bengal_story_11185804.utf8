The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Cops run for life cover
                                                                                                               Cops run for life cover
          IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                               
	Lalgarh, July 1: The men in khaki posted here may be armed with assault rifles, but they are rushing for an arguably more potent cover  life insurance.        
	A constable who had one policy when shifted to Lalgarh two years ago has three now. I bought a policy of Rs 3 lakh last year and also signed up for the governments group insurance scheme, he said.         
	For the man in his early 30s with a take-home salary of around Rs 11,000 a month, the annual premium of over Rs 11,000 is steep. But I dont have a choice. The Maoists have killed seven of our colleagues here, said the father of two.         
	In the past five years, the rebels have killed 30 policemen in Purulia, Bankura and West Midnapore.         
	I could have been among them. Then what would have happened to my wife and the kids? the constable asked.         
	All the 70-odd personnel in Lalgarh and Goaltore thanas have two to three insurance policies each, he added.        
	Midnapore DIG Praveen Kumar said that given the state of unrest, it was natural.         
	A sub-inspector who has bought policies worth over Rs 6 lakh in the past two years spends Rs 48,000 a year on insurance. My friends in other professions invest in insurance schemes to reduce their tax burden. But for us, they are indeed covers against loss of life, explained the officer, who earns Rs 18,000 a month.         
	He was seated inside the now heavily fortified Lalgarh police station, with central forces armed with semiautomatic guns and armoured vehicles hovering around. But he is aware that the sense of security will be short-lived.         
	Later, well have to go into the villages for regular law-and-order duty. There is every possibility that I might get killed, said another officer.         
	State police chief Bhupinder Singh admitted that the long spell of unrest was taking a toll on the forces morale. The government is planning a special allowance to boost the morale of the forces posted in troubled areas. We have finalised a proposal, he added.

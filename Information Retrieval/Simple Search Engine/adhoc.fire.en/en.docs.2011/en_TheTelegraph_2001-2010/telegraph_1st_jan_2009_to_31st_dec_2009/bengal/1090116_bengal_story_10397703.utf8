	Calcutta, Jan. 15: A nine-member team from the UK on information and communication technology has landed in Calcutta to explore the possibility of jointly working on projects in IT, medical and environment technology, food and drinks, animation and gaming.        
	The projects could be funded by the EU or locally.         
	The team from the Coventry amp; Warwickshire Cham- ber of Commerce is also keen to forge links between the Coventry University Enterprises Ltd, the trading arm of Coventry University, and universities and business schools in Bengal.        
	Ajay Desai, the leader of the delegation at Infocom 08-09, said the team had already met officials of the Indian Railways Institute of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering in Calcutta. The institute is in Jamalpur, Bihar.        
	Companies are interested in India because its story is still one of growth, while globally the forecast is of shrinkage. Basically, we are looking at the eastern part with better prospects, Desai said.         
	He added that the delegation had spoken to officials of Hindustan Motors, Jadavpur University, Globsyn Business School, IISWBM as well as IT company Metalogic Systems and the chambers of commerce in the city.         
	We are getting a very good response and (see) good prospects. We will surely pursue those when we are back, Desai added.        
	The delegation is attending Infocom for the first time. This is a very good event for us. Actually, we were looking for an IT event meant for the SMEs (small and medium-scale enterprises), unlike big events. Infocom is the answer to that.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Parties put Nandi cops in dock
                                                                                                               Parties put Nandi cops in dock
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          A mother and daughter who had to flee Satengabari in the face of the CPM attack on Thursday night                                  
	Tamluk, May 10: Representatives of both the Trinamul Congress and the CPM today held police responsible for the spiralling violence in Nandigram at a meeting called to end the post-poll clashes that have rocked the region.        
	They told East Midnapore district magistrate C.D. Lama, who had convened the all-party meeting, and district police chief P.K. Ghosh that the force did nothing when their supporters were attacked and killed since Thursday.         
	CPM cadres have been accused of threatening and thrashing Trinamul supporters who had defied their diktat not to vote. Trinamul supporters allegedly beat to death two cadres yesterday.         
	Our supporter Yasin Mir was beaten to death at Satengabari on Thursday. Toddler Sania Khatoun was shot dead. Yasins wife had pleaded with the police in a jeep nearby to help but none came. When the CPM cadres were firing and hurling bombs, no policeman came from a camp only half a mile away, Trinamuls Sheikh Sufiyan said.         
	CPM district secretary Kanu Sahu alleged that partymen Abdullah Khan and Shahauddin Khan were lynched in front of the police yesterday. They have failed to arrest the Trinamul men responsible for the murders.        
	Sufiyan criticised the police for not having carried out pre-poll raids to seize arms and called for central forces.        
	The district magistrate, however, said the police were being prevented from carrying out raids. In villages where a particular party has a strong presence, its supporters are preventing the police from making arrests, she said, appealing for co-operation.        
	In Calcutta, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee reviewed the situation with senior officials. The chief minister expressed concern over the violence. If it continues, central forces may have to be deployed, the chief secretary said.        
	The all-party meeting  also attended by the CPI, RSP, Forward Bloc, Congress, BJP and the SUCI  did not seem to have softened positions. The CPM leaders rejected Lamas request to call off tomorrows 12-hour bandh in the district.        
	The villages continued to be tense. Around 500 Trinamul supporters in Jadubarichar kept 10 CPM cadres under virtual house arrest till late tonight, accusing them of stockpiling arms.         
	Nearly 500 Trinamul sup- porters fled Adhikarypara la-st night allegedly after bombs were hurled and shots fired from adjacent Garupara, a CPM-dominated village. They returned with police escort this morning.        
	Governor concern        
	Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi has expressed concern over the election-related violence in certain constituencies.         
	Reports of election-related violence in certain constituencies come as a matter of greatest regret. I urge contestants and their supporters to neither provoke violence nor respond to such provocation, he said in a statement.

	Calcutta, Dec. 4: The government will probe the charges made against the Nadia police chief by his mother in the high court, home secretary Ardhendu Sen said today.        
	The court had yesterday asked the state police chief to ensure protection of Bela Bhattacharya, 65, who alleged that Champak had been trying to snatch her house in Salt Lakes BC block.         
	We havent got a copy of the court order, but we will have to take certain steps and that includes conducting an inquiry to find out what the SPs role has been in this regard. After that, the necessary steps will be taken, Sen said.        
	The court had said that a list of the charges against the IPS officer would be sent to the government for steps.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Cong vows to hit Marxists hard
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Cong vows to hit Marxists hard

	New Delhi, Nov. 30: The Centre may have tried to pacify the Left in Parliament saying that sending the team to Bengal was not a confrontational move, but the Congress today warned its former ally not to expect concessions in the political battle ahead.        
	We have been getting feedback that the law-and-order situation in some places in Bengal is extremely bad. Despite that we have so far not adopted a resolution for the use of Article 356. The government (Centre) might have got its own feedback, let the government respond, party spokesperson Shakeel Ahmed said, reacting to the ruckus in Parliament.         
	The central Congress leadership has often been perceived to be soft on the Left despite its role in the plot to topple the UPA I government over the Indo-US nuclear deal. However, a section of the party believes it could be as disastrous as toeing a soft-Hindutva line ahead of the Assembly elections in Bengal.         
	There wont be any compromises. We will go all out to defeat them, the Congress general secretary in charge of Bengal, K. Keshava Rao, told The Telegraph today.         
	He described the disruption of Parliament as a CPM ploy to divert peoples attention from its failures. Viewing the decision to send a central team to study the situation as a move to impose Presidents rule is hallucination.        
	He pinched the CPM over its own admission of moral corruption as a reason for its sliding fortunes. We didnt say the CPM is on the decline because of greed and selfishness. The CPM general secretary is saying.        
	Congress leaders admit in private that the relationship with the Left in Bengal has not been hostile, though the parties have fought pitched battles in Kerala. However, they also say that things have changed with the possibility of the Lefts ouster from Writers Buildings becoming real after the CPMs successive electoral losses.        
	The party denies getting aggressive under pressure from Trinamul. Rao said: There are many issues of misgovernance and law and order in Bengal. We dont need Trinamul to understand that.         
	Other Congress leaders point out that the Left has joined hands with the BJP, Mayavatis BSP and Mulayam Singh Yadavs Samajwadi Party in the past to embarrass the Congress and now it must be shown the mirror. The Congress should pull out all stops to throw the CPM out of power in Kerala and Bengal and then it would be almost impossible for them to regroup, said a cabinet minister who was unwilling to be named.         
	The Congress leadership is not in favour of imposing Presidents rule, but it will try to keep the state government on its toes.         
	We have to create an impression that the Buddhadeb (Bhattacharjee) government is a lame-duck government and the law-and-order situation is volatile. We have to sustain the pressure built up by Mamata Banerjee and demolish the impression that our leadership shares a rapport with the chief minister, the Union minister said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | High tea calls rivals
                                                                                                               High tea calls rivals
          BARUN GHOSH                           Mamata Banerjee: Will she or wont she?                                  
	Calcutta, Aug. 14: Mamata Banerjee could be sipping tea with Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on Independence Day if she accepts the governors invitation to a Raj Bhavan get-together.         
	The last time the chief minister and the states principal Opposition leader had met was 11 months ago, when the government was trying to cajole her to end her Singur agitation and save the Tata Motors project.         
	That meeting at Raj Bha- vans Marble Hall on Septem-ber 7, 2008, ended in an agreement that apparently mudd- led things further. The Tatas left Bengal a few weeks later.        
	Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi has invited both of them along with a host of others for tomorrows high tea at the Raj Bhavan Banquet Hall.         
	Railway minister Mamata Banerjees additional private secretary informed us this afternoon that she was likely to attend the programme but for an eventuality, said a Raj Bhavan official supervising the event.        
	Samosas, vegetable cutlets, cashew nuts, an assortment of biscuits, gulab jamun and tea will be served to around 1,000 guests.        
	Mamata, the six Union ministers of state from her party and Opposition leader in the Assembly Partha Chatterjee are among the invitees. Chief minister Bhattacharjee should be there with his cabinet colleagues and Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee is likely to lead the Congress.        
	Given Mamatas rapport with Gandhi because of his consistent, proactive role in upholding the Constitution, she might turn up at Raj Bhavan, said a Trinamul general secretary.        
	Only last week, the CPM had accused Gandhi of bias after he issued a statement decrying the veritable tandava of political violence in Bengal.        
	If Mamata attends the programme, it will be her first appearance at Raj Bhavan as railway minister on Independence Day. She was missing when governor Viren J. Shah was the host on August 15, 2000. She was part of the BJP-led government then.

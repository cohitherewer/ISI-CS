The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Chopper grounds Mamata
                                                                                                               Chopper grounds Mamata
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Balurghat, April 19: Mamata Banerjee and Pranab Mukherjee were scheduled to address five rallies in five hours in north Bengal but they managed only four in double the time after their chopper ran out of fuel.        
	Forced to stay put in Balurghat for two hours, Mamata alleged that the CPM had hatched a conspiracy to spoil her election campaign.        
	After the rally off Balurghat station ended at 1.30pm, the pilot announced the chopper was too low on fuel to go to Cooch Behar. Police took Mamata and Pranab to the station waiting room but they left the place after some time and chose to sit on the chopper. For the second meeting, scheduled for noon, they reached at 4.50pm.         
	The truck carrying the aviation turbine fuel had got stuck in a snarl caused by people heading towards the Balurghat rally ground. The police located it about a kilometre from the station and escorted it to the helipad.         
	We had set off from Bhubaneswar yesterday and were supposed to be here early this morning, said Devendra Kumar, an employee of the company that owns the chopper.        
	Mamata said: This was a deliberate attempt to sabotage our rallies and the state government and the CPM are fully responsible for it.         
	District magistrate A.K. Banerjee said the charge was unfair. This is a private aircraft and its owners were responsible for the refuelling. We were told that a helipad was required near the venue and we provided one.        
	As the sun set, the leaders had to abandon the chopper and travel by road from Cooch Behar to Birpara in Jalpaiguri district, which meant they had no chance to make up for lost time.

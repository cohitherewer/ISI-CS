The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Left tussle in Kerala
                                                                                                               Left tussle in Kerala
          JAYANTH JACOB                               
	New Delhi, March 6: Like Bengal, like Kerala but among allies, not within the party.        
	The Left Democratic Front is unable to sort out seat sharing in the southern state for the Lok Sabha elections because of one seat where the CPI and the CPM want to put up candidates.         
	The seat at the heart of the discord is the Muslim-dominated Ponnani in Malappuram district.         
	The CPI has been contesting from the Ponnani seat since 1984 but has failed to win it even once. It was the only seat the Congress-led UDF won in the 2004 Lok Sabha elections. This time, the agreement was that an Independent would be fielded from the seat.         
	While the CPI said it would decide on the candidate, the CPM named Hussein Randathani as the candidate from Ponnani. The seat is now held by E. Ahamed, Muslim League MP and Union minister of state for external affairs.         
	According to the CPM, fielding an Independent meant putting up any candidate chosen by the Left, not necessarily one picked by the CPI.        
	At the LDF meeting yesterday, CPI leaders argued that Ponnani was one of the four seats in its share this time of the total 20 in Kerala. They pressed the line that an Independent in Ponnani would be a candidate fielded by them. But the CPM stuck to its guns.         
	The CPM has run into seat-sharing trouble with the Janata Dal (Secular), too.         
	The Dal(S) wants its sitting MP Veerendra Kumar to contest from Kozhikode. But the CPM wants the Dal(S) to fight from the nearby Wayanad seat.        
	The CPM argued that after the delimitation, the Wayanad seat had many areas that were part of the earlier Kozhikode seat, so it would not make a difference to the Dal(S).         
	But the Dal(S) has not relented yet. The two sides are scheduled to meet on March 9.         
	The central committee meeting of the CPM beginning tomorrow will discuss election issues, including seat sharing in different states.        
	The CPM was hoping to finalise the seats before the two-day central committee meeting. But now the ruling Left Democratic Alliance will hold talks on the Ponnani seat on March 12.         
	In Bengal, two sitting MPs have moved out of the Left fold after not getting tickets. Abu Ayesh Mondol was dismissed from the CPM and joined the Trinamul Congress.         
	Hiten Burman, who quit the Forward Bloc, is said to be in talks with Trinamul and Kamtapuri leaders.

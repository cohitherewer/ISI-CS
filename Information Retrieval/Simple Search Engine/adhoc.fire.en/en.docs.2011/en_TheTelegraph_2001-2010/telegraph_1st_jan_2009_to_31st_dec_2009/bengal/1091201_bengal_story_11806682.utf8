The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CPM soft on Centre
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      CPM soft on Centre
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 30: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee did not utter a word on the central teams visit at the CPM state committee meeting today, indicating the partys decision to avoid a clash with the Congress-led government.        
	However, party general secretary Prakash Karat stepped out of the meeting and said the Centre need not have sent the team as law and order is a state subject.         
	It has taken a unilateral decision. (The) Centre should not interfere in state matters, he added.        
	However, he also betrayed the CPMs understanding that the Centre had been compelled to make the move to humour ally Trinamul Congress. Obviously, the team is coming at the instance of a party which is a coalition partner in the government.         
	Reminded that he had not opposed the teams visit on Saturday but only wanted it to be impartial in its probe, Karat made the partys priority clear. If they had decided to visit Lalgarh, where the joint operation is going on, it would have made sense, Karat said today.        
	He was happy that the Left was not alone in opposing the central move. Most parties have taken a stand criticising the Centres move in Parliament, Karat said.         
	But what he did not voice in public was the partys sense of relief after Chidambarams reassurance in both Houses of Parliament that his move was not confrontational.         
	Members of the CPM state secretariat were happy that the home minister had referred to his good working relation with the chief minister of Bengal while adding that the central team would assist the state to put an end to the political clashes.         
	We know what Chidambaram did was under coalition compulsions. Mamata and her MPs may harp on their demands for imposition of Presidents rule in Bengal, but he has made it clear that the Centre would not misuse Article 356, a secretariat member said.        
	That the party is not going to train its guns on Chidambaram or the Congress was clear from state CPM secretary Biman Boses silence on the central team during the state committees concluding session.         
	The secretariat members went into a huddle later to discuss the developments and decided to keep tabs on the central teams role during the visit.         
	The party wants the government to impress upon the three-member team the need to visit Maoist-hit Lalgarh when it calls on officials at Writers Buildings tomorrow.        
	If they visit only places like Hooghlys Khankul, as Mamata had insisted, we will protest. We will insist on impartiality. We are preparing a rep- ort on the killings of our cadres, policemen and common people by the Mamata-Maoist combine. We will meet the team and hand over the report, a secretariat member said insisting that the central team had to meet a CPM delegation if it met one from the Opposition.        
	The Left Front is meeting tomorrow to formulate its formal response to the central team among other things

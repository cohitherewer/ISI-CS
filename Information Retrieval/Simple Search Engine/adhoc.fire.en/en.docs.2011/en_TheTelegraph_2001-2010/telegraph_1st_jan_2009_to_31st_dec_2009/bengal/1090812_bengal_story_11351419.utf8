	Khudrun, Aug. 11: Mamata Banerjee today declared she would now focus her energies on rescuing restive Mangalkot, clubbing it with Singur and Nandigram.        
	From now, Mangalkot will be my target, Mamata said at Khudrun, the place where Trinamul Congress supporters had clashed with police last Saturday. Why did the administration clamp Section 144 just before I came here for the meeting? We will come to the rescue of the people of Mangalkot who are being tortured by the CPM, just in the way we went to the rescue of the people of Nandigram and Singur.        
	However, she told her supporters not to violate the prohibitory orders in Mangalkot  Khudrun is about 3km from the restriction zone  and warned them against provoking the police. But trouble erupted at Noapara, about 6km from the meeting site, after Mamata had left for Calcutta.        
	Trinamul minister Mukul Roy stayed back under Mamatas instructions to discuss cases filed against party supporters arrested for clashing with the police after Saturdays rally by Trinamul MP Subhendu Adhikari.        
	The police said Trinamul supporters travelling in an open van tore a CPM flag in Noapara. Some CPM supporters objected and an altercation ensued. The Trinamul supporters, who were more in number, chased the CPM activists and torched a barn. Roy later said: The CPM supporters attacked my car.         
	The police denied this. No one threw stones at the ministers car, said Burdwan police chief R. Rajsekharan.

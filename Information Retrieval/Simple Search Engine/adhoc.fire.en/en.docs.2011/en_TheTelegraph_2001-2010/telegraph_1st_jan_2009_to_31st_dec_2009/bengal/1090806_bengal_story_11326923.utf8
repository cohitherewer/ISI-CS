The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Infosys to wait on Bengal unit
                                                                                                               Infosys to wait on Bengal unit
          A STAFF REPORTER                                  Infosyss Gopalakrishnan, IT minister Das and Wipros Senapaty at the CII programme. (Kishor Roy Chowdhury)                                 
	Calcutta, Aug. 5: Infosys said it does not want any land at the moment on a day the government promised to provide by December the 90 acres the company had been looking for in Bengal since 2004.        
	(We) want to wait and do not require any more land for any new infrastructure at the moment, Infosys chief executive and managing director S. Gopalakrishnan said on the sidelines of a programme organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry.        
	Minutes before, IT minis- ter Debesh Das had told reporters at the same gathering the state had almost arranged the land in New Town, Rajarhat. The entire process of land aggregation is complete. The process of mutation and conversion is under way, Das said.         
	We will give the land to all interested firms, and Infosys and Wipro will be given priority, he added.        
	Infosys had been keen on a Bengal debut since 2004, but the price of land in Rajarhat proved a stumbling block.        
	The states offer finally appeared suitable to Infosys and Wipro last year, when they signed memorandums of understanding for 90 acres each.         
	But the state has not been able to deliver the land yet.        
	Today, Gopalakrishnan said: Yes, we are committed but want to wait. We cannot outline any timeframe for the proposed facility in Bengal.        
	Asked about the ministers land promise, he added: We are in touch with the government, but cannot give any specific timeframe (for the Bengal project).         
	Gopalakrishnan blamed the global meltdown for the change of plan. We prefer to wait till the market stabilises.        
	Indias second largest IT company had earlier said it would not spend on new infrastructure this year.         
	The Infosys MD and Wipro executive director Suresh Senapaty held separate meetings with Das today.        
	Wipro did not say in as many words as Infosys that it did not want any land at the moment, but the go-slow plan was apparent.        
	I cant commit anything on the (Bengal) project, but we are one of the happy customers here in Bengal, Senapaty said. Slowdown has affected plans across the whole spectrum of the company. When we get back to recovery and hiring people, Bengal is a good location for us to add headcount.        
	Infosys and Wipro had earlier wanted to invest about Rs 500 crore each in the projects.         
	Das said ITC Infotech had also expressed interest in the 600-acre hub the government was getting ready in Rajarhat.        
	Buddha bypassed        
	None of the corporate bigwigs in Calcutta today called on Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, a first in his eight years as chief minister, according to some.        
	Among the others here today were Ganesh Natarajan, vice-chairman of Zensar Te- chnologies and head of the CII national council on IT, Arup Dasgupta, MD of Metalogic Systems, Kurush N. Grant, divisional chief executive of ITC, and Ramamurthy Sivakumar, Intel MD.        
	The chief minister was busy with party programmes for the better part of the day and an official of his secretariat said: Top officials do not usually seek appointments with the chief minister when in the city to attend business programmes or those organised by chambers of commerce.

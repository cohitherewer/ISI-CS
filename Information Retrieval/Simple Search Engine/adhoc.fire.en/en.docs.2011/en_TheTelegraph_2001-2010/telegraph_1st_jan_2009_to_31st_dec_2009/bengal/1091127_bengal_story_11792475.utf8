          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Nov. 26: Legislators of the Trinamul Congress and the CPM used the Lok Sabha to accuse each other of fostering violence in Bengal, leading to an adjournment of the House, hours after their workers clashed in Khanakul.         
	Trinamul chief whip Sudip Bandopadhyay interrupted proceedings during Zero Hour to accuse the CPM of killing his partys workers across the state, citing todays violence.         
	Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjee, who is the rail- way minister, did not join her MPs but did not stop them, either.         
	Within seconds, Bando-padhyay was joined by other party MPs  Kalyan Banerjee, Tapas Pal and Satabdi Roy  who screamed out allegations against the CPM. They were also joined by a few Congress MPs such as Nirmal Khatri and Jagdambika Pal.         
	A home ministry team should visit Bengal immediately to see the kind of violence that is rampant in the state because of the CPM, Bandopadhyay shouted.         
	CPM leader Basudeb Acharya immediately responded by saying that there was no need for any such step from the home ministry. The response opened the floodgates, with all CPM members joining him in contesting Trinamuls allegations.

	Calcutta, March 26 (PTI): The Bengal government has offered Nayachar for disposal of silt after dredging navigational channels of the Calcutta Port Trust.        
	At a meeting in Delhi, the state had offered Nayachar but the Dredging Corporation of India and the port trust said it was not a viable option for technical reasons.

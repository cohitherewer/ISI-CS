The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CPM points to prudence
                                                                                                               CPM points to prudence
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 22: The CPM today did not laud the governments move of facilitating bail for 15 suspected Maoists in exchange for the freedom of Atindranath Dutta, but also said that whatever was thought prudent was done.        
	I have nothing specific to comment on the governments move. Whatever was thought prudent in order to run the administration, the government has done it, CPM state secretary Biman Bose said, asked if government had succumbed to the rebels.         
	If Bose left something unsaid, his Front partners filled the gaps. No doubt, the government had to make a retreat to save the life of the abducted police officer. The Maoist tactics landed the government in a tricky situation and compelled it to compromise. The public sentiment would have gone against the government if the hostage had been killed following a security crackdown, RSP veteran and PWD minister Kshiti Goswami said.        
	Yesterday, Bose had hinted on the dilemma the government and party had been facing when he said that priority would be given to secure the release of Dutta, but the government would have to take proper legal action against those charged with creating anarchy.        
	Betraying the worry that the Maoists had gained publicity for releasing Dutta unharmed and also secured the release of some of their tribal supporters, Bose today said: Todays incident doesnt prove that the Maoists have a human face. They have killed many innocent and poor people earlier. More than half of their victims were from Scheduled Tribe and Scheduled Caste communities.        
	Asked if the 22 people released today should have been given bail earlier before the Maoists could have made it an issue, Bose evaded giving a direct answer. I dont know the details. The police might have detained them for interrogation, he said.         
	The change of mood in the administration was evident yesterday after Kishanji mounted pressure on the government, demanding the release of innocent and elderly tribal women through the media, some CPM leaders said.         
	Yesterday morning, director-general of police Bhupinder Singh said the state would take up the Maoist challenge, but in the evening chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti hinted at willingness for talks with the rebels.         
	The CPM leaders said the chief minister spoke to Union home minister P. Chidambaram last night and apparently got his nod for the release of the 22. The government got in touch with the Maoists through some back channel asking for their list of innocent men and women undertrials.         
	PC rejects PoW label        
	Union home minister P. Chidambaram today rejected Maoist leader Kishanjis claim that Atindranath Dutta was a prisoner of war but said the political view of the Left wing rebels could be accommodated in a democratic system.         
	They are using the words like PoW. We reject that, (it is) unacceptable in a democratic and republic system.... Let me assume that the CPI (Maoist) has a particular political view. That can also be accommodated in the democratic system.

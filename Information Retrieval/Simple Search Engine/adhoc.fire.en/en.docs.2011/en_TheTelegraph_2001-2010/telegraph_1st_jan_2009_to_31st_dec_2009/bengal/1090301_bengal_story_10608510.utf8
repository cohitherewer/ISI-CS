The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Wall ruined, with permission
                                                                                                               Wall ruined, with permission
                                  The Telegraph had on Friday deliberately defaced a wall in Sealdah with poll graffiti using easily removable material. The wall was wiped and washed clean on Saturday. This was done to demonstrate how your walls can be defaced, with the sanction of the Election Commission, if you give permission to any political party to do so.

	With The Telegraph leading a campaign against graffiti and the chief electoral officer (CEO) of Bengal, Debashis Sen, urging houseowners not to give permission if you care enough for the appearance of the walls and your building, political parties must think twice before using strong-arm tactics to sully walls.        
	Will you allow your walls to be defaced, we had asked our readers. Several nays  and not one aye  have flooded our inbox.         
	As a citizen, I feel very strongly against graffiti and I certainly hope it stops. I sincerely hope that pollution of all sorts stop and we live in a more beautiful Calcutta someday.        
	Nabamita Das               
	Why should anyone allow the walls of their houses to be defaced? I will definitely not allow the walls of my house to be destroyed. If politicians think this is a good way to advertise themselves, they must start from their own homes; after all charity begins at home!

	I, as a houseowner in the city, wouldnt like my walls painted with political graffiti. Its another thing whether I would be able to withstand the pressure from my neighbourhood political dadas.         
	Debashis Sen has said that the common man, united for a common cause, can make miracles happen. I hope to see that miracle take place this time.

	We are pained to see that the Election Commission has preferred to side with the political parties instead of the common Calcuttan. The clause of taking permission from houseowners is a farce because peace-loving citizens will be forced to agree to the disfiguring of their houses when muscle-flexing political goons knock at their doors.        
	Kalyan Mitra               
	Nobody should allow defacing of walls. I am not going to, in spite of political pressure. How many leaders have graffiti on their own walls?        
	Azeem Nawaaz              
	I will never allow my wall to be painted by political parties for elections and I will also request the entire city to protest against it.        
	Md. Azharuddin              
	If the parties have become so adept at wielding the brush, give them some of the old eyesore buildings along the main thoroughfares to paint on. The government can sponsor the paint. This way, everyone gains  the political parties give vent to their artistic urges, the houseowners save money, and the city gets a facelift!

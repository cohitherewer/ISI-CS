The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CM sees help for rebels
                                                                                                               CM sees help for rebels
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 23: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today accused the Trinamul Congress and its allies of pressuring the Centre to withdraw security forces from Lalgarh in a bid to help the rebels.        
	Addressing a CPM rally to mourn transport minister Subhas Ckakrabortys death, he said: Why is the Opposition asking for the withdrawal of the central forces? Whose interest is it serving? They (the Opposition) are silent on the daily killing of our party comrades by the Maoists. Neither have they raised any alarm over the murder of a doctor, nurse and poll personnel. Were these lives worthless?         
	He described the Trinamul-Congress combine as a peculiar alliance and accused it of conniving with secessionist forces both in south and north Bengal. But he only called Mamata Banerjees party, the main challenger to the CPMs might, bhayankar (demonic).

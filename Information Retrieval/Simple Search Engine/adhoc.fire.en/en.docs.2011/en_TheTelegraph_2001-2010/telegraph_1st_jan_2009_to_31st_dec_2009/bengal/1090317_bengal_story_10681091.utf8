The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Murmurs of rebellion in Congress
                                                                                                               Murmurs of rebellion in Congress
          BARUN GHOSH                              
	Calcutta, March 16: The election campaign has begun in Krishnagar with Bengali film star Tapas Pal at the centre of it but Congress leader Shankar Singh couldnt care less. He is an angry man.        
	Why me alone? Many Congress leaders and ordinary workers are staying away from Trinamul Congress candidates campaign. Our workers grievances are genuine. Trinamul has fielded candidates for the two Nadia seats  Krishnagar and Ranaghat  despite our strong presence in the municipalities and panchayats there, Singh complained.         
	He alleged that the party brass accepted Mamata Banerjees candidates ignoring the demands of their own ranks for the sake of an alliance.        
	The story is the same in Arambagh, Hooghly. Congress leader Abdul Mannan, in his mid-60s, said: All of us were disheartened at the way the alliance was worked out. We were offered unwinnable seats across Bengal. Some state Congress leaders (read Subrata Mukherjee) had once targeted Shankar (Singh) and me for speaking up against the pact. Now they have realised that it amounts to abject surrender.        
	There are such angry faces across the state.         
	In Birbhum, where Trinamul has fielded actress Satabdi Roy, district Congress leader Swapan Ghosh has decided to contest as an Independent.        
	Dissidence in the Congress over candidates is not new in Bengal and its impact varies from one election to another. Whether the murmurs of revolt will be a major factor will become clearer as campaigning picks up.        
	The Trinamul leadership is aware of the disgruntlement among Congress workers in the districts. Mamata has told the candidates to send their complaints in writing so she can take them up with Pranab Mukherjee, said a Trinamul functionary.        
	Mamata is likely to meet (state Congress president) Pranab by the end of this week to discuss a joint a campaign.        
	The beleaguered Congress is also facing revolt from leaders who have trained guns on the high command in public for disregarding their recommendations while choosing candidates.        
	Jalpaiguri Congress chief Biswaranjan Sarkar complained that the leaders chose former IAS officer Sukhbilas Barma for the seat ignoring our choice, Mani Kumar Darmal, a hardcore party worker.         
	In Murshidabad, the party is virtually split over the no- minee. District president and Behrampore MP Adhir Chowdhury wants Abu Hena, the MLA from Lalbag, to replace sitting MP Mannan Hossain, who has the backing of the partys rank and file.        
	It is one of the three seats for which the party is yet to name a candidate. The others are Malda North and Darjeeling.        
	Impasse over SUCI        
	Pranab has asked his party leaders to leave it to Mamata to persuade partner SUCI to withdraw its nine candidates fighting the Congress.

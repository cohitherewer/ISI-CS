The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Rise above politics: CM
                                                                                                               Rise above politics: CM
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 28: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today called upon those running rural bodies to rise above politics for the sake of development.         
	I feel bad when I hear about corruption in panchayats. I want those overseeing the rural bodies to rise above political interference while delivering the goods to the people, he said at a workshop for panchayat functionaries in Calcutta.        
	The chief minister also wanted the panchayats not to allow contractors to call the shots. Dont allow contractor raj. How will you work if they dictate terms? he said.         
	Although panchayat func-tionaries from the Left and Congress-run boards attended the meet, those from the Trinamul Congress skipped it on Mamata Banerjees orders.         
	We cant share a platform with the chief minister, whatever the programme. That is our partys principle, said Shamima Sheikh, the chief of the Trinamul-run South 24-Parganas zilla parishad.

	Bankura, March 26: Students of a private engineering college in Bishnupur yesterday ransacked property on the campus and clashed with police at night to protest an alleged assault by a teacher on a first-year student.         
	On Tuesday, the first-year IT student of the Mallabhum Institute of Technology was allegedly pushed by a teacher while chatting loudly with others outside the class.         
	About 100 first year students started agitating soon after. On Wednesday, they blocked the institute entrance. They would not allow students to enter, said Sunil Roy, the college head who resigned in disgust.        
	In order to pacify them, the college sat for talks with students representatives. The authorities promised that the teacher in question would not take first-year classes. But after the talks, the students damaged buses on the campus and broke 30 computers.        
	The college then called the police. In the clash that followed, several students were hurt. Ten were arrested.

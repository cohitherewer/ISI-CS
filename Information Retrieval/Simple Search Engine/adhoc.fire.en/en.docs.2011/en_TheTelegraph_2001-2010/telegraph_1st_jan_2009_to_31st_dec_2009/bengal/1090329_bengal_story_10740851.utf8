                                                                                                               Film protest
                            
	Calcutta, March 28: About 20 people, including monks, stopped the screening of the Bengali film Challenge in a Nabadwip cinema today, protesting the use of a remixed version of the kirtan Bhaja Gouranga.        
	Armed with traditional instruments and microphones, a group sang kirtans in front of Sri Guru cinema and shooed the audience away. They felt the song had been used in an obscene manner, said R.N. Kundu, the owner of theatre.

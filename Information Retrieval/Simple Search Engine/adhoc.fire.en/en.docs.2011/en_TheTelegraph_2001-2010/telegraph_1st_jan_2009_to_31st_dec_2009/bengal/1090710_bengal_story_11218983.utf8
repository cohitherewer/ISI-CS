          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, July 9: A Jet Airways passenger has alleged that he found his luggage had been tampered with and gold jewellery stolen from a suitcase when he claimed the bags at Dum Dum airport today.        
	Swambhu Saran Mitra, who flew in from Agartala at 6.30pm, said he found that two of his four bags had broken locks and torn Jet Airways seals when they emerged on the conveyor belt. One bag had a lock missing but the Jet Airways sticker was intact. But the VIP suitcase lock was broken and the sticker also torn, Mitra, who had gone to Agartala with his family, said.        
	He contacted the airlines security personnel. I opened the bag and suitcase in front of them. The jewellery box that was at the bottom of the suitcase was on top and empty, said Mitra, who works in Dubai. The box had a gold necklace, two pairs of gold earrings and a gold bangle. The jewellery will be worth at least Rs 1.5 lakh.         
	The airline has said it will probe Mitras case. The CISF has confirmed that the locks were found broken.

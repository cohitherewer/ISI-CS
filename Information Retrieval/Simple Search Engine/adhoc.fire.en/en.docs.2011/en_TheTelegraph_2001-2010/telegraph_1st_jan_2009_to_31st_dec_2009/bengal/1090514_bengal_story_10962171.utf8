	BUDDHADEB BHATTACHARJEE        
	What time did he step out of home?        
	9.06am. From Palm Avenue, he went straight to the state CPM headquarters on Alimuddin Street.         
	At 11.20, he left for Writers. He spent an hour and a half there and left for his polling booth at Patha Bhavan School at 1.03pm        
	Was his dress any different from other days?         
	No, the usual white dhuti-panjabi        
	Were any of his family members with him when he went to vote?        
	He went alone. His wife and daughter voted at 12.45pm at the same booth, No. 108, room No. 4         
	How long did it take him to reach the booth?        
	About seven minutes        
	How far was the booth from his home?        
	About 250 metres        
	Did he wave at people on the way?         
	He reached the polling centre at 1.10pm, appearing grim, and looked straight ahead while walking into the school building. On the way, he hand-brushed his hair.         
	Just before entering, he asked a BSF commandant which way his voting room was        
	Were slogan-shouting supporters around?        
	None. Only a group of photo-graphers shouted Buddhababu, Buddhababu, urging him to look at them so they could get the best angle        
	Did he stand in a queue?        
	There was only one person voting in room No. 4 at the time. Bhattacharjee smiled at some TV journalists waiting inside and took out his voter I-card, which the polling officer did not look at.         
	Then he signed on the electoral roll, had his finger marked with the indelible ink and pressed the button        
	Who was the man ahead of him?         
	Kaushal Sahu, 49, a driver. He refused to say which party he supports        
	Did Sahu have a word with the chief minister?        
	No. But he did a namaste with folded hands and Bhattacharjee reciprocated        
	How did it feel to vote with the chief minister?         
	He is the malik of the entire state, so it was a privilege to be voting with him, Sahu said        
	Who was the person immediately behind?         
	Medicine dealer Pankaj Das, 52. He neither exchanged a word with the chief minister nor did a namaste         
	Where did Bhattacharjee go after voting?   
	Home.

	What time did she step out of home to vote?        
	Less than half an hour before close of polling, at 4.34pm.         
	She spent the day at home. At 12.22, she stepped out, saw her car parked under the shamiana where reporters were meant to be seated and hollered at the driver. The car was removed. Then she proceeded to her office adjoining her home, to monitor the elections         
	Was she wearing anything different?         
	No, the usual off-white taanter sari, with a white blouse        
	Who accompanied her to the polling booth?        
	MLA Madan Mitra        
	Did she walk down?        
	She drove to the polling booth located at Mitra Institute on Harish Mukherjee Road in her black Hyundai Santro               
	How far was the booth?        
	Less than a kilometre from her home        
	How long did it take her to reach the booth?        
	Four minutes        
	Did she wave at people on the way?         
	No, but she did wave at supporters who had gathered in large numbers near the polling station. She walked the last 50 yards to the booth, cordoned by Rapid Action Force personnel. At the entrance of Mitra Institute, she stood for 15 seconds as photographers clicked away        
	What did her supporters do?        
	Didi, Didi, they screamed as she stepped in and stepped out. Many women who had turned up along with their children asked her to bless them. Mamata obliged.        
	Did she stand in a queue?        
	There was none when she reached the room         
	Was there any other voter in the polling station?         
	T. Chakraborty, a 67-year-old chartered accountant, would have bumped into her had he come a minute earlier. He saw her taking the car. I have been voting here for 30 years, but this is a first, Chakraborty said         
	After voting, what?        
	Home, for a news conference.        
	One tight slap and a consoling arm  
	A fan got one straight in the face. He was part of a group of supporters preventing photographers from getting close to her. Let the photographers do their work. They have been out since morning. Before getting into her car, Mamata put her arm round the 25-year-old whom she had slapped. Dont stop people who are doing their work, she consoled him

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Mamata admits trios CPM link
                                                                                                               Mamata admits trios CPM link
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Mamata during the TV interview                                  
	Calcutta, Sept. 9: Mamata Banerjee today virtually admitted knowing for some time a section of her partys involvement with the CPM in land deals in Rajarhat.         
	Yesterday, she had expelled former Rajarhat MLA Tanmay Mandal and two other Trinamul Congress functionaries from the party.        
	In an interview to STAR Ananda tonight, Mamata said: It is true that Tanmay Mandal was a (Trinamul) MLA. But the CPM had taken them (the expelled trio) into their confidence. That is the way the CPM works.        
	 The Trinamul chief added that it was the CPMs style to either tempt the Opposition or threaten it.         
	She said she had been able to control 99 per cent of this hobnobbing with the CPM for gains, but 1 per cent remained to be done. I have been able to control 99 per cent of this. Its no small job. The 1 per cent is always around in all political parties. But that has to be controlled as well.         
	Referring to the expul- sions, Mamata said: We take action only when there is reaction.        
	She claimed that Trinam-ul learnt about the hobnobbing when CPM dissidents started coming out of the party. We started cross-checking, there was an inquiry committee and a disciplinary committee which took the action.        
	Asked by a viewer why no action had been taken against her party MLA from Bhangar, Arabul Islam, whose brother Sirajul was allegedly a member of land shark Gaffar Mollahs gang, and whether this was because he was from the minority community, Mamata said: Arabuls brother is in the CPM. Such things are out of my hand. Sonia Gandhi son Rahul is in the Congress, while Maneka Gandhis son is in the BJP. What can I do about such things?        
	Asked whether she thinks the Tamil Nadu model  in which the dispensations in power and Opposition share the spoils from a project  had emerged in Rajarhat, Mamata said: Rubbish. I despise such things. Im the last person to follow the Tamil Nadu model.        
	Even for the railways, Mamata, the railway minister, said she was opposed to acquiring land forcibly.        
	For her, the ideal is investors buying non-fertile land directly from owners. The state governments claim that there is only 1 per cent non-fertile land in Bengal is a lie, Mamata said.         
	On Wipro and Infosys having to leave the state because of non-availability of land of their choice, Mamata said: This is not good for the state. If the Tatas could have got cheap land, why couldnt they (be provided cheap land)?        
	She added that only 1,000 acres in Rajarhat would have been enough to ensure many, many industries instead of the 10,000 acres that the government has procured.        
	She stressed that Trinamul had not prevented the Tatas from setting up a factory in Singur. We wanted them to return 400 acres to the farmers and have their factory on 600 acres, Mamata said, adding: Let them give us (the railways) the 1,000 acres, we will pay for it. We will return 400 acres to the farmers and set up a national project, a coach factory, on the remaining 600 acres.        
	There is no reason to be disheartened. There will be an industrial revolution in the state, she added.        
	But what would she have done to keep back Wipro and Infosys had she been in power?         
	There are three things that you dont part with: wife, wisdom and books. If you do, you will never get them back, she said.

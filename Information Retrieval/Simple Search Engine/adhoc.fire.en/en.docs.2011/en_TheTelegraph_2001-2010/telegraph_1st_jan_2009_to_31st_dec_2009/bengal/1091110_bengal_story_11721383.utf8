The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Team to weigh probe demand
                                                                        Tuesday , November 10 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                              Team to weigh probe demand
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 9: The human resource development ministry is awaiting the Prime Ministers nod to a proposal to send a team to Visva-Bharati to find out whether the allegations against the vice-chancellor merit an inquiry, The Telegraph has learnt.         
	Manmohan Singhs approval has been sought because of Visva-Bharatis unique status in higher education and the interest the Prime Minister has taken in it, government sour- ces said. It is the only university in the country with the Prime Minister as an office-bearer. Singh is the chancellor.         
	Vice-chancellor Rajat Kanta Ray has argued his case in the PMO and the HRD ministry and officials here indicated they believed the charges against him could be exaggerated.         
	Ray is not particularly po-pular in the HRD ministry or the University Grants Commission because he allegedly bypasses them and approaches the PMO directly with demands. But officials in both the HRD ministry and the PMO indicated that many of the allegations against him were unsubstantiated.         
	Ray, for instance, is known to be ill and requiring expensive treatment. However, a ma- jor allegation against him is that he spent Rs 10 lakh over three years on treatment.         
	There is no cap on the medical reimbursements of a central university VC and Ray, officials say, has not violated any norm.         
	Another allegation involves promoting Rays kin to posts at the university. But education officials here pointed out that the people he had been accused of backing were senior faculty members with legitimate claims purely on merit.         
	Ray has alleged that he is being targeted for trying to implement reforms recommended by a committee appointed by the Prime Minister.         
	The committee, among other recommendations, had proposed reducing the number of seats reserved at the university for those who studied at the school run by Visva-Bharati.         
	Sections of the alumni, teachers and non-teaching employees are up in arms against the proposal.

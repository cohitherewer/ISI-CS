          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Midnapore, Oct. 15: CPM leaders in West Midnapore today held a public meeting in Goaltore violating Section 144 of the CrPC, a day after Mamata Banerjee charged that the ruling party always cited prohibitory orders whenever Trinamul Congress leaders wanted to visit Lalgarh.        
	Goaltore town is about 25km from Lalgarh, where too Section 144 is in force as also in Binpur, Belpahari and parts of Salboni and Jhargram  areas known as Maoist strongholds.        
	The meeting called by the Goaltore zonal committee this afternoon was attended by Paschimanchal Unnayan affairs minister Susanta Ghosh and West Midnapore district CPM secretary Dipak Sarkar.        
	Police said Section 144 was violated.         
	We have started a case, said Manoj Verma, the superintendent of police.        
	Addressing a 2,000-strong rally at the Goaltore College ground, Sarkar called upon people to come out and resist the Maoists.         
	Enough is enough. We will not tolerate the Maoists any longer. Please come out and build up a resistance against the Maoists. If they kill one of you then kill two of them, Sarkar shouted.        
	He also called upon the women to come out with their bonti (a sharp instrument used to cut vegetables).         
	I call upon the women to come out with their bonti and katari to resist the Maoists. I also call upon the tribal people to resist the Maoists with bows and arrows. Organise people in every village against the Maoists, Sarkar told the rally.

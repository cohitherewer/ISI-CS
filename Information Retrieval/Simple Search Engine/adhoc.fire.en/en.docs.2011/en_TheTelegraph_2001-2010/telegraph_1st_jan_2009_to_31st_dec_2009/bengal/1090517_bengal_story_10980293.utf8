The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Shock amp; awe at Alimuddin 
                                                                                                               Shock amp; awe at Alimuddin 
          KINSUK BASU                       Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee leaves the party office at 8.30pm. (Aranya Sen)                          
	Calcutta, May 16: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, like any other day, walked into the Muzaf- far Ahmed Bhavan around nine this morning.         
	Biman Bose followed his routine and came down to his first-floor office from his second-floor-room at the Alimuddin Street headquarters before the clock struck 8.30.         
	For the CPM Top Two in Bengal, it was a normal start to what soon became a very abnormal day.         
	Like the staid setting in CPM offices  characterised by huge portraits of Marx, Lenin and Stalin, wooden tables and chairs and liquor tea  its leaders know how to hide emotions. But their skills failed to hide the shock and awe dealt by the poll tally.        
	I have never seen the party office so silent on a result day, said a party member, who remained glued to the television set till 10.30am.         
	No chance We are routed, he said while leaving the party office around 11.30.         
	By then, the vote swing had started affecting the mood at the three-storey building with a red flag fluttering atop. Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty was the first to admit the debacle. I have nothing to say. We did not see this coming, he said while leaving.         
	At the first-floor secretariat room, his party colleagues  including Bhattacharjee and Bose  were tracking result updates on TV. Secretariat members like Madan Ghosh and Surjya Kanta Mishra were calling up district leaders for details on leads.         
	Defeat is part and parcel of the electoral game the challenge is to move ahead and assess the situation, said a state committee member.         
	According to him, the performance analysis started after the first signs of the swing in favour of the Trinamul-Congress alliance. As the analyses and teleconferences with comrades at AK Gopalan Bhavan in Delhi continued, Bhattacharjee broke from his daily routine of lunching at home and stayed back at the party office.         
	There was no word on food. We kept serving them rounds of liquor tea, said a comrade, who also served tea to film director Anindita Sarbadhicari  in a red tee and jeans  and actor Arindam Sil  in a starched kurta and white pyjama  who were in the first-floor conference room.         
	(Kabir) Suman jitchhey? Anindita could not believe her eyes as the TV channels flashed the singers lead over Sujan Chakraborty in Jadavpur. It is bad news in Calcutta North, too, Arindam murmured.         
	With no signs of a recovery, Arindam, Anindita and even some senior leaders started leaving the party office after 3pm.         
	Bose and Bhattacharjee stayed back till evening and discussed the debacle behind closed doors.

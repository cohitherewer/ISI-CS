          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Midnapore, Sept. 19: Four Maoists suspected to have shot dead a school teacher in his classroom five days ago were arrested today in Lalgarh.        
	Police said all four were members of an action squad of the CPI (Maoist) and involved in the murder of Kartick Mahato, the 36-year-old teacher, on September 14.        
	Of the four, Lakshman Baskey, from whose house the other three were also arrested, is a member of the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities.        
	The three others arrested were Baskeys son Rajendranath, 18, his brother Ranjit, 30, and Baburam Mandi, 18, who is from Raipur in Bankura.        
	Mahato, a CPM branch committee member, was caught by the collar by the four Maoists, who shot him dead in Barajamda primary school as stunned students stared.         
	Preliminary investigation reveals that the four action squad members murdered the teacher. We are probing if they were involved in other murders in Lalgarh in recent times, said West Midnapore police chief Manoj Verma.         
	He said the joint forces raided the house of Baskey in Barajamda.         
	We have come to know that the four had huddled in the same house before September 14 to plot the murder of the school teacher. After the murder, they fled but returned a day or two ago. This time also, they had gathered to target another CPM leader, said a senior official associated with the probe.

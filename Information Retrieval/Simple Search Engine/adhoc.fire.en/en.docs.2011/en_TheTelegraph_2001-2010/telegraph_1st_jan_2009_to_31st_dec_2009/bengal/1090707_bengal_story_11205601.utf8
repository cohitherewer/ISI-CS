The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Rs 1000cr Aila aid to state govt
                                                                                                               Rs 1000cr Aila aid to state govt
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           A woman in front of her hut in the Sunderbans, flattened by cyclone Aila. File picture                                  
	New Delhi, July 6: Pranab Mukherjee today proposed to allocate Rs 1,000 crore for Aila relief to the Bengal government as sought by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, a move likely to please the states Left Front regime more than ally Mamata Banerjee.         
	Three days after the Trinamul Congress chief targeted Left frailties in her railway budget, the finance minister indicated that the UPA would not bow to pressures from allies in tackling calamities.         
	While immediate interim relief (for Aila victims) has been provided from the calamity relief fund... for rebuilding the damaged infrastructure... I propose to allocate Rs 1,000 crore, he told Parliament.         
	Bhattacharjee had requested the Prime Minister to release Rs 1,000 crore from the national calamity and contingency fund for reconstruction and relief in areas hit by the cyclone on May 25.         
	But Mamata and her party had demanded that the central funds be disbursed directly to panchayat officials, bypassing the state government. The Trinamul chief had said that any money provided to the CPM-led state government would only reach party supporters.         
	Trinamul leaders had also questioned the Rs 1,000-crore figure quoted by Bhattacharjee, alleging that it had been arrived at without a detailed survey of the damaged areas.         
	However, the Prime Minister had indicated he was averse to bypassing the state government in disbursal of relief  stressing that the Centres relations with Bengal were governed by the Constitution.         
	Around Rs 300 crore worth of relief has already been sent to the state from the national calamity fund and from various central ministries, including some where the junior ministers are from Trinamul.         
	Most of this relief has been distributed through the state government, though the railways  under Mamata  has provided some directly.         
	Todays Rs 1,000-crore proposal may not be a snub to Mamata, but central sources said this amount, too, would be disbursed to Aila victims through the state government.         
	Trinamul leaders conceded that the announcement in todays budget was not in line with what Mamata wanted.         
	But honestly, none of us had any doubt that the Prime Minister and Pranab Mukherjee would stick to tradition and route the money through the state government, a Trinamul leader said.         
	The Bengal finance minister said the state was happy, but more was needed to repair or rebuild the thousands of kilometres of damaged embankments. We are happy about the allocation of Rs 1,000 crore, Asim Dasgupta said at Writers Buildings.        
	According to the state governments estimates, it will take around Rs 10,000 crore more to rebuild the embankments. The cyclone had affected over 65 lakh people and claimed 138 lives.        
	Mukherjees proposed allocation is based on a report presented by a central team that toured the areas worst hit by Aila. Officials clarified that it was in addition to the amount already sanctioned.

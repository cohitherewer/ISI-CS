The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Front in a fix over candidates
                                                                                                               Front in a fix over candidates
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Jan. 30: The Left Front may not be able to finalise its Lok Sabha candidates by February 8, when it kicks off its election campaign, because the job is proving doubly tough in the face of serious competition and a seat recast.         
	It may not be possible to finalise the list and announce it at the Brigade rally (on February 8). Discussions are on with district leaderships. Our front partners are also holding in- ternal talks, said party state secretariat member Benoy Konar.         
	The CPMs allies conceded they were vulnerable in 10 to 13 seats.        
	The Forward Bloc brass today decided to meet their leaders in North 24-Parganas, Purulia and Cooch Behar between February 15 and 20 to finalise candidates in three seats.         
	CPM insiders said though the party had decided to change some of its 26 MPs, which had become a political imperative as well as a legal obligation after delimitation and dereservation of several constituencies, the exercise was fraught with dangers like stoking faction feuds.         
	The focus is on the fate of Tamluk MP Lakshman Seth, the man who had triggered the land war in Nandigram with an untimely land acquisition notice and, according to some in the CPM and its allies, helped Mamata Banerjee bounce back in Singur.         
	A section of the Left wants him dropped to minimise the effect of the Nandigram factor across the state and to improve prospects in Tamluk.         
	Another section, however, believes dropping Seth would only add to the Oppositions ammunition. Election results dont depend on individuals, but party policies. It was not Lakshman who was defeated in the Nandigram Assembly bypoll, but the CPI candidate, said Konar.         
	His removal could be perceived as conceding defeat before the battle and may further demoralise cadres, bruised after a series of setbacks in rural and civic polls.         
	A section of anti-Seth leaders also fears sabotage, knowing his grip over the organisation in East Midnapore.         
	While some party leaders spoke of the norm to drop two-time Rajya Sabha MPs and four-timers among Lok Sabha candidates, Konar said: We also have to consider the MPs role in Parliament and whether they are indispensable.        
	This may help eight-timer Basudeb Acharya (Bankura) and seven-timer Rupchand Pal (Hooghly).         
	However, another eight-timer, Hannan Molla (Uluberia), may be dropped to spare him for his organisational role in north India, especially Rajasthan, where the party has won three Assembly seats.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 13: Mamata Banerjee will relaunch her movement for the return of 400 acres from the abandoned Nano project site in Singur.        
	The decision was taken after officials of Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (BHEL) visited the place yesterday to explore the possibility of setting up a power plant.         
	Last night, hours after the BHEL recce, Mamata told her aides that the agitation would be relaunched under the banner of the Save Farmland Committee, which had spearheaded the Singur protests against the Tata Motors project.         
	We shall have to relaunch the movement for the return of 400 acres to the unwilling farmers, Mamata was quoted as saying by an aide.         
	The Trinamul Congress chief had made the demand on TV, too, telling STAR Ananda last night: The BHEL factory can come up on 600 acres but 400 acres have to be returned to those from whom land was taken forcibly.        
	A Trinamul general secretary said Mamata would discuss the details of the fresh agitation at the partys core committee meeting on Monday.         
	Key Save Farmland Committee members will attend the meeting. Its convener, Pradip Banerjee, has started contacting other members at Mamatas instance. I have started talking to our members on re-launching the agitation next month. Mamata has given me her nod.        
	The government iterated its stand that no land would be given back. Theres no question of returning even an acre. According to the (land acquisition) rules and a Supreme Court verdict, the land has to be given to a government department and used for a public purpose or auctioned off to the highest bidder. We cant give back the 400 acres as demanded by the Trinamul chief, land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah said.        
	He pointed out that the Singur land  997 acres  was still with the Tatas. If the Tatas give back the land, they will have to be paid back the price, the rent and compensation they may demand.

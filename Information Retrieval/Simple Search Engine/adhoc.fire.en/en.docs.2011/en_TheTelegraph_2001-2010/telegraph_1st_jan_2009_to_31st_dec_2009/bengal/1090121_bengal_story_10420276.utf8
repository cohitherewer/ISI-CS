	Jan. 20: The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha accepted the chief ministers offer for talks in Calcutta on a day a minister from the Dooars raised in the cabinet concerns about ethnic clashes in the region.        
	A seven-member Morcha team headed by its general secretary Roshan Giri will meet Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at Writers Buildings at 6pm tomorrow.         
	Chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti said the hill outfit had agreed to the talks without any precondition.         
	We hope the meeting will end the prevailing tension in the Dooars, he added.        
	In Darjeeling, Giri said: We have decided to meet the chief minister and inform him about the state of affairs  the plight of our supporters and local leaders and the violence sparked by some organisations to create tension in the region.        
	Adivasis living in the Dooars have been resisting the Morchas attempts to hold rallies there. The standoff has resulted in frequent clashes and police have had to set up barricades, use tear gas and chase mobs to prevent the two groups from coming face to face.        
	Last night, suspected Morcha supporters ransacked an Adivasi leaders house in Banarhat. In retaliation, the tribals stopped a car and torched it. Police could not say who owned it. Houses of Morcha supporters were also set on fire.        
	Junior public works minister Manohar Tirkey, an Adivasi himself, wanted to know at the cabinet meeting why the government was not being able to contain the ethnic clashes. They are taking place every day in various parts of the Dooars. This is a matter of serious concern. I want to know what the government is doing to contain the violence, Tirkey was quoted as saying.         
	A minister said: Apparently embarrassed by Tirkeys question, the chief minister repeated several times that he had already written to Morcha chief Bimal Gurung for talks and strengthened the local administration to avert untoward incidents.         
	Bhattacharjee told Tirkey he was in regular touch with the Centre and that three companies of central forces had been deployed in the Dooars. Another is expected soon.        
	The Adivasi Vikas Parishad, which has been spearheading the anti-Morcha agitation, expressed hope that the impasse would end through talks.         
	The Morcha press and publicity secretary, Binay Tamang, said: We want normality to be restored in the Dooars.        
	The hill outfit wants the Dooars, the Terai, Siliguri and Darjeeling in the Gorkhaland that it has been demanding.        
	The Jalpaiguri district administration held a peace meeting at Banarhat police station today, which Morcha and Adivasi representatives attended.

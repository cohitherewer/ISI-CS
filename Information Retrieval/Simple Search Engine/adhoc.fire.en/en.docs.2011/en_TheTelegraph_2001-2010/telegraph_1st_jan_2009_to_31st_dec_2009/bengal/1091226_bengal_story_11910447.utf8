	Burdwan, Dec. 25: Four policemen were injured this morning when warring Trinamul Congress and CPM activists hurled bombs at them in Burdwans Mangalkot.        
	Additional superintendent of police S.R. Mishra said a sub-inspector and three constables were admitted to the Katwa Subdivisional Hospital. Two Trinamul supporters were arrested after a large number of crude mobs, stuffed in 16 bags, were found in the rented house of one of them.         
	The clash site, Bonpara village, is Trinamul-dominated and the party also runs the local Jhilu gram panchayat. The election to the managing committee of Jhilu High School is scheduled for January 3. The CPM controls the panel now and there is tension in the area over the polls.

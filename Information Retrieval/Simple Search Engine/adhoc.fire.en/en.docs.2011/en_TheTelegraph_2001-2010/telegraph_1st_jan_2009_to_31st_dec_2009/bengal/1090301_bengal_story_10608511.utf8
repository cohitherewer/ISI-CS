The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Rush to Dhaka, 88 people on train 
                                                                                                               Rush to Dhaka, 88 people on train 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 28: The Calcutta-Dhaka train, which usua-lly goes near-empty, had 88 passengers today when it ran for the first time since trouble broke out in the neighbouring country.         
	Several Bangladeshis brought their journey dates forward to reach their families fast at a time of crisis.         
	Maitree Express will have 46 passengers on Sunday, a railway official said. Many passengers, who had booked tickets for Sunday and later dates, cancelled and rebooked on Saturdays train.        
	The train, which leaves Calcutta (Chitpur) station on Saturdays and Sundays, has been recording very low passenger count since its launch on April 14 last year. Railway sources said it barely exceeds 50, less than a fifth of its capacity. The train has two stops on the way, but passengers are not allowed to board there.         
	Dhaka resident Shammi Akhtar, 35, who was here for business, said: I wanted to return home early after hearing about the Bangladesh Rifles mutiny. So I cancelled my booking for Sunday.        
	Hajibullah, 45, a farmer from Chittagong, came for a friends treatment. There are rumours that the BDR-army conflict is spreading, he said.         
	After the rush to return home ends, railway officials suspect, the passenger count will suffer further.        
	The train from Dhaka reached Calcutta around nine tonight with 38 passengers.         
	It had Indians hurrying to safety. I went there for business last week. In Dhaka, I saw army tanks on the road, said Mohammad Asraf.         
	A Bangladeshi passenger took the train to avoid the Petrapole checkpost, usually manned by Bangladesh Rifles jawans. We had heard of trouble in some of the border checkposts, said the young man from Sylhet who studies here.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Run averts train crash
                                                                                                               Run averts train crash
                            
	Raiganj, Sept. 13: A level-crossing guard today ran up the tracks with a red flag to stop a speeding train after realising that the gate he was manning was not working.        
	Uday Chandra Dey jumped off the tracks at the nick of time to save himself and saved many more at the bazaar area at Subhasganj, about 2.5km from Raiganj station.        
	After the train stopped, local residents blocked the tracks on the Radhikapur-Katihar section for three hours protesting negligence at Raiganj station, which controls the locks of three level crossings.         
	At 10.30am, Dey saw Raiganj had given the green signal to the Radhikapur-Katihar passenger, but the lock had not been released for him to insert a key to bring the gate down.         
	I tried to contact Raiganj station. Then I shouted at the people crossing the tracks seeing the gate open. But with the bustle all around, nobody heard me. It was then that I ran, Dey said.

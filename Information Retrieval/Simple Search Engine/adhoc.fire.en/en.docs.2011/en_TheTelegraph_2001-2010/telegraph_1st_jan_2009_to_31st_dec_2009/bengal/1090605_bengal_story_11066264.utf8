                                                                                                               1 clinic, no medicine
          IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                          Gosabas lone health centre. (Bishwarup Dutta)                                  
	Gosaba, June 4: A primary health centre that is supposed to be the lifeline for 2.5 lakh marooned people in Gosaba did not have a packet of oral rehydration solution for nearly 24 hours since yesterday.        
	A nurse scribbled the names of medicines on a piece of paper and asked me to buy them from a pharmacy, said farmer Sandip Sana, who had travelled nearly three hours by boat to admit wife Ruma to the health centre.        
	Ruma, an acute diarrhoea patient, urgently needed fluids but the centre had none. Sandip ran to the nearest pharmacy and bought packets of ORS, a must-have for treatment of enteric diseases, Metrogyl and Cifran, also basic drugs that doctors said any health centre should have.         
	Harishankar Debnath, who owns the pharmacy where Sandip bought the medicines, wasnt surprised though.        
	What do you expect from a health centre that has been one mans fief almost 25 years? he asked. Debnath was referring to block medical officer Girendranath Mondal, who hasnt been transferred for a quarter of a decade.         
	I didnt know that ORS was not available, Mondal, who had not been seen at the centre till this evening, said. I will find out why it happened.         
	A senior official at Swasthya Bhavan in Calcutta said: There is a scarcity of potable water. People are drinking contaminated water. That has led to an outbreak of water-borne diseases. There are reports of enteric and skin diseases, fever, cold and cough.         
	But finance minister Asim Dasgupta, said there is no enteric outbreak.        
	Farmer suicide        
	A paddy farmer committed suicide after Cyclone Aila ruined his crop for which he had run up a debt of Rs 50,000.         
	Gul Mohammad, 42, drank a bottle of pesticide. He entered the house with the empty bottle and told me that he was leaving us.... He said the storm had finished him, said the farmers wife Salekha Bibi.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Too many hearses

	We returned last weekend from an all too brief stay in Italy, the never-never land of Silvio Berlusconi and his enormous ego. The straitjacket of northern European Protestantism would never permit the ongoing antics of this corrupt and, from a distance at least, laughable billionaire, but in Italy, political criticism may be vocal, Latin and loud, yet it is also ineffective. In any case, roughly 50 per cent of the population continues to rejoice in their aging leaders complicated love life, his remarkable hold on the avenues of power and publicity and aspire to similar success. His critics may despise him but are unable or unwilling to fight him, and the end of the G8 summit at the earthquake-ruined LAquila a couple of weeks ago found him crowing again like Peter Pan over his triumph. The truth is that Italy has its problems as the recession bites and unemployment grows, but the Italians thrive on alternative solutions and creative, not to mention illegal, shortcuts to the system that involve an impressive black economy and most people closing their eyes if not to reality, to strict legality.        
	Back here, I find myself regretting that this small country still feels the need to be in the first tier internationally instead of settling for muddling along in a laissez-faire Latin style and avoiding responsibility for others than ourselves. The war in Afghanistan has come home to roost as the hearses carrying the repatriated bodies of teenage soldiers are driven through the silent crowd-lined streets of Wootton Bassett, just a few miles up the road from us in Wiltshire. Yesterday, we heard the eulogies to the highest ranked officer so far to be killed in Helmand province and his widows set face is on the front page of most of the papers this morning.               
	The prime minister, the foreign secretary and their cohorts continue to assure us that our retro adventure in Afghanistan is stopping terror coming again to our shores, and we are torn between our total disbelief and our need now to support our troops fighting a deathly and thankless battle in a foreign field. Scandalously, given the vast sums of money being spent on so disastrous a war, it seems that the troops do not even have the hardware they need for success, always supposing that success was more than an undefined figment of the political imagination. Has anyone read a history book?        
	Rory Stewart, now a still youthful Ryan Family professor of the practice of human rights at Harvard University, with his knowledge of local landscapes and languages in Afghanistan based on a long walk across the country and work both as a diplomat and, more latterly, as founder of the Turquoise Mountain NGO, is one of the few people criticizing the government from a position of in-depth knowledge that is rivalled by few, if any, commentators and no politicians. He sees international policy led by the United States of America towards Afghanistan based on narrow and largely incorrect premises, counter-terrorism and the assumption that a ruined and hostile country with no recognizably concrete political system, economy or institution, remains a threat to international security through the unholy alliance of the Taliban and al-Qaida. As it is, the Taliban are only strengthened by the chaos of a government of no power existing solely on foreign say-so and al-Qaida can covertly organize attacks abroad from far more convenient territory, including inside the US and the United Kingdom.        
	 The solution, based on an assumed moral obligation and an arrogant belief in the Wests ability to succeed against all the odds is excessively ambitious and as wrong-headed as were British views of the threat to India from Russia via Afghanistan in the mid-19th century. Quoting John Lawrence, a son of the Victorian Empire after all, if ever there was one, Stewart concludes with Lawrences opinion that our proper course is not to advance our troops beyond our present border, not to send English officers into the different states of Central Asia, but to put our own house in order, by giving the people of India the best government in our power, by conciliating, as far as practicable, all classes, and by consolidating our resources. In contemporary parlance, Stewart sees the argument as: The presence of Nato special forces, the challenging logistical and political conditions in Afghanistan and lack of technological capacity are likely to impede al-Qaida from posing a significant threat to UK or US national security. Instead, development in south Asia should remain the key strategic priority for the UK government.        
	Stewart is positive that development is the only useful way for the West to continue its determined and unbearably costly involvement in Afghanistan. State-building is a hollow aspiration and one that could only succeed based on an Afghan national movement, not on foreign force. Instead, foreign troops should be reduced to, if the West considered them essential, Special Forces only, to continue to exclude al-Qaida from the country, this process legitimized by generous development projects that may, over 30 years or more, help to balance Afghan society to find its own equilibrium. As he says, this will, to some, seem like a betrayal of good Afghans, leaving society and individuals prey to extremism and abuse, but it is in fact both their and our least bad option albeit understood by only a handful of experts who really understand the country and its history. Unfortunately, few, if any, of our politicians are amongst their number. The rise in the foreign body-count advocates for Stewarts argument with the UK public, but god knows how many more funeral cortges will parade through local streets before this or any government has the moral courage to face facts and the current outcry over shortage of helicopters in the field becomes irrelevant.              
	Meanwhile, as gamesmanship abounds in the Ashes tests, we may all shortly be dying like flies of swine flu. We should no longer visit our general practitioners but stay at home and consult online doctors from our sick beds, and, for fear of infecting others if we go out for prescriptions, receive online remedies, virtual cures, presumably. I cant work out how bad this pandemic really is. Predictions for deaths are similar to those from any other form of flu, although I had not realized how many people do die from the flu virus each year, but the government is enjoying getting us into a panic about something that may be relatively minor. I, for one, have taken up my doctors offer of packets of extraordinarily expensive Tamiflu as insurance, in case a member of the family is struck down and virtual treatments dont measure up. Anyway, I hope to escape, at least until the autumn flu season, by coming to India next week and heading for Kashmir and Ladakh. Srinagar may not be the place for escape from the complications of religious and political rifts, but it remains extraordinarily beautiful, and it is paradise enough looking out over the lake in the early morning. The nail-biting drive up to Leh is a spectacular experience, anticipated by my height-fearing husband, on his first trip, by an escapist stockpiling of sleeping pills, the means of unconscious travel.

	In spite of its self-styled pretensions of being more than a game  and being actually a way of life, a culture  cricket has never quite inspired a historian of the calibre of Edward Gibbons. If it had, there would have been scope to pen a volume at least on the decline and fall of the Australian cricket empire. The green cap is no longer being worn with the kind of swagger that has come to be associated with the confidence of Australian cricketers. This confidence had substance. The Aussies have been used to winning. They won the first Test match ever played, they won the first Ashes series and have been on the winning streak except when Clive Lloyds Caribbeans with a battery of quickies took the entire cricket world by storm. But even Mr Lloyds great success was an indirect tribute to the Aussie way of playing cricket. It is said that it was after the West Indians had been mauled by the pace attack of Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thompson, did Mr Lloyd decide that his arsenal would have only superfast bowlers. The Australian dominance of the cricketing stage has not only been more long-lasting than the Caribbean, but it has also been achieved through more varied means  through superior batsmanship, excellent fielding, outstanding captaincy, and extraordinary bowling, spin and pace.        
	Just as in classical times the history of Europe could easily be written with its focus on Rome, the history of cricket in the 20th century could be penned with its focus on Australian cricket and cricketers. Even the other day, with Glen McGrath and Shane Warne attacking the opposing batsmen, and with Ricky Ponting, Matthew Hayden and Adam Gilchrist tearing apart bowling sides, and with all eleven players catching, running and throwing with fitness and zeal, the Aussies looked invincible against all kinds of attack and even on all kinds of surface. They were occasionally defeated, but they inevitably came back with a vengeance. Recent performances, however, would suggest that the past magic of supreme dominance has evaporated. It is not just the defeats suffered, but the manner of playing.        
	The signs of this decline have been visible but lost in the euphoria of victories. The first sign was a palpable increase in the volume of sledging by Australians. It is true that the Aussies made a fine art of this horrible practice  even though the great Australian players of the past never indulged in it  but in the very recent past this has become all too evident, leading to the suspicion that it was all a cover-up for something else, like falling standards. The other was the almost simultaneous departure of Messrs Warne and McGrath and, a little before that, of Steve Waugh. The Australian team now has competent players but no outstanding talent, save Mr Ponting. For the moment, the long Australian innings seems over. A second innings may be far away. Rome never got a second chance.

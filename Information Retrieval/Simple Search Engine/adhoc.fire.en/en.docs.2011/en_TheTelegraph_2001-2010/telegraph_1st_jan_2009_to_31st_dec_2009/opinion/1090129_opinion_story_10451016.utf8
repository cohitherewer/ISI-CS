The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | BACK AND FORTH
                                                                                                                 BACK AND FORTH                                                    
	The mission that took the minister of external affairs, Pranab Mukherjee, to Colombo was no different from that of the foreign secretary earlier this month, or of several other Indian dignitaries in the past few months. Such visits have not shown any change in response from the Sri Lankan government in accordance with the weight of the visiting dignitary. This shows how intractable the situation is for India. Other than continually prodding its neighbour to show greater sensitivity towards the plight of the ethnic Tamils stuck in the crossfire, there is very little India can do at this moment. There is no international law that enables it to enforce a ceasefire on a foreign government that is determined to clear its territory of elements threatening its authority. No amount of blackmail by the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam can change this fact.         
	There is not much that the international community too can do about the humanitarian crisis in Sri Lanka. The independent press has been muzzled, and severe restrictions imposed on the international aid agencies and journalists make it impossible to ascertain to what extent the governments assertions about no-fire zones and safe passage for the fleeing population are being realized. With about a quarter of a million people trapped now in an area that is around 300 square kilometres, together with little access to food and other resources, the United Nations has warned of high casualties unless the government earnestly tries to prevent such an eventuality. It is not enough to offer guided tours of freed territories or refugee camps to visitors, as the president, Mahinda Rajapakse, has offered to sparring Tamil politicians in India. A little more transparency in relief operations would not only earn Mr Rajapakse the trust of the Tamil population whose future he wants to salvage, but also international sanction for the military operation he promises to carry to its finish.

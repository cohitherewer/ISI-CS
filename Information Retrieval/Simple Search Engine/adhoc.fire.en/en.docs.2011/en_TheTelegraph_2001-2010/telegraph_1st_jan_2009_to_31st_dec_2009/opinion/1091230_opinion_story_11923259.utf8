The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | In the bleak midwinter
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        IN THE BLEAK MIDWINTER                          - A new class war in the corridors of power					 					      WESTMINSTER GLEANINGS      ANABEL LOYD                                                      
	The papers are attempting to put the usual Christmas and end-of-year cheerful spin on the events of 2009 with some difficulty. We are not yet out of recession, unlike most of the rest of Europe, and unemployment statistics are horrific, however the government tells it. General elections are on our doorstep, but there is little sense that anything more than the faces on our television screens are likely to change  in the short term, at least. Meanwhile, whatever is going on in Copenhagen, we are not currently suffering any sort of global warming here, although constant rain, and then terrible floods last month, will certainly be put down to climate change.        
	We are now in the grasp of a real winter freeze, and I am sure there is climate change. But, for the casual observer, it is very difficult to get much of an idea of this changes direction. The worst thing here, let alone in India and in the low-lying areas of the Pacific, is the threat of imminent inundation, whether from the sea or our bursting rivers. I have written before of my thankfulness that, by the merest chance, we live in the English countryside halfway up a hillside with the river hopefully safely enough in the valley below. Things will have to get quite a lot worse before we have water coming through the door, but most of London  where we all spend a good deal of the working week  is low-lying, and no one believes that the Thames Barrier is enough to hold back eventual high water levels.              
	Gordon Brown is clearly working at his best, taking a leading role in the Danish mayhem that has nothing to do with polishing his poor image but appears to come from a genuine understanding of the issues involved in reaching any sort of agreement. No doubt this is when his intellect and a capacity for hard graft over any concerns to his public persona stand us all in good stead, and hats off to him if something worthwhile is achieved, although the general view seems to be that whatever the results they will not be enough ultimately to save the planet. I am not sure that matters immediately so long as Copenhagen is seen only as a beginning of ongoing efforts to make changes, not, as it has been cracked up to be, our one and only chance to save the world for succeeding generations.        
	The prime minister, whatever his role abroad, is unlikely to receive a heros welcome when he gets home. We seem to be going backwards here with a vicious row and the sort of poisonous state of affairs between management and unions at British Airways that is reminiscent of industrial relations in the 1960s and 1970s. I am sure that BA cabin staff, like the miners then, have an axe to grind. Clearly, their management has behaved in a high-handed and possibly incompetent way, allowing the situation to get as far out of hand as it has. But the miners lost not only their jobs but also their whole industry to cheaper competition from elsewhere. BA is in trouble anyway and staff cuts are, one imagines, essential, but a total breakdown between entrenched management and obdurate union leaders threatening a strike over the Christmas holidays, ruining them for thousands of potential passengers, has succeeded in losing public sympathy for the staff. We are, instead, all ranged with Willie Walsh and Mrs Justice Cox, who yesterday imposed an injunction making the strike illegal on the basis of a technical mistake in union balloting. The evil day may have been put off, but it isnt going to be a very happy new year for either staff or management at the company as further battles are fought and passengers hurry to book their flights with almost any other airline.        
	In other ways too, the most unattractive aspects of British social intercourse have lately reared their heads in the corridors of power as Labour and Gordon Brown  who ought to be bigger and better than that, when he is, after all, at the top of the political tree  have appeared to be fomenting a new and rather ridiculous class war. Most people thought that we really had grown out of the sort of politics that sneers publicly at the backgrounds of others or, more specifically, the backgrounds of those who are once again being portrayed as too patrician and privileged to understand life outside the manor house or the rich enclaves of Notting Hill Gate and Belgravia. Both the government and the Opposition are mixed in old-fashioned class terms, and whilst Old Etonians may at the moment, for those with a will to slant appearances, seem to make the Opposition benches look like an old school club, there have been toffs on the Labour benches, too, ever since the early days of the party. The Liberal Democrats are the successors to the old Liberal party that was always a good mixed bag of all classes descending itself from the largely aristocratic radical parliamentarian Whigs.        
	I doubt the class card will wash for long with voters who may quite cheerfully carp about privilege, just as we may blame Gordon Browns Presbyterian manse background for his lack of humour and dour demeanour. We will vote for the individuals and parties that seem most likely to get us out of whatever holes we are in and give us individually the jobs and public services that we need even if we know that means a heavy tax burden for the foreseeable future. I am not a huge fan of the shadow chancellor, George Osborne, nor, as I have said previously, am I too sure about David Cameron. But I do not think, and neither do most other voters, that either of them is less likely to do the right thing after receiving one of the best educations available in the world at Eton and Oxford, or, in fact, because they themselves are well enough off not to be worrying about their own pensions. The only thing that will not help the Conservative case is if the partys so-called toffs spend too much time apologizing for their breeding and upbringing, and thus making it matter too much by appearing to have no confidence in themselves for what they can do rather than who they are.              
	To win an election, David Cameron needs to gain the voters respect with a believable plan of action should the Conservatives come to power. This is quite clearly, in current conditions, not going to be easy, especially as respect for politicians in general is a minus quantity. But the Labour leadership is exhausted and failing, which should, in the past, have given him the sort of head start that won elections. One of his problems is being seen as the heir to Blair, an image which he has previously encouraged and will cause him far greater problems than his tarring with the brush of privilege, especially after Blairs recent BBC interview in which he admitted that he would have taken the country to war with Iraq to get rid of Saddam Hussein regardless of the excuse of possible WMDs.        
	Cameron must be seen to be secure in his own skin and careless of his image to the extent that words are more important than pictures. Nobody cares too much about the modernizing of the Conservative party, as had happened with New Labour. They just want a government of whatever hue that will do a decent job for them through a parliament of genuinely honest men and women whose loyalty to themselves comes second to their loyalty to their office, their country and their constituents. I always imagine that the new year will be better than the old one, but I have a feeling that government change one way or another notwithstanding, things may not look much different this time next year  but one has to hope. Happy New Year to one and all!

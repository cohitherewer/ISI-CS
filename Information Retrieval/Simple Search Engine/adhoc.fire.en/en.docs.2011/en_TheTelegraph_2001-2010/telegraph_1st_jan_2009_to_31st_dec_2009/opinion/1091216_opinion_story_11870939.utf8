	Q: My daughter, a British citizen by birth, got her MBBS degree from the Manipal College of Medical Sciences, Pokhara, Nepal. At that time, the institute was recognised by the Medical Council of India (MCI) and had the facility for direct MCI registration for pass-outs. Yet she was denied permanent registration because of her nationality. Can the MCI deny registration to graduates from an institution that was recognised by it? Can I move the court against the verdict of the MCI? If so, which will be the court of jurisdiction? Is there any time limit for filing an appeal in court?  
	A: Yes, the MCI can deny permanent registration to your daughter on grounds of her nationality. As per Section 23 of the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956, the person concerned should possess a recognised medical qualification for registration to the medical council. But according to Section 13, clause 3 of the Act, no person possessing such qualification shall be enrolled in a State Medical Register unless he is a citizen of India. Hence, in my opinion, challenging the verdict of the MCI may prove to be futile.  
	Q:I am a co-tenant  along with my wife, brother and sister-in-law  of a piece of land vested with the government of West Bengal under the Thika Tenancy Act. My wife and I want to transfer our combined 50 per cent of the tenancy rights permanently to my brother. We have applied for the necessary permission. We understand that after receiving the same, well have to execute a registered deed of gift in favour of my brother. Since this is a transfer of tenancy right without any material gain on our part and as the land does not belong to us, why do we have to execute this deed? We have also been told that we shall have to pay stamp duty and registration fee based on the market value of the property. Is this true?

	A: You have not mentioned whether the piece of land is vacant or if it is a land with a structure on it. In case of vacant land the thika tenants holding directly under the state shall not be able to let out the land or any part thereof according to Section 6 of the West Bengal Thika Tenancy Act, 2001. However, if your land is with a structure and you do obtain the sanction for transferring your tenancy rights, registration of the deed of gift is mandatory. Otherwise, the title of the property will not pass on to the next holder. It is true that you will have to pay stamp duty and registration fees based on the market value of the property in accordance with the Indian Stamp Act.

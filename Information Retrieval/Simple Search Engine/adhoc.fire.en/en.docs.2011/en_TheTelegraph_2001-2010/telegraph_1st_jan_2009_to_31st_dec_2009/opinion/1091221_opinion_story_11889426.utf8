                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        TAKE NOTE                                                    
	At the end of the two-week-long Copenhagen summit, a familiar cloud of confusion continues to hover over its central agenda of arresting climate change. Perhaps the only palpable change has been in geopolitical relations. India and China, along with Brazil and South Africa, have emerged as the key players in a conference whose working principles had been guided by none other than the United Nations. With the UN becoming virtually redundant, the role of the developed nations in framing the Copenhagen Accord was also dramatically reduced. In a curious reversal of the rules of the negotiating game  so far dominated by the big Western powers  the worlds most powerful country was cornered by the combined intransigence of the developing nations. Barack Obama was merely expecting a tte--tte with the Chinese premier, Wen Jiabao. Ambushed by the BASIC group, Mr Obama promised to share technology. He even topped it up with financial aid, but still could not secure anything better than a non-binding political pact. The countries that account for 60 per cent of global pollution left with a big grin on their faces, with India and China delivering the masterstroke. Unwilling to upset popular sentiments back home, they merely pledged to take note of the accord. This idea of prospective damage control for when tidal waves, droughts and floods start overwhelming the earth is like a smoker saving up carefully for when he is finally afflicted with lung cancer.        
	If India and China have intangibly, if dubiously, benefitted from the summit, their lesser partners in the G77 group are the ones that have been worst served. Based on the outcome of the conference, UN scientists have predicted that the temperature of the earth will increase by up to 4C annually, which is far above the 1C limit that the island nations have been lobbying for  anything more than 1.5C would be catastrophic for them. Their sense of betrayal is now deepened by India and China, two pivotal G77 members, gesturing towards a deal, however tentative, with the US.        
	The only plausible winners of the Copenhagen summit are the sceptics. They have sneered at this elaborate gathering from the very start, predicting how it would all boil down to horse-trading and arm-twisting of the pettiest kind. Their apprehensions have been gloriously validated. The elaborate rhetoric of goodwill and environmental concern, bandied about by so-called global leaders, has steadily descended to bickering and mutual recrimination. The rich nations have desisted from signing any legally-binding deal to reduce emission. And the newly rich nations have pleaded their relative poverty and lesser carbon footprint, equally reluctant to enter into any long-term agreement. The pursuit of material wealth has triumphed over the need to safeguard the natural riches of the earth.

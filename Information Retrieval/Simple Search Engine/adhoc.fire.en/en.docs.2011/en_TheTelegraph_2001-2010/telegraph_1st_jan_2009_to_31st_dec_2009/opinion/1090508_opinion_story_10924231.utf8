	The sword and the pen                
	Terrorism and the Indian Media: A comparative study of the approach of English, Hindi and Urdu newspapers towards terrorism (India Policy Foundation, Rs 80) by Rakesh Sinha is a research project that explores the impact of the spectre of terrorism on sections of the Indian media, and their fragmented response towards this burgeoning evil. Sinha and his team of researchers and co-writers have selected three recent incidents  the Batla House encounter in New Delhi, the Mumbai attack and the A.R. Antulay episode  to raise some significant questions: does the medias coverage of such incidents provide terrorists with a certain degree of legitimacy? Do the media violate the ethics of journalism by sensationalizing episodes for commercial gain? Significantly, Sinha also focuses on the differences in the coverage of such events between mainstream English publications and their regional vernacular counterparts. For instance, while most English newspapers projected the Mumbai attack as a product of Islamic jihad, Urdu newspapers editorial line harped on a Jewish-American conspiracy. The excerpts of press reports of the Batla House encounter also expose the medias unwillingness to contest the police version of the event.        
	The painstaking research provides a chronological presentation of the three events and highlights the differences in the medias interpretations. Some of the findings listed in the final chapter are illuminating. They make it fairly evident that when the fourth estate starts speaking in many voices, truth is often the first casualty.                        
	Permanent Ghosts: A memoir (Pothi, Rs 284) by Nitin K. Shankar is an autobiographical work, which brings to light the authors personal experiences in different countries. Apart from his experiences in Karachi, whose real or imagined scenes are still alive in Shankars mind, he recounts his encounters with people and cultures in Bombay, Berlin, Warsaw, Milan and Tabriz. The book is not merely an attempt to resurrect fond memories of people, but is also about remembering cities and events of another era. Thus, there are descriptions of a man putting out gas lamps in Cuffe Parade in Bombay, the beauty of a German lakeside retreat and the tremors of revolution in Iran. Like most memoirs, this one too is tinged with nostalgia, but the sights and smells of distant cities in another time make the book appealing.                                  
	If cricket is a religion, Sachin is God (HarperCollins, Rs 195) by Vijay Santhanam and Shyam Balasubramanian is, according to Harsha Bhogles foreword, a rational response to an irrational emotion. In other words, it is yet another offering from the stable that incessantly churns out tomes which try and establish Sachin Tendulkars godly status in the annals of cricket. The method to arrive at a foregone conclusion varies from one book to another. In this case, the authors analyze statistical data to chart the Little Masters rise, fall and resurrection. Expectedly, for a dose of objectivity, there are the inevitable comparisons with some other great players along with expert opinions. But then, the proof of Tendulkars greatness lies not only in his statistical record but also in his strength to shoulder the expectations of an entire nation. For a story to be told, one does not always need numbers.                        
	Hes just not that into you (Harper, Rs 195) by Greg Behrendt and Liz Tuccillo is, ostensibly, the no excuses truth to understanding guys. Based on a popular episode of Sex and the City, this book supposedly helps women identify the men who are interested in them. After reading this book, the task would appear even more simple for women, as men, the authors claim confidently, are not complicated enough.

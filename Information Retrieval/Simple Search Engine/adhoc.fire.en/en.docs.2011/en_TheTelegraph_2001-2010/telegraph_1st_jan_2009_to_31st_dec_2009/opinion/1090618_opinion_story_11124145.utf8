The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | The price of disorder
                                                                                                                 THE PRICE OF DISORDER                                  Abhijit Bhattacharyya                              
	The latest report on Pakistan once again emanates from the Pentagons documents, and the contents are neither unexpected nor unusual. They state that Pakistan has used a substantial amount of military aid from the United States of America, meant to fight terrorists, to stock its army with modern weapons and equipment for a full-fledged conventional war with India.        
	Pakistans acquisition of arms is a non-issue for most nations in South Asia. Nepal believes that there is no threat from Islamabad. Several non-state actors in Bangladesh bank on the clandestine operators from the Pakistani State. Sri Lanka is indebted to Pakistan for its assistance in destroying the Liberation Tigers for Tamil Eelam. Understandably, therefore, India continues to be the sole target of any mischief by the Pakistani establishment.         
	However, the information that the Bush administration not only provided $1.9 billion in foreign military financing but also signed agreements with Pakistan for military aid worth nearly $5 billion will not shock those who are aware of US realpolitik. Self-interest reigns supreme in American policy. Hence, on the USs political radar, it is imperative to contain the enemy as well as to realize a friends interests.         
	To be fair to the US, it has to be noted that it is neither possible nor feasible to comprehend the changing world order through the USs eyes. The changing dynamics would appear unfathomable for a non-American. Hence the action Washington initiates in any part of the globe may not look compatible even to its own interests at times. Thus, when the US granted Pakistan the status of a major non-Nato ally, in March 2005, and expressed its willingness to supply Pakistan with advanced weaponry, it apparently undermined its chances of securing lucrative defence orders from India. Clearly, Pakistan was prioritized over India in the larger canvas of US strategy in world affairs.                
	Money matters        
	Bilaterally, however, there exists a love-hate relationship between the sole superpower and the terrorist hub of the world. Washington needs Islamabad not by design but because of a desperate necessity. This explains the USs traditional policy of containment and cooperation with Pakistan.        
	The Pakistanis understand the American dilemma and designs rather too well. They know that Washington is there to provide wealth and weaponry to them. They also know that there is US money available for tackling natural calamity, to fight the Soviets, to create the mujahedin and even to rid the country of the Talibans and al Qaidas machinations.         
	In brief, the strategy seems to be to continue demanding money not only from the US but also from the Middle East as well as from any other country, which is willing to listen to and agree with Pakistans tale of woes. If money can be had from India, that too would be more than acceptable to the rulers of Pakistan. New Delhi may be seen as the perennial foe, but Pakistans president has stated that he wants to strengthen commercial ties with India.         
	In line with the general thinking of the Pakistani establishment, the head of state too wants Indias money and markets for Islamabads manufacturers. It is thus possible that the prevailing state of chaos, confusion and violence has been intentionally created, and is being monitored by the State, to generate a sense of collective paranoia and a fear psychosis. This, undoubtedly, will help spread panic and desperation, thereby compelling the world community to pour in more money to fill Pakistans coffers. So far, the ploy seems to be working fine. But only time can tell for how long this state of affairs will continue in Pakistan.

	 Sudheendra Kulkarni may have quit his active association with the Bharatiya Janata Party, but he is not without a home. Mamata Banerjee, the Union railways minister, has reportedly given him shelter by inducting him into a railways panel that is supposed to examine the issue of public-private partnerships. Kulkarni and didi go back a long way, to the time of Vajpayees reign. Every time Banerjee threw a tantrum then, Vajpayee counted on Kulkarni to calm her down. However, there are rumours that Banerjee may have done Kulkarni a favour not just for old times sake, as he may have some uses for didi after all. Banerjee is supposedly a great fan of Kulkarnis cool and rational approach towards sticky issues, and his fund-raising abilities may also come in handy before Bengal goes to the polls. But it is unlikely that didi will ask Kulkarni to write her speeches for her. After all, his speech-writing abilities had even got the lauh purush in trouble.                
	 Even as the dust refuses to settle over Jaswant Singhs book, Ajit Jogi is reportedly ready with his own tome, which is supposed to hit the stands soon. The grapevine has it that the former Chhattisgarh CM, who was a civil servant before joining politics, is likely to spill the beans on a number of contentious issues. However, what has baffled Jogis friends and foes alike is that he has supposedly come up with a list of his 12 all-time favourite personalities, but it does not include anyone from the Nehru-Gandhi family. This, despite his professed admiration for Indias First Family. Not just that, Jogi is trying persuade Rahul Gandhi to release his book. Under the circumstances, he is being a little too hopeful perhaps.                            
	 That the BJP has had its nose bloodied is well known. But what is not known is whether the inner squabblings will force some of its younger leaders to switch sides. Already, Kiren Rijiju, a leader from the Northeast, has joined the Congress. There is some speculation that Manvendra Singh is also scouting for a new party after his fathers expulsion. Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi and Shahnawaz Hussain are said to be disillusioned with the state of affairs, and are keen on a secure future elsewhere. Much of the news of the BJPs young leaders looking for the exit route is sheer speculation. But if all of it were to come true, the BJP, loaded with elderly leaders, will then become Indias second Grand Old Party  albeit in a different sense.                            
	 The disquiet among BJP leaders has got some of their rivals  the Samajwadi and the Rashtriya Janata Dal leaders in particular  grinning. Mulayam Singh Yadav and Lalu Prasad may have kept mum on this matter, but there is no holding back their trusted lieutenants, Amar Singh and Raghuvansh Prasad Singh respectively. The duo have rushed to fish in troubled waters, extending invitations to Jaswant Singh and Vasundhara Raje, among other disgruntled leaders, to join their parties. Amar Singh apparently found ideological compatibility with Jaswant Singhs views on the events that led to the Partition. Meanwhile, Raghuvansh Prasad Singh described Raje and the ousted Uttarakhand chief minister, B.C. Khanduri, as Suljhe huwe log (straightforward people). But, unfortunately for Raghuvansh Prasad and Amar Singh, their efforts seem to have gone to waste. Last heard, Jaswant, Raje or Khanduri have not responded in any way to their persistent wooing.                            
	 When he was in the news, it was for his sartorial tastes rather than for his work. Now, out of the limelight, the former home minister, Shivraj Patil, has stopped hitting the headlines altogether. Patil may not be in the thick of things in the United Progressive Alliance governments second stint in power, but that does not mean that the former home minister has time to kill. These days, he is busy attending programmes and events, especially those that have Madam in the list of invitees. Yet, neither Sonia Gandhi nor Manmohan Singh have shown any inclination to accord Patil a gubernatorial role.       
	Moreover Patils successor, P Chidambaram, hasnt made matters any easier for his predecessor. Chidambaram has not only proved to be an able home minister, but in a recent review, he also ended up lowering Patils security.

	 A little more on PC. The Union home minister isnt exactly known for his prowess in Hindi, but the other day, he had no trouble in following a BJP parliamentarians tale of woe. During a home ministry meeting of the Rashtra Bhasha committee, which is supposed to look into ways of promoting Indias national language, a former Union minister, Ramesh Bais, recounted how the non-utilization of the rashtra bhasha by an airhostess in a domestic airline had put his wife in a spot of bother. Apparently, because of her unfamiliarity with English, the parliamentarians wife ended up consuming non-vegetarian food during a domestic flight. A deeply religious woman and a vegetarian, she has, since then, sworn not to fly. Bais urged the home minister to issue a directive asking airhostesses to turn bilingual. One doesnt know if P Chidambaram will heed his advice though. For after hearing Bais out, all he did was smile.

	Five Novellas by women writers 
  Edited by Uma Chakravarti, Oxford, Rs 595        
	In A History of Civilizations, Fernand Braudel, while defining a civilization as a cultural area, mentions that this area contains a kernel as well as frontiers or borders. This Braudelian concept gives rise to a pertinent question: what is a womans position in this cultural space? Is it at the kernel or on the borders?         
	Cultures around the world are invariably patriarchal, and they strive to institutionalize the subjugation of women. India, which developed as a civilization long before it emerged as a nation, has had a long tradition of systematizing the subjugation of the womans body through philosophical treatise and social codes known as shastras.         
	In the West, what is known as feminism today is a throwback to Mary Wollstonecrafts A Vindication of the Rights of Woman, which struck hard at the roots of the rationalist stereotyping of women as the frivolous sex. Another seminal work in this respect is Simone de Beauvoirs The Second Sex. These two texts contain the ideas that developed into full-length theses in feminist writings that came later.         
	This anthology by five Indian women novelists writing in five different regional languages is caught up within the vortex of the feminist discourse. The novellas deploy different narrative strategies to show how it feels to be a woman in Indian society. The first, Defying Winter, by Nabaneeta Dev Sen is a portrayal of life in an old-age home whose inmates hail from diverse social backgrounds. The next contribution, A Womans Farewell Song, by Mrinal Pande is the tale of a widow, Savitri, who plods through life negotiating oppressive relations. Vaidehis Temple-Fair chronicles a girl-childs life in a large joint-family. The story is told in a childs voice, which bubbles with joy and exuberance. Moonlight, by B.M. Zuhara, is the story of a Malayali Muslim girl, Nechhi, who becomes Naseema after her premature marriage.         
	Thereafter, by Saniya, is about a middle-aged woman, Radhika, whose husband suddenly walks out on her, leaving her with all his property. Her son, Amol, leaves her too, and puts up with her in-laws. As she confronts her inquisitive relatives and other people, Radhika learns to live anew and alone, and even forges a new relationship. Then, one day, her husband returns, and the narrative shifts gears to explore the crisis. This is the most disturbing and also the best of the five stories.         
	To quote Judith Walkowitz, women are makers as well as users of culture, trying doggedly to free themselves of the constraints that they internalize as consumers of culture. The narrative strategies and the language in this anthology bear this out.

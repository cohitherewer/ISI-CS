	In the final years of George W. Bushs presidency, Muslims in the United States of America complained of being victimized as agents of evil. Then Americans elected their first black president, a man with a Muslim middle name who is trying, at least in theory, to rekindle some sense of racial fairness. Formerly a lawyer, the presidents quest for justice has been absolute  he has even distinguished the good Taliban from the bad. Barack Obama may thus hope to earn some credibility in the Muslim world by extending a hand of friendship, but not much of his good faith has rubbed off on the US army. Recently, a Muslim psychiatrist with the army went on a shooting spree in the countrys biggest military base, just a day before he was to leave for Afghanistan. Apparently, Nidal Malik Hasan, now critically hurt after being shot down by an officer, was deeply shaken by his patients, who had returned from battlefields overseas. Moreover, the Federal Bureau of Investigation was informed at least six months ago of Mr Hasans supposedly jihadist tendencies after he started posting pro-Muslim messages on the internet. But the FBI never started a probe.        
	While the blame-game among the FBI officials goes on, a few tiny details seem to have slipped out of the picture  that Mr Hasan was routinely bullied by the soldiers for his Muslim faith, or the fact that people had thrown diapers at his house with the message This is your head cover, and scrawled camel jockey on his car. Perhaps Mr Hasan, like countless ordinary American Muslims, was only trying to be a good citizen and do his duty by his country. Yet, whatever be the provocation, his outburst cannot be condoned under any circumstances. Still, his was no ordinary wager with fate. Mr Hasan chose to be a part of the army  where many of his co-religionists would fear to tread, even in Mr Obamas America.

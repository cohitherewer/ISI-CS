	Forms of rudeness                  
	Sir  I am a fourth-year student of architecture in Jadavpur University. A few days ago, on my way back from Alipore, I decided purely out of academic curiosity to visit the old colonial building, Hastings House, which today houses a B.Ed institute. I was accompanied by two of my classmates, both of them girls. After entering the grounds and taking some photographs of the building and its surroundings, we walked round to its rear side. There, just as one of my companions was about to take a photograph, we heard a shout. It came from a couple  a man and a woman  both middle-aged and ruffianly in manner. The man began abusing my friend in the choicest of Bengali slang for daring to photograph a government building and an all-women complex at that. When I asked him to exercise moderation in his speech since he was addressing a lady, and pointed out to him the absence of any signage prohibiting photography, he threatened to destroy my camera if we did not vacate the grounds immediately.           
	I tried to reason with him but the brusque woman accompanying him entered the debate at this point and said that they would throw me out by force. When I resisted, the two of them further raised their voices and summoned some of their cronies from nearby. When the incident was about to become a contest of muscle power, we decided to leave the premises instead of arguing further with the people. On our way out, we could not help but notice the presence of young men playing football in the supposedly all-women compound.          
	We never discovered the identity of our two interlocutors. They were not in uniform, and looked more like illegal settlers within the premises than security personnel. Even if we ignore our personal indignation, we cannot help but point out that this incident underlines the culture of unbridled hooliganism that prevails in Calcutta and the rest of Bengal, which have been nurtured by decades of misrule and political nepotism, which in turn have given birth to roughnecks who treat State property as their own. As a student, I have visited heritage buildings all over the country, and I have been treated with dignity everywhere save in the very state that I call my own. But perhaps we deserve nothing better, and we ourselves are to be blamed for such a state of affairs. Our so-called bhadralok culture is but a thin veneer concealing a rot consuming both Bengal and Bengalis. My feelings were best echoed by my friend who remarked as we were returning home after the scuffle that this incident highlights one of the reasons why nothing good ever happens to Bengal. This is indeed why Ratan Tata left Bengal and why every right-thinking youth is deserting the state. This is why perhaps one day all that will be left in this once great state is a bunch of uncouth ruffians lording over Tagores hypothetical sonar Bangla.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  I was returning home on March 19 on my motorcycle when I was stopped by a traffic sergeant and asked to show the relevant papers. This happened on the northern end of Durgapur bridge, on Gobindo Auddy road. The middle-aged, bespectacled sergeant checked all the papers  my driving licence, papers pertaining to pollution, insurance, the letter of authorization  and seemed satisfied. I was wearing a full-mask helmet, and my pillion rider was wearing a half helmet  a design widely used by many, including traffic sergeants, on the streets of Calcutta. The sergeant pointed at the latter and said it was illegal. The pillion rider is also supposed to wear a full-mask helmet. I was given the option of paying Rs 100 immediately as fine or having my driving licence confiscated and a court case slapped against me.          
	I requested the sergeant to let me go as I did have all the relevant papers and was abiding by the rules of traffic. He was enraged at this, and accused me of wasting his time. I was feeling dejected and threatened by that time and so paid him Rs 100. He wrote my name and vehicle number on a printed slip and asked me to sign, which I did. When I asked for a receipt, he said that this was court paper  I was being released on bail and the money would be deposited in court. When asked about the time and place where I can collect the receipt, I was advised to leave. Incidentally, the sergeant in question was himself wearing just a regular police cap.          
	The issue here is not whether I was guilty of flouting traffic rules. If I was at fault, I stand corrected and am ready to comply by the rules in future. What I find unacceptable and demeaning is the way the policeman treated me. It makes me sad to see policemen treat common people like dirt when their obligation is to protect and serve them. It is because of such rude policemen in the department that honest officers get a bad name.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  I was fined Rs 100 by the Lalbazar traffic department for violating traffic rules. I deposited Rs 110 in the UBI, Lalbazar branch, for this. I was under the impression that the bank in question will send the money to the Lalbazar traffic department automatically after updating my record. But a friend told me that I have to go to Lalbazar personally with the receipt copy.           
	Accordingly, I went to the traffic department and was kept waiting on the staircase along with several others who had come to deposit the fines. There was no proper seating arrangement, no fan, no drinking water, no toilet, and on top of it all, the behaviour of the officer controlling the queue was rude to the extreme. Like me, others waiting in the line were annoyed with the officer but were unable to raise their voice in protest. Is it impossible for the officers to behave decently with the people? The Lalbazar traffic department also needs to upgrade its computer system so that once banks receive money on behalf of the people fined, they automatically updated the accounts of the latter. Telephone bills can be deposited with any post office or bank and after paying the money, the subscriber need not have to go to the concerned office to revise his record. Why cannot the Lalbazar traffic department follow the same process?           
	Yours faithfully,

                                                                                                                 PARTY SPOILT                                                    
	The leadership of the Bharatiya Janata Party has not exactly made an edifying spectacle of itself in the last few days. It has become clear that the party is riddled with factions. Arun Jaitley, one of the most articulate leaders of the party, has chosen to stay away from the meetings of the partys principal cell to monitor the election campaign. He has, according to all available reports, taken umbrage at the elevation of an individual to that august body; an individual whose presence in that body, according to Mr Jaitley, is due to a network of patronage. The stand-off between Mr Jaitley and the president of the BJP, Rajnath Singh, has continued over a number of days and even if some sort of rapprochement has been arrived at, the negative impression about the BJP will not be removed from the public mind. The idea that the BJP is a united party has already taken a blow. There are issues more important here than the factionalism involved in Mr Jaitleys open show of displeasure at the way Mr Singh runs the party.        
	One such issue is the manner in which persons who are not elected by the people come to be part of the decision-making process in the BJP and other political parties. In India, the very way in which a political party is conceived and fashioned is flawed. In a democracy, only those elected by the people should have the right to form themselves into a political party. In this case, neither Mr Jaitley nor the object of his ire, one Sudhanshu Mittal, is an elected representative of the people. Yet both belong to the core group that is supposed to determine the trajectory of the BJPs election campaign. What could be more ironic and more paradoxical than this? This kind of non-democratic way of forming teams or committees within the BJP inevitably opens doors to the patronage to which Mr Jaitley is objecting. To strengthen his position and case, he should take a broader view of the matter, and of course get himself elected to the Lok Sabha.        
	The other issue that has become manifest through this episode is a looming crisis within the BJP. This relates to leadership as well as to ideology. Of the two known leaders of the BJP, one, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, is in retirement, and the other, L.K. Advani, is well past his prime. There is no leader from the next generation who commands acceptance within the party. There is the other issue of a cabal calling the shots from Nagpur. The problem of ideology has put the BJP in a kind of political cul-de-sac. It has not been able to decide if it is a party of Hindutva or a party of India. The BJP has failed to articulate the politics of inclusion. This has, by definition, reduced its appeal and made it the object of suspicion, even of fear. Without a solution to these issues, factionalism will always erupt like a boil on a canker.

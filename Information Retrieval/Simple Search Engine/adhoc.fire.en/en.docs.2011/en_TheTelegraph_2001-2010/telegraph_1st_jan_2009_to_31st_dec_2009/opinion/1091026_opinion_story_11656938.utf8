The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | think ahead
                                                                                                                 THINK AHEAD                                                    
	As far as the current timeline for climate change goes, nobody alive today, in India or elsewhere, will live long enough to suffer the direst effects of global warming. So a well-developed ability to look very far into the future, together with a conscience that compels one to act according to that vision, is required for citizens and governments to start planning against climate change and then earnestly implementing those plans. This is particularly true for the developing economies, which are used to feeling absolved from the environmental responsibilities of the developed economies. So India, for instance, is busier fending off the developed worlds demands regarding emission-cuts than thinking pragmatically about what it can do, in its own way, about global warming. Ordinary Indians are still far from perceiving climate change as a problem that touches their lives, and therefore worth thinking about. So it would not matter to most people that a recent survey has found Calcutta to be the highest emitter of carbon dioxide among 25 Indian cities. It has to be noted, though, that the comparable figures for Delhi and Mumbai have not yet come in. So it is impossible to make out how the Indian big cities emit compared to one another.        
	Yet, a survey like this is important in initiating some sort of awareness in municipalities, panchayats and state governments, and in ordinary citizens, about the long- and short-term measures and targets regarding cutting down energy consumption. Indias place in the world is getting more and more prominent, and with that will come certain global responsibilities that it will find increasingly difficult to dodge. Himachal plans to become a carbon-neutral state by 2020, and states like Uttarakhand and Kerala have already taken some decisions regarding biosphere restrictions and replacing incandescent bulbs with compact fluorescent lights. It usually takes West Bengal an inordinately long time to wake up to immediate dangers and crises. So perhaps its keepers could begin to wonder if they would like to begin to think about such things. Calcutta has got used to lethal air pollution. So it may not be too bothered about this sort of thing.

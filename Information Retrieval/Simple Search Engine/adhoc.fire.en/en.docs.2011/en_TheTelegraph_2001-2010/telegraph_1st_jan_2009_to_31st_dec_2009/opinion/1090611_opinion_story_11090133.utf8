The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Not everything can be black or white
                                                                                                                 NOT EVERYTHING CAN BE BLACK OR WHITE                                  COLOUR CODE       A Ugandan student who has been racially abused in Calcutta chooses a different path to confront prejudice                                                  
	Moses Khisa was first made aware of the colour of his skin on a crowded bus in Calcutta. A woman had been standing next to Moses, her male companion by her side, even as other bodies kept pressing into them. As the vehicle hurtled forward, and Moses shifted uncomfortably to balance himself, he saw the man move slightly and place himself between him and the woman. He threw a protective arm around her. This subtle movement, an almost imperceptible shift in the alignment of bodies cramped in a public place, revealed to Moses the distance that lay between him and the swaying mass of hands, feet and heads around him.        
	Some of the other incidents that reflected this collective prejudice have not been as subtle. For instance, Moses, who has now spent almost a year in Calcutta as a research student at the Centre for Studies in Social Sciences, was once accosted by a group of young, jeering neighbourhood boys in a park who shouted Negro! Negro! as he jogged past them. On another occasion, two seemingly respectable, middle-aged men had admonished his Indian friend for shaming her community by walking on the road in the company of a Black man.        
	Such crude expressions of deeply entrenched prejudice reminded Moses of Uganda, from where he hails, and its burgeoning Indian population. Uganda is home to an affluent, enterprising community of around 30,000 Indians, who have often been accused of mistreating their Ugandan employees. (Uganda has particularly feeble labour laws.) The Ugandan media had once reported an incident in which an Indian employer asked his Ugandan help to lick clean a carpet.        
	But these unabashed displays of hostility and discrimination do not disturb Moses. In fact, they have kindled in him an interest in race relations. He said he owed much of his interest and understanding of societal prejudice, especially the Wests blindness, to Saids Orientalism. While he acknowledges that racial prejudice towards black men in India is related to the countrys own traumatic colonial past, he is also aware that it is not enough to use history as an alibi to condone a malevolent bias that cuts across class, age and gender. The critical need for many Indians, Moses argues, is to first recognize such inherent ill-feeling, then confront it and gradually erase it from their consciousness.        
	The strategies of confrontation may vary. In Australia, Indian students who have been subject to vicious racist attacks are pressurizing the authorities by organizing massive rallies in Melbourne and Sydney. There is strength in numbers and visibility; there is even greater strength in commerce. By justifiably warning fellow Indians not to travel to Australia for higher studies unless the Australian government takes steps to stop the attacks, expatriate Indian students hope to choke the supply lines that pour money into the coffers of Australias educational institutions. The results are now showing, albeit at a grudging, halting pace. The Victoria police commissioner, Simon Overland, who had been denying that the attacks against Indian students in Australia were racial in nature since they started a couple of months ago, has finally admitted them to be so.        
	But numbers can also be counter-productive, stated Moses. A show of strength against aggression, however justifiable, raises the possibility of a flare-up that can damage ties irreparably. The reported stabbing of a 20-year-old man in a Melbourne suburb by members of the Indian community shows that the security of numbers can goad an injured community into retaliation that is equally deplorable.         
	Moses firmly believes in a different kind of engagement. He is interested in analysing racial discrimination, the faultlines in society that create it, and in entering into a dialogue with the prejudiced to bring about a slower, yet perhaps more effective, sensitization. He knows that he cannot shy away from the problem, or even wish it away. But his mode of confrontation is quiet reflection, discussions with friends and strangers, informed with the hope that things will change.        
	Moses is aware how deep prejudices can be, and about their myriad forms  people are discriminated against on the basis of race, gender, sexuality and religion. Things wouldnt change in his lifetime. There are too many crooked lines in this world that need to be reset.        
	But Calcutta has its share of fair and unbiased people: his friends who say they are shamed by his experiences, or his flatmates who urge him to be more vocal in his protest against such abuse. He also remembers a stranger he met on yet another bus who reprimanded the conductor for charging Moses an extra rupee in his fare. The man made sure that Moses got his money back and left before he could be thanked. It was on that bus, on a different kind of journey, that Moses realized he had one less crooked line to straighten.

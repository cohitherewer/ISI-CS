                                                                                                               DIARY
                  
	 The fantabulous performance of the Congress gladdened the heart of a mother who decided to listen to her son this time. It also gladdened the heart of another person in her party  Veerappa Moily  for very different reasons. Moily, former head of the media cell, had reportedly been given the boot after what had then seemed like a misadventure. Moily had organized the now famous press meet where Rahul Gandhi ended up praising the partys adversaries. All that went against the party line and created a completely avoidable controversy while the elections were still on: a crucial southern state was about to give its verdict. Moily, it was widely believed, had even scotched the partys chances of wooing Nitish Kumar by decrying the latters saffron links and saying that the Bihar CM had become too big for his boots. What had seemed sacrilege then may now seem like an honest opinion. Who knows, Moily may even be given his job back for his bravado!                 
	 It always pays to have friends. In Praful Patel, Sonia Gandhi has her point man in the Nationalist Congress Party to beg, woo or dissuade the Maratha strongman, Sharad Pawar. Patel is naturally Madams chief aide in the post-poll scene when lobbying will be at its peak. On her part, Sonia has done her bit too. She campaigned for Patel and took time off from her busy schedule to visit Bhandara, which, incidentally, was the only time she shared the dais with Pawar. Patel proudly claims that even when he had left the Congress with Pawar, a picture of Rajiv and Sonia Gandhi had remained mounted in his living room wall.                             
	 Going by the last count, about 3,500 candidates had not listed their permanent account numbers in their nomination affidavits for the general elections. This provides an eloquent commentary on the politicians credentials in this democracy. The question in Raisina Hill is whether this figure will awaken the revenue sleuths and prompt them to scrutinize the tax returns of crorepati candidates. Incidentally, the penalty for not having a PAN card  mandatory even for those whose income is below the taxable limit  is only Rs 10,000. For tax evasion, the fine is 100 to 300 per cent of the money concealed. Election laws require candidates to declare their income or wealth, not the source.                             
	 Never mind the bonhomie between the J amp;K CM and the Gandhi scion, the Congress-National Conference alliance does not seem to be working at the ground level. The Congress was allowed to contest three seats in the state, Ladakh being one of them. But here, a NC rebel, Ghulam Hasan Khan, is reported to have contested as an independent candidate. Incidentally, Khan is yet to be expelled from the NC. The Peoples Democratic Party in Ladakh also withdrew its candidate in favour of Khan to ensure a Congress defeat. The buzz is that Farooq Abdullah was unwilling to allow the Congress to win all the three seats. This, apparently, would allow his party to keep the Congress under its thumb.                             
	 Running a political dynasty is not an easy job. Two distinguished political families appear to have had a pretty difficult time during their campaigns, thanks to the roadblocks put up by rivals from their own parties. Take Manvendra Singh, son of Jaswant Singh, for instance. Coping with Vasundhara Raje Scindias supporters proved to be a harder task than combating his Congress opponent. Sachin Pilot is another example. Pilot, in the fray from Ajmer where the Congress had not won for a while, had a trying time with supporters of a member of his own party  the Rajasthan CM, Ashok Gehlot.                             
	 As the battle for the ballot intensified, so did the desperation among television channels. Along with the mercury, the decibel levels went up, and news channels were fighting tooth and nail to raise their TRP ratings. They kept a barrage of text messages flowing, waking up their poor viewers from their afternoon nap and asking them to tune in. Some did not take any chances and put glossy ads in newspapers. One channel, clearly defeated in the war for TRPs, refused to be cowed down. It declared with a righteous swagger that while TRPs can be managed, it was trust that mattered most. So, it claimed itself to be the most trustworthy of the lot, and challenged its star rival to beat it on that unquantifiable measure of trust. Now that was a tough one!                      
	 Is Amar Singh switching his loyalties? Those who never had any doubts about the fragile commitments of Singh point to the fact that it is Sanjay Dutt, and not Amitabh Bachchan, who is now seen perpetually beside the Samajwadi Party leader. At         the rather sombre prayer gathering after Feroz Khans death, Bollywood could not help notice that it was Dutt who made an entry with Singh. However, for years now, Singh has been seen at filmi dos in the company of Bollywoods first family. In this instance, Amitabh turned up with his wife, Jaya, and the son and bahu in tow. Singh has scotched all rumours and insists that it is not a case of changing sides. He pointed to the fact that after the prayer meeting, he went to the Bachchan home and added that it is absurd to compare the two relationships. If he is now close to Sanjubaba, it is because he is a party colleague. As for Amitji, his family and elder brother, the tie is apolitical.

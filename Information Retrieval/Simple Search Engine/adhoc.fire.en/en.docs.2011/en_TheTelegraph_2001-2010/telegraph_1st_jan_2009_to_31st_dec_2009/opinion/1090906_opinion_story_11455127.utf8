	 It is the season of surprises. When Sudheendra Kulkarni recently decided to quit his active association with the Bharatiya Janata Party, who could have guessed that he would land up on a railways panel, thanks to the generosity of his one-time friend, Mamata Banerjee? While Kulkarni basks in this pleasant turn of things, didi is in an awkward spot  and with no less than Madam herself. Sonia Gandhi has reportedly shown strong disinclination to flag off Banerjees ambitious Duranta Express  a train that is supposed to change the lives of excited vacationers travelling between Calcutta and Delhi or Delhi and Mumbai during the Puja holidays. Although didi is in a tearing hurry to set the project rolling, the AICC chief has distanced herself from the opening ceremony, in case she is forced to be on the same podium with Kulkarni, an avowed Congress hater. It is time didi learnt the hard way that she is not the only one to throw surprises.                
	 Staying with Madam and the art of springing surprises. Recently, the AICC chief was at the receiving end of another prank, albeit an amusing one. When the Haryana chief minister, Bhupinder Singh Hooda, had invited Sonia Gandhi to the engagement ceremony of his son, Madam had initially refused to attend on grounds of austerity. She is said to have been averse to the idea of going to this grand occasion, organized at a plush five-star hotel. Hooda was not one to give up so easily. He did a double take and promptly shifted the venue to the residence of a Delhi MP. Although Madam relented, she was stunned the moment she stepped inside the house. Surrounded by all imaginable items of luxury, the place could well have given any five-star hotel a run for its money. Now thats what is called bending the rules.                            
	 While the rest of the BJP is desperately seeking a new leader, Rajnath Singh is on a different search altogether: when he is not worrying himself sick over the dwindling fate of his party, he is said to be househunting. Ever since he became the party president, Singh has been grumbling about his Ashoka Road house. Apparently, such a humble abode does not befit the exalted status of the president of the second largest national party. So Singh had his eyes set on a Type-VIII bungalow for a long time  and by a stroke of luck, one such building indeed came up a few months back.A beautiful house on Kushak Road was vacated after Singhs party colleague, Satyanarayan Jatiya, lost the Lok Sabha polls and then failed to get nominated to the Rajya Sabha. But sadly, the bungalow is in no shape for human habitation. After surveying the legacy left behind by its former occupant, the Central Public Works Department has pronounced that it will take at least a couple of months to complete the essential repairs. But Singh has no time to lose. Given the volatile state of his party, a wait that long could not only cost him his dream bungalow but probably also his position in the pecking order.                            
	 In keeping with the tough times, the United Progressive Alliance government has taken suitably tough measures to stall the economic crisis. Accordingly, the ring of security around VIPs has been diminished. Amid long faces and suppressed rumblings, we hear that Atal Bihari Vajpayee and his extended family have been spared, with the government extending the SPG ring around the Vajpayee family for yet another year. Since the former PMs health started deteriorating, he has had an ambulance 24x7 at his disposal. There is also a hotline between AIIMS and his residence. Now, even Ataljis foster son-in-law would enjoy SPG protection and exemption from security checks at domestic airports for yet another year. Looks like the long faces are going to get only longer.                            
	 While the BJP was trying to stay afloat amid the tumult of controversies that rocked it, Arun Jaitley took time off to see his old friend, Amar Singh, who is convalescing from a kidney transplant for months now. The meeting was supposed to be a reciprocal gesture, since Amar had visited Arun when the latter was recovering from a cardiac ailment. Given the solemnity of the visit, it turned out to be a surprisingly merry affair, with a lunch arranged by Amar and joined in by none other than Mulayam Singh Yadav. Perhaps Arun could have brought Rajnath Singh along as a reciprocal gesture.

	 Trouble has been crawling out of the woodwork at Shyamla Hills, home to Shivraj Singh Chauhan, the Madhya Pradesh chief minister. And trouble, in his case, has not merely come in the form of political crisis, but in the shape of creepy, crawly creatures. First, a giant python was spotted on the premises of the CMs official residence. Before the formidable snake-catcher, Salimbhai, could arrive, the monster had gobbled up a dog. As Salim set out to capture it, he came upon another Ghoda Pachad snake huddled in the green cover around the CMs house. Although some have rationalized the presence of these unexpected guests on the elite premises, a few superstitious eyebrows have also been raised. It is intriguing, they say, that at a time when the BJP is in a low, Chauhans place has become a breeding ground for snakes. A local leader was even heard asking Salim if he would be able to catch the treacherous, snake-like characters close to the CM.

	The proposal to make Presidency College into a unitary university has embedded in it the idea of creating an institution of excellence in the field of higher education. In the context of the history of Presidency College, it is also an attempt to retrieve for the college, and to restore it to, its former glory. The idea of making a college into a university is both novel and radical. But the Presidency University bill, 2009, presented at the legislative assembly on Tuesday, is neither novel nor radical. The act embodies in it hackneyed clauses that have gone into the making of other universities in West Bengal. There is nothing in the act to suggest that some fresh thinking has gone into its making. It bears the giveaway stamp of a minor bureaucrat in the education department, the iron in whose soul is rusty beyond repair. From this act it would not be unfair to infer that there is no realization among the powers that run education in the state that the ruin of West Bengals higher education is rooted in precisely the kind of provisions that are there in this act.        
	The act mutatis mutandis is no different from the one that governs the universities of Calcutta or Jadavpur. It allows for a whole range of people, who are not remotely connected with education and academics  bureaucrats, legislators, non-teaching staff and so on, to be critically involved in the running of the university. The point is important since the transformation of Presidency College into a university offers an opportunity to the government led by Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to create a landmark and an exemplary institution that will have no other commitment save to excellence in learning and teaching. This demands that during the preparatory stage a study be prepared of the best practices in some of the leading universities across the world. Further, the chief minister, whose dream it is to restore to his alma mater its former status, should ensure that the new universitys first vice chancellor be a person of unquestionable academic standing, untainted by political patronage. The act opens up fears of political and bureaucratic interference, and such fears cannot be wished away given the track record of the Left Front government for over 30 years. The Left Front government systematically destroyed what was once the countrys best undergraduate college. It can redeem itself by making it a first-rate university, not by making it an also-ran.

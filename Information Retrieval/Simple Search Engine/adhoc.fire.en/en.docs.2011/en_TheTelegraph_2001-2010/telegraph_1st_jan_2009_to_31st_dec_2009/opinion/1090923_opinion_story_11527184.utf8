The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Points to ponder
                                                                                                                 POINTS TO PONDER                                  Sumanta Sen                              
	The Union home minister, P. Chidambaram, has said the government has reports that the Maoists are making contacts with secessionist forces in the Northeast and that the cadre of the United Liberation Front of Asom is receiving training in the forests of Jharkhand. Suspicions of such a development had strengthened over the last few years and now there is official confirmation. It is part of the Maoists tactics to infiltrate all areas of unrest, irrespective of the character of the agitation, and the home minister must be aware of this. He has spoken of the Northeast and would perhaps do well to look beyond as well. The situation in North Bengal, particularly Darjeeling, is well worth considering from this angle.        
	Darjeeling borders Nepal and the Maoists in that country are seemingly all set to return to their old ways. In the past, they had contacts with their counterparts in India. For a while, on coming to power in Nepal, they had spoken in a different voice, but now after walking out of office in Kathmandu, they have no reason to do so any more. And the best way to establish physical contact is to enter Darjeeling  which has never been a problem given the fact that the Indo-Nepal treaty of 1950 allows free movement between the two countries.        
	The huge turnouts in the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha rallies are causing eyebrows to be raised. There is a strong feeling that the agitations support base is bolstered from across the border. Indeed, Morcha leaders themselves have, at times, been disturbed by the militancy displayed by their frontal organizations. They have, of course, always sought to explain this as added enthusiasm among local leaders. But is such enthusiasm spontaneous or sponsored?                 
	Different turn        
	Soon after Subash Ghisingh had started the Gorkhaland agitation in the Eighties, intelligence agencies had suspicions, not entirely unfounded, that Gorkha soldiers, retired from the British army and settled in Nepal, were providing military training to the cadre of the Gorkha National Liberation Front. Today, the same kind of service may well be provided by Maoists from Nepal who share with those in India the perception that the peoples war must cover as wide an area as possible. The existing treaty helps them immensely in this regard.        
	The Morcha leadership itself has so far kept the agitation confined to democratic ways. But any agitation that drags on, with no hope of reaching the goal in sight, can take a different turn. It is a situation tailor-made for extremists. Even if the demand for a separate state is met at some point of time, Maoists from Nepal may well have created by then a strong base for spreading their political message, as is being done today in the plains.         
	But why will the Maoists from Nepal have to be active in Darjeeling  why can the indigenous revolutionaries not do the job? The answer is simple  it is a matter of ethnic affinity. A Nepali in the Darjeeling hills will respond far more easily to overtures from his kinsmen than from somebody speaking Telugu or Hindi or Bengali. Also, thanks to the absence of any travel restrictions, a Nepali from Nepal has no problem mingling with his own crowd in India which is not possible for a non-Nepali.        
	When he was the prime minister, Prachanda himself had wanted a revision of the 1950 treaty to show that Nepal wanted to be a truly independent nation, not bound by the obligations of a treaty agreed upon by feudal rulers. New Delhi had not paid any attention to the subject then. Today, in the context of the serious concern at the spread of Maoist activities, New Delhi should have a second look at the treaty so that future movement from Nepal is viewed in the same way as that from the other neighbouring countries.

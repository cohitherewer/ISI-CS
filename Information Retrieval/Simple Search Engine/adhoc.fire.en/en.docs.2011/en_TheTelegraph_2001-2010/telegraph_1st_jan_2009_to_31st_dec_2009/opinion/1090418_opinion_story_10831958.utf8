The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | And April will be beautiful
                                                                                                                 AND APRIL WILL BE BEAUTIFUL                                  This above all   Khushwant Singh                          Celebrate the bounty                                        
	Whosoever thought of making April 1 All Fools Day must have been a very foolish person. And those who play pranks on that day as a legitimate pastime must be a bunch of fools as well. It should be celebrated as the day of rejuvenation of life. In the northern hemisphere, the day manifests itself in all its natural splendour. To quote Robert Brownings exuberant outburst:        
	Oh, to be in England        
	Now that Aprils there,        
	And whoever wakes in England         
	Sees, some morning, unaware         
	That the lowest boughs and the brushwood sheaf         
	Round the elm-tree bole are in tiny leaf,        
	While the chaffinch sings on the orchard bough        
	In England  now!        
	One of the reasons why I fell in love with England was the many Aprils I spent there walking through Welwyn woods, with rhododendrons and azaleas in full bloom and thrushes in full-throated song.        
	T.S. Eliot described April as the cruellest month breeding lilacs out out of the dead land, because it reminds one of the dead past and at the same time, of the hopes for the future.        
	April has special significance in India. It is the beginning of the new year by the Vikrami calendar. Also, April 13 is the birth anniversary of the Khalsa Panth. It marks the end of our all-too-short a spring and the beginning of the two-and-half months of searing summer heat. So we celebrate Baisakhi as a day of gratitude for the bountiful wheat-harvest to be followed by a well-deserved couple of months of comparative ease.        
	Most Indian poets had more to say about the onset of the monsoon than about Baisakh. In his Baramah (the twelve months), Guru Nanak briefly mentions nature and goes on to mans quest for union with god. In his case, man is the bride awaiting union with her chosen bridegroom. I give my translation of the verse, Baisakh bhala sakha ves karey:        
	In beauteous Baisakh the bough adorns itself anew;/ The wife awaits the coming of her Lord/ With her eyes fixed on the door./ My love you alone can help me across/ The turbulent waters of life; come home,/ Without you I am worthless as a broken shell/ When you look upon me with favour/ And our eyes mingle;/ Then I shall become priceless beyond compare./ Nanak asks Where seek you the Lord/ Whom are you awaiting?/ You have not to go far to find Him/ He is with you, you are His mansion/ If your body and soul yearn for the Lord/ The Lord shall love you/ And Baisakh will be beautiful.                
	Sorrowful songs                
	It is generally accepted that poetry is the highest form of literary expression. Even the best of prose, be it fiction, biography or travelogue, thoroughly enjoyed when read for the first time, loses much of its appeal when read a second time. On the other hand, good poetry becomes more and more enjoyable when re-read. One does not have to be a scholar to write good poetry. Either you have it in you or you dont. And far too often, it stays latent in the recesses of a persons mind till some event like betrayal of trust or the death of a dear one triggers it off. The latest example I came across is Maninder Kaur Bains of Mohali (Punjab).        
	She is a lovely young lady with a triple MA creatively employed in producing programmes for Punjab TV, acting, singing and teaching. She fell in love and married a man of her choice. He betrayed her trust and ditched her. Maninder found solace in composing poetry and painting. Her collection is yet to be published. I have little doubt she will find a good publisher soon. I give an example of one of her poems entitled M:        
	Night has set/good and proper/ and I think/ as I walk towards/ momentary death of/ confines of my four walls/ that Im alone /I look up/ to see/ glimmers of stars and smile/ but/ O Saturn! /Even stars dont smile:/ a soft, mild wind/ gently lifts/ crumbs of earth/ and obscures the stars/ thus/ enshrouding moon for us/ I return/ to me,/ to that which is within me,/ to that which is/ may not be me,/ to cries that reach/ through the obscurity/ to me:/ is this all/ or/ is there presence beyond/ the stars, the moon, the night,/ My room, my walls, myself,/ my loneliness and/ me...                
	Calling names                
	I was teaching English to my son, Ganga Deep. I asked him What do you call a man who cannot hear ?        
	He replied: You can call him anything, it will make no difference, because he cannot hear.

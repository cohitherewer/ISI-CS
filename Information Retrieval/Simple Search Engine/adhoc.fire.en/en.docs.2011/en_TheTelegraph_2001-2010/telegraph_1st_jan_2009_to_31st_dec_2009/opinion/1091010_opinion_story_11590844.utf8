The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | The house on wheels
                                                                                                                 THE HOUSE ON WHEELS                              Somak Ghoshal      VISUAL ARTS                                                
	Instead of cluttering up the gallery with ill-considered works of art, Aakriti has made an exception in its annual exhibition this year. GenNext IV (till Oct 15), like its previous three avatars, presents a reasonably catholic mix of works, in various forms and media, picked out of a wide range of entries from across the world. But this time, the selection process appears to have been more discerning, given the generally high quality of the exhibits. Even better, the works have been so placed as to give the viewer some breathing space.        
	Although, as usual, painting predominates over the other genres, it is pleasantly surprising to note the presence of some intelligent installation art. Atul B. Mahajans wicked phallus-shaped rubber balloon inflates itself the moment you step on the wooden plank in front of it. For the less dirty-minded, it could even look like a rhinos horn, freshly red from hunting its prey.         
	Dipta Bhattacharya uses fur to create a coral that looks like something between a cuddly soft-toy and a deadly striped tarantula. Partha Guin puts rows of PVC pipes wrapped around with iconic images or kitschy poster words inside a wooden box and calls it Misuse of Image Causes Danger. The profusion of half-legible words and half-seen faces has a dizzying effect. This neat arrangement of cylindrical objects is reminiscent of Bari Kumars similar experiments with tiny rolls of cloth, although the effect, in Kumars case, owed more to the bright colours than to quirky words and images.        
	Priti Kahar creates a semantic jumble by calling her work A for Apple, and then hanging a bunch of white apples from the wall with the word, art, embossed on them. Illusion and reality come together in a gorier form in the gigantic Heart-less Heart Sanhita Banerjee makes with bee-hive, fibreglass and plastic pipes. The blackened organ, with a sickly sheen on it, embodies a festering bleakness surpassing words.         
	An understated drama also resonates throughout the three-odd minutes during which Bijli, alias Mohammad Fayyaz, a drag queen from Pakistan and an asylum-seeker in America, sings a heart-wrenching song in Jaishri Abichandanis video footage. Toast amp; Tea, by Sukanya Ghosh, the other video-art, is a collage of crumbling shapes and crazy doodles. However, it is a bit too short and moves on too hurriedly for the viewer to savour its finer nuances. It is also not a good idea to show both the videos on the same screen: the longer one, with a more real and colourful cast, is bound to come in the way of the viewers appreciation of the subtle charms of the shorter and crisper piece.        
	Moving images are also integral to Mansoor Ali Makranis work, although his medium is not the video camera. Makrani uses mirror, etched glass and colours to suggest cracks and fissures. While looking at his works, the viewer is reflected in tiny shards on the glass surface, and becomes mingled with the blood red or inky black colours.        
	Of the painters, Debasish Dutta stands out with Missing You, a profound meditation in cerulean blue, filled with men, women and children (and one stray dog), walking around a city, but seldom together (picture). There is a slender house on wheels in the background, growing skywards like Jacks beanstalk, and soap bubbles float in the air. The surreal house is a clear reminder of Louise Bourgeoiss Femme Maison series from the 1940s. Yet the press of human bodies fading into the horizon, a tractor with a dead tree left forlorn in the crowd, and the solitary absorption of the walkers also reveal a deeply personal vision of life and loss.        
	Paltu Barmans The Old Days presents a visual panorama of a bizarre landscape inhabited by penguins, naked women, amorous couples, dead fish and babies. It is a nowhere land between sleep and wakefulness, city and village, rivers and deserts. A different kind of limbo is apparent in Prandeep Kalitas Mirage within Truth, a not-so-subtle comment on the desecration of Gandhian values through the ages.         
	Punyo Chobins Six Pack II is a witty diversion from the themes of loss and love. In it, a bald, rotund couple, with rosy cheeks and smiling faces, is seen exercising with dumbbells. Thought-bubbles hover over them with images of succulent chicken roast and Schwarzenegger-like torsos. The allusion to Richard Hamiltons Just what is it that makes todays homes so different, so appealing?  a seminal image in the history of Pop Art  is evident from the half-visible body of a man holding a baton-like object, with the word, Pop, inscribed on it.        
	Priyanka Lahiri, Mantu Das, Nabanita Datta Guha, Romicon Revola and Pramod Kumar Singh have submitted rather pedestrian work and could have been safely set aside. The same can be said of most of the sculptors and photo artists, whose endeavours look uninspired and derivative. Nantu Bihari Das and Prafull Singh, for instance, have produced tawdry clichs in fibreglass.         
	Yet, sometimes even the simplest change of tack can have a startling effect. This is brought out by the exquisite works of Piyali Sadhukhan. There may not be much that is novel about the veiled face of a woman exhaling smoke through her painted lips or even in the view of her brain, protruding behind her. But there is indeed a freshness in Sadhukhans rendering of the curlicued veil in pigment ink, as though she is tracing a traditional pattern in mehendi on bridal hands.

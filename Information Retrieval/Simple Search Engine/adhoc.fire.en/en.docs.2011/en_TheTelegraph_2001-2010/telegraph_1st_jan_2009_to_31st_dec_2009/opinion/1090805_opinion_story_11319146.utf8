                                                                                                                 MISSED CHANCES                          - Some Indian leaders could deal with the US more maturely        Diplomacy -   K.P. Nayar                                                        
	What does it say about managing Indias relations with the United States of America when the petroleum minister, Murli Deora, brags on the day the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, arrives in New Delhi that the country will not succumb to any pressure from Washington on seeing through the India-Pakistan-Iran gas pipeline project? If any other cabinet minister had said this, the boast would have been credible. But Deora?        
	When Deora was elected to the Rajya Sabha in 2002, Capitol Hill witnessed the unusual spectacle of Congressmen falling over each other on the floor of the House of Representatives to congratulate, on the record, his election from Maharashtra. No other Indian politician has ever been similarly hailed on the floor of the US Congress. During the Bush administration, when the United Progressive Alliance government anchored its vision of India-US relations on downgrading other multilateral relationships, India was the only country that chose not to send its head of government for the summit meetings of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. At that time, Deora was hand-picked by the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, to represent him at the SCO. It is an open secret in Washington that Singhs choice of Deora was more of a message to the Bush administration than to the SCO summit, where the petroleum minister was headed.        
	In the pre-Hugo-Chavez-Evo-Morales era in Latin America, it was to reliable supporters of the Deora kind that the US historically turned to when Washington wanted to change governments in banana republics and was looking for leaders to head States refashioned in the flavour of the White House.               
	On occasion, to be fair, the Manmohan Singh government, for its part, has used Deora to its advantage. When the nuclear deal was going through a rough patch on Capitol Hill, with its US opponents determined to pass what were then known as killer amendments to its enabling legislation, it was after the petroleum ministers visit to Washington and his powwows at the Hay Adams Hotel near the White House that several senators and members of the House of Representatives fell in line and supported India.        
	It is also a matter of record that the ministry of petroleum and natural gas was the only Union ministry that mounted a sensible public campaign to sell the deal to doubters and opponents among the Indian public. The copy of the advertisements that Deora ordered to be run in dailies across the country made out a logical and convincing case for going ahead with the nuclear deal in the interest of energy security. But why create discord over the controversial India-Pakistan-Iran gas pipeline at the precise moment when Clinton was arriving in New Delhi on what was essentially a goodwill visit? Especially when everyone knows that pipeline will remain a pipe dream long after Deora, now 72, has probably left the government and even public life.        
	Like the broadside against the US by the environment minister, Jairam Ramesh, on the same day, like the late president K.R. Narayanans ill-timed words against the US in the Rashtrapati Bhavan banquet speech to honour then president Bill Clinton in 2000, Deoras conduct was symptomatic of a lack of maturity and self-confidence that dogs Indias political leaders in their dealings with the worlds only remaining superpower.        
	If the Clinton trip had been differently handled on Raisina Hill, the seat of authority in New Delhi, it would have equalled, or even surpassed, the atmospherics during the visits of Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. That would have set the tone for what the prime minister wants to achieve in Washington in November in the next stage of India-US relations. Instead, what has been created in Washington are lingering controversies, some bad blood and a partial return to the mistrust and suspicions, especially at the bureaucratic level, of the kind that dogged Indo-US relations throughout the Cold War era.         
	Symptomatic of this undercurrent was a shocking statement in an interview last week by Indias best friend in the Senate, John Cornyn  who is none other than a founder and Republican co-chair of the Senate India Caucus  that the US is not just fighting wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. We are fighting  we have graver threats and great threats than from a rising India, with increased exercise of their military power. Cornyn quickly apologized and corrected himself, but that cannot wish away the feelings that prompted even a friendly senator to tell what was really at the back of his mind about India.        
	The new ambassador, Meera Shankar, has now been left to deal with the fallout of a visit that could have been handled better. Shankar made an impressive beginning last week when she mobilized a quarter of the entire Senate for an event on Capitol Hill that coincided with the reorganization of the Senate India Caucus in the new US Congress.        
	Like Senator Cornyn, in an unguarded moment, Hillary Clinton expressed her innermost thoughts when she met Ramilaben Rohit, the president of the Self Employed Womens Association, in Mumbai. Ramilaben was recently elected to lead the association by its 1.1 million members. You are lucky to have been elected president. I didnt have the same luck, Clinton told Ramilaben, whom she addressed as Madam President. And she meant it. Clinton had once imagined that she would repeat her 1995 visit to India as first lady, this time returning as US president. But fate willed otherwise, and she was recalling her lifes unrealized ambition when she envied the Gujarati womans success in their brief conversation.        
	The Indian government failed to understand what Ramilaben, a farm-worker from Anand, Shantaben Parmar, a vegetable vendor from Ahmedabad, Fulkuvabra Jadeja, an embroidery worker from Kutch, and other SEWA members did. These women called her Hillaryben and taught her to wear a traditional Indian dupatta. The US secretary of state was much more comfortable with the women of SEWA, the students she interacted with and the corporate leaders in Mumbai who fawned on her than with the politicians she later met in New Delhi.              
	There were plenty of opportunities in New Delhi for the government to have dealt with her visit differently. There were three women in South Block, for instance, each of whom played an important part during Clintons stay in the capital. Clinton was received in New Delhi on arrival by two women, Gayatri Kumar, South Blocks point person for the US, and Meera Shankar, the ambassador in Washington. Nirupama Rao had not yet taken charge as foreign secretary, but she was designated as officer on special duty so that she could be part of the official delegation talking to Clinton and her team.         
	Indias government does not know how to use its assets. Much could have been made of this all-women team on the Indian side in spinning to the US media about the gender-glass ceiling being broken during the Clinton visit. That was the kind of projection the secretary of state was looking for back in the US. That would have taken India much further in bargaining with the US than the lecture by Indias environment minister and the posturing by the countrys petroleum minister.        
	One person who made the most of the opportunities offered by Clintons visit was the low-profile, soft-spoken defence minister, A.K. Antony. He managed to solve a problem that has been a thorn on his side from the day he took charge of the defence ministry: the issue of end-use verification of military purchases from the US. He also laid the groundwork for private-sector defence production in India with US collaboration by timing a series of revelations in Parliament, on the day Clinton arrived in New Delhi, about the pathetic state of the countrys indigenous defence production. In the end, Clinton may look back and thank Antony for what he quietly did for the next big phase of the India-US engagement in the coming years.

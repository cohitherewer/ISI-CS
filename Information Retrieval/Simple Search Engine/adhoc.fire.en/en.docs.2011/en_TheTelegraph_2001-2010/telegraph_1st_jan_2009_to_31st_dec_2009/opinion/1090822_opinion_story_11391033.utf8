The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Still trapped in a treacly nostalgia
                                                                                                                 STILL TRAPPED IN A TREACLY NOSTALGIA                                  Visual Arts - Soumitra Das                                                  
	The Society of Contemporary Artists kicked off its golden jubilee celebrations with a big party at Akar Prakar accompanied by an exhibition titled Exhibition of Small Works (Aug 12-23). There was an orgy of eating and drinking, and gatecrashers, all familiar faces, had a whale of a time. Nobody had any time for the accompanying exhibition, slight as it was, that later moved to the new space the Society has acquired in Kasba. Unlike the gallery, the Societys space is better suited for informal gatherings than for exhibitions, and so the paintings appropriated almost all the space available on the walls. They ended up looking like the metaphorical tinned sardines. The lighting, too, was quite miserable here, and the small bronzes, which occupied corners of the room, looked as if they were ashamed of being there. The tiny pieces of sculpture looked flat and dull, although they did not lack vitality.        
	What should have been one of the highlights of the show  the archival photographs of the Society  were displayed in the obscurity and semi-darkness of the staircase. They showed the members  many of them dead now  in the prime of their life, and a good number of them are hardly recognizable today. The Society has prepared a year-long programme to celebrate its golden anniversary, and publishing books on this rare artists group is one of them. One hopes these photographs will be splashed in them.        
	However, age does not always signify maturity, and the participating artists hardly had anything new to offer in this exhibition. Enervated Calcutta artists need to shake themselves out of their stupor. Actually, at times, even uniformly well-painted works can be bit of a drag. Ganesh Haloi is the only surviving founder member of this group, and however much one may admire the mathematical precision with which he slices the green landscape and water bodies of which Bengal was once so proud, at times, viewers may feel the need for some change. The triangles and polygons of blue, green and ochre, and the stubbled paddy fields are the very picture of tranquillity. But has not the same agricultural land turned into killing fields in recent times? Nostalgia can get treacly at times.        
	One wishes one could see Suhas Roys old prints, a new edition of which had been issued and displayed by another gallery. Instead, all one got to see was his current series of pretty women, of which his famous Radha has been done to death. Sad to say, Manu Parekh did send some works, but again they were of the slapdash kind, not of the quality one expects to see in a golden jubilee celebration show.         
	Sanat Kars despairing young man is a familiar figure. He appears in this particular work that looks smart as a bandbox with its green checks and various shades of blue. Perhaps the smartness was unintended. Amitabha Banerjees dark beauty and Lalu Prasad Shaws drawings, however, have been seen umpteen times.         
	After this disappointment, ones expectation of the artists of the next generation was not very high. Atin Basaks heads that looked like death masks, Aditya Basaks trapped birds, and Sadhan Chakrabortys people in conversation left one cold. Manoj Mitras head of a woman with flowers in her hair looked more like art work for some beauty product. Pradip Maitras Jesus was nothing much to write home about, but his second work, in which he strikes an equilibrium between the dark and light areas, looked striking. His skill as a watercolourist is unmistakable.        
	Of the sculptures, Niranjan Pradhans calf (picture) stood out for its suppleness. Sunil Kr Dass domestic animals in deep sleep were carefully observed.

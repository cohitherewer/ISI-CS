The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Stars that vanish with the night
                                                                                                                 STARS THAT VANISH WITH THE NIGHT                                Somak Ghoshal    VISUAL ARTs                                                
	The exhibition of works by artists from Hyderabad, organized by the Birla Academy of Art amp; Culture, could have been a welcome break from the monotony of the Calcutta art scene. Most of what is shown in city galleries often turns out to be clever, or not-so-clever, copies of the Bengal masters, sometimes inflected by a modernist idiom that the rest of the art world has outgrown at least half-a-century ago, frequently embellished with motifs and ideas aspiring to the avant-garde without quite getting there. Sadly, Rendezvous Hyderabad (Dec 16-Jan 3) did not exactly open magic casements to a new visual landscape.        
	This was not because the works on offer were ugly or vacuous. On the contrary, most of the artists, including a few well-known names, display signs of good training and sense. For instance, nice things can be said about Bairu Raghurams pen-and-ink drawings of rustic damsels, or about Kavita Deuskars colour-pencil portraits of Telengana women. Raghuram uses cross-hatching expertly to modulate the light and shade. Deuskar is able to tease out tones and textures using her unusual medium. But technically accomplished as they might be, there is a hint of sterility in both these artists. It is as if the images they produce are not ready to take off once they are finished. They have no afterlife in the eyes or minds of the viewers. The same holds true for K. Narendranaths pretty vignettes in soft pastel. He looks at life in the small town of Srikakulam unfolding in a languid pace. The result is visually pleasing, but one tends to forget all about the scenes as soon as one moves on.        
	Gouri Vemula is a printmaker who has been inspired by the essence of the Borra caves in the Araku valley. Her etchings on zinc plates depict vultures, a satyr and a hunchback. A judicious choice of colours captures the crusty texture of the eroded rock surface or a cave wall overgrown with moss. There may be a primal appeal in these images, but this revisiting of historical motifs is scarcely a novel enterprise. It has been sought out too often and too easily by contemporary artists. Vibrant colours and skilful drawing enliven the assembly of chattering females in Anjani Reddys acrylic. But is there really anything remarkable, let alone extraordinary, about such works?         
	It is difficult to decide if A. Rajeswara Raos image of an androgynous and heavily bejewelled lady seated before a mirror is naughty or simply banal. Presumably her husband (though one can never be sure) puts a gaudy necklace around her throat from behind. The title, Third Anniversary, is supposed to be enlightening. B. Padma Reddy is obsessed with a ghastly creature whom she calls Alchemist, and insists on showing us its visceral organs or what appears to be its tantric moments. And it is certainly not a good idea to place K. Srinivas Charis weak, but unabashed, imitations of Ganesh Pyne before Bengalis.         
	Moving on to the more abstract works, L.N.V. Srinivas seems to have discovered Jackson Pollock rather conveniently, and P. Gouri Shanker looks utterly unsure of what he means by Cityscape or Landscape. In a cute way, cows dominate the works of S. Bharat Yadav, Sisir Sahana and Sreekant Kurva. Yadavs bovine family (its members either looking blank or mating excitedly) is amusing, while Kurvas designer cows are strikingly ornate in their electric blues and lurid reds. Of the sculptures, the less said the better; only Y. Shivamacharys Imperishable love deserves an honourable mention. And outrageously, the gallery had put up a couple of prints of Surya Prakashs works in oil.        
	Finally, the risen stars of the South: Laxma Goud, Thota Vaikuntam and Laxman Aelay. Gouds works in oil appeal to the viewers for their mellow to dull colour grids, as if the compositions are dimly lit up from behind. Vaikuntam is a trickier artist. You think that if you have seen one, then you have seen them all, but you cannot help stealing yet another glance at the Telengana men and women rendered in Vaikuntams signature style (pictures). The portraits in this exhibition were in charcoal, which, surprisingly, revealed an intimate humanness in their subjects. Aelays skeletal figures (vague echoes of Somnath Hore here), with a thin red line cutting through them, have become mind-numbingly formulaic.

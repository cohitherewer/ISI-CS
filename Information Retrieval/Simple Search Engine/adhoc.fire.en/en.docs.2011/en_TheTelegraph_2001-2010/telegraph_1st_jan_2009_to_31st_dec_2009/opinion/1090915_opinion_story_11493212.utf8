The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Returning images of a paradise almost lost
                                                                                                                 RETURNING IMAGES OF A PARADISE ALMOST LOST                                  While Leh turns into a summer hub for tourists, the clouds of misunderstanding and hurt still brood over the Kashmir valley, writes Anabel Loyd                                      
	For tourists prepared to ignore the dramatics of both international and Indian national press stories, the divisions in the state of Kashmir and Jammu are less obviously the great wound between India and Pakistan and more the difference between the lush and beautiful valley with its courteous and dignified people and the barren hills of the plateau of Ladakh. Leh, the capital of Buddhist Ladakh, only a handful of decades out of the relative isolation of an inaccessible kingdom in the Himalayas, has become, for its brief summer season, a tourist and trekking hub, with foreign tourists apparently outnumbering locals in the main bazaars of the town. In the winter, though, carpeted in thick snow, the tourists and traders from Jammu and Srinagar, who cater to them, return from whence they came. Traditional Ladakhi life once again holds sway, as sociable and fun-loving locals drink local beer, chang, and party with friends and family to survive cold so extreme that toothpaste freezes in the tube and changing clothes is out of the question.        
	Life in Ladakh in the past could hardly be said to be easy. But the extraordinary contentment with a subsistence existence that revolved around seasons, family, community and religious ritual and festival is still apparent in the villages away from Leh, where work and play continue for the moment with much the same rhythms as in the past.        
	Non-governmental organizations these days struggle here as in every underdeveloped and poor area to improve health, education, nutrition, hygiene and high child mortality rates, but contemporary awareness of other lives has not so far diminished the good humour and high spirits of the Ladakhis. A passionate pride in home, place and environment is habitual among Indians, indeed to the extent sometimes that the outsider is left wondering how on earth this vast country holds together at all, even without politically inspired problems. In Ladakh, this means that most Ladakhis who leave for work or education have return as their goal and remain at all times deeply rooted in their villages and mountains.        
	In the Kashmir valley, too, there is enormous pride in everything Kashmir has been; beloved of Mughal emperors and as much of the less glamorous invaders of the British raj. The intensity of pride in the valley means a deep distrust of close neighbours, even of the peaceful Ladakhis, whose morality and honesty are questioned no less than those of Indians living on the plains. Kashmiris are prickly, no doubt about it. But they have been so regularly and endlessly damned by the press and by ill-informed foreign politicians with little understanding and no experience of the people or the situation of the valley that they can hardly be blamed for that. As it is, the extraordinary handicrafts of Kashmir, the exquisite shawls and carpets, in particular, have been ruthlessly exploited by greedy markets and traders, not, it has to be said, all outsiders, to the extent that there is little appreciation these days for pieces once understood to be unique works of art, now reduced to expensive commodities.              
	The chiru antelopes that provided wool for the fabled shatoosh shawl for hundreds of years are almost extinct, the effect of an impatient market with no care for rarity value; factories in Ludhiana and elsewhere produce thousands of pretty enough machine-made and cheap versions of shawls that would otherwise take weeks, months or even years to produce. And ersatz versions of Kashmiri carpets are made on looms around the world.        
	There are those like the Kashmir Loom Company and others fighting with some success for continued recognition of the old skills that make a handmade shawl or carpet as much to be valued and understood as an Old Masters painting. They are up against other problems as young people dismiss old family traditions and skills in favour of quicker, easier ways to make a buck. It is only to be hoped that the skills can at least be kept alive by the encouragement of a few and of the discerning collectors who are their clients. It is hard though, when a carpet made by hand over two years and involving the skills of a dozen craftsmen from four or five families sells wholesale for a couple of thousand dollars, the price only rising later by hundreds of per cent for the retailers profit.        
	Tourism should be the other money-spinner for the valley, but the scare stories and the advice of foreign ministries and offices abroad have created impregnable barriers to most holiday-makers. Good value, stunning scenery, excellent food, magnificent fishing, beautiful gardens, remarkable culture and unique shopping do not, it seems, outweigh the conviction that every delight comes with attached explosions. As it is, the houseboats on the Dal and Nageen lakes are fuller than they have been; young Israelis, against all advice of their government, are the most apparent nationality both here and in Ladakh, but it is not enough. They are, as a rule, travelling on a freedom kick after compulsory military service and often more interested in cheap drink and dope than in culture and carpets.        
	Since I was last in Kashmir, three years ago, there have certainly been changes and not only in the weight of motor vehicles in Leh. Perhaps the wheel is turning a little towards a greater optimism. The new, young and energetic chief minister, Omar Abdullah, inheritor and emulator of a family tradition, is setting about the infrastructure of the state with a will.              
	The precipitous road through the mountain passes from Srinagar to Kargil and on to Leh is being improved dramatically, and even at a relatively early stage, the journey time has been cut by some hours. The promotion of skiing and winter sports in Gulmarg and Sonmarg may create a cost-effective competitor for vastly expensive skiing holidays in Europe, even including long-haul travel. Next year, there should be direct flights to Srinagar via the Gulf. As the essential infrastructure for winter tourism grows, other sports, such as golf, are being catered for with new international level courses. Omar Abdullahs father, Farooq, was not loved for his use of public money to build a perfect golf course in Srinagar at a time of extreme insecurity, shortage of housing and public works. But such extravagance may pay dividends in time.         
	Meanwhile, a razor-wired and massive army presence causes the greatest depredations on the state and adds the greatest visual weight to the doomsayer stories we all read and hear so regularly. Less obvious than it was in Srinagar a few years ago, the people of the valley detest this colonizing force and the cost of its existence as it eats into state resources, and cements perceived prejudice.        
	Whereas in more laid-back Ladakh, a hearts-and-minds approach of school-building and fraternizing has created a reasonably easy relationship, a mistrust of the political and military centres of Hindu India, combined with local pride, does not allow any hope of a comfortable compromise in the valley. For the outside spectator, the costs of its massive army, a permanently occupying and ill-occupied force throughout Indian border territories, is, in the face of the extremes of perpetual poverty in rural and urban India, a sign of mismanagement at best, immoral at worst.        
	It is said that the cost of getting one egg to the troops based on the Siachen Glacier in northernmost Ladakh bordering Pakistan, is Rs 200, 2.50 or so. The costs of, and to, the Indian and Pakistani soldiers fighting a no-win on-and-off war of 17 years duration in a high altitude frozen hell are stratospheric. What to do? Being king of the castle on the glacier has become a matter of pride, costing both countries resources better used elsewhere.        
	In Ladakh, though, the metaphorical and literal clouds over the glacier that can be seen in the distance from the Nubra valley seem far away from sunny skies and smiling people as tourism turns Leh in summer into a miniature Kathmandu.              
	The busy flights up from Delhi and Mumbai pour ever- growing numbers of passengers into the airport, many of whom would do themselves a favour and avoid altitude sickness if they were to spend time first in the valley and progress in acclimatizing stages to Leh by car through some of the most spectacular scenery in the world. The valley is not a bomb-at-every-corner place, but a place of culture, natural beauty and a deeply bruised psyche that appreciative and relaxed holidaymakers can do a little to salve.

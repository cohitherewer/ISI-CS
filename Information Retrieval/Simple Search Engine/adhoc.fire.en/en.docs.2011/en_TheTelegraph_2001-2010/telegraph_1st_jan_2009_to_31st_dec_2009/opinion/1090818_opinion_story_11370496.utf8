	The fuss over Vasundhara Rajes resignation as the leader of the Opposition in the Rajasthan assembly reveals a fundamental flaw in the functioning of Indian democracy. Reports suggest that Ms Rajes fate and future will be decided by the central leadership of the Bharatiya Janata Party in Delhi. The BJP leadership wants her to step down from her position. The fact of the matter is that she is an elected representative of the people of Rajasthan. Her position as a leader can only be discussed in, and decided by, the BJPs legislative party in Rajastan. The latter is a recognized body, whereas the central leadership of the BJP has no constitutional locus standi. Yet Ms Raje has to act not according to the wishes of her peers in the Rajasthan assembly, but according to the diktats of her partys central leadership. What this shows is that in India, the legislative wing of a political party  that is, the elected representatives of the people  are invariably subject to what a partys central leadership decides. This can only be interpreted as a violation of simple democratic norms.        
	Ms Rajes predicament is only a particular case of a general phenomenon. Each leading political party in India has its central leadership  it may be given various names  that decides on all critical matters from policy to discipline. Such a body is often manned by persons who have never faced an electorate or secured a popular mandate. The legislative wing of a party, which is always constituted of people who have won an election, is made subservient to the central leadership. This means that, in theory and in practice, politicians not elected by the people have powers over people who are the elected representatives of the people. What can be more anomalous than this in a functioning democracy? Who is to be the leader of the Opposition  Ms Raje in Rajasthan or L.K. Advani in the Lok Sabha  should be decided by the legislative parties to which they belong. No other body should have a say in this.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | From being to nothingness
                                                                                                                 FROM BEING TO NOTHINGNESS                                                          
	A BIRD ALONE																														 By Ketaki Datta,   Sarup, Rs 200
    
	The existential angst, as defined by Jean-Paul Sartre in Being and Nothingness, stems mainly from a basic paradox in human consciousness. If we translate this paradox in terms of Lacanian psychoanalysis, then the angst can be seen as an outcome of troubled negotiations between an individuals perception of his self and the big Other, or the Symbolic order  which indicates that familial, social, economic and political institutions derive their meanings from a signifying chain.  
	Anita, the protagonist of Ketaki Dattas debut novel, is an individual whose angst lies in her ever-baffled attempts to understand the meaning of the events in her life. An elderly lady living in Darjeeling, Anita has her past buried in Calcutta. Sourav, her husband, walked out on her long ago, leaving her with two children, Sanju and Nina. Sanju is now settled in Bombay and spares very little thought for his mother. Nina lives in Paris with her family. For company, Anita has Chandana, the daughter of a baiji, whom she once saved from being sold and brought up like her own daughter.        
	The novel opens with Anita getting a missive from her childhood friend, Merlin. It is, as Anita notices with a note of chagrin, an interminably long letter, an epistolary autobiography, to be precise. She reads the letter intermittently, not always with interest, but somehow feels obliged to read it through. Meanwhile, she keeps receiving letters from Nina which are telegraphically short, if not curt. Chandana has gone to Gangtok to join a school, and Anita has her loneliness as a never-failing, but unkind, companion. Around this time, Nina decides to send her son, Duke, to India to live with Anita. Anita feels buoyed by this prospect: at least, a pulsating heart to share warmth, she thinks. But even this camaraderie is short-lived as Anita decides to send Duke to Chandanas school. Things change pretty soon in Gangtok as Duke becomes an unsuspecting witness to a murder, and Chandana decides to shift him to Calcutta.        
	What exactly has gone awry in Anitas life? Why should she always be forlorn and languish in loneliness? One explanation may be that the paradox couched in her consciousness blurs her vision of the swift transition from being to nothingness or, in Lacanian terms, she is taken in by the shiftiness of the signifying apparatus in the Symbolic order. Anita does not know exactly when her children got estranged, when Chandana developed a world of her own, when her beloved hills got into the thick of a sanguinary political turmoil, or when Merlin became her alter-ego. (Ironically, Merlin is dead when Anita visits her, which seems like a grotesque reduplication of the same existential paradox.) Anita is no less a victim of her own consciousness than of a transitional phase in the history of West Bengal.        
	For a debutante, Datta shows commendable skill in portraying Anitas mental landscape. Hers is a moving account of loneliness, which is nuanced and poetically inflected.

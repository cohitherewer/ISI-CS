The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | RED TERROR
                                                                                                                 RED TERROR                                                    
	It was once fashionable for French communists to note Vladimir Lenins affinity to Maximilien Robespierre. The use and rationalization of terror are common to all extremist ideologies. But from Lenin to Joseph Stalin to Mao Zedong, communist leaders have treated terror not only as a virtue but also as an instrument of State policy. Shocking though it is, the beheading of a policeman by Maoists in Jharkhand fits into the communist tradition. Its likeness to the Talibans ways of killing its enemies is more than incidental. Both pose as liberators and seek to justify terror and violence as necessary means to supposedly higher ends. Such ideologies have their appeal to sections of both the common people and the civil society. As the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, noted, the battle against the Maoists in India has to take into account these sections moral and intellectual support to the rebels. The Union home minister, P. Chidambaram, has now appealed to human rights groups to condemn unequivocally the brutal killing of the policeman in Jharkhand. A failure to condemn what he called cold-blooded murder will mean an abject surrender to not just the Maoists but all other groups that want to thrive on terror.        
	Mr Chidambaram has also offered to open talks between the government and the Maoists if the latter give up violence. It is a valid offer because the spread of Maoism in India has much to do with the issues of poverty and socio-economic backwardness of large sections of the people. The government has reasons to worry about why large masses of people, especially among the tribal communities, find the Maoist rebellion more attractive than the benefits of democratic politics. It is time to ponder seriously how to reach the fruits of democratic development to those living on the margins. But the governments offer of talks must not be seen as a sign of its weakness. Andhra Pradesh has periodically banned the Maoists and negotiated with them. But the Maoists have used peace overtures and ceasefires to regroup and re-arm themselves. For all their complaints about social and economic oppressions, communist rebels everywhere aim at taking over State power. New Delhi and the governments in Maoism-affected states, therefore, cannot afford to lose the battle against the rebels. Democracy has its flaws, but a totalitarian ideology is no alternative.

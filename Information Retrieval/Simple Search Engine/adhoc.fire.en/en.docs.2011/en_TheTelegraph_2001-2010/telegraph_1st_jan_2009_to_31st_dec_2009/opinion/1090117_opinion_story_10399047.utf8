The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | deaths foretold
                                                                                                                 DEATHS FORETOLD                                                          
	Becoming a powerhouse of the world is a splendid dream. India is pursuing the dream determinedly and convincingly, with the gross domestic product growing at an impressive rate. Strangely enough, India does not seem to think that a strong and healthy generation should carry the dream forward, because its spending on public health has fallen to two per cent of its impressive GDP. No one should be surprised that 78,000 of its mothers die during childbirth in a year and one million of its children die before they are 28 days old. The Unicef report that presents these facts, The State of the Worlds Children, 2009: Maternal and Newborn Health, says alongside that India has actually improved in the last few years in these areas; the figures indicate the reduced rates of mother-and-child mortality.        
	That is nice to know. India is now losing less than a lakh of mothers and just about a million babies immediately after birth each year, although in the years that it is supposed to have reduced its rates of loss, technology has progressed by leaps and bounds. Only this is not a matter of technology; it is a matter of things that existed long before technology became a talking point, such as poverty, the lack of education, social insecurity and the hopelessly backward status of women. It is also a matter of poor governance and institutional callousness that make medical care inaccessible to the rural poor. The logic of liberalization has encouraged the growth of private health care, but that means nothing to the woman in the village. Sixty per cent of Indias women give birth at home, 38 per cent of the mothers who do not survive die of bleeding and 11 per cent of sepsis. Babies whose mothers die within six weeks of giving birth are most likely to die themselves within two years.        
	Facts can seldom get more painful than these, and they represent the net result of a range of failures. Whatever the laws against minor marriage, 27 per cent of girls are married off before they are 15, and if they give birth before 15 too, they are five times more likely to die. A staggering 58 per cent of girls are married before 18. These figures imply truly frightening conditions of nurture. A mother of 15 or less is unlikely to be educated enough to face the challenges of an increasingly literate and technologically-oriented world. She would be unfit to protect her child, or to provide support if he ever goes to school. Her own nutrition would be in doubt. A girl can be a mother in her teens only in a household that is least concerned about her welfare. Unfortunately, that would mean that she would be unable to provide enough nutrition for her baby, even if it is a much-prized boy.        
	India is perhaps being prodded into realizing, slowly, that its women and children need health and education for the overall growth of the country. The National Rural Health Mission is offering cash support to pregnant women below the poverty line. Changes are being promised by 2011. But what was happening in the last 60 years?

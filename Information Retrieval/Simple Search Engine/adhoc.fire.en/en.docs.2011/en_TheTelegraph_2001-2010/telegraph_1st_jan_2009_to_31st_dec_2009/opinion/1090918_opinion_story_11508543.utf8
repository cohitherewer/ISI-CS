	Whatever may have been the gains of what some political scientists have described as the deepening of democracy, the loss is visible in the sharp decline in a sense of humour among the political and the chattering classes. People unfamiliar with English usage and with the nuances of the language suddenly take umbrage at phrases that are perfectly normal and acceptable. Thus, Shashi Tharoor finds himself in a meaningless controversy because he used the words, cattle class and holy cow. Mr Tharoor, after a career in the United Nations and with a curriculum vitae that shows that he went to some of the best known schools and colleges, used the phrases with his tongue firmly in his cheek as most people hailing from a similar background are prone to do. But the humourless apparatchiki of the Congress party have taken serious exception to his language. They have seen in Mr Tharoors use of the phrases an elitist attitude that is completely unaware of Indian social and political realities. Alas, poor Mr Tharoor, before he joined politics he hadnt taken a course in subaltern speak and political correctness. He spoke as he was trained to speak in the classrooms of St Xaviers Collegiate School, Calcutta, St Stephens College, Delhi, and the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy in Boston. He has to learn now to prepare a face for the faces that he meets in the Congress party office.        
	There is a wider sociological phenomenon revealed by this incident. This is the pronounced tendency of people to take themselves too seriously. The Congress party has gone on an overdrive with its austerity measures. This is wise and good. But this should not mean that the leaders within the Congress should abandon the ability to laugh at themselves. Nobody, unless he is Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, prefers to travel by economy or cattle class. Circumstances have forced leaders, accustomed to certain kinds of comfort, to accept less comfortable modes of travel. Good grace demands that people should not be hypocritical about this. Indian politicians tend to be earnest, self-righteous and holier-than-thou. This is what Mr Tharoor was poking fun at when he spoke of holy cows. He was trying to lighten things up. He has obviously failed, for no fault of his own. It is high time people realized that nothing is beyond laughter. The importance of being earnest has to be balanced by the importance of laughter.

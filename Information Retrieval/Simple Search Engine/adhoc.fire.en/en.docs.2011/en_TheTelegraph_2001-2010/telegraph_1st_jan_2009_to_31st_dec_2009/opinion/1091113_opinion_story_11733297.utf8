The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | back to basics
                                                                            Friday , November 13 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                              BACK TO BASICS                                                    
	In every gentlemans club in postcolonial India, there is the fuddy-duddy who sits around with his whisky and never tires of declaiming that the only solution for the anarchy of independent India is the return of colonial rule. He is rightly dismissed as a reactionary old bore. But the most patriotic Calcuttan would perhaps think twice before dismissing as imperialism an old law recently rediscovered in the archives that allows the police to arrest without warrant anyone caught littering or ravaging the Maidan. Article III of the 1881 Fort William Act had made the Maidan a no-nuisance piece of land. And it is both amusing and dispiriting to read the list of offences against the greens that this law imagines itself punishing: littering, bathing, washing clothes, picketing, spitting paan, cooking, washing dishes, destroying trees, bushes and plants, and so on. Obviously, old habits die hard. The fact that these offences have survived robustly into the present, while the law has been quietly forgotten, is a telling comment on the effectiveness of colonial rule. The ravaging of the Maidan continues with impunity  a wonderful testimony to the resilience of native energies.        
	Yet, it is reassuring for most concerned Calcuttans that there does exist a law, which might be resurrected to add new ammunition to the ongoing battle for the preservation of the citys greens. A whole range of enthusiasts need to be civilized by something powerful enough to counter the combined ineffectiveness of the police, the military and the State. These passionate creatures range from book-lovers to leaders of the masses to open-air cooks, not to mention the masses themselves. When asked to respond to the idea of such a law, senior police officers have called for a more balanced approach than arresting without a warrant. The court is always on the right side of the problem when it comes to the Maidan, but nothing that it has pronounced has been implemented with any consistency by the citys law and order machinery or by the state government. So, even if the old law is revived, who will enforce it and how? Environmental or green-bench activism is certainly not a new-fangled thing, as the existence of this law proves. Concern for health, beauty and ecology, whether democratic or colonial, has been, and ought to be, part of the natural reflexes of any civilized society.

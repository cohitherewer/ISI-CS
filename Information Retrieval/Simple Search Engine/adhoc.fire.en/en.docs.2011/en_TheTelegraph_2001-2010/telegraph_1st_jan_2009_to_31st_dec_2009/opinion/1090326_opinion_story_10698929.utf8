	India has been mostly spared from being infected by the banking subprime virus which triggered the global economic meltdown. Although Indias economic growth has slowed from around nine per cent gross domestic product growth per annum to an estimated seven per cent in the current year, the country has remained, along with China and Brazil, reasonably insulated from the collapse of economic growth worldwide. As a matter of fact, with the drop in crude and commodity prices, which plagued the world last year, inflation in India has come down dramatically. It is highly probable that the economic slowdown here is bottoming out and we may well witness a gradual upward trend in growth in the coming quarters. Unlike China, exports as a percentage of Indias GDP are relatively modest, and that has helped as well.        
	India has, so far, remained reasonably insulated from the global banking crisis because its banking system has avoided the virus demolishing the banks of the developed countries. Although India has experienced a higher outflow of foreign institutional investor funds and a dramatic collapse of equity prices, these have been more in response to global stock market sentiments rather than a reflection of domestic reality. Domestic demand, both urban and, more specifically, rural, remains buoyant in India. The growth of fast-moving consumer goods, telecommunications and education sectors have been particularly healthy, while consumer durables and real estate sectors have responded by price moderation, reflecting the astute price sensitivity of the Indian consumer. The growth in the infrastructure sector remains sluggish, as it has been in the recent past, and is a weakness in Indias economic growth story. The other noteworthy strength is the very healthy domestic savings rate which is one of the highest in the world.              
	So looking ahead, does India have cause for worry? The response to this question will depend upon how long the developed economies take to recover from the present crises. While the domestic demand will keep growing healthily for the next 10-15 years, a prolonged depression of global trade is bound to have adverse impact on growth economies like India and China. On the question, How long? no one is ready to speculate.        
	The key underlying factor that has protected India, until now, from the global turmoil is the relative insulation of the Indian banking system from the global financial virus. The delay in the opening up of the Indian banking sector to global competition is the principal reason that India has been spared the meltdown. The delay was primarily to prepare domestic banks to become familiar with the ever-growing complexity of international financial instruments as well as to conform to the Basel protocols for international banking regulation.        
	What triggered the banking crisis in the developed economies is being widely analysed by economists and reported by journalists almost every day. It is, however, hugely complex and labyrinthine, making the story amorphous and esoteric for the non-specialist. Since this crisis may have a deeper impact on India if it is not resolved in reasonable time, it is worth recalling the comprehensible elements of the developments which have led to the present state of affairs.        
	Although nobody is ready to admit that the world financial turmoil may be worse than the one experienced during the Great Depression of the 1930s, there is a palpable undercurrent of fear that it may be nearly so and could be even worse. Worse, because the game has yet to play itself out and no one is ready to speculate when that might be. Daily articles, analysing causes and possible cures, are appearing about the financial crisis and how it has built up and acquired critical mass over time. Most of the articles are by economists or specialized journalists and tend to be dense for the common reader. Snatches of information supposed to make sense seem frightening, such as the report that wealth worth 50 trillion dollars has been wiped out in the crisis. That figure incidentally is the same as the annual GDP of the world. Who had this wealth and how it has been lost, was it real or ethereal, and so on, remain obscure. But virtually every human being on earth is having to pay a price, one way or the other, for the excesses of a few. The crisis is of such gigantic proportions that it has triggered debates on whether the world is witnessing the end of capitalism. Although capitalism may not die, the excesses and hubris of financial markets and institutions are likely to remain dormant for a long time.        
	I can recall the heady beginnings of the emerging world financial centres in Europe which were launched to compete with the United States of America. Their objective was to generate and grow the equity cult, akin to production of goods and services, but by processes which very few understood and, as a consequence, were labelled financial engineering and innovation. The Reagan/Thatcher era promoted the concept that greed is good and that too many regulations fetter the human spirit. That China, under Deng Xiaoping, had embraced Western capitalism with open arms was a big boost for the votaries of the unfettered pursuit of wealth. With the collapse of the former Soviet Union, socialist economic models were discarded as debris of the 20th century.        
	Thus began the era of financial innovation as a catalyst of wealth creation and the galloping rise of stock markets was seen as access to wealth for the common man in unprecedented ways. There appeared, however, early warnings in the form of the savings and loan crisis during the Reagan era, the September 1987 crash of the stock markets and a few others. Downturns and upswings were explained away as normal cycles that could be dealt with in new ways by the financial engineers. It was during these heady years that graduates fresh out of business schools were scooped off their feet from around the world with six-figure dollar salaries and, in this heady environment, financial engineering finally came of age.        
	Financial engineering is made up of money instruments (such as loans, mortgages, and so on) being subjected to multiple iteration and mathematical permutations and combinations, with the sole purpose of deriving algorithms (equations) to maximize returns while reducing risks from financial products. Besides loans and mortgages, products included commodities futures, crude prices, exchange rates, and so on. The algorithms produced by the bright and bushy-tailed whiz kids in the basements and vaults of banks and financial companies were then used by the dealers in the front offices and back offices to create markets and conduct commerce for novel products. The nature of the products progressively became obscure and people dealing in these products began to understand them less and less. Gradually, debts and risks were dismantled, packaged and repackaged and presented as new and attractive Triple A-rated financial products, implying very low risks and high returns to customers, who had come to trust and depend on the system.              
	The world of financial transactions became entangled in a web of algorithms which no one understood but were afraid to ask about. The contagion of not admitting that the users did not understand the products they were dealing in, slowly travelled up the organization and, eventually, into the boardrooms. One of the principal reasons for the denial syndrome was the huge profits which the institutions were generating and the unheard of salaries and bonuses that the employees began to enjoy. Thus, began a long period of laissez-faire capitalism which finally reached a dead end.        
	Even the regulatory bodies were loath to admit that they really did not quite understand what was happening in the increasingly complex money markets. The regulators were products of an era which espoused that the fewer the regulations the better the innovations, and that the foundations of Anglo-Saxon morality and honesty provided sufficient checks and balances in Western societies, and this separated them from the rest of the world.        
	The unheard-of amounts of annual bonuses and unprecedented levels of conspicuous consumption by a section of society gave the impression that a new steam-engine had been discovered which would perpetually belch out wealth in unlimited quantities. The fairy-tale had to come to an end. We saw a few of these excesses in India as well. Fortunately, we were less prone to such excesses. We should thank our old-fashioned habit of thrift and living within our means as qualities that have stood India in good stead.         
	There have been news reports that India has been shielded from the calamity because it is a developing country with lots of poor people. For a change, being a developing country may turn out to be a virtue.

                                                                                                                 STRAY SHOT                                                    
	A tragedy takes on its sharpest edge when a specially promising young life is laid to waste. Eighteen-year-old Gagandeep Singh had already won laurels as a player in the junior Indian cricket team, and there were many hopes for his future. Singh was in Meerut to play for the under-22 C.K. Nayudu Trophy, when he was shot, apparently because he got in the way, by a thug firing at the owner of a kebab outlet for alleged delay in service. It would take a particularly paranoid sensibility to imagine that an innocent visit to a kebab shop by young men could turn into a blood-soaked tragedy without the help of terrorists or insurgents. The restaurant-owner died along with Singh because he refused to serve the thugs out of turn. Another employee was seriously injured.        
	There is a shocking meaninglessness about these deaths that raises questions about the way Indians exist from day to day. The young cricketers death adds to the poignancy, but the questions would have been there anyway. This is a country in which not just rich peoples children, but also the children of any officer who has access to firearms can and do use guns. For the thug who shot two people dead was the son of a policewoman. There is a peculiar slackness in work culture and ethics that breeds disrespect for the paraphernalia of work, a sick sense of self-importance among petty criminals that makes a delay in service a shooting matter, a casual attitude to crime among the police some of whom have criminals as close friends, the nurturing of underworld contacts and musclemen by politicians, an indifference to the law, all of which build up to the extreme brittleness of civic life. Anything can happen at any time. There can be no security for the citizen if every thug carries a gun and feels free to use it everytime his wishes are thwarted. It may take time to deal with terrorists and insurgents. But can anyone claim that an environment with proper policing and higher professional standards would not have saved Singhs life?

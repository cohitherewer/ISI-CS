	A hotel employee who killed a government official who tried to rape her has become a heroine, and not just on the internet  there have been marches in her favour, university students have performed street plays about her, the official media have rallied round her and the China Womens Association has taken note of her.         
	The story, as told by the employee herself (through her lawyer, reported in a Guangzhou newspaper) is this: Deng Yujiao was washing her clothes in the water treatment room of a hotel when a man came there. Those rooms, apparently, are meant for sexual services to male patrons. The man insisted she take a bath with him. She refused, saying she worked in another department, and tried to leave, but he grabbed her arm, pulled her towards the bed, yanked off her trousers and molested her. She managed to kick him and rush to the adjacent room.        
	By this time, another man entered. The first complained that he had been tricked by the girl. Deng again repeated that she didnt work there, but the second retorted: Arent you all the same? Dont you want money? You have never seen any money. Would you believe if I am going to beat you to death with money today. He then went on to slap her face and shoulder with a wad of notes. The girl tried to leave but the men pulled her back, shoved her on the sofa and pounced on her. By now, Deng had taken out a small knife from her purse. She stabbed them. The second man died while the first was hurt on his arm. Deng then called the police and her mother.        
	The first man was the vice- director in the local governments business department; the man who died was the director of the towns development department.                
	True heroine        
	The police charged Deng with intentional murder. Questioned by the press, they said that the hypothetical self-defence could not have resulted in such injuries, and then went on to describe the case as very ordinary. They rued the way the public and the media insist on turning (it) into a tragedy. This is indeed tragic for the families of the deceased and the survivors. They then put out the story that Deng was under medication for depression, and also claimed that her mother had denied any rape attempt on her daughter, and had even dismissed Dengs lawyers.         
	By then, the official newspaper, China Daily, had conducted an internet poll among the Deng Yujiao Fan Club and found responses such as She is Chinas true Heroine, There should be a park named after her and She should be the next Premier. Most respondents wanted to marry her. Her story was also written out as a chronicle in traditional Chinese.        
	Very quickly, Beijing sent out instructions that only the official version of the case be used. Internet portals were told to downplay the story and filter comments. Journalists visiting Dengs grandparents in their village were assaulted by goons. Soon, all outsiders visiting the town were being asked to turn back.        
	But the censors could not stop people marching on the streets demanding her release and condemning the police. This had the desired effect: Deng was released from custody, placed under house arrest, and the charge against her changed to excessive self-defence. The injured official was dismissed, stripped of his party membership and detained for public order offences.        
	What will Dengs fate be? The Supreme Peoples Court has advised the lower court to be cool-headed. An editorial in China Daily gives some clue: The thug certainly deserved to be punished, yet probably not killed as he was. Deng was justified in defending herself, but not to the point of taking his life.

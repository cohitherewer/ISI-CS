The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Food,   glorious   food!
                                                                                                                 Food,   glorious   food!
          The proposed National Food Security Act promises to deliver the poor from hunger. But the legislation will be effective only if the public distribution system is toned up, argues Shabina Akhtar                          FOOD FOR THOUGHT: As much as 50 per cent of the population may benefit from the National Food Security Act                                               
	Selima Bibi, a resident of a shanty in central Calcutta, ignores her five-year-old son when he cries for food. She is going to boil some rice in a while but theres precious little else that she can give him to eat. The malnourished boy, with a swollen belly and rickety legs, slinks off whimpering, perhaps to forage for food somewhere else.        
	Selima Bibi and her family are among millions of people in India who do not get enough to eat. In fact, if the latest survey by the ministry of rural development is to be believed, about 50 per cent of Indias population suffers from malnutrition. However, that may change soon.        
	The United Progressive Alliance government has promised to come up with the National Food Security Act (NFSA). This will provide a statutory framework to ensure food security for all. The proposed law is to be drafted by the ministry of food and public distribution in consultation with several non-governmental organisations and the Supreme Court Commissioners (SCC), a body formed by the apex court in 2001 to address the problem of hunger.        
	The NFSA will entitle every family below the poverty line (BPL) in rural and urban areas to 25 kg of rice or wheat a month at a subsidised rate of Rs 3 per kg. Targeted identification cards will be issued to people who fall below the poverty line. The delivery monitoring unit in the Prime Ministers Office will be overseeing the project.        
	Yet despite the laudable objectives of the law, many feel that it would actually be a step back from what the government is providing now. Given that India has a very high percentage of people suffering from hunger and malnutrition, we do require such a law. However, 2.5 crore BPL cardholders are already getting food grains at the rate of Rs 2 per kg. Besides, each BPL household is entitled to 35 kg of rice or wheat a month. If the government plans to reduce entitlements in the name of food security and ask the beneficiaries to pay a rupee extra per kg, then what kind of food security is this, asks Member of Parliament and CPI(M) politbureau member Brinda Karat.        
	Karat has a point. Under existing schemes like the Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) each BPL household is entitled to 35 kg of food grains a month at the rate of Rs 2 per kg. Then why bring in such a law at all?        
	Says Biraj Patnaik, principal advisor, SCC, Both the Supreme Court and the high courts have repeatedly interpreted the right to food and shelter as a fundamental right. But unless a right is clearly explicated and broken down into solid entitlement, it fails to deliver. Schemes such as the AAY are there, but they can be done away with any time. Once the National Food Security Act comes into force, however, it would require an amendment to be passed in Parliament to make any changes to its entitlements.        
	Patnaik feels that schemes such as the AAY will probably be merged with the new law eventually. However, he also says that the government may have to raise the entitlement to 35 kg of rice a month per BPL household in the draft bill, in keeping with what poor families are already getting under the Antyodaya Anna Yojana scheme.        
	Another critical issue is the assessment of those who will benefit from it. The Planning Commission report of 2002 made 65 million people beneficiaries of the AAY schemes. Yet the state governments have already issued BPL cards to over a 100 million households. But if one goes by the recent survey by the ministry of rural development, as many as 50 per cent of the Indian population is likely to benefit from the law.        
	N.C. Saxena, a former secretary of the Planning Commission, who conducted the survey at the behest of the ministry of rural development, says, The analysis shows that the percentage of rural population unable to satisfy the minimum calorie requirements is far greater than the present 28.3 per cent of the total population. I have recommended that the percentage of people entitled to BPL status should be increased to at least 50 per cent.        
	Others say that the law will be futile if it does not tone up the public distribution system (PDS). Devinder Sharma, chairman of the Forum for Biotechnology and Food Security, a collective of scientists, economists, farmers and policymakers, says that what plagues the proper implementation of existing schemes is the not-so-transparent PDS. The Act should try and reform the public distribution system. It is one of the most corrupt systems in the country, he says.        
	Saxena agrees. Many policies have failed because of the deficiencies in the public distribution system. The government procures 40 million tonnes of food grains from farmers. And this amount needs a market so it needs to be given to the poor at a subsidised rate. So the PDS needs massive reform.        
	Experts also suggest that the law ought to look at the idea of direct cash transfer, that is, providing cash in lieu of the amount of food grains a family is entitled to. As I have mentioned in my paper, one needs to experiment with the idea of direct cash transfer in places where there is a good banking facility. You can then see what people prefer  PDS or direct cash transfer.        
	Right now, there is every indication that the government means business when it comes to the NFSA. It has expressed its desire to work closely with activists in order to come up with a draft bill that is satisfactory to all. Apart from securing entitlements, the legislation should also have provisions for vulnerable groups. We have come up with a draft that will be submitted to the ministry after our July 11 meeting in Delhi, reveals Trilochan Pandey, secretariat, Right to Food Campaign, New Delhi.        
	Activists who have been campaigning hard to ensure food security for Indias toiling masses feel that the law is long overdue. The government should have brought in such a law earlier. But its better late than never. Now the policymakers should think of policies that will ensure the judicious implementation of the law, says Sharma.

	On the road to nowhere      
	Here and Beyond: Early 20th Century Womens Literature of Bengal (Yapanchitra, Rs 200) edited by Barnali Roy and Subhranshu Maitra is a rare collection that brings together little-known women writers forgotten by history. It is significant that for most of these women, no biographical information is available. But they live in their stories, which thus become immensely important documents preserving lost voices. Most of the stories revolve around the lesser world of the household with which the authors were inextricably involved. Self-sacrifice is a common thread uniting these stories and this says a lot about the qualities considered desirable in women. In At the End of the Journey, Shyama, the dark-skinned heroine, gives up her life for the husband, who had rejected her after the marriage ceremony on account of her skin colour. Better editing and more careful translation would have added to the books value. The translators penchant for line-long ellipses is quite baffling.                         
	Molly Foxs Birthday (Faber, 7.99) by Deirdre Madden is a quiet and brooding novel where the unnamed narrator reflects on the reasons why her friend, the famous actor, Molly Fox, does not celebrate her birthday. Not much happens in its pages, and the reader is left undecided as to whether this is a sign of greatness or of insipidity. Even if the former is true, Madden would do well to add some action to her narratives in the future. Otherwise, readers are likely to fall asleep in the middle of the narrators introspections that go on endlessly without any tonal variation.                        
	Pilgrims (Bloomsbury, Rs 350) by Elizabeth Gilbert is the latest offering from the author of the best-selling Eat, Pray, Love. As the books title and the Epigraph from Chaucers Prologue indicate, all the 12 short-stories revolve around journeys, with the characters always coming and going, being stranded in the middle of nowhere, or desperately searching for an elusive home. With little or no knowledge of where they are going, they just keep walking in the hope that they will reach somewhere. Gilberts stories are stark, fragmented, yet peppered with humour and sympathy, without which they would have sounded bitter.                        
	Why I am a Believer: Personal Reflections on Nine World Religions (Penguin, Rs 450) edited by Arvind Sharma allows the adherents of nine different religions to voice the reasons behind their beliefs. Ultimate questions of life and death feature prominently in each of the narratives. It is impossible not to be a little wary of the writers spirited professions of their beliefs given the tendency of faith to slide into prejudice.                                 
	Welcome to Advertising! Now, get Lost! (Tranquebar, Rs 395) by Omkar Sane is a smartly packaged book that testifies to the skill of the writer as an adman. In the words of ad guru, Bharat Dabholkar, This book is a sharp-witted look at the advertising industry as it really is. It tells you why most of the time advertising agencies work so well and advertising doesnt. It is difficult to say whether the flair Sane displays in writing this colourful book is really wit or just outr cleverness. The book is funny, but only up to a point after which the twists and turns of phrases, falling into a predictable pattern, begin to appear rather asinine. Sample this: The Proof is a printout of the Ad on the actual paper of the media  newspaper, hoarding, etc. It is also the piece of paper also acting as a coffee table near the Art Directors desk. Is the double also in the second sentence a sign of the shortage of deft proofreaders for this book or just a part of Sanes ingenious style?

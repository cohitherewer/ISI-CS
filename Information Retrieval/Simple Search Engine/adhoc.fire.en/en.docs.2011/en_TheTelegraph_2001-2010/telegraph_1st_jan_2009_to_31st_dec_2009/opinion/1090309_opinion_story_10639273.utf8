                                                                                                                 MATCHING UP                                                    
	It is encouraging that the chief election commissioner has left behind his ugly quarrel with a fellow commissioner and turned his attention to making elections more enticing. His idea of using film stars to sell elections is, however, not one of his brightest. True, the Election Commission has unlimited access to government funds, and its aims are so laudable that no one will grudge it splurging on pretty faces. But elections do not need to be sold to Indians; for all their rurality and navet, Indians do vote in remarkably large numbers. The fear that they will be kept away from polling booths by the threat of terror is also misplaced. The number of booths is so large that few attract large crowds; usually, as long as one goes in the afternoon when the rest of India sleeps, one can walk into a booth without waiting. Almost all of electoral violence is engendered by those in power and those who want to get into power.         
	It can, indeed, be argued that the EC is too cautious, and uses far more security forces than it requires. This is partly because it opens so many booths; each of them requires a posse of guards. But even more, it is due to the primitive technology of voting, which requires that a voter must trudge down to a particular booth on a particular day to vote. As long as he carries reliable means of identification, there is no reason to confine him to a single booth; the machinery is adequate as long as he votes anywhere within his constituency. Nor is it necessary that everyone in a neighbourhood votes on the same day. Most of the expense is incurred in setting up booths and supplying them with personnel; once that investment is made, the booths could stay open for two or more days. And finally, the EC should now permit remote voting. If people can make payments on their mobiles, there is no reason why they should not be able to dial their vote.        
	The government poses a threat to Indian Premier League matches. It says that it does not have enough guards to stage an election and protect spectators in stadiums. If the EC were to try out the innovations mentioned here, it will increase the productivity of protective personnel so much that staging cricket matches will become childs play. At that point, they could be staged by the EC itself. It would be great if it took on staging of cricket matches as a diversification. That will increase its capacity utilization, and bring down costs all round. It may make such profits out of cricket that it will be able to hold many more elections. If it holds enough of them, electors may be able to vote directly on everything, and we may not need politicians.

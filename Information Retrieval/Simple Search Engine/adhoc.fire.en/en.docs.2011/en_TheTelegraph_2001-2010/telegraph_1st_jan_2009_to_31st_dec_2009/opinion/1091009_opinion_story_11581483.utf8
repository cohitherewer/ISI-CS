                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Points to ponder                  
	Sir  One can have no doubt about the value of the decade-long on ground experience of dealing with Naxalites of the former director of the Border Security Force, Mahendra Kumawat. At the same time, is it not right to say that the experience being talked about was an experience of failure? (Veteran questions Maoist fight, Oct 4). I disagree with Kumawats view that the government should focus more on development than on fighting the armed rebels. Contrary to what Kumawat suggests, it is following this course that will result in Afghanistan and Iraq-like security liabilities in the long run.          
	India is a free country. Freedom involves that of thought and expression, among other things, but not the freedom to murder people. A murder, whether politically motivated or not, is a crime and the perpetrator must be punished by the law as any other criminal. The governments actions should be directed towards uprooting murderous forces such as the Maoists first, and only after that has been accomplished, can they be veered towards the development of the deprived people. If we cannot check an anti-State force that kills people in the name of political belief, it might threaten to overpower the government one day. This is not to say that development work should cease until the fight with the Maoists is over. However, the position of the home minister, P. Chidambaram, of striking hard at the Maoist-controlled zones before bringing development there, makes good sense. One needs to eliminate an infection before starting to rebuild ones health.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Mahendra Kumawat has raised a timely and pertinent question on the issue of Indias fight against the Maoists. It is understandable that Kumawat, given his experience, should make suggestions as to how to tackle the Maoists. But he did not have much success during his tenure owing to lack of co-ordination at the national level. It is sad that in spite of being a capable member of the army, Kumawat could not serve his people better.           
	Insurgencies are not merely the works of rebels. They can also signal the emotional outburst of a suffering populace. Such emotions can then go against the interests of the State. In the present situation, the government should dissociate itself from the routine operations of the armed forces so as not to aggravate the problem.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Jayanta Datta, Chinsurah, Hooghly

                
	Sir  People living in the pockets now occupied by the Maoists have long been exploited by those in power, including the administration and the police. It is also true that many people have been uprooted from their lands and denied their livelihood in the name of development.          
	The Maoists had come to fight for the poor in this context.The government, instead of waging war with the rebels, should work toward the development of these areas. It should understand that the Maoists fight against oppression. If the government begins to work for the deprived, the Maoists movement will become irrelevant.                     
	Yours faithfully,        Hara Lal Chakraborty, Calcutta

	Sir  Chinas move of issuing stapled visas to Kashmiris, departing from the standard practice of stamping the visa onto the passport, should serve as a wake-up call for India (Protest over stapled visa, Oct 2). Separatist forces in Kashmir will now try to encash this slight to Indias sovereignty to create divisions. India should make it clear to China that Kashmir is not a disputed territory but an integral part of India. It also needs to remind the world that differences with Pakistan on the Kashmir issue will be sorted out bilaterally and India would not brook mediation from any other country.           
	Yours faithfully,       
S. Balakrishnan, Jamshedpur

                
	Sir  Chinas decision to give residents of Jammu and Kashmir visas on a separate piece of paper, to be stapled onto the passport, smacks of a design to undermine Indias integrity. Immigration authorities have rightly reacted to Chinas discriminatory practice by not allowing anyone with a stapled visa to travel to China, although the Chinese embassy has certified such visas as valid. China is perhaps forgetting the fact that its aggressive intent regarding Tibet is known to the whole world. It has shown the same kind of attitude towards Arunachal Pradesh. China, despite Indias objections, issues stapled visas to residents of Arunachal Pradesh, which it claims as its own territory. Indians  politicians and common people alike  should come out strongly against this aggressive strategy.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Afghanistan has hit the predictable path towards a run-off after the inconclusive presidential elections of August. But this is more because of the choice of the incumbent president than that of the people. On Tuesday, Hamid Karzai chose to accept that he had fallen short of a majority verdict. The unpleasant situation arose after an inquiry by the Electoral Complaints Commission of Afghanistan, under the aegis of the United Nations, led to the cancellation, on grounds of fraud, of chunks of votes that had gone in Mr Karzais favour. He could have challenged the ECCs conclusion in court and avoided a run-off. After all, the Independent Election Commission, run by his government, had conclusively decreed his electoral win  never mind the many boxes found stuffed with ballot paper not even torn off from the book stub or others that were signed in the same hand and pen.        
	The reason why Mr Karzai felt compelled to allow himself to undergo a second round was because of his critical dependence on the Western allies for logistical support. Without them providing foreign troops to deflect the Taliban, manpower to conduct the humungous task of elections, or facilitating aid and training, Mr Karzai would still not be able to venture too far. Over the years, he has undoubtedly cultivated political relations within the country and beyond, with China and Russia, to overcome his handicap, but the logistics do bother. The threat of the Nato allies indefinitely withholding addition to troops must have rankled, if not their displeasure with a dubious victory. For Mr Karzai, a run-off is thus the least worst option. There are chances of the Taliban playing spoilsport. But in a contest held within three weeks, Mr Karzai could still hope for his support networks  worked out assiduously before the August elections  to return him a decent victory than their being able to do so in the distant future. Besides, three weeks could be enough time for a compromise to be worked out with the political rival. It is important for Mr Karzai, but perhaps more important for his Western allies, that the next government in Afghanistan should appear to represent the peoples choice. On that hinges the exit plan of the Nato countries. But given that even fewer people may be willing to participate in this charade, there is little chance that the run-off will lead to a more representative government than the first round did.

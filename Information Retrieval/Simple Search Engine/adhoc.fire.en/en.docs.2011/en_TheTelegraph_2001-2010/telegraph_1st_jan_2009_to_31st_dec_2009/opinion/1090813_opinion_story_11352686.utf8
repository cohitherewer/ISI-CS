                                                                                                                 ACT BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE                                  FACE-OFF      Tiger conservation needs collaboration between the social and the ecological sciences                                                  
	The candid admission of the Union minister of state for environment and forests, Jairam Ramesh, that the data concerning the number of tigers published until recently lacked scientific basis, has won him considerable appreciation from conservationists and scientists. There was little government backing till now for knowledge-driven approaches to tiger conservation. But Rameshs initiative to actively enlist scientists in the governments project for tiger conservation is genuinely progressive.        
	It is essential to see beyond the obvious ways in which science can contribute to tiger conservation. Technological advances have no doubt helped us understand the tigers ecology and conservation status better than before. But science, in its broadest sense, can also help us unravel the big cats survival needs while keeping in mind the equally legitimate livelihood and development demands of Indias marginal rural societies.        
	From its inception, the National Tiger Conservation Authoritys Project Tiger has been pivoted on two fundamental facts of the tigers biology  its need for large tracts of land and adequate prey therein. But even after 35 years, this science-based approach has still not been used effectively enough. Until the discovery of the tigers disappearance from Sariska that led to the first-ever nationwide sampling-based survey of tiger population, few had reckoned the tigers status to be so precarious. The mood thereafter has been that a crisis of calamitous proportions has befallen the tiger.         
	An overblown sense of crisis often tends to obscure our understanding of some of the chronic problems of tiger conservation. Foremost among these is the increasing human footprints on tiger habitats. Across the country, there are at least ten times more forest-dependent people residing on the fringes of tiger habitats than within them. The well-intentioned but sweeping recommendation of ecologists and conservationists to persuade resident communities to relocate dominates the tiger conservation agenda. But barely a thought is given to the management of the besieged fringes of our tiger reserves. This is not to reject voluntary resettlement as a possible means of enabling both tiger conservation and human betterment. But this is to inquire whether the scarce resources available for tiger conservation are better deployed, say, by securing a reserves fringes against serious pressures than by evicting a set of potential allies residing within. Only a strong and equal collaboration between the ecological and social sciences can help us answer these crucial questions.        
	Conservation, be it of tigers or any other species, unfolds at the interface of ecology and society. For conservation to be effective, policy must draw from both domains. This is not happening. While ecological science is being used to help tiger conservation through the identification of priority tiger habitats and by monitoring the tigers status in these areas, there remains a disturbing absence of science in understanding the social issues that underlie tiger conservation. In the past, these lacunae have created polarities such as those between the tiger and the tribal, which have not helped either. For tiger conservation to be effective, this attitude has to change.

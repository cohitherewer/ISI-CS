	 Faced with the ongoing meltdown, the best economic brains in the country are finding it tough to give hope to the nation. But words of solace have come from another quarter, though not from a mathematical wizard. Someone even more dependable  a spiritual guru schooled in the ways of modern times  has come to the rescue. If you are still wondering who this could be, think no more. The inimitable Swami Ramdev, who connects with the masses not just by the mystical power of yoga but also through an efficient media team, recently held a camp for chartered accountants. By all accounts, the event, organized by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, was a grand success. Given the current stress levels even among the veterans in the profession, it was hardly surprising that the four-day meet was heavily attended. From the smallest branches to the central and the regional councils, more than 800 members of ICAI flocked to Haridwar to destress and imbibe the mantra of yogic life and leadership. What with the market slump and, more importantly, the inglorious coming out of one Ramalinga Raju, such noble thoughts would definitely give a much-needed boost to the financial community. What better potion than a heady spiritual tonic to fight these deadly post-Satyam blues?                
	 While the rest of India is all aflush with the excitement of the general elections, the prime minister is set to leave for the far shores. Rarely in India does one hear of a PM going abroad while the Election Commissions code of conduct is in place. But Manmohan Singh is flying to London soon for the G-20 summit, his first trip abroad since his surgery last January. Whats more, he will have his first rendezvous with none other than Barack Obama. Reason enough for journos to kill for a place on the special plane. Pity, the PM will be flying forlorn of any media entourage, thanks to the ECs orders.                
	 Staying with foreign tours: while the PM is off to London, the president will not be far behind. After refusing to be a rubber stamp in the awarding of honorary degrees, the formidable Pratibha Patil is gearing up to visit Poland and Spain, that too in April, when the country will be stewing in the heat of the polls. There is nothing unseemly about any of this. But puritans feel that Patil should have waited for a new regime to take over, however much her aides insist that the hosts were in a tearing hurry.                
	 Speaking of poor timing, heres an example. Just as Ajay Pratap Singh, son of the late VP Singh, was making a foray into big politics, a fallout in the family has left him in the thick of petty politics. After merging his own Jan Morcha party with Ram Vilas Paswans Lok Jan Shakti Party, Ajay finally managed a berth from Fatehpur. But his own clan seems to be trickier than his ambitions. Since the patriarchs demise, the family has been enmeshed in a broil over property. The time is ripe for some other party to lure Abhay into its fold. But nothing seems to be in the offing so far.                 
	 Mysterious are the ways of politics. But more mystifying are the ways of politicians. Recently, former railways minister and dissident Congress leader, CK Jaffer Sharief, was seen lunching with the RSS spokesperson, Ram Madhav. The sight raised quite a few eyebrows, and not just because of Shariefs reputation for belligerence. Ever since Sonia Gandhis ascendance to political eminence, Sharief has become notorious for throwing tantrums. Each time he threatened to revolt, he was promised some sops, which were, of course, never fulfilled. The cold war with Madam led to private conferences with behenji. But breaking bread with an RSS man has now cast aspersions on Shariefs secular credentials. Is this a new conspiracy against the Congress or a peacemaking with the enemy? After all, Shariefs grandson, contesting from Karnataka, is quite likely to face a bout of negative campaigning from the RSS.                
	 While the Congress and the Left are keen on womens participation in politics, the BJP is focused on another kind of inclusiveness. If Arun Jaitley gave an assembly ticket to his secretary, Om Prakash Sharma, LK Advanis special favours have fallen on his personal aide, Deepak Chopra, who has been inducted into a policy-making committee to manage the polls for the party. Little wonder that the loyalists are the most empowered in Indian politics.

	 Prakash Jha not only has an eye for the perfect frame but also as good a nose for controversies. After completing the first leg of shooting for his much-hyped film, Rajniti, Jha has finally departed from Bhopal for Bettiah, from where he his contesting the Lok Sabha polls. But not before leaving a trail of discontent. Junior artists from Madhya Pradesh, who were on the crew of Rajniti, have come up with bitter complaints against him. These 5,000 odd men and women claim to have been paid meagre wages and treated badly by Jha. This is surprising, coming from a director in the habit of making films with a social conscience. And especially worse for someone with political aspirations. When Jha fought the last general elections as an independent, he was sent back to Bollywood with a thumping defeat. This time, with a film like Rajniti, where Katrina Kaifs role is said to be modelled on Sonia Gandhi, Jha stood a better chance of being taken up by some party. But after this fiasco, he may have to walk it alone again.

                                                                            Wednesday , November 18 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                              CUPPED HANDS                                                    
	It is a small red cup, and it tends not to run over. The United Nations World Food Programme often uses such a cup to provide food for the worlds starving. It has now chosen this object as the symbol for the acute shortage not only in the UNs coffers but also in food for the worlds poor. For the first time in history, the number of hungry people in the world will be more than a billion this year, and the UN is running out of money for dealing with this crisis. So the WFP has launched its A Billion for a Billion campaign, appealing to individuals and the private sector who have access to the internet, money in the bank and cards to donate it with to gift whatever they can afford by clicking on the red cup on its web-page. The appeal, this time, is not to governments, but to the global citizen, who can pay in euros or dollars, although the country options are unlimited. The funds shortage is because of the economic and the food crises hitting the globe together. This, then, is the dark side of globalization, making the global citizen an important agent  the giver independent of government, freeing the gift from the geopolitical web into the World Wide Web.        
	Giving, like taking, is an ambiguous activity, economically and ethically. It is impossible for gifts to be truly disinterested, for they bind individuals, communities, nations and economies in dubious networks of stated and unstated obligation. So the private, but global, giver is a way of redistributing resources in an emergency without getting into fiscal or political tangles, without forgetting the short-term nature of such a solution, and without absolving privileged governments of their responsibilities. And with Internet and the global media, it has also become impossible for the well-fed to look away and pretend not to know about hunger. India tops the hunger chart, with 230 million people being undernourished, but it is also a big player now in the globalized scenario. Will netizen Indians with their own bits of plastic see themselves as part of the community of global givers in the Billion for a Billion programme? Or will they conveniently choose to see themselves as part of the developing world instead, as they have with climate change, and prefer to be with those who are at the receiving end of the campaign? The peculiar contradictions in Indias self-image as a developing, yet globalizing, nation might play themselves out yet again when faced with the little red cup in cyberspace.

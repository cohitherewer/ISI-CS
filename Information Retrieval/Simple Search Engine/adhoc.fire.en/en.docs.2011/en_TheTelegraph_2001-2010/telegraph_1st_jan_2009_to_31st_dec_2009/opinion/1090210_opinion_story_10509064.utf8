The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | state of pardon
                                                                                                                 STATE OF PARDON                                                    
	Irrespective of his previous status, Abdul Qadeer Khan, the father of Pakistans nuclear bomb, is now a State actor. The Islamabad high court has declared him a free citizen and the Pakistan government will ensure that he remains trouble-free. Mr Khan, by his own confession on television in 2004 (which he later retracted), was a kingpin in a nuclear proliferation racket that spread to Libya, Iran and North Korea. The Pervez Musharraf government had immediately denounced him and distanced itself from his crime. But the next day, it granted him pardon and, in what seems now a standard practice in Pakistan, placed him under house arrest. Pakistan continues to feign ignorance of Mr Khans motives behind participating in the international nuclear bazaar. But it seems to have regained sufficient composure to claim that it has dismantled Mr Khans network. The Pakistan foreign minister, Shah Mehmood Qureshi, has vouched to the world that Mr Khan is no longer in a position to exert any pressure on the nuclear policy of the State. Pakistan has established unqualified control over him through an agreement prior to his release. The details of the agreement, however, remain as clouded as the secrets of Mr Khans dealings in the nuclear blackmarket.         
	The sudden turn of events, and the secrecy in which they are enveloped, do not inspire much confidence in nations inhabiting Pakistans neighbourhood and even those beyond. The United States of America, as also the United Kingdom, have registered righteous protest, but they seem satisfied with Pakistans claims of being able to manage the ramifications, if any, of Mr Khans liberation. So far, the US has not pressed Pakistan to allow the international community access to Mr Khan in order to unearth his clandestine network, in spite of proceeding against individuals and companies involved in his deals. Pakistan senses the USs constraints and has no qualms about raising the latters hackles just a little to avenge the let-down on Kashmir on the eve of the visit of its special representative on Afghanistan and Pakistan, Richard Holbrooke. The US is paranoid about Pakistans nuclear secrets spilling out to those manning its tribal hinterland, and its fears may not be unjustified. Pakistan is bound to reassure Mr Holbrooke on these matters  only the pious words may come with a price-tag attached to them.

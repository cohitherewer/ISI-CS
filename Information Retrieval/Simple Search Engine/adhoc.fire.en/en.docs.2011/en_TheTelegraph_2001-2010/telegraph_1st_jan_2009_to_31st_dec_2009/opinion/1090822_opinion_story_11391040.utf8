The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Fallen women, control freaks and hunted artists 
                                                                                                                 FALLEN WOMEN, CONTROL FREAKS AND HUNTED ARTISTS                                   Theatre - Ananda Lal                                                  
	As more Bengali troupes distance themselves from the policies and practices of the Left Front, they let their productions voice their critiques, taking their inspiration from such wide-ranging sources as the Mahabharata and Harold Pinter. Ostensibly, the title of Sundarams Ja Nei Bharate echoes the maxim that what the Mahabharata does not contain just does not exist, and suggests its applicability to India today; it could even counter-imply that the play is about what India lacks. Although we could read it in terms of the state of the nation, writer-director Manoj Mitra sounds more passionately engaged in our own states politics.        
	So, besides the expected epic characters, he creates a choric chamberlain [Kanchuki, by far the best actor in the cast, Mitra himself (right), in picture] who comments wryly on royal machinations, and a literally fallen woman (Patakini, an overdone performance by Mayuri Ghosh) who warns that the downtrodden and the forest-dwellers will wreak revenge on those in power for ignoring their needs. The parallel with recent city-village relations in Bengal is obvious.        
	As for Vyasas story, Mitras most interesting variation is his interpretation of Dhritarashtra as a gentle lover of nature (portrayed sympathetically by Subrata Chaudhury), pushed unwillingly into conflict with an obsessively ambitious Pandu. Kanchuki also jibes at control freaks like Bhishma, who just cannot retire. But the rest of the dynasty (Mitra stops short of the Kaurava-Pandava cousins) present no new perspectives, and strut and fret on stage like escapees from melodrama. The worst offender, Ishita Mukhopadhyay, turns Ambika into a soap-opera queen.        
	Meanwhile Ajitesh Bandopadhyays group, Nandimukh, revives his last production before his death in 1983, Tettrish-tama Janmadibas. Normally, an inveterately free Indianizer of modern Western drama, Bandopadhyay followed the original much more scrupulously in this adaptation of Pinters The Birthday Party, translated by Pabitra Sarkar. After Pinters Nobel Prize speech, it is easy enough to label this 20th-century classic as an anti-American diatribe, but it seems more immediate in our context as the depiction of a political party hunting down a former member and forcing him to conform, or as an artists loss of creative freedom under party orders. Ironically, the socialist authors best-known work boomerangs here on leftist strong-arm tactics.        
	Ashok Chattopadhyay re-directs capably, though his own performance as Gagan (Goldberg) needs more rehearsing. Suddhendu Chakrabarti makes a suitably sullen Samu (Stanley), while Arup Bose and Sonali Chattopadhyay act his working-class foster parents naturalistically. The weakest scene is the party, which receives polite bourgeois treatment, instead of the disruptive drinking and lecherous behaviour that threaten the four local inhabitants and disturb us.

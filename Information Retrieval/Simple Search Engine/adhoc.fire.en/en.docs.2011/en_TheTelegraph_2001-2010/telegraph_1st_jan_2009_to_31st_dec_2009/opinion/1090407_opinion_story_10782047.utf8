The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | more damage
                                                                                                                 MORE DAMAGE                                                    
	A combination of ignorance and callousness is not the most commendable attribute of a government. The Left Front government in West Bengal has steadily refused to clear the streets of Calcutta of pollution. Detailed studies and repeated warnings have not changed its attitude; apart from pious promises and short-lived campaigns entailing funds that vanish almost as soon as they are allocated, it has nothing to show. Even the recent promise to take illegal autorickshaws off the roads is yet to be fulfilled. It is perfectly possible that leaders in West Bengal were ignorant of the fact that pollution poses dangers to health  they are not famed for making intellectual connections of this kind. But for the last 10 years, they have no excuse for such simplicity; just too many people have been pointing out what the Calcutta streets are doing to the health of the residents. Everyone is at risk of damage to throat, lungs, and heart, allergies are increasing, and children and old people are especially vulnerable. But leaders have remained more concerned about the interests of the transport lobbies and unions which vote for them.         
	The most recent study, the fruit of an Indo-American collaboration, adds to the list of damages. The worsening pollution levels in the city have led to an unusually rapid decline in male fertility over the last few years. One of the causes of male infertility is environmental, and the effects of the gases and poisons floating in Calcuttas air on mens reproductive health were already evident in 2007. At the time, 45 to 48 per cent of cases of reproductive failure in the city were being attributed to male infertility. The last 10 years have shown that the fertility of the urban male is declining all over the world, owing to his lifestyle, clothing, addictions, increased levels of stress and environmental pollution. But even two years ago, Calcutta showed a higher level of urban male infertility than the world average. The latest study has isolated one main cause, and it is perhaps the banality of it that is most shocking. This at least was eminently avoidable. The state government has not distinguished itself in the arena of health. One look at a government hospital would confirm that, let alone the lack of access to health among the rural poor. But cleaning up the citys streets was not a complicated process. It is just that the government is indifferent to the basic rights of its voters: their health is not the states worry.

	The decision of the Peoples Conference leader, Sajjad Lone, to contest the general elections is not exactly a precursor to a revolution in Kashmir. Separatists, even those within Mr Lones party, have joined the poll fray before, as in 2002. But Mr Lones transition from a mass leader during the Amarnath agitation, spewing anti-India rhetoric, to his sudden pliancy in swearing by the Indian Constitution (with a heavy heart though), does reflect the power of the popular will. By defying the separatists call for a poll boycott in the 2008 assembly elections, the people of the state have shown that they were no longer willing to plough the lonely furrow the separatists want them to. They wanted their bijli, sadak and paani, and were willing to negotiate over their azaadi. The last, of course, was not part of the separatist strategy, although, as Mr Lone never tires of pointing out, the separation of the demand for basic necessities from the demand of azaadi was the brainchild of separatists. By entering the democratic process, Mr Lone now wants to assure his people of their basic necessities and take azaadi to the larger platform that the Indian parliament will grant him. By doing so, he has not only responded to the needs of his electorate but also to his own need of remaining politically viable in Kashmir. Despite his proactive role during the Amarnath controversy, Mr Lone has found himself overlooked by the Hurriyat leaders, both the hardliners represented by Syed Ali Shah Geelani and the moderates like Mirwaiz Umar Farooq. His exclusion from the Hurriyat coordination committee after the Amarnath controversy had dealt a blow to his political aspirations. Mr Lone has made it plain that his entry into the electoral process is also a test of his acceptance and political relevance among the people of north Kashmir, a support base that he shares with his two siblings besides other mass leaders.        
	There is no doubt that Mr Lones entry contains within it the seeds of change. He could serve as an inspiring example to other separatists and thereby set in motion an irreversible political trend. But there are also fears that Mr Lone could turn a personal failure into a more vehement commentary on the inefficacy of the Indian democracy. An armed struggle for azaadi may not be a popular choice any more, but a steady infiltration across the border indicates that the choice persists.

	State of unrest          
	Beyond control?          
	Sir  The daring hold-up of the Bhubaneswar-Delhi Rajdhani Express by Maoist sympathizers has proved that the Maoists and their supporters can strike at any target at any time and in any place (Bandh beast bites its guardians, Oct 28). This does not speak well of the efficiency of the state and the Central governments in containing the Maoist menace.          
	It is clear that the situation is now beyond the control of the state governments, and there are practical difficulties in the way of ensuring proper coordination between the states and the Centre. The latter is essential for effective action. Therefore, the Centre should consider ways to take control of the disturbed districts in order to flush out the Maoists, and to bring their supporters among the poor back to the mainstream.          
	Yours faithfully,      
J.N. Mahanty, Puri

                
	Sir  The hijacking of the Bhubaneswar Rajdhani Express by villagers, who were possibly Maoist sympathizers, causes concern. Such acts of disruption cannot happen without some kind of popular support from a section of the poor. The government should not view this problem as a law-and-order issue only. While the methods employed by Maoists and Naxalites are wrong, many seem to think that their revolt against corrupt politicians and government officials was inevitable. It was just waiting to happen.          
	The insecurity and harassment faced by common men in rural areas and small towns at the hands of local politicians and rowdies have to be seen to be believed. Whether one would like to admit it or not, the fact is that the distinction between politicians and law-breakers is becoming thin.          
	The Maoist problem cannot be solved by the government without fighting the corrupt elements within its structure.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir It is unfortunate that the Bhubaneshwar Rajdhani Express was stopped by Maoist supporters resulting in a seven-hour-long ordeal for the passengers and drivers on board. There was nothing surprising about the incident though, as the stoppage of trains is part of the bandh culture common in India. Taking a leaf out of the book of the political parties within the mainstream that call bandhs at the slightest pretext  a practice which is supposedly a democratic form of protest and a sure way of attracting the attention of the concerned authority  the protesters staged their drama by seizing the Rajdhani Express at Banstala.          
	One appreciates the bold step taken by the chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, of not relenting to the agitators demand that Chhatradhar Mahato, the chief of the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities, be released. At the same time, it is surprising that the chief secretary of the state, Asok Mohan Chakrabarti, the home secretary, Ardhendu Sen, and the director-general of police, Bhupinder Singh, did not rush to the spot in spite of being present at Midnapore at that time. They could have made an attempt to know the ground reality at first hand, and to engage the agitators in dialogue. Perhaps they were afraid of being kidnapped as Atindranath Dutta, the officer-in-charge of Sankrail police station, was. State officials should realize how the inhospitable, and now Maoist-infested, areas, where development is a distant dream, have suffered in the last 32 years under the Left rule.          
	In the meantime, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the Trinamul Congress have embroiled themselves in a blame game accusing one another of indulging the Maoists. This is to make a mockery of the incident which can only embolden the Maoist activists. As domestic insurgence seems to be becoming a national phenomenon, all political parties, irrespective of their ideologies, should come together and find a way to arrest the Maoist menace.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The episode of the Bhubaneswar Rajdhani Express being taken hostage shows the precarious political condition in West Bengal. There is reason to believe that the Maoist movement reflects the sentiments of a larger section of the people, and to that extent it is an expression of the peoples rejection of both the state government and the Opposition. Had this not been the case, the Maoists, with their faulty ideology, could not have mobilized a large crowd of villagers in their war against the State.          
	The present crisis is due, in large measure, to the Left rule of over three decades. The poor have lost their faith in the government. The role of the Opposition, too, has been more disruptive than constructive.The politics of vote-bank leads to political bankruptcy. The Maoists are taking advantage of this fact by discomfiting both the ruling and the Opposition parties.                    
	Yours faithfully,

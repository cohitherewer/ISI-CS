	On the right track                  
	Sir  The Indian Railways is the lifeline of the masses and an important part of the economy. The outstanding policies proposed by Mamata Banerjee in the railway budget for 2009-10 speak much about the vision of the United Progressive Alliance government (Maa, Mati, Manush and Metro, July 4). Her triple M agenda has successfully touched the hearts of the passengers and has boosted the industrial sector. It has also adequately represented the underprivileged class. Some of the unique policies introduced in this budget are the opening up of railway lands for industrial activities and encouraging public-private partnerships in several projects. Such steps have the potential to uplift the economy during the ongoing recession. Banerjees initiatives for her state have also strengthened the support base of the Trinamul Congress in West Bengal. They have raised doubts about the chances of the Left Front government staying in power in the future.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Ayon Sarkar, Jamshedpur 

                
	Sir  The railway budget by Mamata Banerjee establishes the fact that the Indian Railways is interested not just in reaping profits. The budget also acknowledges the social commitment of the Indian Railways. It addresses the needs of women, students, vendors, journalists and ordinary travellers with the concessions on tickets. The number of trains has been increased and non-stop trains introduced, keeping in mind the travellers comfort. Banerjee has also tried to make the Indian Railways a hub of job opportunities.          
	What is most striking about the budget is that through it, Banerjee seeks to set an example for the leftists in her state. She has proposed a power plant in Purulia that will require land when it comes up. Banerjee has thus addressed the issue of land acquisition in her budget. The Purulia project may also help prove that Banerjees Singur-Nandigram movement was not anti-development as alleged. After this budget, Banerjee will be seen as a visionary who discovered hitherto unexplored regions of the economy that have huge potential for growth.          
	Yours faithfully,        Subrata Pal, Karimpur, Nadia              
	Sir At last, due attention has been paid to the needs of the people of West Bengal in the railway budget after many years of negligence. Taking over the wagon manufacturing units of Burn Standard and Braithwaite will help solve the unemployment problem in the state. The concessions for students and women will help the daily commuters. Efforts for establishing a coach factory at Kanchrapara may also rejuvenate the present railway establishment there. But the railway minister will have to be vigilant. In the present scenario, she may not get much assistance from the state government, which might try to hinder her efforts.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Ranjit Sinha, Deolali, Maharashtra              
	Sir  It is clear that the railway budget is aimed at the assembly polls of 2011. One wonders if the projects proposed in this budget will be launched at all before 2011. After 2011, Mamata Banerjee may resign as the railway minister to take over West Bengal from the leftists. The person replacing her may shelve the projects meant for this state. Banerjee seems to be playing with the voters. Giving concessions to the students of madrasas can be seen as a ploy to capture the Muslim vote bank. Whatever Banerjees motives might have been in putting forward her populist budget, one hopes that she will at least ensure that the trains run on time and the quality of the food improves. If Banerjee cannot fufil even these two promises, she will lose all the applause she received after the budget.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Benu Kumar Bose, Calcutta

                
	Sir  In presenting her railway budget, Mamata Bannerjee has acted more as a minister of West Bengal than that of India. She has introduced a large number of schemes for her home state with an eye on the elections. In the process, she has neglected all the other states. The condition of the railway tracks is pathetic. A large number of accidents happen every day as a result. But the railway minister has paid no attention to this grave problem.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Ambar Mallick, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The railway budget for 2009-10 appears keen on expenditure but overlooks revenue generation. In terms of the amenities promised, it has fared well. Students stand to benefit a lot from the heavy concessions. Extra trains will ease congestion on the tracks. The super-fast trains will make it possible for passengers to travel swiftly. But safety needs to be given due importance when introducing faster trains. The stretches of the tracks that are in poor condition need to be replaced before the super-fast trains start running.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Ashok Jayaram, Bangalore

                
	Sir  Mamata Banerjees plan to establish medical colleges for railway employees is objectionable. She should not use public funds solely for the benefit of railway employees.           
	Yours faithfully,        R. Baskaran, Bokaro, Jharkhand              
	Sir  Many states feel that the railway budget is pro-West Bengal. A balanced approach is required in budgets to bring about the development of every Indian state. The railway budget talks about the safety of the passengers, but this cannot be guaranteed unless unauthorized travel is checked and people are stopped from sitting on the roofs of moving trains.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Mahesh Kapasi, New Delhi

                
	Sir  There are many aam admi-friendly features in the railway budget. One that deserves special mention is the provision of free medical service in long distance trains. This will help the patients who have to travel by trains to distant hospitals.           
	Yours faithfully,      
S. Chidambaresa Iyer, Mumbai

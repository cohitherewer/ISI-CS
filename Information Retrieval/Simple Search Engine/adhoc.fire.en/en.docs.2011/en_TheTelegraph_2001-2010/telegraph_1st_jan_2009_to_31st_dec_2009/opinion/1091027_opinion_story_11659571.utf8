	A classmate of mine in college was a girl from Gangtok. For a large part of the six years she lived in Calcutta as a student, she found the city dusty, noisy and difficult to cope with. As soon as the vacations began, she would make her way back home, and not even invitations from friends to spend the Pujas with them would keep her back. Getting back to the comfort of her home was perhaps one of the things she looked forward to, in addition to wanting to see her family again. For someone as rooted in her place and tradition as she was, it was difficult to imagine that she would want to stay away from her people.        
	After the completion of our course and the final examinations, she went back home to figure out what to do now with life. At that point, she did not much like living at home. Having stayed away from a family set-up for six years, she found it tedious to stay in a space defined by the unspoken norms of an established family unit.        
	She is one of the most disciplined persons Ive known, fully aware of her responsibilities and what she calls her limits. From the way she conducted herself, it was clear that she laid down a strict set of rules for herself. But perhaps going back home and having restrictions imposed upon her by others was what she may have resented.        
	During the four months that I have lived alone I have felt it quite liberating to be able to live by my own terms. But what I felt liberated from I cannot quite answer because, strangely enough, my own terms have often been more rigid than the ones set by those with whom I lived earlier. I am now more careful about what I eat, for I do not want to fall sick, careful about how I spend, and I hardly ever stay out at night later than the limit allowed by my family. More than the fear of getting into trouble, I am afraid of being told, in case of any untoward incident, that the mishap took place because I chose to move away from my family, which would otherwise have shielded me.         
	I have often found it difficult to explain to people why exactly I moved out of home. Hardly ever do I find myself saying, I moved out because I wanted to. Living alone invariably gets identified with going against an established family set-up, with a desire to do things that one wouldnt have been able to do living within a family. This may not always be the case, but living away from the family just for the sake of wanting to live alone is often felt to be something of an indulgence  even in my own mind.

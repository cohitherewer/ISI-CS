	THE ANGELS GAME By Carlos Ruiz Zafn, 
  Weidenfeld amp; Nicolson, Rs 495        
	David Martin, the hero of Carlos Ruiz Zafns The Angels Game, begins the story of his enigmatic adventures with the sweet poison of vanity entering his blood, when, like all new writers, he realizes he will never forget the first time he received a few coins and a bit of praise for his first story. The dream of literature begins to take shape, and the writer imagines he will not only make a living, but also have his name printed on a miserable piece of paper that will outlive him. From then on, says David, the writer is doomed and his soul has a price.        
	That is a promising beginning for what looks at first like a Gothic take on Great Expectations, with an embittered Philip masquerading as David  as in Copperfield?  greedily lapping up success from the sexy crime melodramas he churns out. From his first mentor, the rich Vidal, friend-turned-foe-turned- friend-again, he graduates to the patronage of the elusive publisher, Andreas Corelli, thrown out of his home after a rift with his father. David hallucinates into a Faustian pact with him to write a novel that will impel the world to accept a new faith. Corelli, David guesses as he is drawn into the mysteries of the tower house he has bought, seems to have lived for ever, and destroyed Davids predecessor in the house, who had trod the same obscure path that David chooses. But Dickens lingers on, in Davids impossible love  although Cristina is more a despoiled Christabel  and in the loyal Isabella, a charming urban Biddy.        
	Great Expectations could have been the central text in this novel about writing novels; it is the symbol of Davids intense love of literature. But there is Jane Eyre too, and Dorian Gray, Bluebeards secret rooms and Poes walled-up corpses, and perhaps even an old, dead Ophelia under the water, and another  a touch of Woolfs Orlando?  under ice. It becomes quite a game, spotting whos next. The narrative talks to too many books as it becomes gradually weighed down with plots atomizing into countless subplots, and a growing number of gruesome corpses littering Davids trail.        
	It is fun at the beginning, with time to savour the sharp, witty distance Zafn maintains with his narrator, making his tale sound like the melodrama he produces. Some way on, that distance disappears, partly, it would seem, because the vivacious realness of Isabella does not harmonize with either the keen fun of Gothic melodrama or the sombre morality myth that unhappily takes its place.        
	At the centre of the myth, in which truth and fiction are interchangeable, are the temptations offered by the power of the word. Of that power, Zafn has plenty, conveyed through the easy-flowing translation of Lucia Graves. Local splendours abound as the dim alleys and dusty mansions of Barcelona between the wars shudder into menacing life. The City of the Damned, the title of Davids first success, is what he literally experiences in his pursuit of the mystery of his own life, although its solution ultimately hangs between the natural and supernatural planes.        
	Two edifices are central to this Bosch-like world, Davids tower house and the Cemetery of Forgotten Books. The latters tunnels and labyrinths could be the enigmatic terrain of human memory. He is taken there by Sempere, the owner of the bookshop, Sempere amp; Sons, and Davids unfailing friend. His grandson is the hero of The Shadow of the Wind, Zafns previous novel, in which both the cemetery and the bookshop figure. Even when Zafns ambitions in The Angels Game, like Philips in Great Expectations and Davids own, disperse in a final disappointment, it is not easy to ignore the unsettling resonance of a vivid confusion.                    BHASWATI CHAKRAVORTY

	 Union ministers, Jyotiraditya Scindia and Kamal Nath, sent Thank You notes to Lalu Prasad after he passed the railway budget. The reason? The two per cent fare slash announced for the aam admi perhaps? Not quite. The duo thanked Lalu Prasad for introducing trains between Chhindwara and Jhansi and between Gwalior and Bhopal via ShivpuriGuna. Congressmen, however, were sceptical about the move: why would someone from Gwalior go to Bhopal en route Guna by adding two long hours to the travel time, they wondered? But Nath and Scindia, who represent Chhindwara and Guna respectively, are convinced that the introduction of these routes will certainly help their cause in the coming elections. Leaders in the Bharatiya Janata Party think that the two Congress stalwarts will fare poorly in the polls. But the men seem assured that they will be able to hitch a ride on Lalu Prasads new trains back to power.                
	 The former chief minister of Punjab, Amarinder Singh, wants the Union minister, P Chidambaram, to declare his home territory as a sensitive state. But it isnt the return of the spectre of militancy, which had once ravaged the state, that is the cause of Amarinders concern. The former maharaja of Patiala is worried that the present state home minister, Sukhbir Singh Badal, is determined to send him to prison at any cost. Fearing arrest, Amarinder is not keen on visiting his home turf. Sukhbir, son of the chief minister, Parkash Singh Badal, had reportedly scribbled Amarinders name in a jail cell where the father-son duo was lodged earlier in a case related to disproportionate assets. Amarinder doesnt want to share his fate, which is why he is keeping himself away from this troubled state.                            
	 Staying with Punjab. All roads seem to be leading to the land of five rivers for the tourism and culture minister, Ambika Soni. Soni has been on an extensive tour of Punjab, giving rise to speculation that she is serious about contesting from the Anandpur Saheb seat. Sources close to Soni reveal that the minister is employing the MBA strategy during her frequent tours. M, B and A stand for marriage, bhog and ardas respectively, the three ceremonies that occupy pride of place in Punjabi social life. And we thought that only business school whizkids were full of bright ideas!                            
	 Scribes always look forward to the annual winter lunch hosted by S. Jaipal Reddy. The food is excellent  mouth-watering Hyderabadi and Andhra delicacies are served on the occasion  but what is even better are the inputs provided by the man himself. Reddy not only plays a gracious host but also livens up the proceedings with his insightful political analysis. So here is what Reddy had to say about the forthcoming general elections. The United Progressive Alliance, according to the Union urban development minister, will come back to power, winning anything between 247-257 seats. And thats not all. The Left, he said, would once again support the coalition. He however declined to comment on whether Manmohan Singh would head the government after the polls, and left the option open for his guests to guess. Reddys silence will give journalists something else to chew on.                            
	 Maneka Gandhi and her son may have crossed over to the rival fold, but Congressmen still take cues from Manekas late husband, Sanjay. For instance, Sanjay Gandhi seems to have been the inspiration behind the recent party conclave of block and district presidents that was held in Delhi. Congress old-timers fondly recalled that Sanjay had organized a similar meeting of block presidents of the Youth Congress way back in August 1976, to establish direct contact with workers at the grassroot level. This time, too, the event went according to a much worn-out script. Rahul Gandhi was the centre of attention of the delegates, most of whom came from the three districts that are considered to be Nehru-Gandhi strongholds: Amethi, Rae Bareli and Sultanpur. On one occasion, the audience burst out in applause even before Rahul had started speaking. The buzz in the Congress is that it was Rahul who had mooted the idea of the conclave. One wonders what Maneka has to say about Rahul borrowing ideas from Sanjays notebook.  
	FOOTNOTE      
	 Here is something more on Rahul Gandhi. All his hard work to bring in transparency and young blood to the Youth Congress seems to have come to a nought, thanks to its president, Ashok Tanwar. Rahul reportedly axed the president of the Bihar Youth Congress after it was discovered that he was overage. Tanwar, however, has allegedly appointed a number of office-bearers who have crossed the permissible age-limit, or are school drop-outs. For instance, Yashomati Thakur from Maharashtra and Virender Rathore from Haryana have been appointed general secretaries, but are said to be over 35 years old. Another gen-sec from Bihar and a school drop-out, one Naushad, has been nominated from the Delhi quota.Tanwars antics have not gone unnoticed. These days, Youth Congress members are heard singing, Dekho Ashok Tanwar ka khel, banai Youth Congress Aathvi fail ( Look at Ashok Tanwars feat, he has made the Youth Congress fail the eighth standard).

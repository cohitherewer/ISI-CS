The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | To unravel a complicated question
                                                                                                                 TO UNRAVEL A COMPLICATED QUESTION                                                                  
	TO LIVE OR TO PERISH FOREVER: TWO TUMULTUOUS YEARS IN PAKISTAN By Nicholas Schmidle, Random House, Rs 299        
	But whats the problem with that place? The question was put to Nicholas Schmidle on telephone by his grandfather, who, like so many of his fellow Americans, must have become aware of Pakistan s existence post-9/11. Schmidle was in Pakistan then on an Institute of Current World Affairs fellowship that required him to report and write on what he saw, and could have taken the question head-on. But he must have hung up soon. A long-distance telephone conversation wouldnt give him enough time to explain Pakistans complex realities. In fact, even after having written 261 pages in small print, Schmidle cannot be entirely sure if he has provided any answers to what is wrong with Pakistan .        
	The best way to go about this book, however, is to stop looking for answers and take in Schmidle as he comes  without any compulsion to provide a linear narrative and without the sombreness that usually marks all discussions on Pakistan and its killing fields. Schmidle even manages to give a face to each extremist in that swarm of bearded men in shalwar-kameez. The infamous Abdul Rashid Ghazi, who led the Red Mosque insurrection in 2007, is said to have looked like Jerry Garcia, and Maulana Fazlullah of Swat, who has never been photographed, is a short man with large gaps between his teeth and a goofy smile.        
	The reason why most of the chapters in this book  many of them self-sufficient articles  work so well is because Schmidle layers his narrative. The unexpected breaks  to recount meetings with tribal and political leaders, his experience of street clashes or tribal rituals, to recollect student politics or rehash history  give no chance for monotony to set in. The dramatic two years  2006-08  which included a regime change, in any case, wouldnt let that happen.        
	Liberal Pakistan versus the Taliban is only one of the many conflicts that the nation has survived. Pakistans current preoccupation, however, also overshadows other irreparable sectarian and ethnic divides that make it almost impossible for Pakistan to hold together as a nation  the Shia-Sunni conflict, the Pashtun-Mohajir or the Punjabi-Sindhi divide, or the recalcitrance of Baluchistan to cohere with the nation. Schmidle goes deep into each of these fissures to show how conflicting identities and histories have complicated Pakistans political journey since its birth. The more Pakistans State-building efforts have tried to smother identities, the more intractable each problem has become.        
	Take Baluchistan, which seems to be currently worrying India more than Pakistan. Its incorporation into Pakistan happened more by accident than by design. Over the decades, the Pakistan government has intensified the feeling of alienation by its neglect of the region, its ill-devised financial system and its ham-handed policy of dealing with insurgency. The same myopia has deepened other divides. In a society as polarized as Pakistans, Schmidle says that any political problem gets transformed into an ethnic one.        
	Schmidle also shows that these problems are never simple. For example, the Pashtun Awami National Party may have given up on its dream of an independent Pashtunistan, but its politics is grounded in the belief that Talibanization is a neocolonial attempt of the Punjabi elite (read the Pakistan army) to rule the Pashtun lands through religious proxy. And, yet, it did agree to a deal with the pro-Taliban Sufi Mohammad. Has the ANP given in to the Punjabi design then? In 2009, Schmidle himself might be groping for an answer to that question.        
	Schmidle invests a lot of time, energy and patience in unravelling the mystery behind the inexorable Talibanization of Pakistan. This takes him repeatedly to the smooth-talking Abdul Rashid Ghazi in the Red Mosque, deep into Waziristan, to the mountain abode of the Taliban in the North West Frontier Province, to witness their summary justice. To begin to do all this, Schmidle had to do a lot of homework. He started off by reading about the country, learning Urdu, and then donning the shalwar-kameez and travelling by public transport to far-off places or riding on local journalists bikes and hatchbacks to slums, madrasas and Taliban territory. Schmidle never forgets the dangers of being an American, although his hosts, sometimes the feared Taliban, often do. As Maulana Fazlullahs military commander, Sirajuddin, put it nonchalantly, You are our guest.        
	In his wanderings deep into Pakistan, Schmidle finds a tribal society in flux  centuries-old tradition of governance was being replaced by the violent sharia-rule of the Taliban, which, nevertheless, answered the peoples need for prompt justice and order. The brash, impatient, new entrants into the game of religious and political one-upmanship were pushing out the previous generation of conservative leaders like Maulana Fazlur Rehman of the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam. There was no time left for the democratic games that Rehman once played under the umbrella of the Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal.        
	One man in a real hurry to seize the moment was Abdul Rashid Ghazi, the imam of the Red Mosque and Schmidles friend, who gave him the key to enter the radical heartland. Schmidle suspects that Ghazi became a victim of the cult he had himself created but he cannot help blaming the Pakistan government/army for forcing Ghazis hand. Schmidles grief for Ghazi is genuine, and in grieving the death of a friend, he manages to give a human face to extremists like Ghazi and to his own tribe  the mediapersons scavenging on Pakistan s disorder to make a name and career.        
	Despite Schmidles interest in the Taliban, he does not explore Pakistans intelligence agencies links with them, although he constantly hints at them. After Daniel Pearl, that is probably now too dangerous a subject. Schmidles discretion, however, does not prevent him from being hounded by the intelligence agencies. He is forced to leave the country end of 2007, and again, more dramatically, after a hot chase in August 2008. Schmidles nail-biting account of the chase in 2008, broken only briefly by his visit to the annual urs for Lal Shahbaz Qalandar, helps the book transcend political commentary and become almost a thriller. But even without this epilogue, the book would have remained an enjoyable read.                          CHIROSREE BASU

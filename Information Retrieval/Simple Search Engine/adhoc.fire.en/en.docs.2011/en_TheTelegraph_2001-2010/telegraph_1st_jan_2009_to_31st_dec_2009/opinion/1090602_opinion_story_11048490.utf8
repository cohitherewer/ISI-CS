The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | another fall
                                                                                                                 ANOTHER FALL                                                    
	This is the time for records. Meira Kumar was sworn in as cabinet minister on May 22. She was allocated a portfolio on May 28. On May 31, she resigned as Union minister of water resources. This must be the shortest time that any individual has held any ministerial responsibility. The ostensible reason for her resignation was the fact that her name would be proposed as the Speaker of the 15th Lok Sabha. She would be the first lady to hold that august office. That is another record. It can safely be assumed that Manmohan Singhs second government has not been put in place to establish records. It should instil confidence in the people by conveying the impression that it knows its own mind and is in control of what it is doing or wants to do. Appointing someone a minister for two days does not exactly give the impression that there is a mind working behind the appointments that are being made. On the contrary, the general impression is that the governments left hand does not know what its right hand is doing. What the prime minister gave to Ms Kumar has been taken away from her by the Congresss decision to field her as a candidate for the post of Speaker of the Lok Sabha. This may have brought honour on Ms Kumar but it certainly has not done the same for the government and the prime minister.        
	The office of the Speaker of the Lok Sabha is perhaps the most crucial for the proper functioning of parliamentary democracy. By definition almost, the Speaker should be above politics and partisanship. The proposal to make Ms Kumar the Speaker is unfortunately not free of political calculations. It will not be unfair to Ms Kumar to suggest that her background has made her the first choice for the post of Speaker. She is from Bihar where the Congress is trying to make a comeback. She is also a Dalit. If the Congress has to regain its ground in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, it has to contend with Mayavati, who is not only the chief minister of UP but is also seen as the number one leader of the lower castes. The gesture of making a Dalit the Speaker of the Lok Sabha is aimed at winning the lower-caste vote in UP and Bihar. The office of the Speaker has thus fallen prey to petty electoral calculations  another non-partisan institution has come to be tainted by party politics. India will be proud to have a woman and a Dalit as a Speaker of the Lok Sabha, but the spirit of parliamentary democracy may not share that pride.

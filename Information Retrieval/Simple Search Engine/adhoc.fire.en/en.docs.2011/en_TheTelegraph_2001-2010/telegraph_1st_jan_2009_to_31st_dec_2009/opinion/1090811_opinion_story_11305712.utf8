The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Letters to Editor
                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Judge not                  
	Sir  I cannot agree with the views expressed by Dipankar Dasgupta in his article, A precious world mindlessly destroyed (July 30). As a student of Presidency, I do not want to sound too biased in favour of the college. But I must say that there is no basis to Dasguptas accusation that something is rotten about the manner in which [the college] has been running for several years now. How can such an academy of excellence, with its position of power and authority, be considered rotten?           
	Dasgupta says that the college makes the students undergo a metamorphosis of sorts, after which they begin to consider classroom lectures as pointless exercises. The students, according to Dasgupta, attach more importance to their tutorial homes than to classes at the college. But the preference of students for readymade notes is a problem that plagues not just Presidency but every academic institution in West Bengal. So why single out Presidency for censure? Similarly, the author cannot indict the college by saying that roll calls here are just a matter of formality when they are so in most colleges. Moreover, these are vague accusations, which have to be supported by data in order to be proved correct. Comments like Even if Nobel Laureates were to agree to deliver the 20 precious lectures a month, would the students have any incentive to attend them? are not only hurtful but also insulting to anybody who has been linked in any way with this institution.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  While speaking about Presidency College, Dipankar Dasgupta says that Except for a small number of highly motivated students..., the rest begin to consider classroom lectures to be pointless exercises. I am a second year post-graduate student of the English department of Presidency College. May I ask how many students have made this confession to the author? Has he verified the facts by looking up the registers of all the departments? I do not think he has. In that case, how reliable is this information? Dasgupta makes sweeping observations regarding the unwillingness of students to attend classes. Every student of Presidency will testify to the fact that there are only five to six students who do not attend lectures; the rest go to classes regularly and painstakingly take notes. I would request Dasgupta to go through the exercise books of the students and see for himself the voluminous amount of class notes taken down by most of them.          
	Dasgupta speaks of the degeneration of Presidency College. Can he prove it? I believe this a general statement made by taking certain things for granted. Is Dasgupta aware of the fact that the National Assessment and Accreditation Council awarded Presidency with an A+ grade? If Presidency had really degenerated then it could not have got such a high grade from the NAAC team. An assessment of the performance of Presidencys students would prove that the maximum number of first classes from the University of Calcutta is from this college. Most of the time, the toppers are also from Presidency. After passing out, the students get good placements, and those who wish to do doctorates get admitted to reputed institutes.          
	The authors allegation against the students penchant for private tuitions does not hold water. Private tuitions are in vogue in Calcutta. But students of Presidency can proudly say that private tuitions will get them nowhere. If private tuitions been able to improve a students standard then there would have been as many first classes from other colleges under CU as there are from Presidency. But Presidency continues to boast of the maximum number of first classes. Hence, the students must be getting something extra, which comes from the class lectures and the reference work done by the students.          
	The NAACs appraisal of Presidency, its students performance in examinations, and their bright career prospects prove the continuity of the glory of the college that the author feels is lost. The past is always glorious, and when the present will become past, it too will appear glorious. I am sure that even in the future, numerous brilliant students will continue to come out of Presidency.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  In relation to the alleged deterioration of Presidency College, Dipankar Dasgupta writes that the attitude towards higher education needs to be changed first. He should know that the process of bringing about this change has already started, and one of its outcomes is the introduction of an adjunct professor scheme in Presidency. Dasgupta expresses doubt about the process of selection of the committee members. He should be told that there is a thorough method to conduct it. We have to keep faith in the learned departmental heads of Presidency whose excellence is beyond challenge.           
	Dasgupta has related Presidencys loss of glory to the sub-standard quality of its teaching. If Presidency has fallen on bad days now, it is because of mismanagement and a change in the general value system. The quality of teaching has not changed. If it had been so then every student would not have dreamt of getting admission to this college. I think that if Nobel Laureates were to deliver 20 lectures a month at Presidency, then 38 out of 40 students in a class would attend it. When The Telegraph arranges talks or lectures, it becomes difficult to get seats. What does that prove?           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Not [being] a sworn critic of the Left Front government, Dipankar Dasgupta is unable to raise his finger against the people responsible for the degradation of Presidency College. He goes soft on the Left Front government, which has brought about the ruin of the state education system. Dasgupta is alarmed about government interference in the affairs of Presidency but nowhere in the article does he mention the malpractices perpetuated in the college by a particular political party.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Gautam Mridha, Calcutta

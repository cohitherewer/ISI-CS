The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | The king is in trouble
                                                                                                                 THE KING IS IN TROUBLE                                  Air India must learn to survive private competition without depending on government largesse, writes Abhijit Bhattacharyya                          The first Air India advertisement                                  
	Let us begin with the basics of civil aviation. It is an industry which is capital intensive, fuel intensive and labour intensive. It is a glamorous and high profile service industry, which makes little or no money but has never been short of production and sale of aircraft, the occasional downturn notwithstanding. In other words, it is the producers rather than the users of aircraft who have traditionally raked in the profits.        
	Even today, the manufacturers of Airbus and Boeing have not been in the red in spite of the reduction in and cancellation of orders due to recession. The major carriers of the world, however, are reeling under loss of market, money and traffic. Only a few have managed to keep their heads above the waterline.        
	Given the circumstances, one needs to take a fresh look at the crisis in Air India. To begin with, it must be remembered that any development in Air India is no longer a matter pertaining to one airline as it now includes Indian Airlines. Hence, losses or gains made by Air India are likely to impact the domestic and international domains of the national carrier.        
	In its composition and structure, Air India is owned, operated and managed by the ministry of civil aviation. Hence, Air Indias success or failure is the success and failure of the government of India as only serving bureaucrats have been allowed to run the carrier of late. From aircraft acquisition, operation, maintenance, charter, lease, route fixation to deciding on capacity and frequency, everything is now the governments responsibility. In other words, Air India is just like any other government department. It suffers from an image problem and an inherent crisis of confidence owing to its professional decisions being under constant scrutiny.              
	Despite the limitations and several defects within, Air India recently appears to have been shaken further by competition from private airlines, both domestic and foreign. A powerful lobby seems to be at work to open profitable routes by creating over-capacity and excess-frequency. Things started to become rather lucrative for private carriers as the Indian market opened up in the early 1990s.        
	The bilateral air agreements appear to have hit the Maharaja the most. The access given to foreign carriers of multiple domestic destinations has bled Air India. Undoubtedly, Air India has also been badly affected by airports, such as the one in Calcutta, being unable to visualize anything beyond Mumbai-Delhi centric operations. Perhaps the ministry of civil aviation should examine carefully the issues afflicting Indias national carrier. Air Indias needs must be looked into carefully as it is the property of the people and the government of India.         
	For example, if Air India were to demand that the sixth freedom rights of all foreign airlines be reviewed, the demand needs to be scrutinized with care. Why? Because, without matching reciprocal rights being given to Indias national carrier, it would be unfair to expect Air India to perform and make profit. But the question is, can this be done? While carriers of single airport countries like Singapore, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Ras al- Khaimah, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Malaysia, Hong Kong are allowed to operate on multiple domestic destinations in India, lopsided single-airport operations are being offered to the Maharaja. Is this ethical, or even moral? And who decides these bilateral agreements? Not Air India, but the government of India. Should not the government look after the interest of its own carrier? One would presume that every sovereign country does so.         
	In this context, one cannot help but admire the nationalist attitude and approach of communist China. China has liberalized its economy a long time back. Yet it has not given up on its national interests. Thus, when the United States of America or Europe stated that Beijings restrictions on export raw materials violate international trade rules, the media office of the Chinese ministry of commerce retorted in a statement that the main objective of Chinas relevant export policies is to protect the environment and natural resources and the policies in question are in keeping with WTO rules. Here, one must pay attention to the word, protect.        
	The word has a bearing on Air Indias case as well. Despite modern emphasis on globalization, liberalization and removal of trade barriers, protection has already come into effect in the US and Europe. A closer look into Barack Obamas policy would be a revelation. The US protects everything which it considers is worth protecting, whether it is trade, commerce, import-export, capital infusion, foreign investment or its soldiers in Afghanistan and its citizens in Pakistan.              
	There is no doubt about the fact that successive managements of Air India have not performed to their potential. Its complacency regarding its past monopoly on the aviation market led to the loss of a huge clientele. Air India was never known to have a pan-Indian vision while operating international flight. Air India thrived on the principle of money from Delhi and management from Mumbai, thereby giving rest of India a go by.        
	Air India cannot bank solely on government money any more. The Maharaja must learn the art of survival in a democratic environment where airlines promoted by private competitors are its main rival. There is a possibility that if the king fails to perform his duty, the subjects might take over the kingdom.         
	Air India needs to decentralize its operations to all four corners of the country. The operations need to be specific, with the logistics based in Delhi, Mumbai, Calcutta and Chennai. Let Delhi and Mumbai operate on the West and the Gulf areas, and Chennai and Calcutta take charge of Southeast Asia, the Far East and Australia. Moreover, there are some specific traffic patterns in the long-haul routes. Chennai has Frankfurt, the US, Singapore and Australia; Calcutta has Dhaka, Bangkok, Kathmandu, London, New York and Kunming. These routes must be consolidated and explored with care and calculation. Or else the Maharajas new fleet of 111 aircraft will find it extremely difficult to pay back its debts and change the balance sheet from red to black.

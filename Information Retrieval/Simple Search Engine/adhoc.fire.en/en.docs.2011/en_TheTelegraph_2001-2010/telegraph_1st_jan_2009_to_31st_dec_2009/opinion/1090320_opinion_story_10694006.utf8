                                                                                                                 UNIQUE CASE                                                    
	The imposition of presidents rule in Meghalaya will reopen some old constitutional issues. This was a rather unique case in which a state was placed under Central rule although the government there had won a confidence vote in the assembly. Usually, presidents rule is imposed in a state after the government fails to prove its majority in the legislature. To Meghalayas governor, R.S. Mooshahary, however, the way the government proved its majority during the vote of confidence was unconstitutional. He, therefore, recommended to New Delhi that the state be placed under presidents rule. This is not the first time that the governor of a state has found an assembly Speakers action unconstitutional. The decision of the Speaker of the Meghalaya assembly, Bindo Lanong, in disqualifying four members of the House was clearly questionable because a case on this was still pending in the Guwahati High Court. Clearly, the Speakers decision was prompted by his anxiety to save the ruling coalition during the trust vote.         
	However, the Congress should not be seen to be using presidents rule as a ploy to wrest power. That the assembly has been kept in suspended animation suggests that politicians will have their time and opportunity for switching party loyalties. A term in office gained through unfair means will rob a government of its moral right to rule. Worse still, it will suggest that the Congress has once again used Article 356 for partisan gains. Such sentiments end up lowering the politicians  and the peoples  confidence in the constitutional process. Mr Mooshahary, too, has an important role to play in upholding the Constitution in the interim period. He needs to be above suspicion and to be seen as such. Too many governors have abused their positions and acted as stooges of their political bosses. The people of Meghalaya have their right to be ruled by their elected representatives. The sooner they get back that right, the better it will be for constitutional governance.

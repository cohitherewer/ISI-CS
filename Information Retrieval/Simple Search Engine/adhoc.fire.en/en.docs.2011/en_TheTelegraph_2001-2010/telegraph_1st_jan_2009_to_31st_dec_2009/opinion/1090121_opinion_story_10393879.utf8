	The story ends (so far) with Barack Obama, but it begins in a Victorian schoolroom with something like this. Teacher: Why are you late? Little Johnny: Jack and me stayed out to play. Teacher: Well, dont do it again. And besides, thats bad grammar, you should have said Jack and I. Little Johnny, later: Mum, Miss Smith says I mustnt say Jack and me, its bad grammar. Mother: Well, Im sure she knows best, dear, always say Jack and I. So Johnny and his kin have ever since been saying things like teacher gave Jack and I a talking-to for being late, and for bad grammar too.         
	Which is, of course, bad grammar: Jack and I stayed out, fine, but teacher gave Jack and me, or to, by, with or from Jack and me  we all know thats wrong, dont we? Well, in educated West Bengal possibly, but not in swathes of British society nor, certainly since yesterday, in the White House. Mr Obama is eloquent, but, as a reader lamented in The Economist recently, he is also given to such grammatical lapses as to Michelle and I.         
	A lapse that indeed is. I, he/she, we and they as the subject of a verb, but me, him/her, us and them as the object, or after any preposition. You wouldnt say to I, so why say to Michelle and I? The only explanation I can think of is some such dialogue as Ive invented in my first paragraph, plus which, in Britain, is certainly no invention  the worthy effort (but in this case failure) of people who dont know correct English to sound as if they do. Between you and I is a very common example.        
	So far, so good, and so banal. And I agree entirely with the grammarians: to my ears, Mr Obama, like little Johnny, is simply wrong. But here comes the shock. He is wrong in distinguished company. In the mid-1990s, a British historian of language, John Honey, then teaching in Japan, made a study of this sort of error. And his list of notables who had used phrases such as to my wife and I, from he and his staff and for she who dares was notable indeed. It included sundry British royals, Margaret Thatcher and Bill Clinton. By now I suspect it would include George W. Bush.         
	Nor is the error a merely modern one. Among the notable users was Britains Queen Mary in 1689, who wrote in a prayer-book that it had been given to the King and I. Also Shakespeare and Ben Jonson. I cant give Professor Honeys citations from either of those dramatists, since I dont have his paper in my files. But I doubt he would have cited the two if these were just phrases that they had put in the mouths of peasants.         
	So is the error not an error at all? Most authorities insist that it is. Eric Partridge, author of a noted guide to English, Usage and Abusage, was half-ready to condone between you and I, noting that the phrase can be seen as a unit, and one whose start is, after all, correct. Indefensible grammatically, he said, but often used by those who would never dream of saying between he and I.        
	Honey went further, lumping all such phrases together as a wide, much-used family, little as he liked it. That raises the old question: if enough people use it, is it English after all? In this case, there are solid reasons for saying no. But lets not worry Mr Obama. To Michelle and he, the best of grammatical luck  and if the only errors of his presidency are errors of grammar, the rest of we can count ourselves lucky too.

	The West is a pest                  
	Sir  In The West for the masses (Feb 9), Sunanda K. Datta Ray is right in asserting that Westernization in India has brought in flies and other pests together with the fresh air in the form of radical changes in thought and education. The former, however, far outweigh the benefits of the latter. This is because young people today have got addicted to English films and their vulgar imitation by Bollywood. They easily forget the values of life and have no morals. Their material demands have reached the sky, but they have no tenacity for the hard work that is necessary to achieve prosperity. They want instant success, by hook or by crook. Today, more and more of them are neglecting education and adopting film stars as their role models. They want to be as successful as them, but they forget that these people are hardcore businessmen. Perhaps they should have someone like Indra Nooyi as their role model. They would then appreciate the virtues of hard work.           
	Meanwhile, the vulgarity that Westernization promotes has become a boon for businessmen. Perhaps mass consumerism could be appreciated if it enlightened its consumers. But it is alienating a large number of young people from society, leading to frustration, failure and increasing number of suicides among the young. This is what should be emphasized about Westernization, not its being alien to Indian culture.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Abhirup Sen, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Sunanda K. Datta-Ray brilliantly portrays the subtle changes that have taken place in Indian society with the advent of Western culture, especially among the boys and girls of the younger generation. Their value system is different and so are their priorities. Today, premarital sex, single motherhood and living-in are common. The moral policing of the Shiv Sena, Sri Ram Sena and other Hindutva groups will be of no use unless parents inculcate the right values in their children.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Death warrant          
	Sir  The killing of 15 policemen in Gadchiroli by Maoists in an ambush shows, once again, chinks in the armour of the Maharashtra police force (15 cops die in Maoist battle, Feb 2). Already, hundreds of policemen have lost their lives fighting the mercenaries who operate from the eastern districts of Maharashtra. Postings to these districts are viewed with fear and helplessness among the police. Measures initiated by the government have not been adequate to reassure the police and instil confidence in them. The state government has to demonstrate a firm resolve to fight the Maoist menace. The states request to the Centre for funds to finance its Rs 1,350-crore plan for the six Naxalite-infested districts of Vidarbha needs to be considered sympathetically by the the Centre.           
	The state government has to explore possibilities of beefing up security in the region through increased cooperation with neighbouring states like Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. There must be more sharing of intelligence and security interaction. The locals could be roped in to gather information on the movement of the Maoists. The lack of this was highlighted by the February 1 ambush. The police have to stop harassing the tribals and arresting them at the drop of a hat. This allows the Maoists to accuse the police of terror and to prevail upon locals to stop sharing information with the police. The police can be offered incentives like hard-station allowances and soft postings after serving a specific tenure in these strife-torn areas. Postings to these areas must not be vindictive in nature, that is, punishment-postings.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Bichu Muttathara, Pune

                
	Sir  The Maoists have again shown their cruelty in Maharashtra. The incident confirms that Naxalism is the greatest hazard to the internal security of the country. In the same way, another Maoist group is believed to have assaulted locals in Halli Bidiragodu village in Koppa in Karnataka for their non-cooperation. It is obvious that the Maoists can no longer claim absolute sympathy from the people. A solid intelligence network is required to take on the Maoist challenge. As yet, the state governments have been unable to set up such a network. Owing to the lack of modern weapons, the police are struggling to fight the Maoists. The lack of adequate funds is another problem that has stymied the police force. Modernization of the police, state-of-the-art weapons and communication are necessary if the government is serious about eradicating the threat.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot           
	Sir  The Swedish tourist who inadvertently put a sticker carrying a verse from the Quran on his ski has been severely reprimanded for his behaviour in Gulmarg (Verse on ski angers, Feb 8).           
	No one has the right to hurt the religious sentiments of another community. Muslims consider certain images and verses sacred, and so do Hindus. However, what struck me about the reports on the incident is that none of the them condemned the agitation. And yet, the media do not hesitate to condemn the agitations carried out by what they term Hindu fundamentalists. The Swedish tourist might have inadvertently stuck a sticker. Can the same thing be said about M.F. Husain?                     
	Yours faithfully,       
S.B. Gupta, Calcutta

	Q: My father was murdered in 1980. My mother, the only eyewitness to the case, had lodged the first information report (FIR). Though an arrest warrant was issued against the accused, he has been absconding all these years. But now we have finally traced the accused. We informed the concerned superintendent of police and officer in charge of the police station about this in May, 2009. But they cannot locate the file containing the FIR, the chargesheet, the copy of warrant, etc, in the court office. Details such as the case number, the name and address of the accused are registered in the General Records (GR) office. Will the accused walk free all because the documents seem to have disappeared?        
	Name Withheld                
	A: The non-availability of documents and court records is a grave issue. I hope you have the case number and the date of lodging the FIR. You may note that a copy of the FIR, chargesheet, seizure list, etc, are generally there in the public prosecutors office  what is known as the case diary. Since a chargesheet was filed in your case, there is a possibility that the record was transferred from the GR office to the sessions court. You should contact the GR office and also the public prosecutor, and request him to put up a petition before the court where the case was pending, and request the court to direct the office concerned to trace the records. You could also file an information slip in the court in order to know the status of your case.              
	Q:My mothers parents died, leaving an undivided property. The legal heirs were my mother, her unmarried sister and her childless brother. My mother and uncle have died. My uncles widow has evicted us, taken over the entire property, and has had it mutated in her name after submitting false declarations. She claims that my mother was not entitled to a share in the property under the Hindu Succession Act, and hence neither am I. How can we get our share back?        
	Name Withheld                
	A: Your aunts claim is not valid and your mother is entitled to a share in her parental property under the Hindu Succession Act, 1956. You can institute a suit for partition, claiming your share in the ancestral property. Move for an injunction against your aunt, praying for a restraining order preventing her from transferring or developing the property till the disposal of the suit. You may also institute a criminal case against her under Section 182 of the Indian Penal Code for giving false information with intent to make a public servant use his lawful power to cause injury to another person.

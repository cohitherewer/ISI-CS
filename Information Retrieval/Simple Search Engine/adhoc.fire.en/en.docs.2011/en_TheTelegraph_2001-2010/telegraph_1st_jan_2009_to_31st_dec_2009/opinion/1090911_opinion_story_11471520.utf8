	Wolf Hall
  By Hilary Mantel, 
  Fourth Estate, pound;8.25   
	Following the historian Geoffrey Elton, it is believed that in the reign of Henry VIII, England went through a revolution in government. The architect of that revolution, Elton argued, was Thomas Cromwell, a blacksmiths son from Putney who, after a chequered career, qualified as a lawyer and rose to become the principal advisor to the king and the most powerful man in England till he was executed in 1540.  
	Hilary Mantels new novel is about Thomas Cromwell. So life-like is the writing and so detailed the research, it is often difficult to believe that one is reading fiction and not history.        
	Cromwells first entry into the corridors of power was as the trusted lieutenant of Cardinal Wolsey. He was witness to the humiliation of Wolsey when he failed to secure the kings divorce, which would enable him to marry Anne Boleyn. Mantel depicts the scenes of Wolseys downfall with great deftness without dramatizing the event.        
	She shows how Cromwell, despite his loyalty to Wolsey, maintained his position in court even after Wolseys fall and death. Through a subtle interplay of persuasion and threats he succeeded in securing the support of the powerful churchmen in swearing loyalty to Henry. This enabled Henry to cut himself off from Rome and to marry Anne.        
	Cromwell was immensely wealthy because of his involvement in Englands wool trade. He had connections in Antwerp and Venice. The narrative is often from Cromwells point of view and thus Mantel makes him note the kind of clothes a person is wearing, especially the kind of fabric from which the clothes are made. These descriptions are quite detailed and they add to the richness and the authenticity of the novel.        
	Cromwell, and following him, Mantel, are aware of the importance of trade and wealth in the 16th-century world. These are Cromwells thoughts in Mantels words: The world is not run from border fortresses, not even from Whitehall. The world is run from Antwerp, from Florence, from Lisbon, from where the ships of sails of silk drift west.... Not from castle walls, but from counting houses, not by the call of the bugle but by the click of the abacus, not by the grate and click of the mechanism of the gun but by the scrape of the pen on the page of the promissory note that pays for the gun and the gunsmith and powder and shot.        
	Cromwell is the unrivalled protagonist of the book, but Mantel avoids the trap of making him a man without flaws. His cunning and his love for power are laid bare. Thomas Mores wife says towards the end of the novel, My husband used to say, lock Cromwell in a deep dungeon in the morning, and when you come back that night hell be sitting on a plush cushion eating larks tongues, and all the gaolers will owe him money. More was a friend of Cromwell, but he refused to take the oath of supremacy of the king.        
	This is a novel about an able man in turbulent times. The novel ends tantalizingly before the turbulence engulfs the man.

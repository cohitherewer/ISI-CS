	Forgotten plans                  
	Sir  Ashok Mitras article (Abul Hashem had a point, June 22) was not just interesting and informative, but it also opened up a forgotten page of the history of India. A fateful event was thrust upon the country in 1947 that drastically changed the entire nation and resulted in one of its greatest tragedies. One wonders just how many people today remember the name of Abul Hashem, who had thought of making Bengal an independent State, when the leaders of the Congress and the Muslim League at that time were far more interested in getting a truncated India and a Muslim-ruled Pakistan.           
	Those short-sighted leaders and the British viceroy certainly could not have foreseen the enormity of the effect of their hastily drafted agenda. It forced a sizeable portion of the population to a seemingly endless period of mutual lack of trust and hostility.           
	Hashems dream of making Bengal an independent State was nipped in the bud by the aggressiveness of powerful political parties, whom the British authorities considered the real representatives of the people of India. He was eventually lost in oblivion, unnoticed and unheard. But history has proved Hashems point. Out of Pakistan has emerged an independent Bangladesh, while India and Pakistan have been spending a huge amount of resources in constant hostility. It is an undeniable fact that Hashem is the authentic creator of independent Bangladesh. If his idea had been seriously considered, it could have changed the history of Asia. But the political leaders chose the path of destruction instead.           
	It may be a matter of time before the leaders of India and Pakistan accept the existing line of control as the permanent border. This time the leaders, in their misplaced zeal, may make another blunder in accepting such a solution. As Mitra has predicted, keeping a truncated Kashmir as one of the states under India will not solve the problem now more than half a century old. But if the valley is allowed to become a sovereign State, both India and Pakistan may gain, as there will be no more expenses and bloodshed for an unrealistic goal. If India can live peacefully with Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan, why cannot it accept Kashmir as a good neighbour?           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  In his article, Ashok Mitra has mentioned a political plan of 1947, the Bose-Suhrawardy formula. According to him, this plan of an independent Bengal on the departure of the British imperialists comes from a little known activist called Abul Hashem. Hashem was a zamindar with communist leanings and his support for united Bengal sprang from his personal interest in keeping his lands under his own control. The pros and cons of the plan have been extensively discussed over the years, but since Mitra seems to have some sympathy for this hare-brained plan, perhaps he may be persuaded to consider the following scenarios that would have emerged had the plan been carried out.           
	What would have happened to Assam and the Northeast in that case? Would they have had to become, willy-nilly, part of the new Bengal? The creation of East Pakistan was the result of a separate electorate, with Muslim seats reserved on the basis of population. However, Hindu seats were broken up into those for scheduled castes. In East Pakistan, this separate electorate continued and it still persists in Bangladesh, although secular India discarded the system in favour of a joint electorate. If the so-called independent Bengal had been formed in 1947, with a Muslim majority and a government dominated by Islamic parties, which may even have opted to join Pakistan, what would have been the situation today?          
	Abul Hashems plan for an independent Bengal might have led to a population imbalance in the independent Bengal of today. A possible scenario may be imagined from the situation in Bangladesh, where the Hindu minority has not only lost its political voice, but is also supposedly discriminated against. Does Mitra know of the high rate of conversion among the Hindu minority in Bangladesh, even after 1971? Mitra has once again raised the issue of Kashmirs right to independence and to decide its own fate. This is a very noble idea indeed, but in that case, what about the Pandits being driven out of the state, even when it is under the umbrella of the Central government?                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Death of a legend          
	Sir  The Peter Pan of pop music, Michael Jackson, is no more. An era of dynamic and innovative pop music has ended. Jackson achieved success the hard way as he rose to a lofty status from a musical wonder boy to a global icon. His popularity can be perceived from the extraordinarily high sales of his albums. His major hit, Thriller, released in 1982, had created euphoria around the world and had won 28 Platinum discs.           
	Jacksons famous moonwalk style was copied by many Indian film actors. Although his personal life was full of controversies, Jacksons fans loved him for his astonishing capability. Like the final come-back concert that was about to take place in London, Jackson has finally reached the end of a remarkable journey, although it was cut short of the expected goal.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Michael Jackson altered our music-listening habits forever. Off the Wall hit the puja pandals in 1979 and nothing was ever the same again. Jackson is the interface of globalization in India, with respect to music. Archetypal Bengalis, to whom all Western music seemed the same, and who could not differentiate between a tango and a tap, got addicted to him, watching him on television programmes like The World This Week. They understood, for the first time perhaps, what a performing artist is all about and what professionalism in music is.           
	I am not a music buff and feel irritated when people with Chinese cell phones play loud music everywhere. Still, I felt really sad at the death of Jackson  the complete entertainer. We shall go on missing him for decades to come.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Tapan Pal, Calcutta

                
	Sir  It is a tragic loss for the world that the king of pop is no more. I grew up listening to Michael Jackson. He was an awesome sensation, especially throughout the late 1980s and the early 1990s, when his albums Bad and Dangerous were out. I remember rushing out to buy his new album and playing it at home for hours on end. With Jacksons death, the world of music will never be the same again.                     
	Yours faithfully,

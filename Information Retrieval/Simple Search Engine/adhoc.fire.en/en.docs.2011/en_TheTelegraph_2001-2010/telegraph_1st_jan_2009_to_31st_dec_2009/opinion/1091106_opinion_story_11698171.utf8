	The game is afoot                
	To the Elephant Graveyard: A True Story of the Hunt for a Man-killing Indian Elephant (Penguin, Rs 299) by Tarquin Hall is an adventure tale that packs in some real problems and unreal situations to deliver a warning about the fast disappearing forest cover of India. Hall, who is a London-based journalist, joins the hunter, Dinesh Choudhury, on a mission to shoot a tusker that had been killing people brutally in Assams forests. The hunt brings Hall face to face with the crucial issues of man-animal conflict that always stand in the way of effective conservation, whether of forests or of animals. Yet the problems are not without solution, and Hall ends on an urgent plea to save the elephants habitat. For all the seriousness of its message, the book is not without drama and humour. In fact, the exaggerated theatrics, especially those involving the Bengali photographer, Vipal Ganguly, get on ones nerves at times.                                   
	50 Indian Film Classics (Collins, Rs 350) by M.K. Raghavendra is a well-researched book that wears its learning lightly. Raghavendra analyses 50 Indian films, starting from the silent-era film, Prem Sanyas (1925) to Rang de Basanti (2006) in short chapters that are remarkably balanced and insightful. The sharpness of the essays should not come as a surprise, given the fact that the author had won the National Award for Best Film Critic in 1997.                         
	The Ugly Duckling Goes to Work (Orient, Rs 295) by Mette Norgaard is a refreshingly different take on management ethics. It is not usual to come upon wisdom for the workplace from the classic tales of Hans Christian Andersen, but Norgaard presents it with aplomb. Norgaard, who is a Dane herself like Andersen, provides a fresh translation of her chosen tales at the beginning of each chapter and then explains their relevance to the workplace. The way she elucidates them, the analogies do not seem far-fetched at all. This book would help those who want to feel alive in their work, who want a work life.                        
	If it Bleeds (Headline, Rs 295) by Duncan Campbell is a murder mystery that is engrossing and hilarious. The protagonist, Laurie, makes one faux pas after another in his search for the murderer of a notorious ganglord, Old Man Hook. At the end, things sort themselves out and Laurie gets a life in the process.

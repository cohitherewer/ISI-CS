	GABRIEL GARCA MRQUEZ: A LIFE By Gerald Martin, Bloomsbury, Rs 1,395        
	Gabriel Garca Mrquez deserved a biographer like Gerald Martin. In many ways, Martin is the perfect match for GGMs fabled capacity for patience and dogged resilience in the face of adversity. It took GGM two decades of restless peregrinations across the world to produce his masterpiece, One Hundred Years of Solitude, at the age of 40 (the actual writing took about a year). In the meantime, he had filled up 40 notebooks with details of his labyrinthine family, consulted dozens of volumes on Latin American history, smoked 30,000 cigarettes made of the most barbaric tobacco, ran into a debt of 120,000 pesos, before he finished a 1,300-page typescript (from which he finally sent 490 pages to his publishers).         
	His biographers feat is statistically no less impressive. At the end of 17 years of research and writing, Martin found himself with a 2,000-page manuscript and 6,000 footnotes. By this time, he had visited all the places GGM had ever lived in, tracked down his vastly proliferating family, interviewed some 300 odd people (including Fidel Castro and Felipe Gonzlez), and exhumed GGMs journalistic trivia, some of which had appeared in obscure publications that have ceased to exist ages since. Yet, in spite of his relentless devotion to his subject, Martin is not what James Boswell was to Dr Johnson. Far from it, he claims to have spent just a total of one full month with GGM in public and in private over the two decades that he has worked on the book. According to Martin, this is not an authorized biography, its a tolerated biography.        
	GGMs resistance to his biography is explained by his compulsive need to control the official version of his life. A self-confessed professional of the memory, GGM has routinely turned his life into the stuff of art. He is famously mischievous: he once told reporters that it was his wife, Mercedes, who dictated his books to him; he is just the poor amanuensis. He loves to keep the critics guessing what he is all about. When Chronicle of a Death Foretold was published, many couldnt decide if it actually was a great work or just an exciting thriller. As reviewers hotly debated the book, newspaper-sellers and chewing-gum vendors sold it all over the streets of Latin America.         
	Beyond this careful self-fashioning, lies GGMs pathological fear of death. Like Kafka, first among his pantheon of favourite writers, GGM is obsessed with writing his life into his art  fiction being the ultimate answer to all the mortal questions. He even chose a tellingly defiant title for his memoirs, Living to Tell the Tale, which he completed while recovering from cancer. As a habitual storyteller, GGM is averse to anyone other than himself telling his tale.        
	Ironically, this limited access to GGM becomes a saving grace for Martin. It allows him the necessary distance to consider his subject without being blinded by GGMs incurable mythomania. In the prologue, Martin disentangles the impossibly complicated genealogy of GGMs maternal family, headed by his grandfather, Colonel Nicols Mrquez Meja, Papalelo to his grandchildren. A reckless fornicator, the Colonel spawned a brood of illegitimate children along the Caribbean coast. Over time, this line of half-siblings and distant cousins became so incestuously mixed up that it was difficult to say who exactly begot whom: You could never be sure who you were marrying, as GGM put it.        
	Shortly after his birth, GGMs mother, Luisa Santiaga, left him with her parents, and the boys first eight years were spent at Papalelos house in Aracataca, overflowing with half-aunts, servants and ghosts, overseen by his grandmother, Tranquilina Iguarn or Mina  the model for Ursul Iguarn in One Hundred Years. It was a childhood spent under the protective gaze of passionately superstitious women  a theme GGM would revisit almost ritually in most of his books  with Papalelo as the male centre of GGMs life. While Papalelo would tell him stories of his heroism in the Thousand Day War, where he fought against the Conservative regime, Mina would be filled with apprehensions, oracles and visions. She dreamed once of a crowd of fleas, so she took her head off, put it between her legs, and began to kill the fleas one by one. GGM felt his early life was like the Roman Empire, governed by birds... thunderclaps and other atmospheric signals... really we were manipulated by the invisible Gods....        
	Martin appears to be highly amused by the idiosyncrasies running in the family, though a few remarks here and there startle him out of his wits. GGMs mother tells him, in all earnestness, that she does not comb her hair at night for fear of delaying the sailors, and the greatest satisfaction of her life is not her sons legendary fame, but that one of her daughters is a nun.        
	Although Martin surrenders himself to the inescapable charms of the family lore, he does not allow the magic to take over his mind unconditionally. After outlining the catalogue of invisible Gods who played havoc with the household, he turns his attention gently, but firmly, to the two most painful invisibles in young GGMs life  his parents. After his grandfathers death, GGM was taken away by his father, Gabriel Eligio Garca  telegraphist, homeopath, and incorrigible womanizer who fathered 11 children with his wedded wife and several more with the various women he met as a roving mountebank. An illegitimate half-breed himself, Gabriel Eligio was an uncaring, insensitive father who delighted in terrorizing his children. GGMs fathers family  revelling in debauchery and shorn of every veneer of decency that held his mothers family together in spite of Papalelos waywardness  plagued his childhood.        
	Martin looks deeper into GGMs Chaplinesque persona, beneath his Cervantine irony, to uncover the turmoils and terrors of his life. In 1955, when GGM was sent to report on the Geneva Conventions, he ended up staying in Paris for a few years. He lived in a brothel, in perpetual penury, and had an affair with Tachia Quintana, though he was already engaged to Mercedes. He and Tachia would part messily after she had a miscarriage, and he fled to Russia.         
	The sins of his ancestors would haunt GGM in even stranger ways when  taking after Papalelos Liberal ideals  he embraced communism to the exclusion of all reason. Despite severe criticism from his closest friends, GGM would continue to support Castro and the Cuban Revolution; he would praise Kdr as just an ordinary working man who goes to the zoo on Sunday to throw peanuts to the elephants. But his contact with powerful men (Carlos Andrz Prez, Bill Clinton, the high and mighty of the Mexican film industry, for which he has written films) did not diminish his unique eccentricities. Instead of the usual tuxedo, he chose to wear a traditional liquiliqui to the Nobel ceremony. There, the reading of the communiqu of the award was drowned by Colombian radio commentators who sounded as if they were covering a football match. At this peak of literary glory, GGM behaved like a bullfighter from the moment he arrived at Stockholm airport. Later at the hotel, he dressed like a matador preparing for a grand spectacle, cheered on by his male friends, while Gloria Triana, one of his many female friends, chaperoned the girls who had flown in from all over Latin America for the ceremony (Theyre all virgins and Ive promised their mothers).         
	Wherever he goes, to this day GGM carries along this rich abundance of humanity. His chiefest vice is conversation; his biggest fear the lull that comes at the end. Ive understood everything except death, says one of his characters in Of Love and Other Demons. The prospect of death and the trials of old age fill him with a cold fury. As GGMs most precious gift, his prodigious memory, keeps fading with time, it is the biographer, that once fearful angel of death, who comes to the rescue, securing the relics of his life. Just write what you see, GGM once told Martin, whatever you write, that is what I will be. Could this be his sly compliment to his biographer? Or perhaps just his mamagallismo (habit of piss-taking) masquerading as back-handed praise? One can never be sure.

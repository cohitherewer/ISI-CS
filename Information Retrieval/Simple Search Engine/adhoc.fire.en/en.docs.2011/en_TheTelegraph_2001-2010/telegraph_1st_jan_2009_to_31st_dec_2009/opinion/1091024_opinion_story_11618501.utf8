The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Twisting trail of rare melodies
                                                                                                                 TWISTING TRAIL OF RARE MELODIES                              Nilaksha Gupta      Music                                                
	The Alladiya Khan gharana, also called the Jaipur-Atrauli gharana, is known for its penchant for lesser-known ragas. So it was not in the least surprising that there were no commonly heard ragas in the morning recital by Shruti Sadolikar Katkar, one of the best contemporary exponents of the gharana, at the GD Birla Sabhagar on October 11. Since the programme was organized by Vijay Kichlus Sangeet Ashram, brief recordings by Vamanrao Sadolikar, the artists father and first teacher, and the magnificent Kesarbai Kerkar, were played to display Alladiya Khans style to the audience before the recital began.        
	The opening khayal was in Bahaduri Todi, a raga that has been rarely heard in the city in recent times. This raga is also possibly the one with the most radically different versions. But Ustad Alladiya Khan had a method of organizing the complex material of ragas of this kind in such a cogent manner that, while listening to trained exponents of his system, one wonders what all the confusion was about.        
	Shruti Sadolikars phrase elaboration was in her characteristically slower and more expressive version of the Alladiya style. It consequently added power to the impact of each major phrase and made the salient features of the raga note-map clearer and easier to grasp than they would otherwise have been. The balance of phrases using either of the two rishavs, the three-step ascending movement, and the grandeur of the madhyam, all built up the raga solidly and attractively. The bahlawas, rhythmic movements and the characteristic taans of the Alladiya style that appeared in a phased manner seemed to expand the vilambit khayal beyond the 35 minutes it occupied. The brief drut khayal was neat and wonderfully complete.        
	The next vilambit khayal was in an unusual version of Bibhas. This version had a shuddh dhaivat and an occasional nishad (N r G; G P D N) and tivra madhyam as well (r G m). This was also very well sung. I was aware of four versions of this raga till this recital: the common Bhairav thhaat Bibhas, the Marwa thhaat Bibhas, the Purbi thhaat Bibhas, and the Bilawal thhaat Bibhas, also called Bangal Bibhas. Now I am aware of five.        
	Next, there was a drut khayal in Hindol Bahar in which the phrases of the two ragas were sung alternately and also blended eventually. The nishad, neither used in the asthayi nor its elaboration hinted at in the preamble to the antara, was brought in with an element of surprise in the antara itself.        
	The final khayal was in a raga as rare today as Bahaduri Todi and with an equal number of disparate versions: Kshat or Khat, as it is called in Bengal and Punjab. Kshat means a group six in Sanskrit, so the raga is supposed to be a combination of six ragas. I could gauge five in Shruti Sadolikars version: Desi Todi, Darbari Kanada (d n P), Asavari (the one with shuddh rishav), Bhairavi/Malkauns (M d n `S) and Bageshree (`g `r n D). I may have missed out a subtle touch of another, but even if I did not, this version was definitely much closer to its name than the Patiala version in which one can discern only two ragas.        
	Though this khayal was sung briefly, it presented the raga as a coherent one and Shruti Sadolikar delivered aspects of the Alladiya-style vilambit khayal with superb skill and artistry. The tabla accompanist, Mangesh Mulye, chipped in with the kind of thheka that incorporates rhythmic phrases during the rhythmic movements of the khayals, especially the vilambit in Bahaduri Todi. This kind of thheka that mixes thheka with saath, enhances a khayal recital greatly and is something that the current crop of tabla players in Calcutta do not play.        
	The singer seemed a bit tired and ready to call it a day after the Kshat khayal, but the organizer-in-chief requested a song in Bhairavi. She responded with the classic thumri, Baju bandhan, but could not really do justice to it. I may be wrong, but I do not think the thumri was ever the forte of any Alladiya gharana singer other than Kesarbai Kerkar. So Shruti Sadolikar was actually very much within the tradition by not impressing as much with her thumri as with her wonderful khayals.        
	The harmonium accompanist, Rupashri Bhattacharya, did an excellent job following the twisting trail of complicated ragas and, on encouragement from the singer, elaborating the ragas on her own at some points.

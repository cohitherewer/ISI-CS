                                                                                                                 MORE THAN BLACK                                                          
	You lie! These are the words with which Republican Joe Wilson interrupted his presidents speech in Congress earlier this month. Mr Wilsons grammar is ambiguous. His words hang between a specific allegation and a general truth: the president is lying, or the president lies. To jump from that to the next stage is easy. If one knows that the president lies, then is Mr Wilsons you referring to only the president, or to the president and his kind? If the latter, then who belongs to Barack Obamas kind? Already, that thing of darkness is calling out to be acknowledged. And this is precisely what Jimmy Carter, ex-president and octogenarian Democrat, did on TV soon after. From his long knowledge of the American south, he had no doubt at all that much of the animosity towards Mr Obama was based on the fact that he was a black man. But, even more significantly, the president himself publicly disagreed with Mr Carters view, saying that race was not the overriding issue here. And with this cool dismissal, the first black president of the United States of America went back to being what he is much more comfortable being: a president who happens to be black.        
	This is a tightrope that Mr Obama, the person as well as the president, will never be spared from having to walk. When he called the police stupid for arresting a black man trying to break into his own home after locking himself out, he had to control the dam age by inviting this man and the policeman who arrested him to his own home for a drink. There, he oversaw a peace-making chat between the black professor and the white policeman, during which his own stakes in the situation  as a man whose colour was more complicated than either black or white  were played down with a calculated mix of the smart and the casual. Earlier, while campaigning for presidency, he had to dissociate himself from the radicalism of his former pastor, Jeremiah Wright, without disavowing his love and respect for the reverend. He did so, in his race speech of March 2008 in Philadelphia, by writing his personal story into it and yet avoiding a racial stalemate by making sure that our trials and triumphs became at once unique and universal, black and more than black.        
	Mr Wilson shouted out that Mr Obama lied immediately after the president had reassured the Congress that his plan for a healthcare system would not cover illegal immigrants. Perhaps Mr Wilson could not believe that a coloured president would not turn a new welfare system into yet another kind of affirmative action, bringing about a biased redistribution of the nations wealth. When apologizing later for his outburst, Mr Wilson said that he had let his emotions get the best of [him]  an apology that unwittingly gets to the heart of the matter. His anger had welled up from a place deeper than from where policy emanates  a realm of inchoate feeling that is no less historical or political for being momentarily ungovernable.

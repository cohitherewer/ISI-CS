	If it could happen in China, it could also happen in Thailand. So there is no reason why the Chinese premier, Wen Jiabao, should come back wonderstruck by the protests in Thailand that indefinitely put off the summit of the Association of South East Asian Nations in Pattaya. That the pro-Tibet protests on the eve of the Beijing Olympics and the anti-government protests in Thailand ended quite differently has more to do with the rules of the game followed than the uniqueness of the countries. Ever since its intervention ended in bloodshed in 1992, the army in Thailand, unlike in China, has never given fulsome support to governments, whatever their allegiance, to crack down on public protests. This is why no political dispensation has been able to show enough muscle in containing agitations, and anti-government protests have been more disruptive in Thailand than in other countries.         
	It was no different this time. Despite the threats of disruption, the Abhisit Vejjajiva government could not do enough to stave off the embarrassing holding up of the convention. It is possible that he did not want to push things too hard either. For one, he cannot afford the bad blood over a trophy summit to unsaddle his months-old government, put together by painstaking manoeuvres to divide the pro-royalty movement, which preceded the present spell of agitation. There is also the imminent threat of an election being imposed on Thailand that could return to power sympathizers of Thaksin Shinawatra, the discredited former Thai premier, who continues to wield enough power from his exile to precipitate the present crisis. The red-shirt sympathizers of Mr Shinawatra, who form the United Front of Democracy against Dictatorship and who now hold the government to ransom, may appear to be justified in demanding elections to bring down the unelected government of Mr Vejjajiva. But it is unlikely that the pro-democratic movement of UDD will take Thailand any closer to real democracy than the popular movement of the pro-royalist Peoples Alliance for Democracy last year.

	Confess to conceal                  
	Sir  There is nothing sensational in the confessions made by Ajmal Kasab about his role in the Mumbai terror attacks (Kasab drops confession bombshell, July 21). He has spoken the truth that was already known to one and all in the subcontinent. Whether the next course of events follows the now-familiar pattern is of greater concern. If convicted with the capital punishment, he can approach the president, the highest constitutional authority, with a mercy plea. When the matter gets referred to the Union home ministry, he might join the long queue of those awaiting a possible reprieve on their death sentences. Given the gravity of offence in many of these cases, the judicial system should consider the question of expediency.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Arun Malankar, Mumbai

                
	Sir  Kasabs confession is not without reason. He has possibly acted on advice and after much deliberation. While pretending to tell all in court, Kasab was careful to blame the slain terrorists for the killings, knowing that they can neither corroborate nor refute his statement. He has also been careful to excise details that have been in the public domain for some time now, especially the role played by the jihadis handlers in Pakistan.           
	All this could add up to no more than a red herring meant to derail investigations and take the heat off the real conspirators, perhaps sitting in Pakistan. In any event, the trial must continue and not be short-circuited by what appears to be a well-rehearsed confession.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Green thoughts          
	Sir  Vinuta Gopal of Greenpeace has cautioned us that if India allows its daily per capita carbon emissions to grow to 5 or 6 tonnes, it would push itself and the world further away from sustainable development (Emissions near tipping point, July 20).           
	Sarah Ladislaw of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies has observed that China and India will need to reduce expected emissions if the world is to avoid the worst impacts. Remi Moncel of World Resources Institute has advised us to decouple economic growth from emissions growth. Reading all these sermons, one is tempted to question the common sense of these alarmists. It is not understood how the task of saving the world from a possible cataclysm falls on India and China more than on the others, and why the experts from the West are not advising their own nations to reduce per capita emissions. Are they not heard in their own countries?           
	If only Remi told us how to decouple economic growth from emission growth. M.K. Gandhis insistence on the use of the spinning wheel and on indigenous means of production in general showed environmental awareness. Now, pundits from the West have taken to advising India.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Hillary Clinton, the secretary of state of the United States of America, while expressing the hope that India will not make the same mistake that the US and other developed countries have, was echoing Remi Morcels emphasis on the decoupling of emission and economic growth by China and India. Thus, she admits that the developed countries are historically responsible for the problem of climate change.           
	The principle of common but differentiated responsibility, enshrined in the United Nations framework convention on climate change and the Kyoto Protocol to the UNFCCC states, says that while all countries have a responsibility to tackle climate change, the responsibility is greater on the part of the developed countries. The extent of the developing countries responsibility will depend on the extent to which the developed countries transfer energy-efficient technology and provide financial support to the former. The Kyoto Protocol lays down definite reduction targets for developed, but not developing, countries, which have to be met by 2012.           
	Instead of saying how they are going to meet these obligations, the developed countries are now asking us to make binding commitments to reduce emissions. In fact, to force us to do what we are not obliged to do under international law, the US Congress has passed (pending Senate approval) the American Clean Energy and Security Act, 2009 (the Waxman-Markey bill), which seeks to raise barriers in the form of carbon-based border tax in a way that would put developing countries at a disadvantage.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  Ever since the Reserve Bank of India directed banks to withdraw cash transaction charges for utilizing the automated teller machine facility, banks have stopped taking care of their ATM customers. The cash stocks of ATMs are not replenished. Moreover, when an ATM becomes inoperative, it remains so for days on end. Complaints lodged against this problem produce no result.           
	I reside at Kalikapur in Calcutta adjacent to the Abhisarika shopping mall. The State Bank of India has its ATM on the opposite side of the road on which it has its Kalikapur branch. In the premises of the Abhisarika mall there are two other ATMs, one belonging to the Axis bank and the other to the Union Bank of India. All the ATMs, except that of the Axis bank, provide irregular service. The UBI ATM is the worst among the three. It is often out of order. The managers of the said bank express no regret over this. Neither can they promise the resumption of the ATMs service in the near future. When can the harassed customers of the banks expect the condition to improve?           
	Yours faithfully,      
Paramananda Pal, Calcutta

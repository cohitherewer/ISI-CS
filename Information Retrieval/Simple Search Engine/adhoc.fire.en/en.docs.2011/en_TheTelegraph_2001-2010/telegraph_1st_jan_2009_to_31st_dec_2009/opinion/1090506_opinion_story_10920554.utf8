                                                                                                                 CLEAN IT UP                                                    
	Industrial pollution is no longer an issue of only scientific or economic debate. It is increasingly becoming a concern of ordinary people and that is undoubtedly a good sign. The Jharkhand governments decision to involve the people in monitoring industrial pollution around Jamshedpur is, therefore, a welcome move. After all, factory chimneys spewing out toxic gases and dust particles in the air can be a matter of life and death for the people living in the area. Even though not all toxic gases and chemicals cause disasters of the magnitude of a Bhopal gas tragedy, polluting industries can result in slow deaths, chronic ailments and other disabilities over a long period. If environmental degradation has become a dreaded idea in many parts of the world, there are good reasons for it. The danger is worsening in poor countries such as India, which seem to be in a mad rush for modernity through rapid, and often unplanned, industrialization.         
	There is no denying that Jharkhand, one of the poorest states in India, needs to catch up with the rest of the country in economic progress. It has an abundance of minerals and other natural resources which makes it an attractive destination for investors in the liberalized economic regime. But the lure of investments is no reason for the state to exchange fresh air and water for new industries. Sponge-iron units, in Jharkhand and elsewhere in the country, have been among the worst offenders in terms of industrial pollution. The people living around these units are known to be particularly vulnerable to toxic emissions. Clearly, many of the industrial units around Jamshedpur have flouted the norms set by the government to check pollution. It is no secret that they manage to bend the law or simply flout it by greasing officials palms. It is all very fine to try to involve the people in the task. But the responsibility for monitoring industrial pollution and punishing the offenders must lie squarely with the government and its agencies.

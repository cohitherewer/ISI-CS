                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        MURKY TRAIL                                                    
	Two women died unnatural deaths on the night of May 29-30. It is amazing that the cause of the deaths of 17-year-old Asiya Jan, and her pregnant sister-in-law, 22-year-old Neelofar, keeps changing  the charges ranging from rape and murder in the reports of the Muzaffar Jan inquiry commission appointed by the state government and the High Court Bar Association inquiry to drowning without rape and murder in the latest report submitted by the Central Bureau of Investigation. The Shopian case, as it has come to be known, is a painful exposure of the erosion in civil society institutions in Jammu and Kashmir, the tragic result of years of mistrust, violence, tension between communities and the tussle between unionism and separatism. The discovery of the bodies, together with the ready suspicion that the police or military were to blame, had ignited in the valley a storm of protest, aggressive police reactions, curfews and house arrests of separatist leaders from May 30 to around July 13. Things cooled a little after five policemen associated with the inquiry were suspended for mishandling the investigation, but no solution emerged. From the beginning, the trail of forensic evidence was murky: two post-mortem examinations by different teams of doctors with the fury of the populace barely held at bay, and procedures allegedly violated at every step, by the police, doctors and officials of all kinds. An exhumation, that alleged the younger girl to be a virgin, was followed by the CBIs most recent claim that 13 people, including doctors and lawyers, had fabricated evidence, while the policemen had done nothing wrong. Predictably, the people are furious.        
	Together with the CBI, there have been four separate inquiries. Each was conducted under pressure, and revealed wildly conflicting statements from doctors and witnesses, and, often, retractions with charges of coercion directed towards one or the other body. The CBIs credibility is pitiful, but the contaminated evidence has allowed it to come to the conclusions it has presented. With separatists breathing down the governments neck and the obvious resentment of the people towards uniform, no womans death, close to a security personnel camp as these were, can be treated with the hamhanded stupidity that has been displayed. In an atmosphere of pervasive mistrust and fear, institutions have to go the extra mile to convince the people that they are on the track of the truth.

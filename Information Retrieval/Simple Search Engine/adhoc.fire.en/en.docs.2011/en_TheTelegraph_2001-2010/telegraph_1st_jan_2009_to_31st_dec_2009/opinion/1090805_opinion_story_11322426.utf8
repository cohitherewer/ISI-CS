The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Big brother is watching
                                                                                                                 BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING                                  The draft rules under the amendments to the Information Technology Act give the government the power to block any web content in the interest of the nation, reports Hemchhaya De                          CONSTANT VIGILANCE: The government may soon have the last word on what you can post or see on the Internet                                   
	Some in the Fourth Estate are an anxious lot these days. They wonder how the government can possibly go ahead with plans that are apparently targeted at gagging news portals and other websites not only during emergency situations but even during normal times if it is deemed necessary.        
	In May this year, the department of information technology under the ministry of communication and information drew up draft rules under the amendments to the Information Technology (IT) Act that seek to monitor, among other things, news content on the web. The rules under the Act will be enforced shortly, says a senior central government official who does not wish to be identified.        
	Section 69 of the Information Technology Amendment Act, 2008, gives the government the power to intercept, monitor or decrypt any information transmitted, received or stored in any computer resource in a public or a private place. Under Section 2K of the IT Act, 2000, a computer resource implies a computer, computer system, network, data, computer database or software.        
	The recently introduced draft rules further amplify the provisions of the Act. It states that once a person complains against any information posted on the web, the authority concerned will decide whether it goes against the interests of the sovereignty or integrity of India, defence of India, security of the state, friendly relations with foreign states, public order or whether it amounts to incitement to commit any cognisable offence. If it is felt that the information needs to be blocked, a request will be sent to a designated officer selected by the secretary of the central IT department. A committee headed by the designated officer will decide whether the request should be accepted or not. If the committees recommendation is approved, the designated officer will ask the web host to take off the information from the website within a prescribed time limit.        
	The IT Act of 2000 focused mainly on the decryption of messages. Section 69 of the latest legislation broadens its scope by including interception and monitoring. Of course, the official line of argument is that such steps are imperative in times of national emergency and on grounds of the countrys sovereignty, defence, public order, foreign relations and other concerns. But the powers will be exercised not only when national security interests are threatened but also when cognisable offences are committed, says Anoop Narayanan, partner, Majumdar amp; Co International Lawyers, a Mumbai-based law firm.        
	Some feel that such stringent legal provisions subvert the very idea of freedom in cyberspace. If these rules are enforced, the biggest losers will be bloggers and independent or citizen journalists who dont enjoy the kind of support that big media organisations do, says Kiruba Shankar, popular blogger and CEO of Chennai-based IT firms Business Blogging and F5ive Technologies. The beauty of the web is that we can express ourselves freely and honestly. But how can we record our experiences and views sincerely when such rules can become a potent tool of abuse?        
	He continues, As it is, high-ranking government officials can easily track any information on the web as and when it appears. So why do they need to bring in more draconian laws?        
	Lawyers say that this is a routine argument against censorship. Though the Indian Constitution guarantees freedom of expression under Article 19, people should bear in mind that there are reasonable restrictions on such liberty. No one has the right to post anything and everything on the web. And national concerns will always take precedence, says Joy Sengupta, criminal lawyer, Calcutta High Court.        
	In the US, for example, there are national centres to monitor web content. Although the US government lays considerable emphasis on the right to privacy and freedom of speech, national security concerns are being given greater priority than ever after the 9/11 attacks.              
	Among existing laws in the country, the Indian Telegraph Act of 1885 gives the government the right to intercept messages or other forms of communication as well. Clause 5(2) of the Act states: On the occurrence of any public emergency, or in the interest of public safety, the Central Government or a State Government or any officer specially authorised in this behalf by the Central Government or a State Government maydirect that any message or class of messages to or from any person or class of persons, or relating to any particular subject, brought for transmission by or transmitted or received by any telegraphshall be intercepted or detained, or shall be disclosed to the Government making the order        
	In 1991, the Peoples Union for Civil Liberties challenged this clause on the ground that it curbed the constitutional right to freedom of speech and expression and the right to life and personal liberty. Delivering its judgement, the Supreme Court observed that unless a public emergency has occurred or the interest of public safety demands, the authorities have no jurisdiction to exercise the powers as specified under 5(2). A public emergency was defined by the court as the prevailing of a sudden condition or state of affairs affecting the people at large calling for immediate action.        
	Says Narayanan, If we look at this example, we see that although the citizens fundamental right to privacy and freedom of speech and expression can be subject to reasonable restrictions in the interest of national security, the government must use such rights carefully and with adequate guidelines.        
	Legal experts feel that the new amendments to the IT law could be more intrusive than the Indian Telegraph Act. One of the lacunae in the draft rules under the Act is that there seems to be no provision to give the affected web host a hearing before or after his or her portal is blocked. Therein lies the arbitrariness of the draft rules. If officials are taking about seven days to complete procedures leading to blocking a website, why cant the affected party get a pre or post-decisional hearing, argues Joymalya Bagchi, senior criminal lawyer, Calcutta High Court.        
	There is also a certain vagueness in the draft rules about the ambit of jurisdiction. What happens if the information is posted from outside India? Its not clear from the rules how that will be tackled, says Shameek Sen, assistant professor, who specialises in media law at the National University of Juridical Sciences, Calcutta.        
	However, the draft rules do have some safeguards. For example, a review committee will meet every two months to check whether or not orders to block portals have been issued in accordance with the IT Act.        
	Still, web professionals are far from convinced. At a time when the country is opening up its economic policies, the draft rules under the amendments to the IT Act will take our country back by at least 20 years, says Shankar.

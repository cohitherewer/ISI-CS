	Women, good and bad                  
	Sir  Social reformers and the media have been questioning Sri Ram Senas assault on women in a pub in Mangalore as well as the protests against other Valentines Day celebrants. But are the pub-going girls doing any good to society? Are Valentines Day celebrations models of sobriety? Are drinking and dancing by women in pubs signs of health for the social and cultural lives of the nation? The Sri Ram Senas initiative to stop such foul practices has not been a crime then. The group has, indeed, been wrong in taking law into its hands. But why did the police remain silent? Local residents had reported such undesirable activities by women to the police who failed to act. If the police do not respond to public sentiments, what then are the ways to stop such action? The government fails to banish drinking and smoking, which are harmful to the entire society, and runs futile campaigns on avoiding smoking. Is this because the government earns revenue from the sale of cigarettes and liquor?           
	It is a fact that the name, Sri Ram Sena, need not mean that the group will always be rightwing or religiously inclined, or that it will not indulge in corrupt or illegal practices. The opponents of the Bharatiya Janata Party, however, have exploited this incident to tarnish the party, although the leader of Sri Ram Sena was expelled long ago from the BJP. When strikes, forceful shutting down of shops, burning of property and vehicles, and political rallies are considered acceptable in a democracy, why do the media look askance at the Ram Senas attack?           
	Yours faithfully,      
Danendra Jain, Agartala 

                
	Sir  I want to congratulate the organizers of the Pink Chaddi Campaign because they have fearlessly countered the threat posed by the so-called custodians of Indian culture. The brains behind this idea should now encourage teenagers not only to inculcate the pub culture but also to join, in large numbers (especially the girls), the tribe of ramp-walkers.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Jorhat Singh, Mumbai 

                
	Sir  The media coverage and discussions on the Mangalore incident have puzzled me. When it comes to our own children, we do not want them to indulge in drinking, drugs, sex and the pub culture. But when it comes to other peoples children, we do not have the courage to say that it is wrong for teenagers to take to these things.           
	Would the Union minister for women and child welfare, Renuka Chowdhury, who condemned the Mangalore incident, allow her children to indulge in these vices? India may be a democracy, but a majority of its population is poor and middle class, and do not identify with this culture. Western trends do not reflect Indias progress but the decay of our values. India will shine only by respecting its own traditions and not by imitating the West.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Pramod Muthalik and the others accused in the Mangalore bar assault case have been granted bail in spite of perpetrating atrocities on women. But there has been a furore around this affair. I think it is just to embarrass the BJP before the elections. Nobody is interested in either the incident or the victims. Why do the moral police of the BJP, as a matter of fact, Indians in general, allow indecent exposure in films, posters and television soaps? This is our innate male chauvinism combined with sadism. Even women enjoy these obscenities. But we are hypocrites and do nothing about this. There is a furore only when a vote bank has to be secured.           
	Yours faithfully,       
M.M. Kale, Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh 

                
	Sir  The daughter of the woman and child welfare minister, Renuka Chowdhury, Tejaswini, had given a Pub Bharo call on Valentines Day. Female activists are purchasing pink panties for sending them to the Ram Sena chief, Pramod Muthalik. This only confirms the activists questionable character and bad taste. They do not represent even one per cent of Indian women, but the electronic media give them full coverage. The people of Mangalore have criticized the use of the phrase, Talibanization of Mangalore, by the media, which have blown a small incident out of proportion.          
	The activists try to create a permissive society in India. They are responsible for broken marriages, extra-marital relationships and sexual liberality. A decade ago, we did not hear of any Valentines Day.           
	I am quite sure that activists like Renuka Chowdhury and Girija Vyas have never read Aurobindo, Subhas Chandra Bose, Rabindranath Tagore and Jawaharlal Nehru. Besides, they never cared to visit the rape victims of Singur and Nandigram. Indians are changing, but this need not mean changing our rudimentary cultural values. This female brigade will never be acceptable to Indian women whose role-models are Sita, Sabitri and Indira Gandhi. Indira Gandhi, stunningly beautiful and dignified in her sari, was undoubtedly one of Indias most loved and respected women.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Tapan Dasgupta, Burdwan

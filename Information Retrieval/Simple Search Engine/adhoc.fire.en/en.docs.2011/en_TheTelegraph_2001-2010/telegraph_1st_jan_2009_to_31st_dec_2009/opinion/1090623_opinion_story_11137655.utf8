The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Letters to Editor
                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Never too late                  
	Sir  The editorial, Govern or go (June 19), succinctly captures the dilemma of the Left Front government in West Bengal when it says that the latter is neither feared nor loved in the state. This peculiarity arises out of the governments inability to act decisively on any issue of consequence. Last years Singur fiasco is now followed by Lalgarh. The Maoist outlaws, who went on a rampage in the area and attacked the cadres of the ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist), were looking to settle political scores in the guise of protesting against police atrocities. Using the tribals as a human shield, the Maoists sought to create liberated zones in the region.          
	But Lalgarh is a symptom of a larger problem created by the Left Front governments prolonged project of substituting the party for the government and reshuffling the administration on the basis of loyalty to the party rather than competence. This Stalinist method of consolidating and retaining power has finally proved fatal. The administration has long forgotten to recognize, never mind keep, its part of the bargain with the very people who had given the CPI(M) its continuing power. It makes a mockery of accountability when bureaucrats, policemen and administrators are deeply entrenched in party affiliations. The CPI(M) government should exit now, when there is still time, else there might be a heavier price to pay.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Dilbag Rai, Chandigarh 

                
	Sir  The state governments initial wavering on how to handle the crisis in Lalgarh has been sharply pointed out by the editorial, Govern or go (June 19). That the government was in two minds over Lalgarh is perhaps explained by the lesson it got from its politically motivated and quasi-administrative handling of the unrests in Nandigram and Singur. Back then, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees actions were much criticized even by his colleagues in the Left Front. So, before the Lalgarh operation, he informed his party so that none could say that this time too it was his private decision that sparked the police action. However, as the head of the state government, he did not hold a cabinet or all-party meeting before sending troops into Lalgarh. Still, the Lalgarh operation might help Bhattacharjee reverse his governments dismal showing in the aftermath of the Cyclone Aila.                    
	Yours faithfully,        Subrata Pal, Karimpur, Nadia              
	Sir  The Centre has already labelled the Maoists as the biggest threat to the countrys internal security. Under these circumstances, the media should assist the State as best as they can to eradicate the Naxalite menace. Sadly, Govern or go does not provide much encouragement to the Bengal government even as the crisis in Lalgarh looms large.          
	Yours faithfully,         R. Subhranshu, Chandernagore, Hooghly               
	Same old stories          
	Sir  The recession in the economy has made government jobs the most lucrative ones in the market. One sincerely hopes that some worthy people are inducted into the public sector this time round  people who take their responsibilities as a form of challenge and are not motivated merely by the money or job security that comes with a government job.          
	I have had a rather harrowing experience dealing with government officials on two instances last month. The first pertains to the Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited, whose customer care cell in Ranikuthi ought to be named customer harassment cell. I had applied for a change in my broadband plan, asking for the alteration to be made effective from next month. The service provider changed it this month instead without any intimation. When I approached the BSNL customer care executives, they said there was nothing they could do. Their attitude was as if I had committed a serious crime in mentioning the date from which I would have liked the scheme to be changed. They said they had no such provision, and were tired of catering to different requirements of different clients. When I was finally allowed to meet the area manager of the Jadavpur division, he asked me to see him later with the bill to get the correction done, but again it was his attitude that disgusted me. It took only five minutes to relate what I had come for, but I was made to sit in front of him for half an hour, hearing him talk about his health to his subordinates, calling his colleagues about another issue that has cropped up, as if the last priority was reserved for the person sitting right in front of him.          
	The second incident took place in the Durgapur Bazaar branch of the Burdwan Cooperative Bank. My grandfather had opted to include my name in his account there, and I had to do all the necessary paperwork. When I went to submit the papers to the bank, I found that the person handling the case was on leave. I was to return to Calcutta the next day on some urgent business, and requested the manager to complete the necessary formalities  otherwise my grandfather would have to suffer the ordeal of coming to the bank in the searing heat. The manager said something to this effect: Its too hot today, and my people are not feeling well. The work cannot be done today, so get back tomorrow. When I tried to make him understand that I would not be available for the next three months, he remained indifferent.           
	I am pursuing an MBA, and in the classes on marketing, I am told that the customer is the king. But in West Bengal the picture seems to be quite different. It is an acknowledged truth that Bengalis have learnt to live with the shoddy work culture prevailing all over the state. But now that I have lived outside Bengal, seen different organizations and experienced a different work ethics, I wonder why this lack of professionalism persists in Bengal. Do trade unions, which have only distorted the work culture in the state, give employees the licence to do so? Do government officials realize that it is from the revenue we pay that they get their pay cheques? When will people get their moneys worth from government organizations?           
	Yours faithfully,         Joydeep Mukherjee, Calcutta

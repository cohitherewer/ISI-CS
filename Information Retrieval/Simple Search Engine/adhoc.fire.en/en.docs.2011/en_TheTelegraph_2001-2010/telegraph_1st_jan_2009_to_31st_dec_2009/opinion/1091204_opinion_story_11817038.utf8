                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        REVIVING GLORY                                                    
	There is much in a name, whatever Juliet may say, and changing the name of Presidency College to Presidency University trails promises of great things to come. That is to happen in the future, of course; so far the change in status boded forth by the change in name is still contained in a bill. The bill is yet to be tabled, and its provisions yet to become public knowledge. It is good to think that West Bengal will have a university that will have as its basis an institution once known for its excellence. It is still rich in the tools and materials of learning, as its extraordinary library demonstrates. For those who feel that tradition would be a positive input in the process of turning a college into a university, Presidency has a brilliant tradition of remarkable teachers, students and researchers close to incomparable among undergraduate colleges, and so may be expected to revive that again. There might be magic in its walls.        
	But to unleash that magic much serious work needs to be done. Presidency College has been twice-bound so far  to the West Bengal government and to the University of Calcutta. Not only does it have to abide by the rules and regulations, systems and procedures, syllabi and examinations, that are determined by the university for its affiliate colleges, it also has to play by all the government rules regulating government colleges. As does every other government college affiliated to Calcutta University. In its best years, Presidency College was outstanding in spite of these rules and procedures; in these less noble times, it perhaps needs to be freed of its shackles to return to the heights again.        
	The freeing will not be a simple matter. Changing a label does not work like a magic wand; the toils that bind the college have to be loosened one by one and a new system laid in its place. The details of that system will depend on the vision behind it  and on the funds that will surely be made available. Besides, a university is a very different creature from a college, however remarkable that college might once have been. A modern university  does West Bengal have any?  is a complicated, many-layered institution, demanding highly developed skills of many kinds to just run it, apart from the learning and expertise needed in classrooms to produce the best students and the best research. Presidency as university will have to acquire the human content necessary to be true to its label: it will have to make offers the best cannot refuse. Given the present state of the college, deeply mired as it is in the self-destructive politicking and tyranny of vested interests normal in the rest of West Bengal, all this may seem a tall order. But it can be done. If the chief minister has taken such a bold step  after even autonomy was denied the college  he must also be confident of keeping politics out as the institution is reborn.

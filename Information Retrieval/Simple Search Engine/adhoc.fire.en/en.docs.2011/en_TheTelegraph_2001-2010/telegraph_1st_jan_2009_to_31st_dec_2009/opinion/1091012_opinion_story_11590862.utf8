	President Barack Obama has just promised not to cut the number of American troops in Afghanistan or pull them out entirely as part of the current review of American strategy there, but he has not promised to increase them. Could he privately be having second thoughts about the whole war?The maximum estimate is less than a hundred (al-Qaida members) operating in (Afghanistan), no bases, no ability to launch attacks on us or our allies, said Obamas national security adviser, James Jones, in an interview. In that case, why does the US commander in Afghanistan, General Stanley McChrystal, want another 40,000 troops?        
	The Washington orthodoxy insists that there is essentially no difference between al Qaida, the mostly Arab organization that ordered the 9/11 attacks on the United States of America, and the Taliban, the local Islamist extremists who controlled most of Afghanistan before the US invasion in 2001 and allowed al Qaida to have camps there. If the US pulled out of Afghanistan, al Qaida would be back like a shot.        
	But hang on. For all practical purposes, the Taliban already do control at least a third of Afghanistans territory. Yet, Jones says that there are fewer than a hundred al Qaida operatives in the country. Somalia, Yemen, Iraq, Pakistan and several other countries each have more al Qaida members than that on their territory. They dont seem to be accomplishing much from those countries either. So why is controlling political outcomes in Afghanistan crucial to American security?        
	That question may finally be getting posed by the Obama administration. After the shameless rigging of the recent Afghan election by President Hamid Karzai, the US no longer has a credible partner in Kabul. So the current review of US strategy is taking on a broader focus.                
	First steps        
	This is Obamas last and best opportunity to escape from the futile war he inherited on taking office. In practical terms, how could he go about it without suffering too great a level of political damage domestically? And how can he avoid what happened in Vietnam, where two-thirds of American casualties were incurred during the five-year search for a way to leave without losing face?        
	The first steps are to reject McChrystals demand for more troops, and to make USs displeasure at Karzais theft of the Afghan election public. Rather than being embarrassed by the revelations of Peter Galbraith, the American deputy head of the United Nations mission in Afghanistan, who was fired for protesting against UN complicity in the electoral fraud, the Obama administration should defend him. Indeed, Washington ought to attack the head of the UN mission in Kabul, the Norwegian diplomat, Kai Eide, and UN secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon, for their attempt to suppress the truth. Attacking the UN is always popular in the US, and it would totally wrong-foot the Republicans.        
	Those are just the first steps, of course. The longer-term strategy must focus on dismantling the misleading narrative that is used to justify the war in Afghanistan, and indeed the whole global war on terror. Washington is full of senior intelligence officials and senior military officers, whose careers have not become indissolubly linked to the GWOT, who would be delighted to assist Obama in that task.        
	Meanwhile, start putting together an alliance of non-Pashtun warlords who can make a deal with the Taliban on the division of power in Afghanistan. The Taliban will end up controlling the Pashtun-majority south and east: for most practical purposes, they already do. It doesnt mean that al Qaida gets its training camps back, or becomes any more dangerous to the US than it is now. Go down that road, and with a little luck all the US troops could be out of Afghanistan before Obama has to face the voters again. But first, he has to choose the right road.

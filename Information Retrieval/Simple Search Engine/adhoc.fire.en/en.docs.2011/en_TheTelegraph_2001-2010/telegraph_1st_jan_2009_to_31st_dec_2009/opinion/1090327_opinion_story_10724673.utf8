	Lifes little ironies                  
	Sir  Ratan Tata has made history by launching what is believed to be the worlds cheapest car (Nano and its ghost, March 24). The fanfare with which the arrival of Nano was greeted reveals Indias rising importance on the global map. West Bengal has missed the chance to be a part of history, thanks to the disruptive politics of a few intellectuals, activists and leaders. These people have also earned themselves a place in this illustrious history, albeit as a tiny footnote. In the mean time, the rest of the state can wait for the next chance to catch the bus, hoping that intelligence and constructive thinking will prevail in the future.          
	Yours faithfully,         R. Subhranshu, Chandernagore             
	Sir  Tata Motors has attained yet another milestone by producing one of the most extraordinary cars ever. This is a positive development for the middle class whose dream of owning a car can finally come true. Instead of rival brands fighting a fierce price-war, perhaps for the first time consumers are going to benefit. However, given the appalling condition of Indian roads, the introduction of affordable cars is not going to ease the congestion at all. Nothing short of flying cars can provide relief from traffic snarls. But for such innovations we have to wait a little longer.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Salil Gewali, Shillong 

                
	Sir  Ratan Tata has kept his word by launching the worlds cheapest car for families in the middle-income bracket. People across the world were fascinated by Tatas dream when it was presented for the first time at the ninth annual Auto Expo last year. Many are interested in buying the car, but the only flip side, it seems, is the relatively low mileage. Around 20 km per litre, the cost of running the car may be a bit steep for middle-class households. With time, the Nano, too, should evolve and improve its mileage efficiency to deliver positive results to drivers driving on Indian roads.           
	Yours faithfully,        Ganesh V. Hegde, 
Dharwad, Karnataka             
	Sir  With the reference to the editorial, Bleak picture (March 11), I would like to point out that it took three decades for West Bengal to wake up to the new mantra of industrialization. The Nano project came to the state, struggled to survive, and was forced to move to Gujarat. However, the chief minister of West Bengal continues to stand by his determination to bring industry to the state so that the new generation can benefit from the job opportunities it will create. But the Opposition is equally adamant in insisting on a land map, the return of several acres of land, and revival of defunct factories like Dunlop.           
	In Bengal, the establishment of new industries is done hurriedly, and often imposed without the peoples consent. The government needs to do its homework well before it can introduce such radical changes. I hope the Singur incident would be a lesson for the government for any new venture it undertakes in the future.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Swaralipi Paul, Nadia

                
	Sir  Automobile experts from across the world have voiced serious apprehensions about the introduction of the worlds most affordable family car. India, having a large consumer-base, may be worst hit by its very own Nano. Let alone the steep rise in oil-consumption, the infrastructure here, especially the road-network, is not ready to meet a surge in the number of cars. It is also likely that other manufacturers would follow in Tatas footsteps to bring in economy cars. The Union transport ministry must give serious thought to the challenges posed by such potential increase in vehicles.           
	Yours faithfully,        Madhu Agrawal,
Dariba, Delhi            
	Sir  The Nano may increase business for towing contractors for alleged parking violations. These people get a fixed sum of money per towing, so they often pick up any car convenient to carry away, sometimes without much reason. Since Nano is a small car, it would be easy to take it away. Oddly, vehicles like tempos and buses are often found parked indiscriminately, but are seldom towed away.           
	Yours faithfully,       
M. Kumar, New Delhi

                
	Daily woes          
	Sir  I would like to draw the attention of the authorities to the difficulties faced by daily commuters of Metro Railway at the Shyambazar station. It is one of the busiest stations on the metro route, and a huge number of people access its north entrances. Due to unknown reasons, for a long time only one entrance on the north side of Bhupen Bose Avenue, adjacent to Manindra Chandra College, was kept open. Since late last year, that entrance too has been closed, causing tremendous inconvenience to commuters as the other gate is across the road. This road is always congested, so a lot of time is wasted in crossing it. To add to the woes of the passengers, the escalator providing access to the station has been out of order for a long time, to which the authorities seem to be indifferent. So people are forced to negotiate a busy thoroughfare, and compelled to climb down a static, narrow, metal staircase that was not meant for such use. I request the authorities to reopen the north-side entrances, and repair the escalator at the earliest.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Bimal Bandopadhyay, Calcutta

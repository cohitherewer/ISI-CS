				       MALA FIDE - MALVIKA SINGH                         
	Our South Asian neighbourhood has become so volatile that it has made a complete mockery of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, and the block of nations that could have played a significant role for one another. India, being the Big Brother and therefore, being rather arrogant and dismissive of the smaller nations such as Myanmar, managed to successfully antagonise virtually all the countries and made the alternative, Chinese intervention, smooth and easy. As India wastes time playing predictable, old-time divisive politics, China uses the opportunity to boost its confidence by building world-class highways and by forging other economic partnerships. In a changing world, the Chinese are gaining ground rapidly, and India is seen as a big bad bully that has not built an equal, strong partnership, with mutual respect as the first criterion.        
	This moribund attitude has already become a dangerous reality across all our borders, where a strong and emerging world power like China sits as the crown in the north. Had we evolved a creative, dynamic and non-bureaucratic foreign policy for our region and for West and Southeast Asia, we could well have diluted the influence of China in our part of the world. Our compatible relationship with the West and with the United States of America could have ensured that India became the Asian giant, the Eastern power. But with our holier-than-thou stance and an archaic, almost rigid approach to a changing world, we have lowered our position internationally. What with all the rather unintelligent bickering in Parliament that is seen by all on television, India comes across as a weak and confused State whose self-serving politicians  overwhelmed by their greed and power, lacking in knowledge of critical issues  are not capable of leading Asia.                
	Right person        
	Prime ministers of India in the decades since Independence have been people with integrity and good minds. They have had some colleagues in their various cabinets who have shared that privilege. There have been some bureaucrats of remarkable intellectual stature who gave the necessary sustenance to political decisions. Unfortunately, foreign policy debates in our Parliament have revolved around a strange and limited nationalism verging on jingoism and not around creative, out-of-the-box thinking. Opposition parties seem to react in the opposite way even if the government is right. It comes across to the public as immature politics.         
	Ideally, we should have had a SAARC visa by now much like the Schengen. Instead, we have China fishing in our troubled waters, steadily building its presence in South Asia. Nepal, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, even Myanmar have increased business and dealings with China. India is besieged by this new alien that is beginning to colonize all the spaces on the other side of its long border. We are to blame for this. We have allowed alien interventions. We have been ineffective and careless. Our leadership  collectively, without fighting one another  needs to pull the nations out of this quagmire fast. For South Asia to become an appendage of China or of the US or any other country in this millennium would amount to stupidity and signal a lost opportunity to lift our people out of the morass they have been drowning in for centuries.        
	Helping people combat the growing power of China could be the new foreign secretarys primary agenda, one that could make her a chapter in the history of Indian overseas policy. Having just returned from a successful tenure in China, having understood that country and its leadership well, and having been there at a time when China had been flexing its muscles not only in South Asia but also in Africa, she is best placed to rewrite the SAARC agenda.

Desai                                                        
	In 2003, medical expenditure per head in the United States of America was $5,711  roughly twice that in most west European countries. Americans spent almost a sixth of their income on medical treatment. In other rich countries like France, Germany and Switzerland, the proportion was 10-12 per cent; in most other industrial countries it was seven to eight per cent. And after all that spending, Americans are not healthier; health indicators for many countries, including Scandinavia and Japan, are much better. Why does the US do worse than its peers?        
	This question was answered by Alan Garber and Jonathan Skinner in a recent National Bureau of Economic Research paper. They showed that amongst comparable countries, the US had the highest proportion of old people who did not take treatment they should because they found it too expensive. Its physicians were also least likely to use electronic records, which pool information about patients and make it available to all physicians who treat them. And administrative costs in the US were amongst the highest.        
	But these were not the chief causes of Americans health backwardness. They did not have a particularly high number of physicians or hospital beds per head; nor did they consume more prescription drugs. But they consumed more intensive and expensive treatments; the number of magnetic resonance imaging machines per head of population, for example, was five times as high in the US as in most other rich countries. Garber and Skinner thought that the greatest scope lay in improving allocative efficiency  on spending less on some treatments and more on others. On which ones, they were less specific.              
	Garber and Skinners approach was to analyse as broad a collection of national statistics as possible. Atul Gawande, an American surgeon, adopted a more micro approach. In the US, Miami spends the most per person on healthcare. That is understandable; that is where old people settle down when they get rich. They have all the ailments of the aged, and they have the most money and the most expensive health insurance, so it is no wonder that they have the most spent on their health. The next most expensive health-care market after Miami is a little county in Texas named McAllen. It is not particularly rich; the per capita income there is $12,000. But Medicare, the American government health insurer, paid $15,000 per insured person in a year in McAllen. Gawande went down to McAllen and asked people down there why so much was spent on medical treatment.        
	The most common answer was that people in McAllen were poor and sick. That was not entirely untrue. The proportion of drunkards in McAllen was 60 per cent above the national average, and 38 per cent of McAllenians were fat. Still, they had less cardiovascular disease, less asthma, less cancer, less injury and infant mortality than the national average. More sickness was not the answer; more was being spent to tackle a unit of sickness.        
	Gawande then asked if the answer lay in better healthcare. Medicare gives grades to hospitals according to their quality. The grades were no better for McAllen than for a neighbouring county. He was told that patients sued doctors and hospitals more in McAllen; to protect themselves, doctors ordered expensive tests. But that too was not true. Texas had passed a law that capped awards in lawsuits at a quarter of a million dollars; after that, litigation had died down.        
	So Gawande too came down to the explanation that Garner and Skinner had given for the US  overtreatment. He called Jonathan Skinner and asked him to analyse the data for McAllen. Skinner got the same answer as he had for the country  that patients in McAllen were subject to more tests, more hospitalization, more surgery and more home care. And the overtreatment did not mean better treatment. Americas best hospital is Mayo Clinic; it is at the forefront of treatment technology. It is the primary hospital of Rochester, Minnesota; and Medicare spending per member in Rochester is in the lowest 15 per cent in the US. Gawande recalled another study by Elliott Fisher of a million old people who had colon or rectal cancer, a hip fracture or a heart attack. Patients in some regions received 60 per cent more medical care; but they did not survive longer, function better or show more satisfaction. A major difference between low-cost and high-cost areas was that high-cost areas got less of low-cost preventive services such as vaccines, and faced longer waits for doctors and to be admitted to emergency rooms.        
	Why, then, did doctors in McAllen order more tests and refer patients to more specialists? The answer was suggested by the administrator of a hospital; he told Gawande to find out what proportion of the doctors income came from their own practice; in McAllen, it would be low. A high proportion would come from kickbacks for referrals.        
	Why, then, does it not happen in Mayo Clinic? Two things distinguish it from comparable institutions in McAllen. Its doctors and specialists get a salary, and nothing else. They do not price their personal services, and therefore have no scope for maximizing their income. And they routinely see patients together, discuss them, and work out the best treatment for each; they are full-time professionals used to working together.        
	That is not the only way. Gawande mentions Grand Junction, Colorado, where doctors are paid on piecework by insurance companies. But they met together and decided on a common fee structure that they would charge everyone; and they agreed to meet periodically in peer-review committees to review patients records. And they joined a local community electronic-record system that brought their patient notes together. They thus maximized the information to which they had access in treating any patient.              
	Reflecting on his experiences, Gawande considered alternative models of healthcare. An economist would argue for a free market; the patient should be allowed to buy healthcare services, with a neutral State subsidy if necessary. That would not work because there is enormous product differentiation in healthcare and the patient cannot have information on it; often, he would need quick treatment and would not have time to weigh information and make a choice. Socialists would ask for nationalization. Those who disagree would point to the dismal state of Indian government hospitals.        
	Gawande points out, rightly, that good medical treatment requires management; it requires the bringing together and coordination of specialists and facilities. So there must be someone in charge; and he must have medical knowledge. The answer lies in doctors cooperatives. Doctors are needed to provide the expertise that must go into the patients decision. They must work together to provide the expertise needed to make an informed decision. And they must be driven, not by individual profit maximization, but by their cooperatives performance and reputation.        
	This is only a tentative answer; Gawande himself does not think it is a complete answer. He calls for managerial experimentation, beginning from the chiefly negative lessons that have hitherto been learnt. Should we wait for the Americans to experiment, so that we can learn from them a few decades from now? Why do we not do some experimenting of our own?

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Pick and choose your future
                                                                                                                 PICK AND CHOOSE YOUR FUTURE                                  Like khadi boutiques selling curtains and lampshades along with shirts and skirts, schools now offer many boards                                             
	The almost simple process where a child, after finishing school, would acquire a college education seems to have become longer. Interventions have crept into this system at a number of stages right from the beginning. Before admitting a child to school, some factors are given serious thought. The choice of school, and the board that it is affiliated to, among other things, seem to be deciding factors that invariably tie up with questions about the future of the child, who must be educated at a place that is not just a school.        
	While such concerns do seem justified, they also get implicated in a market-driven education sector. Schools promote themselves on the basis that they have world-class facilities  state-of-the-art laboratories, multi-media teaching technology, a well-equipped playroom, a cool canteen.... Along with this, the syllabus of the board that the school is affiliated to is meant to help the children pursue their dreams. With the state boards seen as archaic and in desperate need of revision, private institutions play up quality. To be educated at a private school means better standards of learning and facilities comparable to institutions abroad that secure the childs future.        
	Therefore, when Kapil Sibal says he wishes to introduce a uniform board for higher secondary education, he will have to contend with quite a few problems. True, services provided by the government are taken with a pinch of salt, and considered to be options for only those who cannot afford private sector services (be it healthcare or education). To persuade those with disposable incomes, who wish to get their children into a school with the best facilities, to accept a uniform board should be quite a challenge. To say nothing of modifying the board to cater to a particular demand of the curriculum that includes preparing children for joint entrance exams, and even higher studies abroad.        
	The entire linking of education with industry begins as early as this. Parents must decide as early as the admission stage which stream has a future, in other words, is more lucrative, career-wise. Curriculum and syllabus, greatly dependent on the board, become important pre-requisites for the kind of education a child wishes to acquire in the future.        
	For this is another set of trends among private schools now. While some have integrated their higher secondary syllabi with that of the IIT/JEE and MBBS entrance exams, other schools run multiple boards at the same time  Indian School Certificate Examinations, the Oxford University supported International Baccalaureate Organisation diploma, Cambridge-affiliated International General Certificate of Secondary Education (or A-levels) and so on. All for those who can afford the fees, of course.        
	The niche consumer of this kind of an education must also be considered  the upwardly mobile upper-middle-class family unit, living in townships with their own separate clubs and swimming pools, schools and hospitals. Now this is admittedly quite a narrow customer-base, and schools catering to such segments follow the same method of selling as those used for any other product with similar target consumers  they diversify. So while a khadi boutique may make curtains, bedcovers, lamp shades, even crockery, apart from the normal fare of skirts and shirts it may sell, a school may offer the choice of multiple boards to students. This is an attempt to keep most of the people belonging to a particular socio-economic class on board, making schools a kind of supermarket. One enters it, picks and chooses, mixes and matches, and helps oneself to a certification in school education of ones own choice.              
	Sibals proposition of introducing a uniform board has already met with disapproval by some of the state boards. Maharashtra is not in favour of the system that Sibal proposes because this uniform board will mean an erasure of the state-specific, culture-specific details that the syllabus now includes. Rajasthan claims that its board is already the best in the country, so it doesnt need to be a part of any standardized system of education.        
	With Sibal now confined to making changes only to the Central Board of Secondary Education, over which his ministry has some control, his method of integrating these differences in his proposal, when he presents it afresh, will need some thought. For now, he seems to have shelved it. But when he does start, he will have to first think of ways to devise a system that incorporates all the individual board preferences. Next, he will have to ensure that this new system does not fall into the trappings of a government service, for which so many have so much contempt. At the same time, the new system should not be driven too much by technology and technical education, for that may throw off a large section of semi-urban and rural children not used to computers. And finally, Sibal must ensure that the needs of the dreamy-eyed kids who peer from billboards advertising private schools are kept in mind together with those of the children who sleep under them.                    INSIYA POONAWALA

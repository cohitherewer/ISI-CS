	It is not the strongest of the species that survive, nor the most intelligent, but the most responsive to change.        
	 Charles Darwin, On the Origin of the Species              
	To begin with a few facts and a little history. Google, the worlds largest search engine, had announced in 2002 that it intends to organize the worlds information and make it universally accessible and useful. What it meant was that it would digitize all the books in the world, allow them to be reachable online, and thus make them accessible everywhere. Google knew, as did Amazon, Microsoft, Yahoo, and several other major libraries, that a great deal of future information would be digitized. So the sooner they got into the act, the better.        
	Hence, in theory at least, rare books, copies of which were available only in a handful of libraries, were now accessible everywhere in the world  and for free. Google spread its net wider to digitize copyright books, that is, those still within 50 years of their authors demise.         
	But, because of the opacity of copyright law and extension of protections mandated by the 1998 Act, it is not always clear which works are protected. Also, copyright status can be murky when authors die or publishing houses go out of business. Rules of copyright are so ambiguous and the courts so slow that the judicial system serves largely to implement the law of the jungle. However, Googles forays into copyright territory was a clear infringement of copyright law; and so, authors and publishers would not permit it because it cut into their earnings.        
	Google realized the implications of using copyright material and therefore provided only snippets of the content on condition that the information would be used for non-commercial purposes only. Since this condition is impossible to implement, copyright holders and Google went into protracted discussions on how much copyright material could be provided on the internet and at what price. A settlement has now been reached under which Google has agreed to provide a book registry, to which copyright holders of books could register and receive an agreed settlement for each book that has been digitized.         
	There is still some confusion about copyright holders who have not been registered  whether Google would hold the rights (in case the authors have died or just disappeared along with the publishers) or would they revert to the next-of-kin.        
	When there are an estimated 175,000 books (new and reprints) every year, how this exercise can be effectively done is open to question. Also, how much copyright material can be posted on the internet and whether the author would be adequately compensated? Would readers who are already overloaded with information benefit from this information overkill? Google has argued that the internet is custom-built for marketing of books and since brows[ing] leads to buy[ing], increased sales would ultimately benefit the author through larger royalties and other spin-offs.        
	Google is dead right on one point: more and more information would be digitized in the future, and the sooner users adapt to the digital age the better. Libraries have realized this and so have researchers  their papers are full of references that are to be found on the internet. There is also rising awareness among readers that elementary computer literacy is required to get on in the world. Old-time publishers and authors have little choice but to play by the new digital rules.        
	But the important question is how much information would Google be permitted to provide by copyright holders and how much of it would be reliable? Would users need to cross-check the information because there are already complaints that some of the facts provided have turned out to be inaccurate? As Marshall McLuhan, pointed out in the 1960s, the media are not just passive channels of information  they supply the stuff of thought, but they also shape the process of thought. What digitized information is doing is chipping away at our capacity for concentration by providing just too much information. So, use Google with care and always double-check the facts from the standard reference books.

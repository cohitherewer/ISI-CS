	Creatures that crawl and bite                  
	Sir  Do you know that more than 50,000 people die due to snakebite in India every year? The website, www.50000snake.webs.com, has been set up to provide information on this subject. Urban people do not care much about this problem since most of these deaths occur in rural areas. The deaths are mainly caused by the ignorance of doctors regarding the correct methods of administering the anti venom serum. The health ministry needs to organize campaigns to teach doctors the right ways of treating victims of snake bite.           
	Yours faithfully,        Dayal Bandhu Majumdar, Calcutta
        
	Great expectations          
	Sir  It is unfortunate that a postgraduate student of Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, killed himself after failing to get a job offer during an on-campus interview (IIT suicide for a job Jan 4). Ganga Pattanam Suman must have been depressed indeed if he decided to end his life like this. One cannot be very optimistic about the future of the boys and girls who decide to study engineering if the student of a premier institute like IIT Kanpur had to commit suicide after being unable to get himself hired by recruiters. The death of Suman brings into question the standards followed by the companies that conduct campus interviews. The methods for selecting candidates should be transparent. But the entire process, as it stands now, is quite confounding and arbitrary. A thorough probe needs to be conducted into this incident if more deaths of bright, young students are to be avoided.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Salil Kumar Kar, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The human resource development ministry should rethink its decision to create more top-class universities after the death of Ganga Pattanam Suman. Students of foremost academic institutions like IIT naturally have high hopes about the job market, which, however, has narrowed down considerably in recent times as a result of the economic downturn. Since the financial crisis is likely to persist for at least a decade, more students like Suman would be disappointed if they hope to get plum jobs on the basis of their academic career in leading institutes. Keeping this reality in mind, the HRD ministry should set up more ordinary colleges and introduce self-employment schemes, which would equip students to deal with a recessionary job market. The students passing out from regular colleges are likely to have moderate expectations regarding their future and can take up jobs even at lower levels.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

                          
	Wasteland          
	Sir  A stretch of road to the north of Bidhan Sishu Udyan had been carved out for morning walkers about a decade ago, courtesy ex-mayor, Prasanta Chatterjee. It is impossible to walk in this area now as it has become covered with garbage and other kinds of waste. Only rag pickers frequent the place today. While environmentalists are protesting loudly against various issues such as the disappearance of migratory birds from the city, pollution caused by high-decibel loudspeakers and that by two-stroke autorickshaws, they do not seem to notice how the Calcutta Municipal Corporation neglects its basic duty of keeping the roads clean. Yet, that is essential for public hygiene. The place to the east of this tract of land also became littered when construction work for the flyover on the E.M. Bypass started. We, the people of this locality, have repeatedly informed the CMC and the local councillor about the problem, but to no avail. As a result, we are feeling helpless and suffocated.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Asit K. Bhattacharya, Calcutta

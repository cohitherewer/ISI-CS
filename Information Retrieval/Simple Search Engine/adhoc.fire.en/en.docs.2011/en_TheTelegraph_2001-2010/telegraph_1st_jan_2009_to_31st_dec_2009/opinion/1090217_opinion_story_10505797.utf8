                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Green brigade                  
	Sir  The unlawful damage to the greenery of the Brigade Parade Grounds, the pride of Calcutta, is shocking (Left Front rallyists flout court norms set to protect the greens, Feb 9). Environmentalists have raised their voices in protest when the Maidan was being used as the venue of the book fair, and the fair was subsequently moved elsewhere. But unfortunately, the ground still continues to be used for political meetings. During the Left Front rally on February 8, several hundred buses and trucks were parked on the Maidan, and supporters of the party cooked meals on stoves set up there. It is a pity that activists cannot take necessary steps to stop the desecration of the Maidan  they can only try and make the people aware.          
	The supporters set up chullahs on the Maidan for cooking their afternoon meals. Some of them also used stoves and LPG cylinders. It seems that rallies in the Brigade are more like picnics than political gatherings. People attending them deliberately violate court orders. They spare no thought for the Victoria Memorial nearby that gets affected by the smoke. After the Sunday rally, the green grass on the Maidan was covered with ash. The fire, the smoke, and the wastes left after cooking must have effectively killed the budding green grass. If our political leaders are callous about the high court directive, it is up to us to make the masses conscious about the harmful effects of the cooking parties on the Brigade Parade Grounds.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  It is strange that in West Bengal, court orders are not honoured but violated or breached. It is even more strange that the violator is often the state government itself. We all know how the Maidan greens were tarnished on Sunday, February 8. The chairman of the Left Front, Biman Bose, had not himself violated the high court order banning chullahs within 3 kilometres of Victoria Memorial and disallowing parking of vehicles on the Maidan. But his men did the mischief, for which the state secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) is as much liable as the actual wrongdoers. The relation between the CPI(M) state secretary and the party supporters is quite akin to that between a master and a servant. The master makes trouble through his servants. As such, the master has to answer for the various misdeeds committed by his henchmen. The Calcutta High Court can see clearly how its orders are being flouted time and again. It should step in and take stern action against the offenders.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Salil Kr. Kar, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The Calcutta High Court has issued a contempt notice to the Democratic Youth Federation of India for violating its orders to preserve the Maidan while holding a rally there in December 2008 (Contempt notice slapped on DYFI over Maidan rally, Feb 10). But what is the use of slapping contempt notices on political parties and leaders when they virtually have no effect? Politicians of West Bengal, especially those belonging to the ruling party, know very well that thanks to over three decades of Left rule here, no court can touch them. The courts can at most rebuke them or impose a fine. It is because of this devil-may-care attitude that rallies, meetings and demonstrations defying court orders have become childs play for the leaders. Contempt notices have been served several times by the court against the CPI(M) and its affiliate wings. But the leaders are not bothered. They have long given up their sense of duty or respect, and that too in the name of the people. But is not the jeopardizing of public life by withdrawing all vehicles and blocking roads a violation of the citizens right to free movement? If the party is to hold a rally which will bring life to a standstill, it should first seek permission from the people. But then, disturbing normal life is perhaps no more an offence for the party than the destruction of the Maidan greens.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  I would like to thank The Telegraph for campaigning with such dedication against pollution. The articles on pollution published by the newspaper create awareness among the people. I would request the publication to continue its commendable efforts unless the government implements the ban on smoke-belching vehicles or stops holding meetings on the Maidan. Since our irresponsible politicians will always serve their own interests, and never those of the public, the media must act as the peoples mouthpiece.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot           
	Sir  On January 27, I went to the taxi stand near Garia railway station at 5.30 in the morning with the intention of hiring a taxi to the Garia bus stand. The driver of the first taxi (WB 19B 0828) in the queue refused to use the meter, and instead asked for Rs 120 as the fare. When he was asked the reasons for making such a stipulation, he reasoned that 5-30 a.m is night-time, when meter-reading does not determine the fare. Taxis will run on meter only after 8 a.m, he said. Other taxi-drivers in the queue all supported this claim. When I demanded that they show me such a rule, if it exists at all on paper, they said that the relevant notice can be found in the office, which was closed then.           
	I called the taxi-refusal cell at Lalbazar. The person who answered the call refused to record the complaint because, he said, Garia station does not fall within the jurisdiction of Calcutta Police. He suggested that I call the local police station, which is Sonarpur, and gave me the phone number. But when I contacted the Sonarpur police station, I was told that a complaint about taxi-refusal cannot be made over the phone since it is mandatory that the complainant be present in person.           
	After much debate, I discovered that one can lodge complaints over the phone only in areas under the Calcutta Police. Those living in the outskirts have to go to the police stations to register their grievances against taxis. I find it difficult to understand why, in this age of telecommunication, personal presence is necessary to record a complaint when identity can easily be established using the voter card, bank account number or passport number. After spending so much time and effort, I was still unable to lodge a taxi-refusal complaint. Such is the condition that prevails in the heaven we call West Bengal.                     
	Yours faithfully,

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | As the light fades
                                                                                                                 AS THE LIGHT FADES                                                                  
	Twilight By Azhar Abidi, Viking, Rs 399        
	Azhar Abidis novel begins on an evening and ends on a new day, thereby making a journey from dusk to dawn. When the day ends, the story of the characters, spread across Pakistan and Australia, begins. The tale is set in motion by the wedding reception of the son of the protagonist, Bilqis, and it ends with her death. It is a story meandering from a region of happiness to a vale of sorrow. But the novel is not cynical or melancholy. It is a story of love and fidelity that cross race, religion and even geographical boundaries.         
	This is Abidis second book, and he seems to be fast learning the secrets of the art of writing. His first novel, Passarola Rising, about adventures in a 17th century flying ship, had already created a stir. Twilight is written in a style, which, if carried forward with consistency by the novelist, may bring him laurels from critics as well as readers. Abidi was born in Pakistan, studied in England, and now lives and writes in Melbourne.         
	The novel revolves around a middle-aged lady called Bilqis Ara Begum  a Pakistani aristocrat for whom tradition is more important than other human relations. She struggles in her own way to stick to the old-fashioned values of life. But Twilight is not a straightforward account of her life. We come to know about her past  her married life, her husband, her childhood days spent in Calcutta before the Partition  from different layers of the narrative. The drama of the conflict between the characters is unfolded in an apparently simple style. Behind the faade of straightforward narration lies the expertise of the artist. The simplicity of style is misleading in so far as it conceals the artfulness of the author.         
	The novel is about the clash of ideas between the old and the new world, the previous and the current generations that refuse to understand each other. Bilqis cannot accept the fact that her son, Samad, has chosen an Australian girl as his life-partner just as she cannot understand the relationship that develops between her servant girl and a Kashmiri freedom-fighter who ultimately dies a violent death. She sends her son to study in a foreign country but cannot admit that it is possible for a young man to fall in love with someone from a different culture. Bilqis wants her only son to marry a Pakistani girl who would carry forward the family traditions. Similarly, she wants her maid to marry anyone but the stranger for whom the girl had broken the impregnable fortress of custom her mistress had built around her.         
	The relationships of Samad and the maid that go against Biqiss beliefs are the focal points of the novel. Bilqis is against both, and yet she neither condemns nor goes out of her way to stop them. She silently opposes them while knowing fully well that no one will listen to her in a world that is fast rejecting the values she lives by. So she arranges the wedding reception of her son, visits him and his wife in Australia, and starts adoring her only granddaughter even as she quietly acquiesces to the maids unexpected behaviour. She accepts the inevitable, but not without a touch of sadness. When she dies, every soul in the household feels her absence. Samad, who did not have time for her, becomes heartbroken. Even Tara, the granddaughter, sees her in a flash of a waking dream.         
	Twilight is a novel about human relationships written in a language that is as transparent and quiet as the fading light of the day. It is a slim book with an expansive theme that will be remembered long after one has finished reading it.

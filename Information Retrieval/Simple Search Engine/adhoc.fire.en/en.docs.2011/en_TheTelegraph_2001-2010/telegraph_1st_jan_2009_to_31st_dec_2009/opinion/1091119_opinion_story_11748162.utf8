	Sir  S.L. Raos article, Parochial passions (Nov 16), addresses the symptoms of a problem rather than the problem itself. Parochialism exists in India because states were formed along linguistic lines. Singling out a Bal Thackeray or a Raj Thackeray for punishment is unlikely to yield a solution. Such a step will push them further into the limelight. It is apparent that the Thackerays have a sizeable following because the local population believe that large-scale migration from other states has resulted in the marginalization of Marathis. This particular problem has two sides to it. First, people migrate to other states in search of a better life. Second, the local population is bound to feel threatened as they fear that the migrants may limit their own chances of leading a better life.           
	States that witness large-scale emigration should work towards improving opportunities for the local people, instead of crying foul when their own people get assaulted in other cities. Moreover, fluency in the local language does not necessarily lead to the integration of the migrants with the local population. In most cases, migrants are looked upon as people who usually reside in a place only to leave it when a better opportunity presents itself elsewhere.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The reorganization of states along linguistic lines received a major fillip when Potti Sriramulu died in a hunger strike demanding the creation of a united Andhra for Telugu-speakers. Finally, Andhra was merged with the Telengana region to form the state of Andhra Pradesh.          
	However, carving out states on linguistic lines has disadvantages as well as advantages. There have been protests in Mumbai and Bangalore over the issue of marginalization of locals. The government should consider bringing metropolises under Central administration to free them of the pulls and pressures of regional politics. This may be particularly useful in Bangalores case as the city is a hub for industrial and defence institutions.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Darker side          
	Sir  Celebrities should be mature enough to understand that the possibility of being stared at when their cars are stuck at traffic signals is an occupational hazard that they have to put up with (Cars and celebrities lose dark cover, Nov 15). They cannot expect the authorities to make an exception to the existing rules in their case and allow them to use tinted glasses on their car windows. If a lawyers car can be used by his driver for an act as heinous as robbing a girl, there is every possibility that a celebritys car may also be used for similar other crimes. Stars may be special, but they too must be governed by rules and regulations.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  At a time when the threat of terrorism looms large over India, the Calcutta Police have rightly decided to prosecute the owners of vehicles with opaque films on their windows. One wonders why the owners of such cars were not punished earlier under the Section 100 (II) of the Motor Vehicles rules. This rule is being implemented only after a law student, Chandrima Gupta, was robbed inside a car that had tinted glasses. The police should make no exceptions, and penalize errant vehicle-owners even if they happen to be famous personalities.           
	Yours faithfully,       
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

      
	Sir  I came across a public notice issued by the Calcutta Police regarding the use of dark glasses on car windows. Any rule that ensures the safety of the citizens is welcome. But the police have woken up to the issue rather late. They only swung into action after a girl was assaulted and robbed in one such vehicle. The police should also ensure that cars keep a dim light on at night, so that the inside of the four-wheeler is visible from outside.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Subhayu Saha, Murshidabad

                
	Parting shot          
	Sir  There seems to have been a change in the peoples mandate in the recent elections that were held in West Bengal. However, things are never going to change for the better if the political leaders resort to bandhs, hartals and road blockades in order to protest against a particular decision (Resurgence? Sorry, its stuck in rally raj, Nov 10). Politicians in India are yet to accomplish the tasks of truly representing the common people and acting in their interest. We can hope for a resurgent Bengal only when politicians, cutting across political lines, give up their disruptive agendas.                    
	Yours faithfully,

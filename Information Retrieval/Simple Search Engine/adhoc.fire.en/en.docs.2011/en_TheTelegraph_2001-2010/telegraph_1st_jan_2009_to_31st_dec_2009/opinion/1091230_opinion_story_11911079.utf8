	Just not enough                  
	Sir  The media are abuzz with news of justice granted to Ruchika Girhotra (For molester police boss, 6 months, Dec 22). The young girl committed suicide after she was molested by the former chief of Haryana police, S.P.S. Rathore. Rathore, the then inspector-general, was subsequently promoted to the post of director-general of police by the reigning Haryana chief minister, Om Prakash Chautala. Chautala was undoubtedly aware of Rathores crime. Rathore, on his part, pressed false charges of car theft against the victims brother in order to put pressure on Ruchikas family to withdraw the case against him.          
	The justice meted out to Ruchika is a matter of shame: her molester was sentenced to a mere six months in prison. The accused has also been granted bail till a higher court heard the appeal that he is supposedly filing. The light sentence for Rathore reminds us of the Jessica Lal murder case in which the offender, Manu Sharma, was initially let off the hook only because he was the son of a politician. This particular case reveals, once again, the nexus between the police and the political class. Both sections brazenly protect one another from being punished for heinous crimes, unless a nation-wide protest is launched. On some occasions, such protests fail in their objectives as well.          
	There have been numerous instances in which the guilty have evaded justice because of their powerful position. In our country, it is evident that only the poor and the defenceless are given harsher sentences as the law of the land seems to be different for people belonging to different social backgrounds. If the maximum imprisonment for molestation is two years, then why should a person like Rathore not pay the maximum penalty? Is this what the people of India should expect from those who have solemnly taken up the responsibility of being their leaders as well as their protectors?          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The report, Ruchika kin want Sonia to intervene (Dec 26), is worrying because it brings to the foreground the alarming law and order situation in India. The complete breakdown of law-and-order and the fact that politicians and bureaucrats are holding the country to ransom have added to the plight of the common man. If India wants to progress and attain some sort of a social equilibrium, it must arrest the induction of corrupt politicians and bureaucrats into the system who, in turn, are a drain on the tax payers resources. Most politicians either do not possess the requisite experience and knowledge to provide leadership or are way too corrupt to be of any help. They are the parasites that we need to eradicate.          
	Ever since the Janata Party rule in 1977, which opened the floodgates for such aya-rams and gaya-rams, Indians have seen a systematic collapse of the checks and balances that are vital to a democratic set-up. Add to that the family-run political parties, which shamelessly sell their narrow and divisive plans camouflaged as social packages for the poor, and we have a situation that is frightening and bizarre. It is only a matter of time before the entire country begins to be governed by the Chautalas, Sorens, Thackerays and Rathores. Manmohan Singh could well be remembered as the last of the honest Indian prime ministers, unless his government undertakes measures to punish corrupt officials so that they are unable to threaten the dream of a clean and civilized India.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The media deserve to be praised for spearheading the campaign to grant justice for Ruchika Girhotra. Be it Delhis Jessica Lal, or Haryanas Ruchika, the media are solely responsible for not only mobilizing public opinion but also forcing the government to reopen old cases. Only recently, Manu Sharma, who has been sentenced to life for murdering Jessica Lal, was sent back to jail after the media showed Sharma partying at a night club, even though he had been given parole so that he could be by his ailing mothers side.          
	The media have done a commendable job in the case involving S.P.S. Rathore. The Central government must now open other similar cases and have them investigated by a special cell of the Central Bureau of Investigation. A free press is of critical importance to a democracy, and, in this instance, it deserves to be praised for a job well done.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Arun Hajra, Calcutta

                
	Sir  One wonders what makes high-ranking police officials aspire for positions that fall outside the ambit of their core responsibilities. On many occasions, these men have also ended up courting controversies in their new roles. K.P.S. Gill headed the Indian Hockey Federation, but the sport touched its nadir during Gills stint as the president of IHF. Prasun Mukherjee, the former police commissioner of Calcutta who had contested the elections to the Cricket Association of Bengal, got embroiled in the infamous Rizwanur Rehman case. Now we have S.P.S. Rathore who molested and abetted the suicide of a budding tennis player, Ruchika Girhotra, while in charge of the Haryana Lawn Tennis Association. It is high time the government of India took steps to prevent police personnel from holding offices in sporting associations or other organizations.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Chameli Pal, Batanagar

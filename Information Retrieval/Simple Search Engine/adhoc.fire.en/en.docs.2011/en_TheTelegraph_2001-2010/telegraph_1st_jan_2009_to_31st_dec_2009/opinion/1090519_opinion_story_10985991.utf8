The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | In disarray
                                                                                                                 IN DISARRAY                                                    
	United, they may not always stand; but divided, they must fall. That sums up the defeat of the Congress and its partners in the United Progressive Alliance in Jharkhand. Such was the division among the UPAs allies in the state that its poor showing in the polls was a foregone conclusion. Sharing of seats among the allies was the least of their problems. Whatever little had held them together for the past one year snapped even before the polls were announced. Lalu Prasads misplaced ambition and Shibu Sorens brand of identity politics were out of step with the Congresss agenda for the state. Little wonder then that the Congresss tally dropped to one from six in 2004 and that of its ally, the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, fell from four to two. The result is the spectacular success of the Bharatiya Janata Party. In spite of problems within its own house that saw several of its leaders leaving the party, the BJP stunned the UPA by capturing as many as eight seats in the state. In 2004, the BJP was out in the cold, losing all the seats it had contested. This time, it is primarily a case of the party scoring by default.        
	However, the division in the UPAs ranks explains its loss only partially. Its defeat clearly had much to do with the poor record of its government in the state. Allegations of corruption against several of its ministers showed the government in a poor light long before the elections. Jharkhand is among the poorest states in the country, with the lowest per capita income. And it has long been plagued by a Maoist insurgency that aims at exploiting the states poverty in order to further its cause. The government routinely swears by a two-pronged strategy to deal with the threat  by launching well-planned security offensives against the rebels and by pushing for development projects. But an inept administration can do little on either of the two fronts. The states politicians have been too busy forming and breaking governments to devote time to the development agenda. The irony is that Jharkhand remains steeped in poverty in spite of having an abundance of mineral and other natural resources. But the Maoist rebellion and the lack of governance together have made the state an entrepreneurs nightmare. The election results have come as a rude shock to the Congress. Things can be even worse for it in the state assembly polls unless the government mends its ways.

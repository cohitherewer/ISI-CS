The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | excellence alone
                                                                                                                 EXCELLENCE ALONE                                                          
	Academic degrees, like works of art, tend to lose their aura in the age of mechanical reproduction. Higher education is a pyramid, where the ascent is a scaling up as well as a scaling down. It gets more difficult, specialized and meritocratic higher up, while the numbers decrease proportionately. If doctoral research is somewhere near the top of this structure, then it is reassuring to see that the University Grants Commission is tightening up its quality control of PhDs. MPhils and PhDs through distance learning have been banned, and the stricter guidelines drawn up last year are now being enforced with renewed urgency. This follows the radical improvement in academic payscales, and the Centres no-free-lunches approach is entirely justified in this case.        
	The question of quality must remain at the core of this ethic. Higher education, from the base to the summit of the pyramid, must keep excellence as its absolute priority. This is what the UGC must never lose sight of. It is only too easy for such a body to fall in with a lopsided notion of democracy in higher education that puts a premium on numbers and accessibility. It is wrong to assume that the more MAs, MPhils and PhDs universities churn out, the better the system gets. In purely academic terms, nothing could be more misguided and harmful. Research is meant for people who can do it well  and there can be no, more functional, alternative to this. It is populism of a mindless and pernicious kind that condemns such an attitude as elitist. At every stage, there should be recognized professional alternatives to academic degrees for those who need to acquire qualifications but are not suited for research-based degrees. This is the only way to make sure that excellence is not sacrificed to functionalism.        
	A university or research institute should be able to strike the right balance between structure and freedom when it comes to designing PhD requirements and standards. In this, not only the presentation of the final thesis, but also the candidates relationship with the supervisor  what the latter is, and is not, supposed to do for the former  needs to be thought through and adapted to specific subjects. Checks against delay and non-completion should be made firmer, making candidates more accountable. Course-work requirements, in preparation for the thesis, should also be considered carefully. (British and American universities tend to differ interestingly on this issue.) It is also important, and fair, that stricter guidelines and standards should be accompanied by improvements in, and regular monitoring of, library facilities (cataloguing and updated acquisitions) and infrastructure (computers, photocopying).        
	Research is most often a solitary activity. But it needs resources and a congenial environment, and its fruits are not just for the good of the researcher. On both counts, the question of standards is paramount.

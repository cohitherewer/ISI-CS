                                                                                                                 DRESS REHEARSAL                                                    
	The Thirumangalam by-election in Tamil Nadu was a semi-final of sorts for the contending political parties before the general elections, somewhat like the assembly polls in the four states in the North. Given the timing of the by-election, victory tastes sweeter for the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam than it would have in normal times. The 40,000-vote lead of its candidate, Latha Athiyaman, over the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam candidate, M. Muthuramalingam, would seem to rubbish the AIADMKs contention that the DMK regime is under serious threat from a resurgent J. Jayalalithaa. The AIADMK diva, despite her late start in the poll fray, is causing the DMK much disturbance recently  from wooing away the Left from the DMK-headed Democratic Progressive Alliance to exposing the current regimes failures in flood control and the energy situation in the state. The DMK may wish to deny it, but the party continues to view Ms Jayalalithaa with consternation. This was evident from the extent to which the DMK went in its poll preparations. In a replay of the great Indian family drama, the Karunanidhis patched up with the Marans and pandered to the ego of M.K. Azhagiri (the eldest son of M. Karunanidhi with clout in the region) to have him lead the election campaign in Thirumangalam, and then went out of their way to declare pre-Pongal sops.         
	The results of these efforts are bound to last beyond Thirumangalam. Both the Congress and the Pattali Makkal Katchi (that had been spurning the DMKs advances to get back on the DPA bandwagon) may now find the DMK an irresistible ally. But the questions Thirumangalam has raised may last too. There are already allegations against the DMK from the AIADMK as also the smaller parties for the use of money and muscle power. The Election Commission had asked for the booking of M.K. Stalin on these charges during the elections, and is now investigating some poll officers for dereliction of duty. Apart from the discreet measures employed by incumbent governments to influence the vote, there are the more obvious ones as well  the doling out of sops, for example, announced at such times as to evade action from the EC. Both the AIADMK and the DMK have relied on these short-term methods to see them to power. But it is high time that such deliberate attempts to undermine democratic choice were stopped.

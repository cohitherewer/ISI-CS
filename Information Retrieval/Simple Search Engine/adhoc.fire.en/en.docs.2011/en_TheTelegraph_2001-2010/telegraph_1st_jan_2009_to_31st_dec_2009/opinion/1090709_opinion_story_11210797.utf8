                                                                                                                 ALL THE UNTOLD STORIES                                   Neha Sahay                              
	The Xinjiang riots are officially being described as the worst since 1949, with 156 dead  including one policeman  and over 1,000 injured. This time, both the official and the international media have been allowed to enter Urumqi, the capital, where the violence began on Sunday night. Contrast this with the black-out on the riots in Lhasa last year, that had resulted in the international media presenting a totally pro-Tibetan picture of the violence, leading to worldwide criticism of the Chinese government.        
	The Urumqi violence began with the minority Muslim Uigurs, the original inhabitants of Xinjiang, going on a rampage against the majority Hans. Allowing the media to report this serves the government, which has long alleged that an al Qaida-affiliated splittist terrorist group exists in Xinjiang, supported by exiled Uigurs like Rebiya Kadeer.        
	The official media are full of interviews of victims as well as of ordinary residents of Urumqi, all of whom condemn the violence. The doctor in charge of the hospital where the victims were brought revealed that most of the victims were Hans. Again, this recalls the March 2008 Lhasa riots, when the Tibetans had attacked the Hans indiscriminately.         
	The immediate provocation of the violence was an incident that took place eight days earlier, in the southern province of Guangdong, far away from Xinjiang, which is in the north- west, bordering Tibet. Two Uigurs were killed by a mob of Hans in a toy factory for reasons still unclear. Initially, the police said that a dismissed employee had posted a rumour on the internet that six Uigurs had raped a Han. Later they said that a Han had been assaulted when she entered a Uigur dormitory by mistake. But male and female dormitories are normally completely separate. So how could she have wandered into the wrong dorm?                
	Same here        
	On Sunday night, Uigurs in Urumqi demanding an investigation into the Guangdong incident came out on the streets. Soon they turned violent. Rebiya Kadeer has alleged that the police brutality provoked them, but there is no media evidence of that as yet. CCTV continues to show them overturning a traffic police car and setting it on fire, throwing stones and smashing bus windows. These visuals, coupled with close-ups of badly beaten victims lying on the streets, are likely to inflame Han viewers across the country.        
	On Tuesday, Hans in Urumqi came out to retaliate with weapons, but were stopped by the police. Ironically, a day earlier, the toy factory in Guangdong reopened. A China Daily report, with pictures of smiling women wearing headscarves working on the assembly line, said that 700 Uigurs had returned to work, and quoted them as criticizing the rioters in Urumqi who had used our factory as an excuse. One Han worker said the entire problem was one of lack of communication. The government has been telling factory owners in the advanced regions to employ Uigurs to solve the unemployment problem there. However, the locals resent these outsiders who speak a different (Turkish) language, worship a different god, and are exempt from the hated one-child norm.        
	Back in Xinjiang, the Han influx has succeeded in making the Uigurs a minority in Urumqi. Their culture seems to be under threat. Recent government actions like ordering government employees to be clean-shaven (many Uigurs sport moustaches and beards), and the demolition of most of the old areas of Kashgar, a historical city which houses Chinas biggest mosque, have aggravated matters.         
	The Urumqi riots remind one of the Hindu-Muslim riots back home. Religion in China hardly ever invades public space, but the minority-majority divide seems as stark.

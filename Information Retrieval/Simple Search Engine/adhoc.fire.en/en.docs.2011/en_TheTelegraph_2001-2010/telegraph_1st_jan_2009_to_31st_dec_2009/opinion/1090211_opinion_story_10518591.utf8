	 The owner of a property constructed a marriage hall on it. In 2001, the municipal corporation detected certain irregularities in the construction and issued a notice to the owner for its demolition. But the owner had died by then and the property was in her grandsons possession. The grandson filed a case challenging the notice and won it. The corporation then appealed to the Supreme Court. The court said that the notice, which in any case had been issued to a dead person, was vague and contained no details about the property. It concluded that the corporation had not given proper notice of hearing to the grandson, adding that if it had done so, the grandson could have satisfied the corporation that the irregularity was negligible.

	Married, for sure        
	 When a man filed a case for his marriage to be declared null and void, his wife had already remarried. The husband contended that the maintenance petition filed under the Hindu Marriage Act should not be entertained as she was not his wife at that point of time. Disagreeing, the Punjab and Haryana High Court held that during the time the question of the legality of the marriage was being decided, the petition for the payment of maintenance could not be rejected. It added that since the act provided for the payment of maintenance during pendency of a petition under it, no distinction could be drawn between a legal and an illegal marriage.

	Careless bail        
	In a case of murder, a sessions court refused to grant bail to the accused on the ground that he had a criminal history and the present murder had been committed in cold blood. However, the high court granted him bail, noting that some of the injuries were also caused by others. Besides, it observed that the injuries were not on the vital parts of the body. The complainant opposed the order, contending that the bail should not have been granted as the accused had other criminal cases pending against him. The Supreme Court ordered a re-hearing of the case in the high court, adding that a complainant could always question an order of bail if it was not valid. (Brij Nandan Jaiswal vs Munna)

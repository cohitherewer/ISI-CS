The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Cat changes colour
                                                                                                                 CAT CHANGES COLOUR                          - Deng Xiaoping, with a dash of Arthur Pigou					 					      Cutting Corners      Ashok Mitra                                                      
	Colour-blindness had struck Deng Xiaoping in the late Seventies; history was, as a result, rewritten in China. The controversy that ensued was not just over the colour of capital, but also over the methodology of growth. Deng argued for two propositions together: first, never mind whether it is the fruit of capitalist exploitation or of socialist accumulation, as long as investible resources are on tap, please do not ask further questions, and second, if the export route can develop the right momentum for growth, why not take it, why stick to the socialist orthodoxy of self-reliant growth?        
	What was involved were two separate species of colour-blindness or two facets of the same affliction. The controversy, many thought, was over and done with. But history has once more chosen to turn upon itself; three decades after Dengs apostasy, the question of colour preference has re-emerged as an issue in China, causing both embarrassment and consternation to the national leadership.         
	Till the American sub-prime phenomenon threw things at sixes and sevens, developments in China were, of course, overwhelmingly supportive of Deng. The countrys foreign-exchange holdings, touching nearly two trillion dollars, were almost entirely the outcome of export-led growth. Americans are conditioned to buy whatever there is in the market to buy and Chinese wares had always been in demand in American households. The Sino-American commercial relationship has, in fact, a long history. This was interrupted by the Kuomintang and the Cold War chapters. Dengs reversal of both ideology and policy helped the two countries to rediscover their past links.         
	The Chinese are, by tradition, skilled artisans, adept at many crafts. Besides, China has been a poor, low-wage country. So, once the ideological difficulties were put aside, there was no problem for China in entering a breathtaking phase of export-led growth. The favoured items for export were textiles, footwear, electronic equipment, toys and construction material of a wide variety. Chinas more than 10 per cent rate of annual growth for years on end was largely the contribution of a more than 25 per cent rate of growth in annual exports.               
	Such acceleration in exports needed to be organized. The eastern coast of China got dotted with factories, plants and workshops; several so-called special economic zones were also tucked in there. Hundreds of thousands of workers migrated from distant interior provinces to the coastal regions to man factories with products ear-marked for export. Urban settlements multiplied in these regions at a dizzy pace, providing work for more migrant workers. Perhaps even greater effort was concentrated on creating facilities for foreigners who both invested in, and bought from, China. The eastern fringe of China, longitudinally measuring 3,000 miles or more, buzzed with activity. The capitalist roaders sat back to enjoy their long season of triumph.         
	The magnitude of growth China attained over the past quarter of a century is unprecedented in the annals of human civilization. It has, however, been responsible for an uncomfortable concomitant: inequalities. The economic distance has grown between the coastal areas and the interior regions, and generally between town and country. The country has simultaneously witnessed a sharp increase in income and assets inequalities between classes. Capitalists were inducted into the Communist Party; and have played a key role in influencing the contours of the countrys economic and social development. Capitalists are not particularly known for their altruism. The logic for inviting capitalists into the party was simple: the preferred development model emphasized the need to combine capitalist growth with export-led growth, and capitalists, with their global reach, know a great deal of both.        
	Export-led growth was the cat that caught the mice. Deng had meanwhile died, but he emerged, ex post, as the most prophetic of leaders. Things were in place, development was taking place at a flabbergastingly high rate. China was shining. And then, to spoil the party, came last years sub-prime disaster. Things are suddenly no longer in place. A good and proper economic depression has set in in the United States of America. Once it goes through all its phases, its ravages might even exceed those wrought by the Great Economic Depression three-quarters of a century ago  or such is the apprehension.         
	America is in distress, and buying less. Causality has consequently gone to work. Chinas coastal-belt industries are in the throes of a major crisis. Exports have declined sharply. Textiles, shoes and toys from China are no longer in high demand in the US. Lay-offs and closures in America are leading to lay-offs and closures in China. Continents and countries of the world have been made interdependent by liberalization on a global scale. No country, China not excluding, is any longer an island. The woes of the US are being transmuted into suffering for the Chinese. Some 20 million migrant workers, who had arrived from the inner provinces, are reportedly being trucked back into Chinas deep, grey interior.         
	Chinas leaders, again according to fairly well-founded reports, are in a funk. They have been forced to suspend their faith in export-led growth, and admit, howsoever reluctantly, some of the virtues latent in the doctrine of self-reliant growth, the kingpin of socialist developmental strategy. China has, over the years, built a mammoth infrastructure for economic growth, what, in Western terminology, is known as the supply side.         
	Infrastructure by itself cannot, however, yield growth; the demand side has to be alive and kicking too. With the bottom dropping out of export demand, the countrys decision-makers are now coming to the wisdom that new demand has to be generated from within, forcing a return to the old theme of agrarian reconstruction. Implicit in this shift in policy is an eagerness to shift income distribution in favour of the poorer classes. The rendezvous with capitalism is obviously proposed to be adjourned. Whether this turnaround is a full ideological reconversion or a temporary excursion into pragmatism is something yet to be fathomed.               
	Arthur Pigou, who adorned the chair in political economy in Cambridge for a large chunk of the first half of the 20th century, was an honest plodder. Innocent of the intricacy of ideologies, he once wrote a tract listing the positive and negative features of both capitalism and socialism, offering the hint that humanity may do worse than experimenting with alternative phases of capitalism and socialism  capitalism ruling the roost for some while, followed by a season of socialism, to be followed by another tenure for capitalism, then another round of socialism, and so on ad infinitum.        
	Pigous avocation was to write books on economics. Some of these books could afford to be fairy tales that did nobody any harm. Trying out a Pigovian experiment in a flesh-and-blood economy such as Chinas might, however, spell trouble. It is all very well to suggest that you change the colour of the cat every few decades, and once the cat of a particular colour has served its purpose, you ditch it and choose another one with a different pigmentation. The colour of a cat, though, represented an ideology. The cat Deng preferred had created during its reign a couple of generations of devout believers in the capitalist ideology. They could well resist, fiercely, the proposal that the Chinese economy be now reshaped to generate effective demand from within via reduction of inequalities and the placing of money in the hands of the urban and rural poor. Their resistance might turn into a deadly turmoil, with foreigners freely joining in, now that it is an interdependent world.         
	The colour of the cat may still be the stuff of dialectics; life, however, is more than analogy.

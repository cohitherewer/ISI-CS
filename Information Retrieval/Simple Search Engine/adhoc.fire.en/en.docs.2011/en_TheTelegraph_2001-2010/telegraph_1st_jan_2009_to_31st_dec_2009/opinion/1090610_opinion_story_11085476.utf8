The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | session change
                                                                                                                 SESSION CHANGE                                                    
	Pretending to be busy with nitty-gritty while being unable to deal with the essentials is typical of incompetent and self-interested politicians. This continues to be the bane of West Bengals education system under Left Front rule. The school education minister, Partha Dey, has announced that schools under the West Bengal boards will switch to January-to-December sessions from 2012. This change will be implemented through several transitional stages. It will make these schools out of sync with not only schools under the other boards in the state, but also with most other schools all over India. So, general havoc is expected, the brunt of which will have to be borne by the students. The current May-to-April session was introduced in the early Nineties. Since then, teachers associations, mostly backed by various Opposition parties, have wanted to switch to January-to-December sessions. Now, the government is holding up this decision as one prompted by parental demand. It looks like part of a series of desperately populist moves to win back the favour that the Left Front has lost in the state. The change is also being linked to that other one, made in 1999, of allowing English to be made part of primary education. In that case, too, acting for decades on wrongheaded principles of education did its irreparable damage to the system before the Front woke up to the situation.        
	These changes, or reforms, mostly happen (or do not happen) according to the inner workings of the party and the whims of various teachers unions that form part of its cadre. With this particular session change, there are teachers associations that are not in agreement, and this might run its own complicated course. But what all this amounts to is a deflection of public attention to the realm of inessentials, so that everything that lies in a shambles about education in the state could carry on being so. The opposing party is no better. A member of one of its teachers associations had recently got into a spat with an inspector of schools and publicly sprayed his face with betel juice stored in his mouth expressly for that purpose. The teacher, who teaches all subjects from Class I to V, then went on to deny having done so. Such being the level of pedagogic thinking and action in the state, the mindlessness of Mr Deys intervention should surprise nobody.

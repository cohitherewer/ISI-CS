The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | fall of innocence
                                                                                                                 FALL OF INNOCENCE                                                          
	Time should stand still in comic strips. Age should not bring wrinkles on the face of Modesty Blaise nor senility impair the cunning of Asterix or vintage reduce the potency of the magic potion that gives Obelix his strength. What would happen to Tintin if alcohol induced dementia claimed Captain Haddock? It this thus shocking to learn that Archie Andrews, the evergreen playboy of Riverdale is going to marry. It is a greater shock to know that he popped the question to Veronica, aka, Ronnie, rather than to Betty. The reports did not mention the response of Mr Lodge, the millionaire father of Veronica, to the prospect of giving away his daughter to his bte noire. Did he have an apoplectic fit when he heard the news? Did he disown his daughter? Or did he settle to have a live-in son-in-law? More than the answers to these questions, what is important is that the romance and fun have gone out of the Archie comics.        
	Before readers begin to wonder what all this is about, the news should be put before them. Earlier this week, Archie Comic Publications made the announcement that Archie had finally decided to marry Veronica Lodge and not Betty Cooper. This storyline will be released sometime in August when the gang graduates from college. This brings to a close a dilemma that haunted Archie Andrews for over 65 years. If truth be told, however, this is not a dilemma that has bothered the readers of Archie comics across generations. No one quite expected Archie to marry. His ongoing flirtation with both Ronnie and Betty was part of the story and its attraction. No reader quite expected that evergreen group from Riverdale High to grow up and take adult decisions. What will happen to Jughead? Will he be made to give up hamburgers and take to fine dining in Michelin-starred restaurants? Will he abandon his trademark crown and don a black tie? The signs point that way, alas. If the gang is to get out into the wider world to work for a living, it will be the end of innocence. Archie could as well bid a fond adieu to his fans. A married Archie Andrews is a contradiction in terms, a solecism.        
	What is also to be regretted is that Archie has chosen the millionaires daughter over the girl-next-door, who was always kind and understanding. Is Archie then to become respectable, abandon his battered car for a swish limo? Will he stop being clumsy and become proper? Will Mr Lodge begin to welcome him rather than having his valet throw him out? A familiar world, a familiar story is about to come to an end.        
	It is impossible to abandon imaginary characters who were integral to the process of growing up. It is as difficult to accept a married Archie as it is to imagine William Brown as a city gent or Billy Bunter as a successful, if portly, banker. Will Biggles stop flying? And wont there be honey still for tea?

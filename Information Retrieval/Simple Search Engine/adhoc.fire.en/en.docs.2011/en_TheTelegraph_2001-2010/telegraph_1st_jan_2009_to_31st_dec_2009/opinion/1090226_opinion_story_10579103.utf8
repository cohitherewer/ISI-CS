The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | complete singer
                                                                                                                 COMPLETE SINGER                                  Nilaksha Gupta                              
	Today, there are a couple of female Bengali khayal singers who could have sung Malabika Kanan (1930-2009) into the shade, but in her heyday (1950-1970) there was none who could have held a candle to her. She was not, however, an epoch-making singer like Kesarbai Kerkar, or even like the rather wayward, but brilliant, Roshanara Begum. She had an appealing and pitch-perfect voice, and sang in a simple style that comprised generally correct and fairly brief melodic elaboration, fairly simple rhythmic phrasing and clear, pitch-accurate taans of a limited variety. But this was enough to please listeners as critical as the late Kumar Prasad Mukherji and even his father, Dhurjati Prasad Mukherji. D.P. Mukherji had praised Malabika, (then Malabika Roy) in his column, Monay Elo, in the Bengali magazine, Desh, thus: Malabika Roy has entered the temple of singing. She sings complete songs (my translation).        
	Behind this completeness was the enviable treasury of compositions taught to her by her father, the musicologist and singer, Rabindra Lal Roy, who was a pupil of V.N. Bhatkhande. Her raga interpretation, naturally, adhered to the format found in Bhatkhandes six-volume Kramik Pustak Malika. This adherence was ratified by the fact that she had passed her All India Radio audition with the extremely critical and strict, S.K. Ratanjankar, the chief pupil of Bhatkhande, in the chair and was placed in the B-high grade straight away. One could, as a consequence, check out the correctness of a khayal composition sung by any artist by comparing it with hers. Though Malabika, probably out of conjugal concern, always acknowledged her husband, the late A. Kanan, as her second guru, she was, in fact, Kanans teacher as well. For Kanan and she often sang the same khayal compositions; compositions that Kanan couldnt have learnt anywhere else.         
	She was a tall, fair woman with cinema-village-belle good looks. As a result, many went to watch her rather than hear her. She dressed in the traditional style, wearing long-sleeved blouses, expensive silk saris, with a jasmine garland wound into her hair for special effect. Before landing in Calcutta and marrying the excellent singer, A. Kanan, she was already well-known in Bihar, her home state, and a regular broadcaster on AIR Patna. National hook-up listeners heard and remembered her voice in R.L. Roys radio feature, Music and you, in which the father did the talking and the daughter, then very young, did all the singing.        
	Since my wife, Jayati, was a pupil of A. Kanan for 20 years, I was a regular visitor to their flat on 154, Bakul Bagan Road in Calcutta in the 1970s, and got to know Malabika well. She used to sit with me in the veranda, while Kanan taught Jayati, and talk about a lot of things, including musicians and their whims, but very little about music proper. The relations soured a bit after I criticized, in one of my reviews, the way she moved to the high tonic in raga Puria Dhanashree. How should one then go to the taar sa? she snapped at me one evening. I recited the fifth movement in her fathers illustration of the raga on page 115 of his book, Raag Nirnaya (Vol. 1). Her nostrils flared. Then I said, some dhrupads, however, illustrate the best final movement and went on to recite the notation. She was fuming, but held her peace and did not speak to me for the rest of the evening. But when I later criticized her sister, Manjulika, for using a glaringly wrong phrase in raga Desh, Malabika was furious and blurted out several untenable arguments in defence of the phrase. I politely refuted all of them and asked, You have never used such a phrase in Desh, have you? No, I havent, she said. If, for arguments sake, I accept that the phrase is correct, why havent you ever used it? She stomped off angrily. A. Kanan, who was quietly watching, offered me a cigarette and said, Congratulations! This is the first time I have seen my wife losing an argument.

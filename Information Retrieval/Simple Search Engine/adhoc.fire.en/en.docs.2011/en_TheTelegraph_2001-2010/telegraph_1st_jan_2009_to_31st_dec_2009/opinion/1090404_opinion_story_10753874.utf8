	The title of the exhibition, Navarasa (March 14-April 5), organized by the Birla Academy of Art amp; Culture, apart from sounding pretentious is also a misnomer. For, while there are nine senior participants from Delhi, most of their works can safely be described as abstract, the term covering a wide range of practice. Most of them were born in the Forties, and their works already look dated. Jai Zharotia and Shobha Broota are the two exceptions. Zharotias iconography is curious. He creates human beings with limbs like mountains, whose bodies tell strange stories like the dreaming of the indigenous people of Australia.         
	In stark contrast, Brootas work with textiles and wool in bright colours are experiments in Op Art where the illusion of uniformity and harmony is broken by warps in the woven material (picture). Kalicharan Gupta spreads a mesh of blue over an already painted surface, and conceals more than he reveals. Niren Senguptas is a splintered world of dark colours contrasted with lighter hues, with the occasional hand holding a flower. Nand Katyals hail of brushstrokes is in the most unlikely pinks, yellows and blues, as if van Gogh had begun visualizing in technicolor. His work looks kitschy, unintentionally of course. Jagdish Chanders is abstract expressionism of sorts. A look from a distance reveals the existence of faces behind the frenzied brushwork and dripping paint. Amrut Patels interlocked forms have a sophistication that is rare as far as this show is concerned.

	In Japan, the world has just witnessed a mammoth demonstration of what is called the anti-incumbency factor in India. Japan may have taken decades to figure it out, but behind the trouncing of the Liberal Democratic Party after its rule of almost 55 years lies this single most important factor. The Democratic Party of Japan may have hit the jackpot by default: it has won one seat short of absolute majority in the lower house but has less than 17 per cent of the countrys electorate rooting for its policies. It is this unpleasant fact that the victors have to bear in mind while going about the task of forming the government. Of course, the contrary fate of the two parties was mainly determined by the economy. In the months preceding the elections, Japan had witnessed the worst spate of economic trouble  a record rise in the rate of unemployment, a slump in exports and a deflated currency. Japans economic downslide had begun earlier though, and the LDP, at the helm for most of the time, has been painfully conscious of it. Perhaps what turned the tide against it was the ill-fated decision of successive LDP prime ministers to dump the reforms initiated by one of their colleagues, Junichiro Koizumi. Not surprisingly, the miracle that the DPJ under Yukio Hatoyama promises to bring Japan back on track will include substantial doses of Mr Koizumis reformism, although that would be the least highlighted of its new policies.         
	Among the new things in the DPJ arsenal are its plans to take financial control from the hands of bureaucrats and give it to elected representatives of the people, stoke domestic demand, and increase welfare measures, especially for families with children. But the obstructions to implementing these policies may not be new. There is the staggering public debt, now close to 217 per cent of the gross domestic product. The other problem may be the running of the government. There are already doubts over the presence of the former LDP power-trader, Ichiro Ozawa, and his proven record as a spoiler. The lack of experience may also force dependence on the ex-LDP members in the DPJs midst. What may, however, go in Mr Hatoyamas favour, other than the overwhelming optimism, is the fact that Japan is now close to the end of its recession. There is also the charm of his new foreign policy that seeks to situate Japan as an equal player with China and the United States of America in the global strategy game.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Talking to the navel
                                                                                                                 TALKING TO THE NAVEL                                  This above all - Khushwant Singh                          Memories of a state                                        
	I have not come across a work of fiction that told the story of Indian Punjab from its blood-soaked birth in 1947 to the present day till I chanced upon Manreet Sodhi Someshwars The Long Walk Home. It is in fact a saga of one Sikh family uprooted from Lahore and settled in a border town of Ferozepore along the dividing line of the river Sutlej. The family happens to be of one Harbaksh Singh Bhalla, a prominent criminal lawyer, his Jatni wife, Preet Sidho, and their three children  two daughters and a son. It all takes place in ten days starting from the night when Bhalla Sahib woke up early (3. 00 am) because he slept quite early and his tippling started early. He was obese, over-weight, diabetic and had heart trouble. He walked through the bazaar in the dead of night to look for a doctor. He could not find one. So he continued walking through wheat fields he once owned along the banks of the Sutlej. He collapsed on his way back home, was picked up by a rickshawwallah and taken to hospital, where he expired. The story goes back and forth, reviving events in Punjab, and on the tenth day there is the antimardas (last prayer) for Harbaksh Bhallas soul.        
	There is a lot to be said in favour of encapsulating the 63-year-old history of the state in this medium-sized novel. The pace of Someshwars narrative varies from the leisurely to the frenetic. She tells you about the demand for a Punjabi state made by Master Tara Singh and Sant Fateh Singh, Jawaharlal Nehrus reluctance to concede it, and the Hindu-Sikh tensions that ensue. In between, comes the 1965 Indo-Pak war in which Pakistanis assumed that disgruntled Sikhs would side with them. They did not. The Sikh peasantry rallied round to help the Indian Army repel the attack. Indira Gandhi then conceded the Punjabi suba with a Sikh-majority. Not content with what they got, rose Bhindranwale and his Khalistani terrorists. Police repression, fake encounters and arrests of innocent young men on cooked-up charges followed. Bhalla Sahib is suspected to have been a sympathizer. There was Operation Blue Star, which took hundreds of lives, and then came the desecration of the Akal Takht. It was followed by the assassination of Indira Gandhi and the massacre of thousands of innocent Sikhs. And so on. To hold the readers interest, the author introduces some highly improbable anecdotes. Young Harbaksh Singh Bhalla sleeping in the open in his wheat field is straddled by a woman unknown to him. They have torrid sex without exchanging a word. She disappears in the darkness of the night carrying Harbakshs lungi with her. It is the stuff a young mans wet dreams are made of. How did the poor fellow get home without the lungi? The amount of material Someshwar tried to pack in her novel required a large cabin trunk; she has tried to squeeze it into a small suitcase.        
	Someshwar is a writer of great promise. I have a gut feeling we have a new star rising in Punjabs literary horizon. She has excellent command over English and a sly sense of humour. Her dialogues, with their Punjabi mutilations of English, choice of Punjabi and Urdu proverbs, quotations from the Gurbani, from Ghalib, Tagore and Gulzar go down very well. Being young and gifted, she is unable to resist showing off what she knows. Readers may know words like moniker, morph and recce, but how many would know omphalokelepsis? I had to look up the dictionary. It means talking to ones navel  a form of meditation. She would do better if she tried it herself.                
	Ask Murad                
	Murad Ali Baig is of the same age as my son, but I regard him as a kindred spirit. He is Muslim, but I doubt if he ever goes to a mosque to pray. Like me, he enjoys his evenings with Scotch whiskey. I am Sikh but I do not go to gurdwaras to pray, eat halaal meat, beef and drink. However, both of us share a common passion  the study of religions. He does it dispassionately and writes about them. I have translated a lot of the Gurbani into English, and have written on matters concerning my community.        
	It was time Murad Baig answered the many questions his readers and admirers keep asking him. He has done precisely that in his Reflections in a Sacred Pond : An inquiry into Indias history, mythology and religion through 80 questions. The range of the questions is baffling. Starting from India as one of the oldest civilizations and where human beings come from, he goes on to Jainism, Buddhism, Hindusim, Islam, Christianity and Sikhism. Then he comes to recent times. Did the British exploit India? Did free Indian leaders fail their country? Why was Indias progress so slow? And so on down to communalism in present-day India  all packed in 200 pages. It is veritably an abridged encyclopaedia of India.

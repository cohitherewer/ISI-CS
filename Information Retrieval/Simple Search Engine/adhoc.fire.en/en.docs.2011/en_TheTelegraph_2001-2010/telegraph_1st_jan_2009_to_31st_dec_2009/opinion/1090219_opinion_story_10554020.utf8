The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Trick or treat
                                                                                                                 TRICK OR TREAT                                                    
	An interim budget is ideally a non-event; the government by convention cannot raise or reduce taxes or subsidies in it. And this government has no need to break convention. It prefers ever-rising deficits to taxes which are bound to displease someone or the other, and it has perfected the art of spending money not approved in budgets: it does so by bringing any number of votes-on-account. So the interim budget could well have been just a vote-on-account by another name. And so it might have been if it had been the work of our taciturn prime minister. Pranab Mukherjee, however, is an acrobat for all his stature. He has been there, seen it, done it  including presenting budgets. He hardly gets a minute these days between the rapid-fire statements he shoots off in his one-man war against Pakistan. But a budget, however interim, was a chance to perform which he could hardly have let go. And he squeezed every bit of histrionics out of the event. He was lucky to have few interruptions. Usually, the budget is an occasion for one or other opposition party to stage a noisy dance, ending with a fall into the well.         
	The state of the economy can present some pitfalls to a novice. Manufacturing production is falling. The balance of payments deficit is getting ever bigger. Businesses are running out of money. When they go to banks to borrow, they find someone with a bigger clout has already got there before them, namely the government. It needs tons of money to deliver on the promises it made in its last five improvident budgets, and who better to give it than banks, which it owns? Far be it from Mr Mukherjee to deny these facts; he just clothes them in brighter words. Instead of the last few months, he talked about growth in the previous four years. Instead of the payments deficit, he talked about export growth. Instead of government deficit, he talked of the populist schemes the government was spending money on. And just in case any blame fell on him, he showered praises on the real culprits  Sonia Gandhi, Manmohan Singh and P. Chidambaram.        
	It is said that Indian politics is ripe for rejuvenation. The Congress has given Rahul Gandhi this task; he has got his own army of young followers. The Bharatiya Janata Party is looking for young leaders, although many of them seem to prefer violence to leadership. The communists have young leaders already in place; at any rate, they have black hair. They should have all, irrespective of party, watched Mr Mukherjee perform; he could teach them a trick or two. But unfortunately, the economics of a country is not determined either by tricks or performance.

	It has been 15 years since the last time pollution standards were set. But India has at last changed the rules determining air quality. The maximum permissible level for each pollutant on the earlier list of pollutants has been lowered, while six others that had not even been considered so far have been added. This can only be excellent news. If followed, the rules could immeasurably improve the air quality in cities. The chief and overwhelming benefit of such a change should be the dramatic lessening of respiratory diseases, which have been growing at an alarming rate in recent years. As important as the general lowering of permissible limits is the fact that the new rules fix the same standards for residential and industrial areas, with no relaxation for the latter as had been allowed earlier. These standards are equal to the European ones, the Union minister for environment has said. Evidently they are higher than air pollution standards in the United States of America.        
	It is good to have a benchmark, and perhaps it is this that should be welcomed first. But ensuring adherence to these rules in this one-billion-strong country with wildly different lifestyles, economic standards and civic cultures takes the issue on to a different plane altogether. The government is focusing on cleaner auto-emission and fuel efficiency standards that are to evolve within the next two years. Arranging for cleaner fuel or getting automobile manufacturers to produce the right kind of cars is not likely to be a simple matter, but even that is only a small part of the process. A part of it will depend on mindset; as the Centre for Science and Environment has pointed out, people should be encouraged to use public transport instead of cars. But even that will mean replanning transport systems and no-car zones within and outside cities, so that people have enough of the right kind of public transport to travel in dignity to the places they want to go to. The changeover into cleaner ambient air would involve individual awareness and willingness as well as investment and action on the part of governments, municipal corporations and corporate organizations, together with owners of factories, and of small- and middle-scale industries. It can be done of course, even if it takes time. But without time frames and possible penalties for violation, cleaner air is yet a little difficult to imagine.

	Grammar with grace                
	Bimbabati Devi, a brilliant Manipuri dancer, knows how to give a new dimension to the classical form, keeping the grammatical structure intact. To celebrate 36 years of Manipuri Nartanalaya, established by her father, Guru Bipin Singh, the dancer presented Amitajyoti, a choreography based on Tagores Viswa-Parichay at Rabindra Sadan on March 7. Classical Manipuri, folk, Manipuri martial art, thang-ta, and yogic postures were blended creatively to depict the eternal brilliance of the universe. Bimba, with her co-dancers all dressed in white with bright full-sleeved blouse, danced with grace and beauty. With supple body movements, crisp footwork, and lively leaps, the dancers brought out the significance of human existence. The amalgam of songs and bols were praiseworthy. The mysticism of the universe and the joy of rhythm were captured in the well-synchronized movements and dramatic bol-parhant. Conceived, choreographed and directed by Bimbabati, Amitajyoti was a wonderful production supported by Nilanjana, Tanusree, Anindita, Arpita and others. Subrata Mazumdars light design added an extra dimension. Supratik Das and Jayati Chakraborty gave vocal support.

	Love notes        
	For the educated Bengali taking pride in his culture, Valentines Day has distinctly philistine associations. It was surprising, therefore, to find a large turnout at Kala Mandir on February 14, for a musical evening titled How do I love thee? Shreya Guhathakurta and Sounak Chattopadhyay sang songs of Rabindranath Tagore and Dwijendralal Ray, all of them sensitively chosen to complement a script rich in Indian and European literature, compiled by Shankarlal Bhattacharjee and read by Parambrata Chattopadhyay and Debleena Dutt. The first song, Ami chini go chini tomaare, sung together by Shreya and Sounak and evoking much Charulata nostalgia, was marred by a small slip. However, both artists went on to give sincere and inspired performances. Sounak was particularly impressive in the two D.L. Ray songs, Shey keno dekha dilo and Neel akasher asheem chheye. Shreya seemed to rely on her falsetto more than was necessary in Doore kothay doore doore, but gave nuanced renditions of Dujane dekha holo, Ami roope tomay bholabo na and O amar chander alo. In an otherwise competently sung Saghano gahano ratri, Sounak had problems maintaining the tempo. The pairing of the Tagore songs, Tumi je amare chao (Shreya) and Jani tomar ajana naahi go (Sounak), the first from Puja and the second from the Prem section of the Gitabitan, worked well, underscoring the interchangeability of two kinds of love  for the divine and the human subject  in Tagores songs.

	Not very long ago, the Bharatiya Janata Party touted itself as a party with a difference. That this was an empty slogan was never in doubt. But the partys decision to support a government in Jharkhand to be led by Shibu Soren shows how low it can stoop to conquer. The party was the biggest loser in the polls to the Jharkhand assembly. But that was not bad enough to keep it out of power. The party has no qualms about joining a government led by a man who has come to symbolize the seamy side of Indian politics. It is not that the BJP is the only party that puts power above public morality or that Jharkhand is the only state where this has happened. The Congress may have found Mr Soren too hot to touch this time. But the corruption and criminal charges against Mr Soren all date from the time he was an ally of the Congress. The party cannot but take responsibility for the corruption cases against another former chief minister, Madhu Koda, whose brief reign survived only because of the partys support. The events in Jharkhand raise, yet again, the old question of whether corruption and other issues of public morality really matter in Indian politics.        
	Jharkhands need for a stable and sensitive government is greater now than at any other time in the new states brief history. Repeated spells of political instability have seriously ruined the ability and credibility of its administration. There are two immediate effects of this near-total collapse of the rule of law. The Maoist rebels have taken advantage of the political and administrative vacuum and spread their influence wider and deeper among the people. Jharkhands failure has also affected the fight against the Maoists in adjoining states. The other impact could prove to be even more damaging in the long run. Although it has an abundance of natural resources, Jharkhand is among the poorest states in the country. With the politicians busy making and breaking fragile governments, economic development seems to be nobodys business. This is a dangerous vacuum in a state where the Maoists recruit the poor tribal people in their ranks. The failures in Jharkhand can only help the Maoist campaign. Power-hungry parties can come together to form a government. But Jharkhand needs a government that benefits, not its unscrupulous politicians, but the people.

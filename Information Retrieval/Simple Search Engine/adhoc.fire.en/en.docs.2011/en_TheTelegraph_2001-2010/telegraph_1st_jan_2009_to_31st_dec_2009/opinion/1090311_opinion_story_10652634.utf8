                                                                                                                 LOOK WITHIN                                                    
	The committee headed by B.N. Srikrishna was appointed by the Supreme Court to provide the court with a clear perspective on the events that occurred in the Madras High Court premises on February 19. Ever since the lawyer-police clashes that day, lawyers in Tamil Nadu have suspended work indefinitely and emphasized, as a precondition to their resuming work, that the police be taught a lesson for using force against members of the judiciary. Despite being pressed on the issue repeatedly by the agitation in Tamil Nadu, the Supreme Court reserved its opinion on the conduct of both lawyers and the police till the Srikrishna committee concluded its findings. The report now makes it clear that contrary to allegations, the lawyers had acted in a way sufficiently provocative for the police to resort to force. However, the report also notes that this use of force was disproportionate to the occasion. The former judge, in fact, holds the police to be as responsible for the mayhem as the lawyers who provoked action. He also comes down heavily on the Madras chief justice and the high court administration in particular, and the bar councils in general, for encouraging such misbehaviour among lawyers and advocates, and suggests reform of the Advocates Act to check the slide.         
	The apex court has not wasted a moment in ordering the agitators in Tamil Nadu, once again, to return to work. It has quashed appeals for a judicial inquiry into the police action and referred the appellants to the reports findings on their role in the violence. However, despite the plain speaking, the higher judiciary has made no attempt to bring to book members of the fraternity for their show of indiscipline. It has appointed mediators to politely cajole them back into courts and referred the matter to the Madras High Court and the state government for appropriate action (both of which have been indicted by the Srikrishna report). It is obvious that the apex court is trying to stop the impasse from becoming a spectacle, but not all members of the fraternity are sensitive to its high thinking. Already, the advocates association in the state has partially boycotted the swearing in of the new chief justice of the Madras High Court and initiated legal proceedings against police officers through a joint action committee. The deadlock between the chief justice of the Madras court and recalcitrant lawyers may once again necessitate intervention from the higher judiciary, perhaps more definitively this time.

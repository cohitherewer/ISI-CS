The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Why is the Pickle Pretty?
                                                                                                                 WHY IS THE PICKLE PRETTY?                                  Stephen Hugh-Jones                                            
	The early swallows are darting to and fro above my Sussex garden, welcome migrants from Africa who show that summer is near. Hence the saying, one swallow does not make a summer, meaning, for instance, that one evening of sobriety does not mean that a drunkard has turned teetotal.        
	The saying is natural, and intelligible enough, to anyone in Britain. But how does it sound in Calcutta? Or what about mony a mickle maks a muckle, as the Scots allegedly say, meaning that a lot of small things add up to a large one? In fact, even the Scots dont (or, at least, didnt use to) say it: mickle is merely a variant of their dialect word muckle, that is, big, and the correct original version was mony a pickle, something small, also in Scottish dialect. But the mangled version is the one known today.        
	How many Telegraph readers have met this pseudo-Scottish saying? And understood it? Not too many, Id guess. And I nearly wrote, I hope. Because there are countless sayings of this sort in English, but most are very rarely used; and life is short. If much of your time as a student of English was spent on such idiomatic but out-of-the-way trivia, then it was time mis-spent. Youd have done better getting a solid command of idiomatic English as it is used, not as it mostly isnt used.        
	The masters at Eton College had forgotten this principle in those distant days when they stuffed me and my school-fellows with Latin and Greek. I left the place with my head full of oddities and quiddities of grammar found in ancient authors, but precious little real feel for either language (and two years soldiering soon got rid of that).        
	That last sentence is a fair specimen of what I mean. Quiddity is a rare, rather pretentious, word, with two distinct meanings, one of which is a trifling nicety, as my dictionary puts it  and thats just what the word itself is. In contrast, precious little (or precious few) is common, at times in a slightly sarcastic tone, in todays colloquial English. Why or when precious came to mean very in those phrases, Ive no idea and it doesnt matter. What matters is that they are often used, and thoroughly idiomatic in the right setting. They give an edge to what youre saying, as very little doesnt.        
	Of course, the right setting matters too, and learning it is part of learning the language. A newspaper editorial on swine flu might well say that precious few of its victims have actually died; an academic article wouldnt. Likewise, though many Germans, for example, speak good English, if youre talking to a roomful of them, or even only a tableful, avoid being over-idiomatic. And avoid it like the plague if theyre not German but Chinese. Youll merely confuse them  a risk that many British businessmen forget when they meet their foreign customers.        
	Like the plague...eh? Oops. That simile is surely plain enough, isnt it? Or maybe not. Well, it should be. But the lesson remains: dont waste too much time learning to be clever in the language, and even if you know it really well, dont be too clever using it. Youll just find yourself in a pretty pickle  which doesnt here mean mickle or muckle or even small. Its the stuff you eat, though why its pretty, and how it got into that metaphor, again Ive no idea. Or, as I might say, I havent the faintest.

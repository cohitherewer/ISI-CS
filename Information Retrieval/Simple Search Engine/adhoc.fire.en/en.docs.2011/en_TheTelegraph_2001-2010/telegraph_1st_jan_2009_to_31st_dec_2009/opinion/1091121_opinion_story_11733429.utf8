                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        A HIDDEN WORLD                                  VISUAL ARTS - Anusua Mukherjee                                                  
	The young artist, Puspita Ray, believes that paintings should be a source of relief to viewers. She does not prefer abstract paintings because she feels that life is too full of abstractions for them to be reproduced in images. The exhibition of Rays paintings entitled Nature (Academy of Fine Arts, Nov 5-11) provided ample evidence of her convictions. There was a quaint quality to her paintings of flowers that was refreshing indeed.        
	Most of her canvases showed a cluster of languid flowers with heart-shaped leaves in the foreground, their petals strewn on the moist earth, and more flowers glowing like stars in the distance. The flowers, of the kind one passes by without noticing on journeys in and around the city, conjured images of a hidden world, which is content to remain undiscovered. I was reminded of that garden of wild flowers, Saraswatikunda, described in Aranyak by Bibhutibhusan Bandyopadhyay. The flowers against blue backgrounds seemed to float under water, their petals waving like mermaids hair in the aquatic current.        
	Ray insists that most of the flowers she paints have no counterpart in the real world. She sees with her minds eyes so that the actual is transformed into the magical. It is not surprising that Ray is also a poet whose poetry celebrates, among other things, those unknown flowers that never get the chance to grace rich peoples homes but are lovely nonetheless.

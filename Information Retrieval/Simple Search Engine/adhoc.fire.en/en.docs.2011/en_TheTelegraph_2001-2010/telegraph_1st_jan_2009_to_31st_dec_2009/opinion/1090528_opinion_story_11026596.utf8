The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | FALSE START
                                                                                                                 FALSE START                                                    
	In a sphere of activity where a week has been memorialized as a long time, twelve days should be enough to constitute a council of ministers. Manmohan Singhs second government is not yet a complete and functioning government because the prime minister is yet to announce which portfolio is going to which minister. All that the citizens of India have is a list of twenty ministers who were sworn in on May 22 (and all of whom were not allotted portfolios); and another long list of names of those who will become ministers (again the portfolios are not known). This inordinate delay in forming a team that is supposed to present to the nation an effective government creates a very sorry spectacle of the prime minister and the Congress president. The delay can only be read as evidence of the lack of clarity in decision-making. This is unfortunate since one obvious message of the electoral verdict was that the winner would provide stable and effective governance. The beginning does not augur well. All well-wishers of Mr Singh will hope that he will not allow similar delays to hold him back when he gets back to the task of governing India.        
	The reasons for this delay are not particularly edifying. They relate to accommodating the demands of the allies of the Congress, especially of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam. To this was added the demands emanating from within the Congress, a party in which the loaves and fishes of office are seen to be of paramount importance. All this suggests that merit and competence were not the guiding principles for the selection of ministers who are supposed to determine the future of the Indian republic. Other considerations, like placating allies, rewarding loyalists, and so on, prevailed. Even if these, for the sake of argument, were kept on one side, some other questions remain unanswered. Why couldnt the names of all the ministers be announced in one go? Why the show that conveys the impression that the council of ministers has an A team and B team? One of the critical attributes of leadership is that the leader should be in a position to command  and not demand  loyalty. That position can be acquired by the leader through firm and clear decisions that are untainted by prejudice and other considerations. While the prime ministers mandate is self-evident, the process of cabinet formation does not quite live up to the mandate. The mandate gave Mr Singh an advantage but he has started off on a disadvantage.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | losing faith
                                                                                                                 LOSING FAITH                                                    
	Politics is not the only passion that ignites mob violence in West Bengal. The torching of a resort on the outskirts of Calcutta shows that just about anything can push a mob to turn violent. That a soccer match could lead to the tragic death of a young man and then the burning of the resort, however, points to a deeper malaise. The incident shows yet again the threat of lawlessness that haunts the state. In this particular case, the public anger apparently had nothing to do with politics or the government. But the mobs reaction clearly captures the peoples loss of faith in the rule of law. The people who invaded the resort and torched it obviously had no fear of the law. Even if the killing of the young man was sad and provocative, no civilized society will accept the way the mob reacted to it. It may be useful, though, for the government and the society to try and understand the reasons behind such outbursts of mob violence. Such reactions are also expressions of anger at the governments inability to ensure the rule of law.        
	It has been suggested that the grievances over land acquisition in Rajarhat could have prompted the attack on the resort. True, many among the local farmers who had lost their plots to the urbanization project in the area felt betrayed. But it may be wrong to attribute the violence to the land question. First, the mob attacked the resort only after some criminals responsible for the death of the young man had taken shelter there. Second, there had been no incident of public anger directed at the resort since it was set up. It is possible that criminal gangs in the area enjoy the patronage of one political party or the other. But it is unlikely that such criminals would be under the parties control. Land brokers, who operate like criminal gangs, are very much their own masters. The incident has a lesson for entrepreneurs too. They must guard against crime syndicates.

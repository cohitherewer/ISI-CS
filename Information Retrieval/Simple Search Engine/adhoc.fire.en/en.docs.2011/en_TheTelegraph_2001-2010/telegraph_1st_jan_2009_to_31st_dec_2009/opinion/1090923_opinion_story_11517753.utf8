	Little on offer                  
	Sir  Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees obsession with offering land to big business houses appears to be never-ending in light of the recent happenings. It seems that his government is now engaged in a hasty damage control exercise after suffering electoral reverses. In his latest attempt to woo Infosys and Wipro, Bhattacharjee has offered the two companies land at an alternative site but the two companies are yet to take up the offer (Out of hat: IT rabbit, Sept 18).          
	The information technology companies have been wise enough to grasp the current situation. Bhattacharjees offer is ridiculous, considering the fact that the present situation in Bengal is not conducive to launch big enterprises in the state. In the three decades of its rule, the government has done little to improve infrastructure to attract investors. The proposed IT hub in Rajarhat will be of no use unless power, drinking water, housing and roads are provided for between the city and the suburb. The states record for providing and maintaining such infrastructure is abysmal. The government is apparently always short of funds, but this excuse is unacceptable. At a time when global business is reeling under recession, how can Bhattacharjee hope to create thousands of jobs with the help of companies that are reluctant to set up establishments in the state? Providing an alternative site to these companies is nothing but a knee-jerk reaction to wriggle out of the muck that the government has found itself in as a result of its faulty land acquisition programme.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Prabhakar Bhattacharya, Ichapore, North 24 Parganas

                
	Sir  A number of issues related to the current turmoil over land allotment to IT companies in Rajarhat have not been addressed or are being carefully avoided. The first among these is the chief ministers announcement of the latest offer for land from the Alimuddin Street party office. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees move defied all norms of governance. But the real issue that needs to be addressed is the governments pampering of corporates in the name of employment. While it is true that industry generates employment, it is also true that no industry is set up to create more jobs. The primary reason for starting industries is to earn profit by utilizing certain assets purchased at market price. Labour happens to be one such asset. So generating employment is not an act of charity, but is essential to the profit-making enterprise.           
	Second is the issue of land given at subsidized prices. Every industry requires investments to succeed. For IT companies, these investments are in the form of land, equipment, uninterrupted power supply and so on. But while most of these assets are purchased at market price, IT companies procure land at ridiculously subsidized rates. Because of their supposed capacity to generate employment, these firms are given land at cheap rates, which help them to acquire more land than they actually require. Cheaper assets reduce the quantum of investment, which, in turn, reduces the interest burden and increases the margin of profit. Should a government be allowed to help IT companies increase their profits by arranging the sale of land at subsidized rates? Corporate companies cry foul over government intervention and control, but it is strange that they use the States influence to stake their claims over land belonging to the poorer sections of society.          
	The Bengal governments constant fear is that if it does not fulfil the demands of these companies, they might shift their operations to other states that are as keen to have them. This game of competitive deregulation to attract investment has resulted in governments serving the interests of corporates rather than of the people. This radical shift of policy has meant that land that has belonged to the people across generations is now being allotted to industrialists with citizens having no say in the process. This has transformed the government from a protector of the people to an agent meant to secure profits for corporate houses. The commercialization of daily life has also impaired the idea of justice. Very often, land grabbing by corporates is justified by stating that business houses will be able to use land more productively. A five-star hotel in place of the SSKM Hospital or a casino in Rabindra Sadan makes good commercial sense. But should healthcare and culture be sacrificed for the sake of commerce and profit? Economists have agreed that investing in education and health makes good sense, even though they may not yield high profits. The market must not be allowed to become the sole arbiter of human beings and their environment. The social costs of the State indulging corporate entities can no longer be ignored.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Deba Pratim Ghatak, Durgapur

                
	Sir  In spite of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees Do it now slogan, his government believes in doing things slowly in the hope that procrastination helps efface a problem from public memory. So when the same government acts speedily  offering 45 acres of land each to Infosys and Wipro within 10 days of its announcement to scrap the proposed IT township  eyebrows are bound to be raised. But if a private telecom company can pay Rs 8 crore and Tata Consultancy Services 1.5 crore an acre respectively, what makes the government offer land to IT companies at cheaper rates? The CM justified the haste by stating that the two companies would create 16,000 jobs in 2-3 years. May we know how this magic figure was arrived at?           
	Yours faithfully,

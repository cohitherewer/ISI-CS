	A poll reversal in India is always the precursor to a blame game within the party that has been defeated. The Communist Party of India (Marxist), with its much-flaunted doctrine of collective leadership, is not free from playing this game. Thus the comrades, when they met for their introspection immediately after their defeats in West Bengal and Kerala, divided themselves into opposed blocs. One lot argued that the defeats followed from local factors  in West Bengal, land acquisition, Nandigram, Singur and so on  and the other group held that it was the decision to withdraw support from the Congress-led government that resulted in the partys alienation from the Congress and the rout. What is self-evident is that the arguments of both groups are to an extent valid. It was the braiding of both the factors that explains the scale of the defeat suffered by the CPI(M). There was a pro-Congress wind all over India and this swelled the sails of local grievances. The latter, especially in the context of West Bengal, have been commented on. What neither side is commenting on is the fact that the communists withdrew support to Manmohan Singhs government because they felt the government was too pro-American. The partys ingrained anti-Americanism spurred on a crucial decision. This is an index of how antiquated the CPI(M) actually is.        
	The anachronistic streak within the CPI(M) is most evident in its organizational structure and its mode of functioning. The party is led and directed by its central committee and politburo. Both these bodies are elected only in the purely technical sense of the term. Both are derived from what is best described as manipulated electorates. Various front organizations of the party and even the various states have their quota. Only a handful of the members of the CPI(M)s highest decision-making bodies are actually elected representatives of the people. The present general secretary of the party  considered by many to be the most powerful man in the organization  has never faced a popular election. This makes the CPI(M)s decision-making far removed from the will of the people. The result of this is a collective decision that completely failed to read the popular mood. Small wonder the CPI(M) finds itself so marginalized today.        
	While the CPI(M) leadership introspects on its plight, it should also begin to review the structure of its organization. The model of a Leninist party does not work in a democracy. The CPI(M) should ensure that its central committee and politburo are manned largely, if not entirely, by elected representatives of the people. This alone will not guarantee success in elections. But it will introduce greater accountability and will eliminate decisions that have no basis in political reality.

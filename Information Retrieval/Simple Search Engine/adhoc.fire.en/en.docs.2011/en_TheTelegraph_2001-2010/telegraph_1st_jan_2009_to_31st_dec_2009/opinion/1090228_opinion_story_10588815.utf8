The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Letters to Editor
                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Bust the racket                  
	Sir  The Telegraphs sustained campaign against the polluting autorickshaws is much appreciated. This is what responsible journalism is all about. It would also be good to see the paper taking up the issue of the chaotic distribution network of LPG in the city. For years, gas distributors have got away with a number of irregularities  from the fixing of arbitrary booking and delivery rules to using unsuitable cylinders for distribution. The government has done nothing about it. Another campaign by The Telegraph will make a difference.          
	Yours faithfully,         Imtiaz Chowdhry, Calcutta
        
	Tied and tested          
	Sir  Of late, there have been numerous reports of physical abuse by school teachers. The recent one in Durgapur appears to be a routine case of senior teachers trying to discipline students (Teacher held for hair snip, Feb 19). Five girls in the school had their hair snipped off for not conforming to the schools dress code. The teacher, in this case, did not act out of a personal grudge, but was merely trying to instil a sense of discipline in the students, keeping in mind the larger interests of the school. In other instances, students have been beaten, abused and punished in some way or the other, and they have had more harrowing tales to tell.           
	Most of us who have studied in schools that put a great emphasis on discipline have had to face corporal punishment of some sort. However, our parents never took to the streets for they believed that deterrence in the form of punishment was in the interest of the child. The media too never reported such incidents unless they were of grave consequence. The publicity given to the conflict between parents and schools will encourage students to flout discipline and discourage teachers from intervening when needed out of fear of retribution.           
	To add to teachers woes, the right to education bill has been tabled in the Rajya Sabha that seeks to ban corporal punishment. This implies that teachers will risk punishment if they hurt or harass children. But if stopping the physical or mental abuse of children is the essence of the bill, it should be extended to other spheres, including the home, where children spend a large part of their time and where they are often abused by parents. The ban on punishment will have a negative impact on schools and will also create a rift between students and teachers.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
P. Bhattacharya, Ichapore, North 24 Parganas 

                
	Sir  The incident at the Gopalmath Girls High School in Durgapur was unfortunate. Though there exist no specific guidelines regarding dress codes in schools, the school authorities often impose severe restrictions on students. The moral policing the teacher indulged in by snipping off the hair of the students is abominable. Her response is a symptom of a deep sense of insecurity in the teacher. These incidents show that teachers can be literate, but not educated.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Subhayu Saha, Khagra, Murshidabad 

                
	Sir  Why did the Durgapur school insist on its students making two braids with their hair? What schools should emphasize are neatness and cleanliness. It is difficult for girls today to keep up with such inflexible regulations. I have myself often been late for school because I have had to tie my hair in this fashion. What the teacher has done in Gopalmath School is reprehensible. Such actions often have a severe psychological impact on children. Verbal counselling, and not physical abuse, is the most effective deterrent.                    
	Yours faithfully,

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Over fish and Pork
                                                                                                                 OVER FISH AND PORK                                  Neha Sahay                              
	Which society treats its poor worse  China or India? Over a delicious Sichuan meal of steamed fish and minced pork with buns, this topic was the focus of heated discussion between a group of Chinese and Indians. The Indians didnt have much to say  all the Chinese had seen Slumdog Millionaire and couldnt believe that such levels of existence prevailed in cities such as Mumbai. Still, it was a shock to them to know that in Mumbai, thousands of households depend on the earnings of women who work as domestics and earn the equivalent of 600 yuan a month. Thats now the minimum wage a migrant worker gets in China, and it excludes dormitory accommodation and one meal of rice, meat and vegetables. The long process of elections in India has sparked off such discussions among young Chinese who have otherwise been pretty apolitical. You have democracy, they say; you can change your government every five years. Has it been good for you?         
	Most urban youngsters know that India is far poorer than their own country. Thats as much a reality for them as the facts that Indians speak English far better than they do and that Indians are computer freaks. Indians may be poor, but they are happy, said one. Your soul hasnt been destroyed like ours was by Mao. China had a well-established system of ethics that had worked for thousands of years. Elders were respected; honesty was valued. When Mao started his evil Cultural Revolution that rejected Confucius, he destroyed the spiritual side of China.                
	Far away        
	Thats not an isolated view. Surprisingly, many university- educated, well-off youngsters feel that Confucius shaped Chinese society far better than Mao did. They long for the values their grandparents were brought up with and despise the Cultural Revolution. Children turned against their own parents; families lost trust in one another. All that mattered was the Supreme Leader and his Party. We are still paying the price for that amorality. The Chinese government talks only about our 10 per cent GDP growth rate; the Chinese today worship only money.        
	Thats why only in China can baby food be poisoned with chemicals! In India, you still have the fear of God to prevent you doing all this, said one Chinese fashion designer angrily. Perhaps a bit too much, commented one Indian wryly. Maybe, we need a Mao. The shock was palpable. Finally, one woman broke the silence. Mao was evil. He didnt help the poor; he just took them for a ride. He asked them to join him in his fight and promised them a better future. But they got nothing out of the Revolution. Mao took away everyones land and kept it with the Party. The poor remained hungry.        
	Aghast that whole tracts in India are now under the control of Maoists, the Chinese shook their heads. Dont make the mistakes we did. So, how should Indias poor get their liberation? Only one person had the answer. And it would have gladdened the heart of every pious Hindu. Your condition depends on the good deeds your ancestors did. We see the poor suffering; we dont know how much their ancestors made others suffer. It was the turn of the Indians to look amazed. What surprised them more was that this belief was being ascribed to Buddhism. Many Chinese believe that Buddhism teaches fatalism and ascribes everything to ones ancestors deeds. So how would you explain the good life enjoyed by Chinese Communist Party leaders today, many of whom are corrupt, asked an Indian. The answer came from a youngster who hates his government: Maybe their ancestors did some good deeds; we will never know. Only the fish bones and lettuce leaves were left; the minced pork had been wiped clean. As the waitresses kept topping up the tea cups, silence reigned. The poor, Indian or Chinese, seemed far away.

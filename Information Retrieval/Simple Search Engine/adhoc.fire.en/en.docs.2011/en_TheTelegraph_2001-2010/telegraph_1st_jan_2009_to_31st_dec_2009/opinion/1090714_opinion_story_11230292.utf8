The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | skin deep
                                                                                                                 SKIN DEEP                                                                  
	How far can education take us? Education and the ability to earn? For Ratna, the trainee nurse who killed herself last month in Durgapur where she worked in a private hospital, evidently not far enough. Yet many girls would have liked to be in Ratnas position, especially if they came, as she did, from a well-to-do farmers family. Or maybe not. Ratna had one overwhelming flaw: her skin was dark. No girl in Bengal would want to exchange places with her, the girl who grew up to be 23 with painful memories of being called Ma Kali in school. Now no one would marry her. That is why she killed herself. Had she been a man, there would have been no story.        
	Education did not give Ratna the confidence to turn the mocking appellation into an assertion of personality. But the colour of her skin might have mattered less to her had she not been also taught that marriage is a girls sole destiny. Rural education is still a struggle; clearly it does not extend much beyond syllabus-specific needs. The exposure to other values and possibilities that one associates with education remains elusive; first-generation learners push themselves through school alternating between tutors and working in the fields. Even if they want to reach out into the world through books, libraries are rare. Oppressive attitudes and beliefs, never easy to dislodge, thus become persistent, always finding new reasons to survive. A girl was never welcome; much less a dark girl. Now that every TV programme is punctuated by girls changing their skin tones from normal to incredible versions of whiteness in seven days, the old, crude attitude to dark skin is rejuvenated. Ratna could not have escaped the attitude, or her own skin.        
	Having a dark-skinned girl in the family opens up the household to insulting inconsideration as well. A week before Ratna was to be married to a teacher in Birbhum, the would-be grooms family returned the dowry of Rs 80,000 and called off the marriage. The girl was too dark. Perhaps they should be lauded for not taking the dowry and the girl, and then killing her. But their decision was late enough for Ratnas parents to have committed themselves socially and, to some extent, economically as well. No household sets up a wedding on the last day.        
	But a teacher was to have married Ratna. What will he teach his pupils? That a nurse was useless if she did not have the right skin? That Rs 80,000 was the going rate for teachers in that area, but even then he needed a better bargain? These are commonplaces, but for how long are our teachers going to continue giving and living these lessons? Ratna wrote in her last note that she was freeing her family from the embarrassing burden of getting a groom for her. There had been too many refusals. But she must have known that she could be self-sufficient. She was obviously unable to fight the pressure to get married, which she may even have accepted as natural or desirable, and unable to escape the shame and guilt that attached to the formal, social, effect of her dark skin.         
	How strange that there was no friend, no teacher, no caring adult, who could have convinced Ratna that she was a clever, successful girl, and nothing else mattered in the world.                    BHASWATI CHAKRAVORTY

	Peoples power                  
	Sir  Andr Bteilles article, The electoral process (April 14), was educative and absorbing. It is not that Bteille has said anything extraordinary in the article. But he has given a new meaning to the concept of democracy in the context of the recent developments in India.          
	General elections, right from the first one in 1951-52, have made and unmade the fates of various contending political parties. Despite enjoying uninterrupted power all over India for a pretty long period since Independence, the Congress lost its monopoly to disparate regional parties later. The survival of the Indian democracy in spite of ups and downs such as this speaks volumes about its resilience. Elections afford ample opportunities for voters to discuss and deliberate on the burning issues of the day. The candidates, irrespective of their social and political standing, have no alternative but to accept the peoples mandate. The people must also keep in mind that once they vote a government to power, they cannot change it until another election is held after five years.          
	However, elections today are no longer what they were in the years after the countrys transformation into a republic. Friendly fights have given way to brawls that sometimes result in irreconcilable animosity. This years general elections in particular saw the pre-poll scene being turned into a battlefield with rival parties engaged in do or die fights. Campaigning has now become a vicious and raucous affair. Every leader is engaged in character assassinations. Their public speeches violate the codes of conduct set by the Election Commission. Nobody, not even senior and veteran leaders, is bothered about maintaining a modicum of decency while electioneering. I think that the media  the electronic media in particular  have a tendency to make matters worse by highlighting, even twisting, allegations hurled by contesting parties at one another without judging their veracity.           
	Bteille has reasons to be upset by such disturbing trends in Indian politics. His disappointment becomes apparent in the second part of the article. His reference to the remarks by a driver in Mumbai about the attacks on Christians by a particular political group and to Varun Gandhis speech in Pilibhit speak a lot about his injured feelings. He justifiably rues the degeneration of a healthy political system. The health of Indian democracy will continue to be at stake unless self-seeking and parochial political leaders are reined in. The elections this time will prove to be a litmus test for our democracy.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
P.B. Saha, Calcutta

                
	Sir  In The electoral process, Andr Bteille writes about the best as well as the worst scenarios that prevail during Indian elections. For Bteille, elections are inevitable expressions of the universal adult franchise guaranteed by the Constitution, which ensures freedom of expression to all citizens. But elections also have certain negative aspects, which become evident in the hate speeches delivered by various opportunistic politicians against their opponents. When party leaders begin to bicker among themselves or attack particular communities, sensible promises and effective action get overshadowed by identity-cum-vote-bank politics. But why does identity politics provide the only possible route for politicians of all parties to attract the attention of the masses? It proves that rural people, who make up the biggest chunk of the electorate, are ignorant about the realities. This lack of knowledge makes them vulnerable to the politics of speeches delivered by the likes of Varun Gandhi or L.K. Advani.          
	Although political leaders make a lot of promises while campaigning, most of them fail to keep them when they are in power. If one ponders the reasons behind this gap between pledges and reality, one will realize that in the 62 years since Independence, Indian politics has been dominated by ruthless administrators who have sought power at the cost of public welfare. A few young, honest and scrupulous Rahul Gandhis, Omar Abdullahs, Jyotiraditya Scindias or Sachin Pilots would be incapable of ripping the corruption net and leading the nation towards progress.           
	The situation has worsened to such a degree that only a mass revolt can reverse the trend. And the media alone can bring this about by creating awareness among the villagers who constitute a major part of Indias population. Why is it that only educated, urban people with knowledge of English are able to enjoy English journals while the poor are left at the mercy of vernacular tabloids that spew political venom? I think that by not trying to bridge disparities, elite citizens are being as negligent of their duties towards the Indian State as the ruthless dictators at the helm.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Too few good men          
	Sir  My sister had applied for a passport at the Calcutta office. I was not aware of this fact until a casually dressed gentleman stopped by our residence and began questioning me about my father. I answered him patiently, and when he was ready to leave, I enquired about the purpose of his visit. He said that he was an inspector and had come to complete the customary verification for my sisters passport. I then welcomed him inside our house. For the next few minutes, he grilled me about my own situation. Then he asked exactly four questions about my sister, whose name I had to spell out thrice to him. Within a minute the verification was over. Then he said point blank, I have done my job, now its your turn. In case I had any doubt about what he meant, he explained that these processes require money, which I should provide. I declined to give him the bribe. The man walked out after threatening that the application would gather dust.          
	Having destroyed her chances to get the passport, I asked my sister for forgiveness. She informed me that her application has expired long ago since police verification had not been completed within a year, and added that she would have to re-apply for her passport and make payments afresh. My father is a retired clerk. He has never once asked for bribe while in service. Our parents have made immense sacrifices throughout their lives to educate us. But it seems that the ideals they lived by have become obsolete. The few good men left today might soon be eliminated following Darwins law if they do not learn how to live in these corrupt times.           
	Yours faithfully, R.N. Dutta, Dhanbad

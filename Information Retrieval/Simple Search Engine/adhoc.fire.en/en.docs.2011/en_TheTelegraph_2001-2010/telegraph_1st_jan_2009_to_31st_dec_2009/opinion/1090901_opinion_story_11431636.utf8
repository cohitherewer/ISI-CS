The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | the short view
                                                                                                                 THE SHORT VIEW                                                    
	Cricket lovers know that a second innings is always off to a slower start than the first. This is especially true of a side that is keen to consolidate its victory. Manmohan Singh in his second tenure as prime minister finds himself exactly in that situation. He began his second innings after an unexpectedly handsome victory in the hustings. Immediately, there was a rise in expectations. Mr Singh somewhat spurred these on by trying to set an agenda for the first 100 days. On the completion of that first landmark, it would appear that the performance of the United Progressive Alliance government has fallen short of the hopes it had aroused. It can be argued that time was out of joint for the government to deliver on most of its promises. When this government took its oath of office, the economy was going through an unprecedented downturn; very soon, the country faced a drought; and there was a panic about the flu epidemic. What is remarkable is that Mr Singh and his team of ministers have been able to overcome, at least in some spheres, these very adverse circumstances. The economy, aided by the governments stimulus package, is showing signs of recovery. The fears about the epidemic have turned out to be less than real. More importantly, in the fields of education and rural development, some crucial programmes have been announced. The prime minister can also take credit for preparing the ground for normalizing relations with Pakistan without compromising on Indias firm stand against terrorism that originates in Pakistan.        
	No one expects completion of major projects in 100 days. But those that have been started will now come under the scanner. What is cause for concern is the official indifference to issues of governance. The mess that surrounds the extraction of gas from the Krishna-Godavari basin is one example of the governments failure to take a decision on a critical matter. This is not unrelated to the governments neglect of the promise to usher in a new era of transparency and accountability. There is the general perception that there isnt a strong enough hand on the rudder to provide direction. Mr Singh conveys the impression that he is running on inertia and then he erases that impression by taking a very firm stand on a crucial issue. This style of functioning is deceptive and often exasperating for those who make it their job to watch Mr Singh.

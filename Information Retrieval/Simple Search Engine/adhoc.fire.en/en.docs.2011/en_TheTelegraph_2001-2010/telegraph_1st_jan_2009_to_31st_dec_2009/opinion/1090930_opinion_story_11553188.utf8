The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | on the tarmac
                                                                                                                 ON THE TARMAC                                                    
	What the private sector did yesterday, the public sector does tomorrow. The pilots of Jet Airways showed the way for the executive pilots of Air India to go on strike. The causes of the two strikes are very different though. The pilots of Jet Airways were protesting against the sacking of some of their colleagues. The Air India pilots have struck work because they do not approve of the decision taken by the management to cut productivity-linked incentives by upto half. In spite of the similarity in the actions, it needs to be pointed out that a few months earlier the Jet Airways pilots had accepted, without a murmur, a 50 per cent salary cut in the wake of enormous losses suffered by the company. The government-run airline, Air India, has an accumulated loss of over Rs 7,000 crore. The executive pilots obviously think that this is not a good enough reason to take a cut in their earnings. The consequent face-off between the pilots and the management (read the government) has created a most unpleasant situation as no solution seems to be in sight. In fact, both sides have hardened their respective positions. The sufferers are the passengers and the gainers, ironically, are those who are the rivals of Air India in business, the private airlines.        
	It can be said without any undue exaggeration that the strike by the pilots has not drawn a great deal of sympathy. There is something anomalous in the argument in favour of salaries that are equal to those offered by the private sector and a refusal to accept some of the terms and conditions that go with employment in the private sector. No one can deny that radical measures are required  and these include drastic cost cuts  to reduce the colossal losses that Air India continues to accumulate. It is over-staffed and possibly even overpaid. In keeping with the airlines original symbol  the Maharaja  it has been run over the years like a huge feudal estate with no drive towards profit maximization. At the heart of this contradiction is of course the idea of a State owning an airline. In keeping with the logic of this contradiction, the present mess  the losses of which the strike is only a fallout  has to be resolved through State intervention. The pilots must realize that cost cutting is an inevitable, if unpleasant, aspect of running a business in a period of severe recession. A strike solves nothing. It only aggravates the problem and leads to an incalculable loss of goodwill.

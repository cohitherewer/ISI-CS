                                                                                                                 MARK ON FINGER                                                    
	When India decided in 1950 that it would be a democratic republic with full adult franchise, the world was amazed at the gamble. It was widely seen as a leap into the uncertain. That cloud of uncertainty has now disappeared. The people of India have fulfilled the trust that the founding fathers of the republic had reposed in them. No one can deny that conducting a general election in India is a mind-boggling exercise, and by far the biggest experiment with democracy in the world. Just the bare figures suggest this: 714 million people voted; there were 8.34 lakh polling stations; 46.9 lakh polling personnel were deployed; 119 trains did poll duty and 55 helicopters flew 600 sorties. These statistics do not tell us how many buses and cars were used, how many electronic voting machines were used, and, most important, how many miles some of the voters walked to cast their ballot. Whatever the outcome of the polls, the last one month has demonstrated the administrative competence of the Election Commission. The elections to the 15th Lok Sabha, like the polls to the previous ones, represent a triumph of the popular will. The people of India want to vote, and this is the best safeguard of Indian democracy.        
	The smooth completion of elections is, of course, only the necessary condition for the functioning of a successful democracy. The point is important, because the just-concluded elections witnessed the death of 37 persons and the arrest of more than 37,000 people. Indians need to ask themselves why these deaths and arrests took place. Why have elections in India come to be associated with violence? The fact that the incidence of violence has come down does not answer the question why there should be any violence during elections. Violence is indicative that even today political parties do not hesitate to use force and coercion even while participating in a democratic exercise. More people in India are becoming part of the democratic process, but this is not necessarily a reflection of the awareness of the norms and conventions of democracy. Adult franchise made India the biggest democracy in the world, but maturity has been slow in coming. The sense of joy in completing a general election is almost always accompanied by a sense of relief. This is not to belittle the tremendous achievement of the EC and the people of India but to point to the challenges that lie ahead.

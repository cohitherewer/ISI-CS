	Rewarding technologically savvy teachers with laptops is easier than realizing the now-buried dream of one laptop per child. National recognition for the best teachers already has a history; it may now be enriched by awards for teachers considered best in the use of information and communication technology in class. This is one of the many plans of the human resource development ministry, and is aimed at providing an incentive to use technology as a teaching aid in the classroom. The proposed national award for teachers in ICT is undoubtedly welcome, for it is meant to promote a fresh approach to teaching. It also has a touch of glamour about it. Apart from a certificate, medal and laptop computer, a winning teacher would get a lunch with the prime minister and dinner with the president. Thrilling as all this sounds, it is impossible not to ask a few questions.        
	What exactly is technology? Certainly, computers, LCD projectors, audio-visual tools, multimedia and so on, but maybe there are a few other, less exciting, bits of technology that are being overlooked in the excitement. A functioning bathroom, or a system supplying pure drinking water, for example, also employs technology. There are numerous schools in India which do not have these. A bathroom or drinking water may not be a teaching tool, but to say that is to duck the issue. What kind of innovation or freshness of approach is needed for teachers in such schools to prevent children from dropping out because of illness, discomfort, or simply for having to go in the open air during school hours? Even if these teachers wanted to use ICT in class, is the HRD ministry sure they would have the electricity to make that possible? Yet India has no dearth of marvellous teachers in its remotest corners, although Indians have not yet learnt how to be proud of teachers. Where nothing is available, teachers innovate: creating models and evolving lessons with whatever is to hand, using technology with no one around to applaud them. It is not easy. They have to teach in between the daily duties of doling out the right measure of grain for the midday meal and totting up the accounts, and being periodically hauled out of school to attend to duties in election booths and survey centres. Without grudging anyone the best-use-of-technology prize, the HRD ministry should admit that the field for nomination is a limited one. Maybe there are other teachers who deserve different awards.

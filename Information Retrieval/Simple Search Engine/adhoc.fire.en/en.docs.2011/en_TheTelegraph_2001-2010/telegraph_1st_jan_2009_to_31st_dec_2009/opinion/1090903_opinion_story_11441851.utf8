                                                                                                                 DO IT NOW                                                    
	The call for change may have been Mamata Banerjees idea to unseat him, but Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee now has an opportunity to use it to redeem his governments image. If he is serious about probing the illegal land deals involving the promoters of the Vedic Village, he should begin by removing his land reforms minister, Abdur Rezzak Mollah. For a justification of such an action, the chief minister needs to look no farther than the ministers own explanation of his departments role in the land deal. What Mr Mollah has said about the deal is clearly an attempt at defending the indefensible. What his department did was legally and morally wrong on several counts. His defence of the out-of-court settlement that he approved for the transfer of the land is simply untenable. It not only shows the ministers lack of trust in the due process of law, but also raises questions about motives behind the deal. His explanation raises more questions than it answers. One such question is why his department chose to vest the land and then lease it to the promoters of not an industry or a public utility such as a hospital or a power station, but a resort. Much more damning is the fact that the price at which the land was given to the promoters was incredibly lower than the market rate.         
	What is at stake is much more than Mr Mollahs personal honesty. Questions can legitimately be raised, though, on why he chose to visit the spa at the resort. Since he knew the murky background of the land transfer more than anyone else, he, of all people, should have been careful to avoid visiting the place. His visits must have given the land deal a stamp of approval and emboldened not just these promoters but also others in the business to flout the law. By removing Mr Mollah from his cabinet, the chief minister can achieve two things. First, he can restore probity in all land transactions. This is important because land is going to be a crucial issue in the transformation of Bengals economy. Despite the failure of Singur and its political fall-out, the use of farmland for industrialization is not an issue for partisan politics. Action against Mr Mollah may send out a signal about his intentions. Second, such action can help change the growing impression that Mr Bhattacharjee presides over a non-functioning government. Better governance, and not street politics, is his only hope for a comeback.

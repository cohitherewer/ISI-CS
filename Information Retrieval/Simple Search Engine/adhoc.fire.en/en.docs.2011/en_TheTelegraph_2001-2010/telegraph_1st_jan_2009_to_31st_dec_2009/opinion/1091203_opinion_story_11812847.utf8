The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | failing the test
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        FAILING THE TEST                                                    
	With the IIMs making a mess of the online CAT, and the West Bengal assembly suspended for more than a week because the new mikes do not work, the country seems to be on a regressive high. The institutes of management are quietly toying with the idea of pen-and-paper re-tests; and although it may be quite alright for legislators to be throwing furniture at one another, screaming every day is bad for the Constitution. In each case, the unreadiness is all  and unreadiness of a rather shameful kind. The state assembly and the IIMs are, in their own way, premier institutions. The latter, especially, are supposed to be excellent (and expensive) at teaching people how to manage complex situations smartly. So, the best way to go about damage control could be with not passing the buck (for once) and with learning the right lessons from such a goof-up.        
	The people who matter, and have suffered, most in the CAT fiasco are the candidates. To them, what excuses Prometric makes as the IT firm entrusted with computerizing the test do not matter. Those who are truly accountable to the candidates are the testing authorities, and in that, the IIMs have failed to maintain the highest standards of professional decorum. Not only have the authorities not been up to the technological demands of the tests, but they have also mishandled the management of the ensuing crisis and its aftermath. Simply being in efficient and transparent communication with the inconvenienced candidates would have been better for the IIM brand than being unapologetic and evasive about taking responsibility. These qualities, combined with inefficiency, do not bode well for the pursuit of excellence, which is supposed to be the IIM hallmark. Retro-managers and muted legislators have some serious updating to do if they do not want to look flustered by technology that is not even particularly cutting-edge.

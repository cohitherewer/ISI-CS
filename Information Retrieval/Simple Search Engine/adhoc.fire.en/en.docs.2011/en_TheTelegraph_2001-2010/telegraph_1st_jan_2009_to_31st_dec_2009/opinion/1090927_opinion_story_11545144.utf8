	 The corridors of power in Haryana are rife with rumours, now that the elections are drawing near. The latest buzz is that the Haryana chief minister, Bhupinder Singh Hooda, has patched up with his first cousin and former rival, Virender Singh, who had once formed an anti-Hooda alliance with a few other leaders. But what has made Singh kiss and make up with Hooda? Apparently, the deal is that the CM will help him win the Uchana Kalan seat against Om Prakash Chautala. In return, Singh will support Hoodas claim to the chief ministers chair. The improved fraternal ties may spell trouble for Chautala who chose Uchana Kalan over Narwana to take advantage of the Hooda-Singh rivalry. Chautala will be glad to know that he has the Ellenabad seat to fall back on if things go wrong in Uchana Kalan. Hooda too will be relieved to note that for once, blood seems to be thicker than the choppy waters of politics.          
	 Remember Lalu Prasads claim to be some sort of a management guru when he was railways minister? Well, Nitish Kumar, the present CM, is equally skilled in managing tricky affairs. Kumar has worked his magic over the media in Bihar. As a result, the fourth estate in Bihar hardly writes anything against Kumar. Some are of the opinion that apart from the scribes, Kumar has also managed to win over the formidable didi. As evidence, they cite the fact that Mamata Banerjee, the present railways minister, started to crack the whip against her predecessor soon after a meeting with Kumar. One wonders whether Lalu Prasad will be able to manage this problem.          
	 The home minister, P Chidambaram, is keeping an eye not just on the security of the people, but also on the attendance of the staff in the North Block. Reportedly, PC has installed biometric attendance control systems to ensure that the staff stay for the stipulated working hours. Chidambaram has led the pack by using the state-of-the-art attendance system while entering or leaving office. If anyone reports late to work  on account of heavy traffic or other reasons  he or she is expected to put in extra hours in the evening. But the home ministers plan is not quite foolproof. He is yet to devise a method to discipline those who are too lazy to finish the tasks while at work. PC, it seems, has his work cut out on this one.          
	 Rahul Gandhis visit to Tamil Nadu to revive the Congress turned out to be a damp squib. The reason? The AICC gen-sec in charge of Tamil Nadu, Ghulam Nabi Azad, keeping in mind the issue of Rahul Gandhis security, had organized a public meeting on the premises of the Coimbatore Institute of Technology that can accommodate 50,000 people. But the TNCC chief, GK Vasan, and the Union home minister scuttled Azads well-laid plans by forcing him to change the venue. The CIT, we hear, is owned by R Prabhu, a fellow Congress leader and former MP, and there was no way in which he could be allowed to claim the credit for organizing a successful meeting for Rahul Gandhi. According to IB reports, only 7,000 people attended the meeting at the new venue. Before hoping to resurrect the party, shouldnt Rahul think of putting his divided house in order first?                
	 Still on Rahul Gandhi. Sometime back, he took a ride on the Shatabdi, leaving a trail of questions behind him. The Opposition dubbed the austerity move a token gesture. His supporters raised queries about his security after stones were hurled at the train. An answer, albeit a hilarious one, has been found about the stoning incident. Conspiracy theorists insist that the security agencies were behind the mischief to stop the young parliamentarian from travelling in trains in future. That way, the threat of a terror strike on the young Congressman would be considerably diminished, which, we think, will also mean far less work for the securitymen.           
	 This Eid, guests dressed in sherwanis and kurta-pyjamas thronged to Shahnawaz Hussains house for the sumptuous non-vegetarian food and sweets. At Salman Khurshids do, guests in fancy suits outnumbered those wearing traditional dresses. More proof of the BJP and the Congress playing by different rules.

	 A different kind of politics is evident on the sets of Prakash Jhas new film, Rajniti. Last heard, the lead pair of Ranbir Kapoor and Katrina Kaif got along a bit too well for Kapoors good friend, Deepika Padukone, who was forced to spend countless hours on the sets although she had no part to play in the film. With Padukone around, the Kapoor lad had to mend his ways. Instead of the friendly peck, he is supposed to have greeted Kaif with an equally warm Hi. For the record, Padukones presence did little to alter the behaviour of either the actress or her director who went about their business in dead seriousness. Neither was Padukone the only well-wisher lurking on the sets. Unit members swear that they had spotted a close associate-cum-bodyguard of Salman Khan who, we are told, was sent to ensure that all was well with Kaif.

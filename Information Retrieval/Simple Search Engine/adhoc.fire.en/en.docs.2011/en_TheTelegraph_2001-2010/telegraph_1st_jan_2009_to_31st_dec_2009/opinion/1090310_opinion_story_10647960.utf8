                                                                                                                 LOOK INTO THE FUTURE                                  MALA FIDE - Malvika Singh                              
	Naveen Patnaik has broken his alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party and has decided to contest both for the assembly and the Lok Sabha elections with his new yet ageing, stuck-in-a-time-warp partner, the Left Front. Why did the chief minister of Orissa and his Biju Janata Dal not consider joining hands with the Congress, since they share the same basic values of working for the aam aadmi in an inclusive and secular manner, and also because the primary leaders of both the parties are there to carry forward the endeavours begun by their predecessors? In my book, there is nothing wrong in carrying forward the professional equity of ones father and in doing it with diligence and commitment.        
	However, the arithmetic could work either way. The bifurcation of the BJP-BJD could give the Congress a comfortable edge despite the fact that the party has been in comparative doldrums in Orissa. If this assumption proves to be correct, Patnaik could stand to lose the assembly as well. On the other hand, the calculation of the incumbent party could be that the BJP votes will now merge into those of the BJD and give the latter a clear edge. And, with the support of a few Left members, Naveen Patnaik could comfortably rule Orissa yet again, without repetitions of last years deadly communal disruptions.        
	Prakash and Brinda Karat, excited by the prospect of the birth of their carefully nurtured brainchild, christened the Third Front even before it has seen the light of day, are busy preparing the the grand durbar where all the regional wazirs will make an emphatic, joint statement, extending their tacit support to this future collective. The other scenario is that the United Progressive Alliance may well cobble the numbers together and make either Lalu Prasad or the forever aspiring Sharad Pawar the prime minister of their disparate joint venture, hoping thereby to draw support from the Naveen Patnaiks, the Jayalalithaas, and of course, the Nationalist Congress Party, all of whom could either join the government or support it from outside like the Left, holding a sword over the neck of the cabinet.                
	Filthy lucre        
	Having said this, confusion prevails and nobody knows or can hazard a guess about what may happen in May when the the final results come out. The political players themselves do not seem to have much sense of the ground reality either, particularly because they have no clue about the predilection of the large percentage of voters who are entering the fray for the first time to cast their critical votes. The candidates of the 2009 elections are fast becoming the victims of their own rhetoric, paying no heed to the sound of silence around them.         
	When will our politicians cease to act in a predictable manner? Who will lead the political class away from the politics of blackmail, nepotism and corruption, ease India out of the morass it has been pushed into by fragmented political dispensations in which each ally used the power vested in it to build its personal empires at the cost of the nation? Many were permitted to do so by the various ruling chief executives, the PMs and CMs in charge at different times, all in an effort to keep compromised coalitions alive. They allowed and condoned rampant misrule and managed to retain power by turning a blind eye to the partners illegal acts.        
	Since the Congress seems to be isolated from the political shenanigans being played around us, and since no one seems to want it as a partner, except to create a ground for itself in a way that has nothing to do with true coalition politics, the party should put up 500 candidates across the country and reassert itself as a potential national force and rebuild its shattered edifice. This is the appropriate time to do so. It has nothing to lose except the politics of filthy lucre.

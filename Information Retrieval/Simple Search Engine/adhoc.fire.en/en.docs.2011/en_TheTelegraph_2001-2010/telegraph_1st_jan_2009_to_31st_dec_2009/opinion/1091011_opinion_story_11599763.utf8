The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Fall of a standard
                                                                                                                 FALL OF A STANDARD                                                          
	There is a popular television serial in the United States of America called Everybody Loves Raymond. It could now be slightly altered to read Everybody loves Obama. Only the committee that awards the Nobel Peace Prize loves him more than everyone else. This is the most polite explanation that can be provided for giving to the present US president the Nobel Peace prize. Barack Obama took oath as president barely nine months ago. Before that he was only a senator. The question that is legitimately being asked is, what has Mr Obama done to deserve this singular honour? Under his presidency, the US has not withdrawn a single soldier from anywhere in the world. There are no major peace initiatives in place that can be described as having originated with Mr Obama. In fact, steps are being considered to increase the number of US troops in Afghanistan. Yet Mr Obama is the winner of the coveted prize. It is tempting to suggest that one reason he has got the award is because he is the president of the worlds most powerful country. In an era of political correctness, it is also easy to imagine that the fact that Mr Obama is the first coloured president of the US influenced the views of the committee.        
	If such reasoning is too cynical, the alternative is to argue that the Nobel committee has confused promise with achievement, that it has been swayed by Mr Obamas very powerful rhetoric. Mr Obama in his various speeches and pronouncements has put forward to the Americans and to the world the vision of an international community that is committed to peace and goodwill. He has outlined a world order under the leadership of the US that is free from nuclear arms and religious violence. He believes that it is possible to build a globalized order that is fair and equitable. He has held out in his speeches the hand of friendship to the believers of Islam who had all been condemned by the West as bigots and fanatics. It cannot be denied that Mr Obamas rhetoric is new and powerful just as his vision of the future is moving and inspiring. But all this has not added up to very much in terms of concrete achievement. Mr Obama has been awarded a Nobel Prize for intentions, not for accomplishments. He had the option of telling the committee that he could not accept the award because he had miles to walk before he actually deserved it. Such a denial would have enhanced his goodwill and made him a real hero. By accepting the prize, Mr Obama has cut himself down to size: he is a hero with his feet mired in greed and self-promotion.        
	The brunt of the criticism has to be borne, however, by the Nobel committee that decides on the peace prize. It has demeaned the prize that is viewed by most people as the ultimate honour in certain chosen fields. By awarding the peace prize to one who has done nothing so far to deserve it, the members have made the Nobel Peace prize look utterly ludicrous. It will be very difficult to take it seriously after this.

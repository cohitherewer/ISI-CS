The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Cloaked in mystery
                                                                                                                 CLOAKED IN MYSTERY                              THEATRE      Ananda Lal                                                
	How well does typically Bengali literature transfer into other Indian languages on stage? We had two opportunities to test this over the past fortnight, as an incarnation of Byomkesh Baksi walked the boards of English theatre for the first time and Badal Sircar took on a new Hindi avatar. Checkmate, inspired by the adventures of Saradindu Bandyopadhyays famous sleuth, marked the Calcutta debut of Pandoras Act, set up in Bangalore by Srijit Mukherji who has now relocated to the city. On the basis of Checkmate, we welcome the arrival of this group, which should inject greater variety into our English-language theatre.         
	Mukherji seems fond of translating Bengali drama and cinema on to the English stage  something that Calcuttas English groups have curiously, but studiously, avoided. Most importantly, Mukherji does not labour under the outdated and artificial notion that a play must be in one language. He mixes Bengali with English in his dialogue, like most of us do in reality, so that we gradually suspend our initial disbelief on hearing bhadralok in dhotis conversing in English. We should accept more Benglish drama, as long as it retains credibility.        
	Mukherjis plotting of this murder mystery may not impress detective aficionados for he recycles methods that we have seen elsewhere. The deliberate showing of one character to anothers sight so as to plant suspicion on the former recalls plays like Anthony Shaffers Murderer. The final twist, exposing the narrators own culpability, harks back to Agatha Christies Roger Ackroyd. Mukherji holds our interest in the way he shuttles back and forth not only in time but also from the inner crime to his armchair heros own family tragedy and the outer frame of his sidekick dramatizing this particular case, and even further to their inclusion of the audience sitting in the front row to watch the play unfold  a lot like Pirandello. This goes to the clever extent of discussing the reason for English as medium, and its answer: so that non-Bengalis can appreciate the ersatz Byomkeshs genius.        
	The seasoned actors, some of them from Bengali theatre, brought their talents to the table. Mukherji himself (picture) gave the most natural performance as the investigators apparently very ordinary friend. Aporup Acharya, called in to take the lead role with two weeks to go, fumbled with his lines but maintained the heros strong personality. Senjuti Roy Mukherjee played an alienated wife mourning the killing of her Naxal son. As the murdered mans children, Trina Banerjee, Daminee Mukherjee and Anubrata Basu, unfortunately, tended to recede, distanced from us by the placing of their set upstage. However, Biswajit Chakraborty (their manservant), a real vet, overcame this hurdle with his experience simply by projecting. Joyraaj Bhattacharyas predominantly top lighting picked off the stark grey-and-white costume designs.        
	Mystery, though of a metaphysical nature, also underlies Sircars Sara Rattir, one of his three mid-career works, including his previous classic, Evam Indrajit, which, he says, he wrote unpremeditatedly, as if possessed by a spirit. That ghost virtually appears in the play as the old man who emerges seemingly out of nowhere in a deserted building where a couple takes shelter during heavy rain. Pratibha Agarwal translated it into Hindi faithfully as Sari Rat, which Sheo Kumar Jhunjhunwala has now directed for Proscenium.        
	Jhunjhunwala creates a few genuinely scary moments at the beginning, as Bilu Duttas dark, brooding interior gets illuminated by Joy Sens flashes of lightning and voices reverberate inside, but after the old owner enters, the effects wear off as a result of some staid acting spoilt further by audible prompting in the second half. Anjum Rizvis down-to-earth portrayal of the husband cannot stand up to the combined stiffness of Rajashree Gaggar (the wife) and Dilip Dave (the old man). Dave behaves too straitjacketed, as a bourgeois Bengali garbed in starched chadar and dhoti, to convey his originally enigmatic presence.        
	Most problematically, the Bengali associations of Ranjan (whom the woman names as her lover) and echoes of lines from Tagores Raktakarabi are utterly lost in Hindi. Consequently, the couples harrowing psychological introspection and anagnorisis, precipitated by apparently supernatural intervention, fall flat on at least two counts.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | words as signs
                                                                                                                 WORDS AS SIGNS                                                    
	If words could make for industrialization, then West Bengal today would be twice industrialized. There was first the rhetoric of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and the effort, now failed, to bring industry to the state. At present, there is the rhetoric and the promise of Mamata Banerjee, who, with every good reason, sees herself as the chief-minister-in-waiting. Words, however, are good vehicles for sending out signals. Mr Bhattacharjees words, three or four years ago, had completely altered perceptions about West Bengal among potential investors. This was replaced by despondency after the departure of Tata Motors from Singur. Despondency is again turning into hope with the words of Ms Banerjee. She is making it very clear that she is not against industry. Behind her words and promises perhaps lies the realization that without industrialization there cannot be any growth or progress in West Bengal. Mr Bhattacharjee, in his time, had also arrived at a similar conclusion. It would not be unreasonable to suggest that this is the reality of West Bengal that has to be accepted by anyone who wants to lead the state out of the morass.        
	The critical question is the mode of making words into action. Or the issue of implementation. It goes without saying that industry needs land. To this extent, industry and agriculture are incompatible. Land for industry cannot but come from what is today agricultural land. Ms Banerjee has taken a political stand against the forcible acquisition of farmland by the State. She will have to devise a policy to facilitate the transfer of land from agriculture to industry. The preponderance of small and fragmented holdings and the proliferation of land rights have hindered the growth of a proper land market in West Bengal. Any industrialist will always need a consolidated unit of land to build a manufacturing plant. He may find it impossible to purchase the land required for such a venture from innumerable small holders and to cope with innumerable holders of usufructuary rights. Ms Banerjee, despite her best intentions and promises, will have to face some tough decisions. More importantly, society in West Bengal has to decide on the premium it places on industrialization and its inevitable price. In the beginning is the word, but it has always to be followed by the deed. Without the latter words come back to haunt those who utter them.

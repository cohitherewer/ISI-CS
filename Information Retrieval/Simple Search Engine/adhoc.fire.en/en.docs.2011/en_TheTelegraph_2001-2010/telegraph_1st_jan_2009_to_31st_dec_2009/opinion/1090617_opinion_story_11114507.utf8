                                                                                                                 TIME TO STAY UNITED                                  Sumanta Sen                              
	Ever since Naveen Patnaik ditched the Bharatiya Janata Party in Orissa, political eyes have turned in the direction of the Bihar chief minister, Nitish Kumar, to see whether he would do the same. Though there has not been a Kandhamal-like carnage in Bihar, it is no secret that Kumar has never had much time for his alliance partner. Sushil Modi has all along played the second fiddle, and perhaps not entirely unwillingly, which caused anger among a section of the BJP in the state. On his part, the Bihar chief minister, now sure of his own ground, did not allow any alliance compulsions to get in the way of the Janata Dal (United) being sharply critical of the BJP at the recent meeting of its national executive. Despite all this, speculations about the alliance splitting in Bihar seem a little premature at this stage.        
	A politician with any degree of maturity takes a step when he feels it will fetch him dividends. That was what Patnaik did in Orissa once he realized that the saffronites had become a liability. With Kumar it is different. He knows that religion does not play a major role in Bihar politics; it is caste equations that matter. The just-concluded Lok Sabha polls have shown that he is on a good wicket in this regard. He has developed a fairly formidable following among the backward castes and the dalits, proof of which is to be had in the defeat of Ram Vilas Paswan in Hajipur and in the reduction of the number of seats of the Rashtriya Janata Dal to only four.         
	Before the next assembly elections, he would like to further consolidate his position among these segments and also among Muslims, something he hopes to do by drawing to his side the disgruntled followers of Lalu Prasad and Paswan. Already, prominent RJD leaders like Raghuvansh Prasad Singh are putting pressure on their chief to remove Rabri Devi from the post of the leader of the Opposition to enable the party to play a more meaningful role in the state assembly. If Lalu Prasad refuses to budge, there may be further trouble in store for him  his brothers-in-law have already betrayed him for personal reasons.                
	Two for joy        
	Even now, Lalu Prasad is the only one who can create problems for Kumar, and the chief minister, though satisfied with things as they stand now, knows he still has some distance to go to be fully comfortable. In such a situation, why should he create problems for himself by antagonizing his partner and its upper-caste voters? He and his party colleagues will spare no efforts to make it evident that they have nothing in common with the BJP so as to make the Muslims happy but are unlikely to rock the boat. Right now, the BJP would also not like to take criticisms to heart and walk out of a ruling alliance because it cannot afford to do so. The people would also not like to see the alliance disturbed as it has, so far, delivered the goods, if not fully then substantially. Politically, therefore, there is no reason for Kumar to do a Patnaik.         
	There is another reason as well. Kumar does not wish to convey that he is moving closer to the Congress by parting ways with the BJP. The people of Bihar still eye the Congress with suspicion and Kumar cannot be unaware of that. One reason for this is that Jayaprakash Narayan and his movement still remain fresh in their minds. Kumar would like to remain a part of that legacy rather than to be suspected of siding with a force which JP had fought.         
	Moreover, Kumar has a fight on his hands. He has demanded that the Centre treat Bihar as a special case and allocate funds accordingly. The struggle will be long and arduous, and the chief minister will need the BJP by his side at the national level. So why pick a quarrel which will only weaken the struggle and bring no praise for him from Patna?

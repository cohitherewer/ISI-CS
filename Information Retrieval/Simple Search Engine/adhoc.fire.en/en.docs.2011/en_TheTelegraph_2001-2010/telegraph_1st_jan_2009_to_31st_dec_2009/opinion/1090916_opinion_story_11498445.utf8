                                                                                                                 CONGRESS BLUES                                                    
	The coming to power of a Congress-led government for a second term coincided with a gloomy turn of events. One was the betrayal of the monsoon. It was late, and the rainfall was nowhere near what was wanted and expected. The late burst has in no way removed the spectre of drought. In India, there is nothing that spreads panic faster than the rumour that a drought is round the corner and that this might lead to a shortfall in the harvest. One immediate result was the rise in the prices of essential foodgrains. This did not augur well for the Congress party as it prepared for various provincial and local-level elections. It will be no exaggeration to suggest that in these the Congress has not performed anywhere near expectations. Apart from the objective factors like inflation and drought, the influence of attitudes within the Congress should not be overlooked. After the victory in the general elections came complacency. There was the tendency to rest on the laurels of a triumph whose scale took everyone by surprise. This adversely affected organization and campaigning.        
	This failure is reflected in the fact that the Congress could not win strong allies. The equation of alliances and their breakdown often led to loss of votes. There is an emerging trend in Indian electoral politics that points to the division between the national and the provincial. When the electorate is faced with a Lok Sabha election, it thinks of national issues and weighs the relevant pros and cons. But in an assembly poll, local or provincial issues acquire a greater potency, and these issues sway the voters one way or the other. This suggests that a Congress victory in the Lok Sabha polls cannot be read as a sign of success at the state level. The Congress being a national party is particularly vulnerable to this emerging trend. If this trend holds, the Congress may have to somewhat rethink its strategy in order to fight its election blues. It has been clear for some time that Sonia Gandhi believes in a strong central leadership: all major decisions emanate from her. One fallout of this has been the weakening of the state-level party units. Leaders sitting in Delhi, for obvious reasons, are often unaware of local squabbles that become critical in a state-level election. The powerful central leadership must be balanced by local chiefs, swearing allegiance to the centre, but powerful enough to fight the local battles.

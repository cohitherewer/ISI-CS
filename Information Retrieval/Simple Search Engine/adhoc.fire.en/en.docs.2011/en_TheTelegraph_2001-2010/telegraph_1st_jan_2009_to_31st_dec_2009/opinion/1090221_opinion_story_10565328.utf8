                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Sad truth                  
	Sir  Malvika Singhs Without any baggage (Feb 10) bluntly exposes the fact that a majority of Indians lacks the urge to provide the simple dignities of life to their brethren. Singh praises the ethos of Slumdog Millionaire, but her enthusiasm, unfortunately, has not been shared by Calcuttas intellectuals at least. I watched the film recently at a renowned south Calcutta theatre, which had three-fourth of its seats empty. We often blame our politicians for the mess in the country, but how far are we true to ourselves in our words and action?          
	Yours faithfully,         Ranadhish Choudhuri, Calcutta
        
	Troubled hearts          
	Sir  A hullabaloo is raised every year in India as Valentines Day approaches. Each year, some organizations come up with increasingly creative solutions to the problem. For instance, Bajrang Dals ingenious quick-fix this year was to force couples to either marry or treat one another like siblings (Vermilion or rakhi, Bajrangs V-Day call, Feb 13). In democratic India, can an outfit have the right to marry off couples who dare to exchange gifts or dine out on V-Day? What does this say about the fundamental rights of a citizen in this country?           
	The alacrity with which these self-appointed moral guardians have taken upon themselves the task to rid Indian youth of deleterious Western values is shocking. I was unaware that critical problems such as poverty, hunger, domestic violence, child marriage, dowry, female foeticide, to name a few, have been eradicated already. Perhaps for the lack of anything better to do, the Bajrang Dal has now decided to resolve other developments such as couples celebrating their love for each other in a peaceful manner. The Bajrang Dals suggestion that boys and girls should celebrate love on Vasant Utsav instead defies all logic. This only exposes the organizations bigoted nature and its lack of an ideological base. All this is just a cheap trick on the part of the outfit to garner some publicity.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The Shiv Sena has suddenly emerged as the moral guardian of Mumbai. But where were the citys conscience keepers when scores of people died in the 26/11 attacks? The Shiv Sena says that it wants to save women from being harassed in the city. But why on Valentines Day alone? Are women not harassed on the streets on other days?           
	To celebrate love is not a crime. Then why are these outfits imposing their ideas on the people and putting couples in an awkward position?                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Tanmayee Mitra, Santiniketan 

                
	Sir  The meaning of Valentines Day in India has been changed by the media and businessmen in order to boost revenue. The hype and negative publicity surrounding Valentines Day serve the protesters and the media well. The protesters get undeserved publicity in the media while the media get handsome returns from advertisements. Valentines Day also increases profits for shops, the communication industries and shopping malls. It should thus be celebrated for what it stands for in reality.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Raj Bagri, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The media and politicians have blown the Mangalore incident out of proportion to malign the Bharatiya Janata Party. Valentines Day is the medias creation. One wonders why teenagers or adults, who are truly in love, cannot express their emotions to their beloved ones on any other day of the year. It would be prudent on the part of the media not to focus on Valentines Day too much because it does not merit much attention in the first place.                     
	Yours faithfully,

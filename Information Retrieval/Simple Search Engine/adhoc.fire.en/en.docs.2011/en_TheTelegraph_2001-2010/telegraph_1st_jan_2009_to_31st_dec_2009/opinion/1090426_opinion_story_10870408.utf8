	Missing the magic                  
	Sir  Beaten 0-1 in Howrah by Al Kuwait and demolished 0-6 in the return match in Kuwait in the AFC Cup (Bagan hit for a six, April 22) , Mohun Bagan seems to be missing its fabled magic. It was sad to see it beaten by a club that had lost the league championship in Kuwait. But Indian coaches do not like to learn from foreign coaches, and Bob Houghton is given a tough time. It is time football bosses stopped blaming cricket, foreign coaches and everything under the sun except themselves for sorry performances.           
	Yours faithfully,         Bhaskar Majumdar, Kuwait 
        
	Unjust hike           
	Sir  Many schools in the city have resorted to an unprecedented hike in fees and have blamed it on the necessity of increasing teachers salaries in accordance with the fifth pay commission recommendations (Schools firm on fee hike in protest wake, April 3). Being a parent of a school-going child, I find the increase ridiculous after being forced to pay an education cess to the government. Why does the government levy the cess if it cannot control the cost of education?           
	Further, if schools wish to be free of government control and to foot their bills with money shelled out by parents, they should let the parents have some control. The schools did not even have the courtesy to inform parents about the reason for the fee hike. I discovered the reason through newspapers as schools prefer to share information with the media more willingly.           
	As a parent, I feel disappointed in my childs school, which has raised the fees by 60 per cent and allowed me 24 hours to deposit the money (a minimum of half a years fees in advance by demand draft only). This was done to prevent parents from coming together to protest.           
	If parents have to pay such high fees and bear the entire burden of the teachers salary, they should have the right to see if the money is actually being utilized for that purpose and to determine the kind of teachers the school employs. When the government pays this bill, it has control over both. So the appraisal of teachers should come from parents.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  In several schools in Calcutta and Howrah, fees have been hiked by Rs 400-Rs 800 per month. Many schools do not even provide clean toilets to their students. Since they were short on facilities they were reasonable with the fees. The government has now given them an excuse to push up the fees without an attendant improvement in facilities.           
	Recession has forced people to curb expenses. In such trying times, how can the basic right to education be assaulted in this way? For a family sending two children to school, the hike means spending Rs 800 to Rs 1,600 more each month. With food prices soaring, how is the family expected to cope with this demand?           
	If the government is concerned about teachers, why does it not increase its subsidies? Forcing schools to hike teachers pay to match the pay commission recommendations is not a solution.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Tadgat Gupta, Howrah

                          
	Parting shot          
	Sir  The Reserve Bank of India has eased short-term lending and borrowing rates and asked banks to pass on the benefits to borrowers (Holding steady, April 22). The reduction in repo and reverse repo should lead to cheaper loans. Most public sector banks have cut their prime lending rates, but home loans and unsecured borrowing rates are not budging. This time, the RBI will have to do more than just put verbal pressure on banks.           
	Yours faithfully,

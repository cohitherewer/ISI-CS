	Election spending, some believe, is conducive to economic growth, a concept that is often blissfully confused with economic development. According to recent forecasts, in fact, an estimated expenditure of Rs 16,700 crore surrounding the Lok Sabha elections during the current fiscal will raise Indias annual growth rate by 0.5 per cent. Unfortunately, however, these predictions, even if substantiated by future events, have little or no relevance for Indias economic development.        
	However pedestrian it may sound, the economic development of India is best viewed not as successful missions to the moon but as access for the masses to safe drinking water, adequate road networks, electricity, basic education and health facilities. Given the devastated condition in which we inherited our economy from colonial masters though, most economists would agree that the achievement of this apparently modest goal is likely to be a time-consuming affair, especially so for a country like India, which ranks amongst the highest in the world in terms of corruption indices. Consequently, if election spending is to be justified on economic grounds, it could well be worth our while to approach the matter from a long-run perspective.         
	Election expenses are clearly separable into two categories. The first of these is borne by the State on the recommendation of the Election Commission and included in the interim pre-election Central budget. It involves, amongst other things, money spent on the deployment of security personnel and polling staff, the setting up of polling stations, the issue of photo identity cards and, more recently, the purchase of electronic voting machines. The second category is made up of campaigning expenditure by political parties and the candidates themselves.               
	The first category is approved by the Parliament and the second, hopefully, by auditors. Needless to say, the latter is far less tractable than the former, though the rules pertaining to it have been clearly laid down. For example, the ceiling on an individual candidates expense is set at Rs 15 lakh. The figure, however, is augmentable beyond pre-specified limits by candidates supporters, subject to written consent by the candidates themselves. The parties too are allowed to spend freely, so long as accounts are properly audited.         
	While the size of the combined kitty of the parties and the candidates is difficult to estimate, the States own expenses belong to the public domain. The table below presents the picture during the period, 1967-1999. The table ignores the expenditure for the 2004 elections, since the published figure has been challenged. Despite the omission, it is clear that the governments expenditure has risen over the years at a phenomenal rate. With the political parties expenses added to the governments budget, the total amount, white or black, must have assumed gigantic proportions by now.                  
	It is natural to try and quantify the nature of expenditure increase reflected by the table. The computation cannot be carried out, of course, without cleaning the data to remove inflation-induced distortions. The purchasing power of a rupee in 1967 was much higher than it was in 1999. To compare the 1967 and 1999 figures, it is important to evaluate them at the same base-year prices. The exercise turns out to be a relatively simple affair though, once we take into account the Reserve Bank of India data for the 1967 gross domestic product at current prices, that is, at the then prevailing prices, and its inflation adjusted value at 1999-2000 prices. The former was Rs 34,840.00 crore, while the latter stood at Rs 4,13,094.00 crore. Prices in 1999-2000, therefore, were (4,13,094/34,840=) 11.85 times higher than what they were in 1967-68. Consequently, to convert the 1967 election expenditure to a figure that is comparable to that in 1999, one needs to inflate the former figure by a factor of 11.85. This raises the 1967 expenditure to Rs. 1.79 crore, or Rs 21.21 crore approximately at 1999-2000 prices.         
	It is straightforward to conclude that the expense of Rs 888.00 crore in 1999-2000 was almost 42 times higher than the 1967-68 outlay. And the question to ask now is how justified this massive expansion over time was. To the extent that elections are indispensable for the continuation of democracy, the proximate cause of the increased expenditure could be traced to a rapid expansion in the size of the electorate, proliferation of terrorist activities and so on. However, democracy itself must be a means to an end and one of the ends ought to be the long-term economic improvement of the populace. What does the data disclose in this context?        
	Indias GDP was Rs 17,86,525.00 crore in 1999-2000 at current prices and its 1967-68 GDP evaluated at 1999-2000 prices was Rs 4,13,094.00 crore. In other words, the countrys production of commodities in 1999-2000 was 4.32 times higher than it was in 1967-68. The GDP being an indicator of economic welfare, the sad truth is that while the expenditure on political power acquisition rose 42 times during the period covered (and in reality it was several times higher since expenses undertaken by the political parties have been ignored), the power so acquired produced a paltry 4.32 times rise in economic well-being.         
	The figures look more dismal in per capita terms. The per capita GDP in 1967-68 was Rs 816.39 crore (at 1999-2000 prices), while it increased a mere 2.18 times to Rs 1784.74 crore in 1999-2000. Given, however, that the Indian economy has exhibited commendable growth rates more recently, one might argue that extending the horizon beyond 1999-2000 would reveal a more optimistic scenario. The latest available RBI data confirms this expectation to some extent, though not dramatically so. The per capita GDP in 2007-08 was 3.36 times higher than the corresponding figure in 1967-68. The numbers obviously indicate that large parts of the economy are still deprived of the basic facilities associated with civilized livelihood.               
	How is it possible to reconcile our growth euphoria then with this gloomy outlook? The answer to this question lies in the contradiction between annual and sustainable long-term growth rates. Annual rates are not reliable indices of a nations developmental performance, since they are subject to rapid fluctuations. For example, recession has ensured that our nine per cent growth rate was followed immediately afterwards by a rate well below seven per cent. The sustainable rate, on the other hand, is a constant rate of growth which, if maintained, would have closely generated the path of GDP the country has actually experienced during a long period of time. Compared to annual rates, this is a robust figure, since short-term fluctuations will not change it drastically. In the ultimate analysis, it is this sustained rate of growth that comprises a relevant measure of the level of economic development, a level from which we cannot be easily dislodged.         
	The annual growth rate is simple enough to calculate, since it represents the percentage increase in output in a given year over the immediately previous one. One needs to run a statistical regression on the other hand to discover the sustained rate of growth and, interestingly enough, the latter growth rate for Indias per capita GDP (at constant prices) over the period, 1967-68 to 2007-08, was only 2.8 per cent. This is a far cry from the much flaunted nine per cent rate.         
	India has been an independent country for over half a century now. The 15th Lok Sabha is about to be constituted, thereby implying that our democracy too has matured. Yet, as our calculations indicate, this mature democracy has delivered little in terms of the economic well-being of the average citizen. Nonetheless the excitement surrounding the elections continues. Contrary to Lincolns wisdom, it may well be possible to deceive all men for all time!

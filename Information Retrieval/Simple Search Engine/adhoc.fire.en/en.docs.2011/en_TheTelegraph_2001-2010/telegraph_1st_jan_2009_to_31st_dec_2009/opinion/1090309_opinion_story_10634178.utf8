                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Democracy in peril                  
	Sir  In less than two months after returning to power, Sheikh Hasina Wajed has had a taste of what she is up against. Bangladesh has innumerable problems, some of which need to be tackled on a war footing if the country is to survive as a democracy and not descend into chaos like Pakistan (Dhaka sepoy mutiny, Feb 26). The mutiny of the Bangladesh Rifles has been in the making for some time now. Poorly paid, with few service benefits, the BDR personnel have had to suffer much humiliation at the hands of their officers. Reportedly, BDR servicemen posted at the borders indulge in every possible corrupt and criminal practice from facilitating illegal migration, cattle-smuggling and drug rackets to trafficking women. They are willing to do anything for a price.          
	Hasina Wajed cannot be ignorant of this reality. She has been the prime minister of Bangladesh before, and on more than one occasion during her tenure, the BDR was the cause of tension between India and Bangladesh. She should have anticipated the mutiny. The Bangladesh army is now an unseen player in the countrys politics. In it, there are deeply entrenched elements owing allegiance to the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and the Jamaat-e-Islami, which want to destabilize her government.           
	Yours faithfully,       
K.S. Jayatheertha, Bangalore 

                
	Sir  The BDR mutiny provides ample evidence of the fact that democracy in Bangladesh is again in peril. The mass murder of army officers and civilians by the BDR is shocking and unpardonable. The criminals should be put on trial and punished for their crime.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Smritish Raha, Calcutta 

      
	Sir  The carnage perpetrated by the rebel BDR jawans in Dhaka cannot be the result of sudden provocation. The calculated way and speed with which the soldiers went about the killings point to a deep-rooted conspiracy that was intended to cause maximum damage to the fledgling Awami League government. Their ferocity recalls the horrific 1971 massacre, when the Pakistani army, with support from some local agents, went on a killing spree. That massacre is regarded as one of the biggest human tragedies after World War II.          
	Bangladesh has broken away from Pakistans shackles, but the sporadic outbreaks of frustration in the country show that Pakistani loyalists there have still not reconciled themselves to the situation. The activities of some of the opposition parties and their leaders should be scanned thoroughly to bring out the masterminds of this heinous crime.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Srikanta Bhattacharjee, Calcutta 

      
	Sir  The modus operandi of the 26/11 terrorists and the BDR jawans were strikingly similar. The killings were wanton in both cases. Just like the Mumbai operation, the BDR mutiny must have been worked out months in advance. Since some BDR personnel were also killed in the incident, it may be assumed that sections of the force were unaware of the conspiracy, while the large-scale killings show that sections in the military must have been involved. It may be that the Inter-Services Intelligence and indigenous fundamentalists in Bangladesh are the main architects of this event.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Anil Kumar Choudhury, Kalyani 

                
	Sir  As the editorial, The onus of democracy (March 1), pointed out, India is marching ahead with a multi-party democracy while its neighbours are lagging behind in the race. Neither Pakistan nor Bangladesh has such a diversity of religions, languages, cultures and customs as India has. The nations should have thus beaten India in their progress towards a stable democracy. It is ironic that neither has had much luck in this. Instead, Indias two neighbours are exporting violence and terrorism to India in order to weaken its democracy. India is not responsible for the fate of the two nations. However, it has to play the role of the Good Samaritan with the help of the global community.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Subrata Pal, Karimpur, Nadia 

                
	Sir  Both Bangladesh and Pakistan are facing violence owing to the emphasis on religion in their polities. India is not too far away from this given the zeal with which its politicians use religion to shore up their electoral prospects. The riots after the Babri Masjid demolition and the Gujarat carnage are results of this. Indians should look at Pakistan and Bangladesh and remember that communalism can lead to chaos. We should try to establish a sound democracy through the forthcoming elections. Democracy is the greatest weapon Indians have.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Md. Maksud Alam, Burdwan 

                
	Parting shot           
	Sir  The report, Samaritan struggles to save job after rescue (Feb 25), reminded me of how selfish we are. None of the passengers saved by Srinivas Rao, the braveheart driver, has bothered to help pay for his treatment or even to visit him in hospital. It is shameful that his family is suffering because of his selflessness. In any civilized society, Rao would have been celebrated as a hero, but not in India. In fact, Rao serves as a reminder of the fact that altruism is an act one has to repent later. I hope that the Orissa government does its bit to help Rao. Perhaps The Telegraph could also raise funds for him.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Devvarta Kumar, Ranchi

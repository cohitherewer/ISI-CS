                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	On a different trip                  
	Sir  Mamata Banerjee has announced the Andolan Express, to run between Singur and Howrah from August 1. The distance between these two stations is barely 35 km. The proposed fare is double of what the passengers pay to travel the same distance by local train. Moreover, there are already enough local trains between these two stations. Such a move on Banerjees part will only lead her opponents and critics to accuse her of abusing her power as a minister. It would be wiser to introduce more superfast local trains on this route instead.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Sandip Mukherjee, Bandel

      
	Friend or foe?          
	Sir  The Congress has managed to form the governing board in the Uluberia municipality, allegedly supported by councillors from the Left and the Bharatiya Janata Party (Cong beats ally to civic body, July 29). The agreement between the Trinamul Congress and the Congress that each party will rule for half the tenure failed to be implemented. Such disagreements among parties that have successfully managed to win the recently-concluded electoral battles in the state are sending the wrong signals to the voters. Given the present differences between these two allies, there is hardly any reason to believe that they will bring any commendable change to the states political arena, even if they win the forthcoming assembly elections. Leaders of both parties must desist from such dirty politics.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Othello Mazoomdaar, Barasat

                
	Sir  The people of West Bengal had hoped to rid themselves of the present communist government after the Congress and the TMC joined hands during the Lok Sabha elections. Now these allies seem to be squabbling over petty issues and this has created a rift between them. It is imperative that both these parties sort out the differences that have come up during the Uluberia polls in order to keep their alliance intact.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Report card          
	Sir  Sections of the electronic media criticize government functionaries out of habit. The same happened during the coverage of the downpour in Delhi, when a news channel alleged the absence of the Delhi traffic police from areas where their services were most urgently required. This is not wholly correct. I was also on the waterlogged streets of Delhi that day, and was impressed to see the men in uniform on duty in the heavy rain. My friends noted the same in some other parts of the city. Complimenting the dutiful policemen in the media can encourage them to serve the people with increased enthusiasm. But it seems that news channels find the criticism of government employees more newsworthy, even if such criticism is unfair.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Subhash Chandra Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

                
	Sir  While commemorating Kargils 10th anniversary, the electronic and print media have revived old memories in a very responsible manner. Columns by eminent journalists, interviews of armymen and of the families of the martyrs, obituaries of the heroes have all featured in the media reports on this occasion. But what is most important is that the vocabulary of hatred against the neighbouring nation is not to be found in these accounts. It seems that the era of cashing in on the memories of martyrs by fanatics is gone. The leaders have shrugged off sectarianism and are trying to solve the age-old conflict diplomatically. This is the only way to make sure that the tragedy of 1999 is not repeated again.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Amaninder Pal Sharma, Ludhiana

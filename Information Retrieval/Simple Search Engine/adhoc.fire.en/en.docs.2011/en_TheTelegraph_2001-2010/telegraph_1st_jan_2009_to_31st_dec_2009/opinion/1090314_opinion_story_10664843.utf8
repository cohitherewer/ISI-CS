The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Quantity over quality
                                                                                                                 QUANTITY OVER QUALITY                              VISUAL ARTS      Soumitra Das                                                
	Kala Bhavana in Santiniketan has produced some leading artists of this country, and from its inception, masters from India and abroad have chosen to teach, or at least sojourn, here. The artists trained here are known for their progressive ideas, anchored to indigenous traditions though they may be. This institution held its annual exhibition (2009) at the Academy of Fine Arts between February 19 and 24, where every inch of wall space was occupied by close to 500 works, as all students, irrespective of quality, were allowed to exhibit.        
	Thanks to the crush of works, it was often impossible to distinguish one painting or installation from another, with, in some cases, labels attached on the work itself instead of the wall. After a quick look around, one got the impression that students from the Northeast were particularly proficient in graphic art and works involving textiles. It was easy to identify the students from abroad, particularly those from Southeast Asia, by their names and their works marked by a sensibility different from that of their Indian coevals. Youn. Mi ocks large acrylic stood out not only for its size but also for the strange, amorphous forms she creates, halfway between representational and abstract art. Su Mi Nahs canvas, with its graffiti-like scribblings in charcoal, oil pastel and oil, and a very measured use of colour, was stark and haunting. It suggested the doodles of a troubled child but was too systematically laid out to be actually so. Lalima Bhowmiks play with likenesses and reflections intrigues the viewer as one is unable to distinguish between the real and the shadow. Abir Mukherjee sought to do the same on a shimmering aluminium sheet in a more literal manner (picture).        
	The graphic section of the exhibition was quite strong. The prints of Kartik Prasad, Atsuko Honda, Jayosmita De, Subhamita Sarker, Rembrandt Iakmenlang Kharnaior, Tribeni Devi and Park Hyun Mi were remarkable for the manner in which they were conceived and executed with precision. Papia Sahas dry pastel drawing on paper may have looked formless but it surely required some skill to create that impression of mobility in an apparently inert mass.        
	The variety and colouring of textiles made this exhibition different from those in commercial galleries. These works usually find no place anywhere as they dont sell. The best ones were marked by a strong sense of design, geometry and colour. Nibedita Rajak, Shrinwanti Bandopadhyay, Patcharaporn Lueraj and Jung Hee created outstanding pieces. The students were weak in realistic drawings and watercolours. They did not seem to possess the requisite skills that their counterparts in Calcutta can boast of. But skill for skills sake is not all.

	West Bengals hellish government hospitals are not good enough for the people who run them. The state government is about to start a scheme for around 10 lakh gazetted and non-gazetted employees that will entitle them to reimbursement for treatment in private hospitals. Until now, they could only avail themselves of these entitlements if they used the government hospitals. But the government had to bear the brunt of continual complaints from its employees for the quality of healthcare this system was forcing them to suffer. What could be a better time than the run-up to the elections for promising a vote-bank of 10 lakh deliverance from the unspeakable horrors of state-sponsored healthcare?        
	The abdication of responsibility such a scheme is founded on should justifiably make any ordinary citizen deeply indignant. It is the poor and the powerless who have no choice but to avail themselves of the services provided by the government hospitals. Instead of radically improving the quality of these hospitals, all that the government is willing to do is to make it affordable for its own employees to avoid using them and get access to better private care. It is of no concern to the government that the rest of the users of these facilities are left to cope with the infernal conditions that prevail there. This amounts to declaring these institutions irredeemable, with their scarcity of beds, the filth, the rudeness and negligence of doctors and staff, the corruption, abysmally inadequate infrastructure and supply of medicines, and so on. The only way in which the government can show some political will regarding its healthcare obligations is to rescue its own people from the inferno, and leave the rest to take care of themselves. The unabashedness of this is breathtaking.

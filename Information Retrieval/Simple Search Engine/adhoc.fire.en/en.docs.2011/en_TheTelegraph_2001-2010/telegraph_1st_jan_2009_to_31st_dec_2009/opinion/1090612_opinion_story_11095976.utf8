The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | hint of hope
                                                                                                                 HINT OF HOPE                                                    
	Democracy is about learning to live with differences so that the process of governance can continue unhindered. The role of the Opposition is to offer criticism and suggestions but not to block the making and the implementation of policies. Without this simple understanding, work in a parliamentary democracy will come to a standstill. Or, as was the case in the previous government, the work of governance will continue without too many sittings of Parliament. This makes a mockery of parliamentary democracy. There is the hint that this time round things may be a little different. The first suggestion of this came from the leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, L.K.Advani, when he said that he would try and ensure that there is no blind opposition to the new United Progressive Alliance government. On the contrary, the Opposition would extend the hand of cooperation in the task of nation-building. In his turn, the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, warmly accepted the promise of cooperation. Mr Singh said that if his government received the cooperation of the Opposition, Parliament could be in session for more than half the year. He said that cooperation would guarantee the irrelevance of differences. What would become paramount is facing the challenges that India faces.        
	Mr Singh was being characteristically optimistic. It would be too much to expect that the differences would melt away. In fact, they should not in a democracy. What, however, offers hope is the spirit behind Mr Advanis statement. He has been gracious in accepting defeat and in putting the interests of the nation above those of his party. Mr Singh has also been magnanimous in his moment of triumph. It is this reciprocity between two leaders not known to be friendly towards each other that creates the space for hope in Indian politics. If this prevails, the Lok Sabha can function without disruption and there can be genuine debate instead of the usual exchange of abuse and noise. This could mark a new beginning. The proof of the pudding, as the saying goes, is in the eating. The behaviour of parliamentarians will be under close scrutiny to see if the promises made by Messrs Advani and Singh are being fulfilled. It will be a mini-revolution in Indian politics if, within the Lok Sabha, members begin to put the nation before the party.

	Concerning chicken tikka masala, one issue should be put to rest. It is not an Indian dish, even if some south Asian put it out in the British market. If cricket, as the scholar Ashis Nandy, has memorably said, is an Indian game that the British discovered, chicken tikka masala is an Indian dish the British exported to India. Tired of the so-called bland British fare, some imaginative cook, probably from south Asia, experimented with the available spices and  voila!  there was chicken tikka masala. If its origin can be thus explained, its popularity cannot be so easily rationalized. What was it that caused so many Britons to abandon their roast beef or smoked salmon or cucumber sandwiches for chicken tikka masala between two slices of bread? Does it taste better with a pint of ale? Or is it that the British palate is so jaded, after innumerable years of ploughmans lunch, that it now yearns for some morsel that is tastier and has a tang to it? The answers to these questions hover over Britain, and some future historian of the transformation of British tastes in food in the last quarter of the 20th century will have to solve the mystery.        
	There is another serious implication to consider, especially by those who are fond of good food. This is the gradual but irrevocable takeover of the tastes of people by standardized food. Indian food has come to be associated with chicken tandoori across the globe. Yet it is probably the creation of a restaurant in old Delhi from where it rapidly spread but it isnt made in any Indian home. In Britain, people are on the verge of forgetting their local and regional delicacies as they are being swamped by chicken tikka masala and its ilk. Standardization of food is the enemy of taste and the killer of high standards.

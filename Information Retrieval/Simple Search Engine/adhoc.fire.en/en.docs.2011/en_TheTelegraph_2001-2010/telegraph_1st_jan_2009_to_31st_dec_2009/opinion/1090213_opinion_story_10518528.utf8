The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A republic of dynasties
                                                                                                                 A REPUBLIC OF DYNASTIES                          - The feudal system is taking time to disappear from India        Cutting Corners - Ashok Mitra                                                            
	It is almost like the Unsinkable Molly Brown Hollywood had once made a celebrity out of; cheerfully or otherwise, the Republic of India takes all the buffetings it is subjected to.         
	In one constituent state of the republic, the father is the chief minister and his son has recently been sworn in as deputy chief minister. Hardly any murmurs have been heard from any quarter, for has not the country experienced much weirder phenomena in the course of the past half-a-century? Not so long ago, in another state, a chief minister, temporarily disabled by the legal process, installed his wife in the slot; she carried on for months on end with none seemingly noticing anything less than right anywhere. The practice of keeping power within the family fold has now turned contagious, with dynasties emerging at a fast pace all over. You name a state, any state  Haryana, Karnataka, Orissa, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu  a dynasty is either presiding over the administration or waiting in the wings.         
	As the countrys most ancient political outfit, the Indian National Congress of course took the lead in the matter, with the father as the countrys prime minister and the daughter named as party president way back in 1958. That cosy arrangement set in motion a perpetual sequence people have tended to accept as a normal happening: three prime ministers of independent India have hailed from the same family; a fourth one is currently being groomed for the position. India may yet emerge over the next couple of decades as one of the technologically most advanced and, therefore, strategically one of the most important, countries in the world. But its system of governance might tenaciously adhere to the feudal doctrine of dynastic succession.               
	To describe this situation as an Indian oddity is, it would be immediately pointed out, factually inaccurate. Just take a look at the topography of South Asia. Whether it is Pakistan or Bangladesh or Sri Lanka, dynasties are alive and kicking in each of these countries too. A theory could even be aired that, in view of the specificity of land relations in South Asia, the feudal curse has endured here longer than elsewhere. A bolder assertion is in fact conceivable. Even within a solidly democratic framework, dynasties can still play, it may be argued, an impressively constructive part if called upon to play a major role in administration. Have not members of particular families in the United States of America been dominant in national politics continuously for a number of generations without hurting a pie? The Roosevelts and the Kennedys did not at all spoil the ambience of democratic functioning in America, and that country has survived the aftershock of the two Bushes as well.         
	The Doubting Thomases will not suspend their disquiet though. In the US, members of the same family have of course come to acquire and hold on to political power for long stretches, but they could do so only after going through the rough-and-tumble of precinct politics and all the rest of the routine; it was tough terrain, and they succeeded because they were able to prove their mettle; their pedigree had nothing to do with it. In India, on the other hand, the dynasties themselves decide the issue of succession; the approval of the people is taken for granted. True, formal democratic consent is sought subsequently; in most instances, such consent is not refused either.         
	The uncomfortable feeling may still fail to disappear altogether. Memory could hark back to that eerie midnight episode in New Delhi a quarter of a century ago, when the countrys president, rushed back from a foreign trip to swear in a young man without any constitutional credentials as the nations new prime minister; the set-up was that of a rushed coup dtat. At this point, someone with a mawkish sense of humour can put in an additional input: even in a supposedly diehard communist regime as the Peoples Republic of Korea, the present ruler has reportedly made up his mind to nominate one of his sons as his successor as the all powerful boss of the communist party and, simultaneously, head of the government.         
	Dissenters will yet not yield. Opportunities, including opportunities to lead the nation, must, in their judgment, be equally available to all citizens, dynasties cannot be allowed to appropriate the prerogative. It is indeed theoretically possible for a dynasty to produce generation after generation of worthy offspring who prove themselves to be natural leaders. It could even happen that, while initially a bit of a dullard, someone from the dynasty, once named to a key position, picks up enough competence to shape into a successful administrator. The objection against a closed shop will nonetheless not be withdrawn. The simultaneous existence of a democratic system and delegating, on a permanent basis, the privilege to a single family to preside over it, appears to suffer from an internal contradiction.         
	The contradiction persists because free, democratic, one-man-one-vote polls have not frowned upon the concept of dynastic succession. The vast majority of the electorate remains steeped in illiteracy, which coalesces with a frightening lack of social awareness. Those conditioned for ages to depend on the king and his emissaries are unable to shed their old reflexes even under the domain of a Constitution that provides them with equal rights with each and everybody else. The issue of class hardly breaks in either; it has been, in large parts of the country, shoved off the arena by the consanguinity of caste. But the allure of a monarchical order, fortified by dynastic succession, continues to overwhelm.              
	For the present, there is little that can be done about it. Protesters may line up any number of arguments to establish how ill-suited the dynastic system is to the needs of the times. What, though, if the electorate decides otherwise? To express astonishment at the fact that a nation which sticks to the medieval principle of dynastic succession in its choice of rulers can yet have a stockpile of intellectual capability that could place it in the fore amongst nations is equally beside the point. The mandarins who have, over the centuries, guided the destiny of nations in the different continents have always been a narrow minority. They have managed to survive  and prosper  despite their vulnerability to forces unleashed in nether quarters.         
	One particular worry may still linger: what if a dynasty, once ensconced in power, wants to put an end to what it considers the farce of democracy  and the mandarins are unable to dissuade them? Even in such a contingency, all need not be lost; the chances are that the other dynasties would then come together and seek to put a restraint on the vaulting ambition of one of their breed.        
	However bitter the truth, it cannot be said that India is hopelessly out of alignment with history; the dynasties will take a while to fade away. Meanwhile, why not wring the last bit of wry humour out of the folklore around A.K. Fazlul Huq, premier of pre-Partition Bengal during 1937-42? His near relations came to occupy prize posts in government soon after his accession to the provincial administration. When charged with nepotism, his scornful response was, What can I do if all my nephews happen to be brilliant?

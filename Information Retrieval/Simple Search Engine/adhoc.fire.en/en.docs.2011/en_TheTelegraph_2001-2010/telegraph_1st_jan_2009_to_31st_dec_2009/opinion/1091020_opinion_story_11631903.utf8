	Historic buildings  monument sites, forts and palaces  need to be viewed in a manner that ensures that they are infused with life and a future which connect them with the generations that follow. That, and that alone, will keep the ethos of our multi-faceted and diverse culture alive and relevant, as well as ensure that people feel they are an intrinsic part of the greater culture. All the strident positions about throwing ropes around monuments and preserving them as sterile edifices have no place in the contemporary environment. To conserve correctly requires participation by every stakeholder, and not just by government babus and by the other administrators of these properties.        
	Take the Victoria Memorial Hall in Calcutta. Here is an ideal historic building that sits in a space that could be devised with care and made into a hive of cultural activity. Exhibitions, a caf, a shop selling products related to the raj, all of these would bring in regular revenue to meet the basic conservation needs. The gardens, too, need to be restored. An effective and working example of this approach to a historic monument is the Mehrangarh Fort in Jodhpur. Fortunately, it remains in the hands of a private trust and, therefore, is a modern, vibrant and beautifully conserved property, which is clean and welcoming and generates large resources that are ploughed back for its upkeep. The trust is now identifying indigenous plants and shrubs in an effort to turn the slopes down from the rampart green.        
	Sadly, in India, we have a band of committed people who want to cover past legacies with a veil in the belief that protection of this nature will keep the culture intact. Unfortunately, the opposite happens. Our man-made heritage is in an abject state of deterioration. This is the sad reality. It is compelling, albeit inadvertently, a new and young generation to ignore its desperate needs because the task of convincing those who call the shots is difficult as they are unaware of fresh strategies related to conservation.                
	More flexible        
	This we-know-it-all attitude, laced with fake patriotism that gets excited about breaking out of old, musty and corroded parameters within which the management of our culture has operated thus far, has to change radically.         
	Private-public partnership is the first step, and it needs to be brought into play immediately if we are to restore and reinvent our institutions, historic monuments and sites, museums, archives and libraries, forests and rivers and so on. Only then will we begin to regenerate something that has been craving for a fresh injection of oxygen for decades. I know how difficult it is to try and find material on the building of New Delhi, and, in comparison, how simple and efficient the same task could be in Britain.        
	The old and traditional must engage with the contemporary. If the two fail to do so, and if we, because of archaic conservatism, do not fight for change in this area of social activity, our history and its invaluable traditions will wallow in confusion and gradually destroy themselves.        
	National pride is an essential ingredient for stable socio-economic growth and change. Therefore, cultural policy and the attitude of the establishment that formulates the rules and norms, which determine how we manage our legacy, are of utmost importance. The static positions have to give way to a more flexible set of dos and donts.        
	Individuals manning these treasures must not be people who are merely marking time, looking forward to a quick transfer. The government must extend itself to concerned and creative people from the public domain who believe that they would like to participate in the process of infusing life into our monuments.

                                                                                                                 THE GAME OF THE NAME                                                          
	In the beginning was the Word, and then Adam figured out very quickly that naming things for the first time could be the easiest way of having mastery over them. I call this an Apple, so it is my apple. This particular instance did not prove to be fortunate, however, and the Fall left man, woman and language in a bit of a muddle. But the English language is now in a bigger fix, especially in Britain and the United States of America. The nastiness of the history emanating from these realms has loaded their many acts of naming with discredited bits of mastery. History has leaked into language and left embarrassing little stains. So, from time to time, as the benchmarks of civilization change and its maps are redrawn, English has to be cleaned up, corrected and made nicer. If creation allowed naming, then correctness enforces renaming. But oddly enough, the masters remain the masters. They decide what offends whom, and how to neutralize that offence; and it is all done with words. Hence, the black comedy of political correctness  perhaps the most entertaining form of two-facedness in the modern world.        
	In the non-sexist, non-racist, non-sectarian, non-disablist, non-ageist and non-homophobic English-speaking West, the latest acts of renaming involve Christmas and schools. Council leaders in Oxford have decided that Christmas should be called the Winter Light Festival in order to make its spirit inclusive. More recently, a new British school has decided to call itself a place for learning rather than a school because the latter has too many negative connotations for both students and teachers. All this is happening in a self-consciously multicultural nation that is waiting for its men to come back from Iraq, toying with the idea of starting identity cards for foreign residents, and trying in vain to keep hijabs, bangles and crosses out of schools. Yet, this is not just a question of making Britishness more inclusive. Brainstorming, now deemed offensive to epileptics, has to be replaced with thought shower or blue sky thinking; Old Masters have turned into classic art (capital letters are authoritarian), and the mentally ill have to be referred to as mental health service users (calling them mad is positively monstrous). The list can be prolonged endlessly, and it stops being funny quite soon.         
	But the questions remain. Who is including whom and in what by calling Christmas the Winter Light Festival? And is inclusion or the cleansing of negative connotations simply a matter of tinkering with words? Humour provides the best answer. There have been guffaws of protest from Muslims in Oxford and their religious leaders. They wouldnt mind having their Christmas back. And isnt there something askew in deciding that this was what they wanted in the first place?

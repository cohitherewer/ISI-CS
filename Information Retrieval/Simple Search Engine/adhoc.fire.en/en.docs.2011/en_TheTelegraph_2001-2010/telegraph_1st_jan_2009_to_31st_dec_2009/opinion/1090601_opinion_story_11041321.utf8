                                                                                                                 FIGURES SPEAK                                                    
	The Central Statistical Office is one of the more trustworthy offices of the Central government. It releases figures on almost fixed dates, and never doctors the figures. So there must have been some red faces in it this time, when it had to release an estimate of 6.7 per cent growth in gross domestic product in 2008-09. Its advance estimate had been 7.1 per cent. It too must have caused some heartburn when it was released. For while all indications pointed to sinking growth, 7 per cent was a psychological barrier; lower growth was incompatible with the governments vision, and the vision won  but only till the real figures came trickling in. There will be no mea culpa from any minister. Success has many fathers, but proven lack of success is best forgotten  until the CSO issues another reminder in three months.        
	However, this 6.7 per cent itself is a bit of a confidence trick. For, of the increase in constant-price GDP between 2007-08 and 2008-09, a half was attributed to government. This half represented no production; it only represented government consumption. If this bogus part of GDP is removed, private consumption and investment grew by 4.8 per cent; and of the two, consumption grew by only 2.9 per cent  barely more than population growth. So, real consumption per head virtually stopped growing in 2008-09. That will not stop the finance minister from saying, as he did in his budget speech, that India is one of the fastest growing countries in the world. But the misfortunes of the rest of the world do not make us a happy people. He would be more justified in pointing out that we increased our expenditure on gold and jewellery from Rs 53,591 crore to Rs 71,656 crore. But then Indians have always bought gold as insurance against future misfortunes. The picture for the first quarter of 2009 is even worse. As in the full year, a half of the increase consisted of government consumption. Only 13 per cent consisted of private consumption. Foreign trade actually shrank; both exports and imports were lower in absolute terms in the first quarter than a year ago. Fixed capital formation showed positive growth; but that cannot continue in the face of the sluggish consumer demand.        
	That suggests that even worse figures will follow in the coming quarters; investment too will follow the slump in consumption, and the entire private economy will do poorly. The only sector that will continue to do well is government consumption, for we have a government that considers spending a virtue and rewards for supporters an investment. On its criteria, India will continue to do well in a depressing world. Indians may find their incomes and consumption shrinking. But they can consider themselves lucky that they have a government that never fails  to do well for itself at any rate.

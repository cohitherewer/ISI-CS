                                                                                                                 THE FINE BALANCE                                                    
	There is an unmistakable difference between a suggestion and an order. The distinction is valid even when someone as important as a minister makes the suggestion. Salman Khurshid, the minister of state (with independent charge) for corporate affairs, has respected this simple but important distinction when he made the suggestion that heads of companies should not be paid excessively high salaries. The suggestion was made in the context of the austerity drive that the government of India has put in place. Mr Khurshid is only too aware that the government cannot decide, let alone dictate, what salaries business houses should offer their employees. As he himself noted, India is in transition from control under socialist planning to regulation in a liberalized economy. Market forces, profits and the views of shareholders will determine what a company will pay its chief executive and its other employees. There was a time, in the heyday of Indira Gandhi, when the government set a ceiling on how much a head of a company could earn. Mr Khurshid is not suggesting a return to those times. His suggestion  or appeal  is motivated by other considerations.        
	These emerge out of the context of the governments austerity measures and the overall economic climate. Mr Khurshids argument is that under these circumstances it would appear too ostentatious, and therefore vulgar, for a chief executive of a company to receive a huge salary. He was appealing to the sense of social responsibility of corporate houses and thus make them follow the example set by the government. It is worth noting that as early as 2007, when the downturn of the economy was not even a squint in the eyes of economists, Manmohan Singh had made the same appeal. Excessive remuneration and conspicuous consumption, Mr Singh had then said, were jarring in a country with excessive poverty. It is clear from Mr Khurshids echo of the prime ministers earlier statement that the government is keeping an eye, albeit up to now a benign one, on corporate salaries. What is surprising is that such comments and suggestions are only directed at business houses and their sense of social responsibility. Sportsmen and actors in India earn huge amounts in fees and endorsements. No one has made an appeal that such earnings should be curtailed.        
	This contradiction is rooted in the deeper anomaly of a government committed to liberalization trying to keep a finger, in however benign and well-meaning a manner, in the corporate pie. Mr Khurshid is right that no one has yet claimed the extreme libertarian position that vulgarity is a fundamental right. But even a moderate liberalism claims that the State should stay away from running a business. Interference is also vulgar. Both the government and corporate houses in a civilized society should behave with responsibility.

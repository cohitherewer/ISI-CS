	It is a telling commentary on the work culture in India that the Supreme Court has to remind people of their basic duties. In the Anuradha Saha medical negligence case, the Supreme Court upheld the acquittal of the three doctors accused of criminal negligence, but reportedly stated that doctors were bound to tell their patients of the risks involved in the treatment being followed, especially since patients were likely to be ignorant of the hazards of the medicines and techniques being used. Whether or not such information had been provided would be considered in each medical negligence case. While the courts firmness is welcome, it should be embarrassing to the medical community that the Supreme Court should have to instruct them in so obvious a matter. Not all doctors are the same, but it is true that there are many among them who do not bother to keep either the patient or  when that is impossible  the people responsible for the patient in the know about the various aspects of the treatment being followed. They seem to be unaware that they are accountable to the people they have been trained to heal. This is a failure of medical ethics that should be unthinkable in a civilized country.        
	India produces some of the best doctors, whether in the cities or from the countryside. But the tendency to take patients and their families for granted has complicated social, cultural and economic causes. In the quasi-feudal, paternalistic society of independent India, training in medicine exuded a hieratic aura, and doctors were noble beings who always knew best, especially when most patients were poor and unlettered. Distorted traces of this tradition linger. Transparency never comes easily to Indians. Besides, the doctor may be in a hurry because he has too much to do (the pressure on the Indian doctor is truly amazing), or because he wants to earn more. Sometimes, there is an unconscious arrogance, born of special knowledge and a sense of power, as well as of a disguised disdain for the poor and ignorant.This last is common in Indian society in general, as is the peculiar ignorance about rights. Patients rights, beyond the very obvious ones, may be as mysterious to certain doctors as a childs rights may be to its parents. Perhaps it is fitting, after all, that the Supreme Court provided a reminder.

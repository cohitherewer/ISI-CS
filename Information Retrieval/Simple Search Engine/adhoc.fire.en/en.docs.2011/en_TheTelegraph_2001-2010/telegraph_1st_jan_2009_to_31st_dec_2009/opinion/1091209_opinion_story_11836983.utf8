The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | The defensive mindset
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        THE DEFENSIVE MINDSET                          - What hinders Indias recognition as the sixth nuclear power?					 					      Diplomacy      K.P. NAYAR                                                      
	The biggest obstacle to Indias rise in the 21st century is an Indian mindset. In January 2004, the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government began a diplomatic process with an Indo-US Next Steps in Strategic Partnership to expand bilateral cooperation in the areas of civilian nuclear activities, civilian space programmes and high-technology trade. A follow-up to this was the nuclear deal between the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, and the United State of Americas Republican president, George W. Bush. Logically, the culmination of this process ought to be Indias eventual recognition as a nuclear weapons state.        
	This objective is still quite some way down the road of diplomacy and the process will, by no means, be easy, but the United Progressive Alliance government has recently taken very tentative steps in this direction. Alas, even before such an initiative can be expanded, Indians themselves are doing everything to stymie this effort, which will change the countrys destiny.        
	For those familiar with the workings of Indian diplomacy, such negativism should not come as a surprise. At one stage during the tortuous negotiations on the Indo-US nuclear deal, an Indian negotiator told the then foreign secretary that New Delhi should not at all expect enrichment and reprocessing rights from the Americans to be included in the agreements for operationalizing the nuclear deal.        
	Sir, the Americans have never given enrichment and reprocessing rights to any country which is a non-nuclear weapons state under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. So, we should not expect to get these rights in the 123 Agreement [then being negotiated for implementation of the nuclear deal]. But the foreign secretary told this negotiator, addressing him by his first name, You are not in these negotiations to tell me what the Americans will not do for us. You are there to convey to the Americans what we want and to tell me how they will do it for us. Your job is to get us what we are seeking.              
	Shortly after the foreign secretarys firm rebuke, another negotiator was publicly asked at a forum in Washington when India and the US would resolve their differences and conclude the 123 Agreement. Without batting an eyelid, in an instant, this negotiator told the questioner that the 123 negotiations would be completed when the Americans agree to what India was seeking. The reply then produced shockwaves within the US state department and sent a clear message that India was unwilling to be pushed around.        
	Although the current, nascent efforts to seek an amendment to the NPT  to include India as the worlds sixth nuclear power  are confined to a very small circle of the prime ministers trusted aides, word has got around, as it always does in New Delhis culture of leaks, about Singhs recent discussions on this issue with two of the five nuclear weapons states recognized by the NPT. And almost as quickly, unsolicited advice has begun reaching the Prime Ministers Office that this is not a propitious time to launch any such ambitious diplomatic initiative.        
	There is a sense of dj vu about this. In 2006, when the UPA government was considering putting up Shashi Tharoor as Indias candidate for the post of UN secretary-general, naysayers in the countrys strategic community nearly scuttled the nomination. But after Tharoor was nominated, a coalition between these naysayers and sections within the ministry of external affairs ensured that Tharoors campaign did not realize its full potential. As a result, Indias candidate to head the UN defeated himself.        
	The same was true of Indias effort, along with Brazil, Germany and Japan in 2004, to change the composition of the UN security council to include India as a permanent member of the UNs top table. It was pathetic to watch some of those who handled the matter in New Delhi proverbially cutting off their nose to spite their face. Such negativism was prompted largely by their dislike of Indias then maverick permanent representative to the UN in New York: these people wanted to see that if by some chance the security council was, indeed, expanded, the credit for it should not go to the envoy in New York who was in charge of carrying out the initiative.        
	A few decades earlier, India was actually offered membership of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations when the Asean was still in its formative period, but New Delhi decided against accepting the offer. Some of Indira Gandhis aides at that time, anticipating what the then prime minister with a radical view of the world would have thought of the offer, persuaded her that it was not worth Indias while to join the Asean, the members of which soon became the Tiger economies of Asia while India was left behind.        
	The worst irony of this episode was that some 25 years later, South Block had to virtually go begging to the Asean to be accepted not as a member but as the Southeast Asian blocs dialogue partner. Even that partnership would not have come about had it not been for prime minister P.V. Narasimha Raos persistent effort to gain a toehold for India within the Asean, and for Singapores solid lobbying on behalf of New Delhi within the group in the face of determined opposition to the idea from some countries like Malaysia and Indonesia.        
	All this is not to say that the international community, which has abided by the NPT more than any other arms control agreement in the history of mankind, will bend over backwards to accept India as a nuclear weapons state through an amendment to the treaty if and when it is formally proposed.        
	To start with, one-third of the signatories to the treaty have to sign on to any change in the NPT in order for a special amendment conference to be called. Obviously, Indias new-found friends in the developed world or in the Group of Twenty will not be enough to make up that mandatory one-third of NPT membership even if they were to go along with the idea of amending the treaty. The only course open to India to mobilize support on that scale is to turn to the non-aligned movement or the Group of Seventy Seven. That ought to be a reminder to Western lobbyists within the Indian establishment that India still needs groups such as the Non-Aligned Movement and the G-77 to secure its rightful place in the international order.              
	Passing an amendment making India the worlds sixth recognized nuclear weapons state, however, requires only a simple majority at a special conference. Indias candidature for a non-permanent seat on the UN security council in next years election will give New Delhi a reasonable idea of the countrys ability to influence the community of nations with its newly emergent image as a rising power. The external affairs minister, S.M. Krishna, is already pitching for a resounding victory in this election that will take place during next years UN general assembly. If India is able to mobilize the 120 votes that Krishna is aiming for out of the UNs total membership of 192, the country would have avenged its miserable defeat at the hands of Japan when New Delhi made its last bid to get into the security council. At the same time, 120 votes in the general assembly will give New Delhi a sense of how quickly it can make its bid to amend the NPT.        
	There are other catches, however. All sitting members of the board of governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency at the time of an amendment conference to the NPT will have to unanimously favour an amendment for it to be passed, according to the provisions of the treaty. And, of course, all the five recognized nuclear weapons states have to agree to let anyone else into their exclusive club. It is pointless, at this stage, to speculate which of the big five countries will agree to an amendment favouring India or otherwise. What the countrys leadership and those entrusted with this historic initiative to draw the final curtain on Indias long nuclear winter need most of all is confidence in themselves and their cause.        
	In the past, India has lost out on the global stage when those in charge of its foreign and security policies have underestimated their countrys strengths and acted in a defensive or reactive manner. For a change, the countrys top political leadership appears to know what it wants in this instance and it is for those whose job is to implement policies to find a way to move forward, just as the one-time foreign secretary told his reluctant and defensive nuclear negotiator.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A different language
                                                                                                                 A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE                              Ananda Lal      Theatre                                                
	Two young local groups recently performed challenging projects, their difficulty quotient multiplied by the adoption of unfamiliar languages normally not heard in Calcutta theatre: Bihari and French. Nautanki dramatized the first half of Satinath Bhaduris trailblazing Bengali novel, Dhorai Charit Manas (picture), the epic of the underclass who rarely got written about  Dhorais story from birth ironically parallels Ramas heroic life. Bhaduri superimposed upon his firsthand knowledge of the dispossessed castes in Purnea his own socialist, Gandhian and nationalist ideals.        
	The director, Abhishek Basu, succeeds in bringing on board Biharis working in Calcutta, mostly taxi drivers, who in their leisure sing collectively in Palbazar or recite on the Maidan, in the name of Rama. He makes them replay their devotion on stage, simultaneously intensifying their consciousness of the common man to whose community they all belong. The method recalls Habib Tanvirs with his Chhattisgarhi artists. But Nautanki comprises mostly Bengalis and, to Basus credit, the linguistic differences do not become obvious. The 23 performers unite as a team, and the shifts from Hindi to Bhojpuri to Maithili to Bengali  among other dialects  not only do not bother us, they actually make the play more meaningful.        
	An unexpected technique that brings novelty in application is shadow puppetry for the scene in which Dhorai sees Gandhiji at a mass gathering: the stick-thin figure looks exactly like Gandhiji would have to a person a great distance away. My only suggestion to Nautanki is to complete the second part, then compress both into one manageable production. Kalyani Kalamandalam staged Dhorai commendably in 2002, but Nautanki can improve upon it.        
	Night and Fog shows maturity at last on La Cage, enacted in French for the Alliance Franaise du Bengale  which, one hopes, may mark the theatrical revitalization of this former cultural institution. In this third version in five years of The Cage, an idea that clearly obsesses writer-director Avisek Arora, the interpolation of Fernando Arrabals Fando and Lis raises the scripts quality. Few in Calcutta have attempted this overlooked French absurdist, whose Theatre of Panic manifested many concepts of Artaudian Theatre of Cruelty.        
	Fando wheels his paraplegic lover Lis on the road to the city of Tar, but his treatment of her exemplifies the maxim that we hurt the most those we love the most. Into the surreal nightmare that surrounds them, Arora throws characters like a devil, priest, seductress and junkie, and arbitrary images of savagery and innocence, to convey the ambivalent impulses in humanity, and of adult and child. The standard of acting varies, though the French is fluent, but if Arora must do Theatre of Cruelty, he should realize that he must desert the proscenium for more unorthodox spaces.

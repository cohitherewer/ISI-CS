	Mixed bag                  
	Sir  The Union finance minister, Pranab Mukherjee, has accorded a mixed treatment to industry and business groups in this years budget ( Mixed response from industry, July 7). However, there was nothing in the budget for the salaried middle class, except the raise in the income tax exemption limit by Rs 10,000. For the poor, there is the proposed National Food Security Act as well as education loans without interest; for farmers, there are farm loan waivers, which have now been extended to six months, a rural housing scheme and the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act. For the business class, there is waiver of the fringe benefit tax among other tax benefits. But the burgeoning middle class does not seem to be part of the finance ministers vision of India.          
	Yours faithfully,       
R. Sekar, Visakhapatnam 

                
	Sir  The post-election budget by the new government is unimaginative, lacklustre and does not inspire confidence. The reliefs given to the middle class are no more than crumbs. Raising the income tax slab by Rs 10,000 would not take care of inflation. The only silver lining, for servicemen, is the one-rank-one-pension scheme for personnel below the rank of officers. Now that the concept of rank-based pension has been accepted, the officers too should be included. The stock market, which had reacted positively to the United Progressive Alliances triumph in the Lok Sabha elections, has greeted this budget with a reverse arms salute by dipping by nearly 900 points.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Raghubir Singh, Pune 

                
	Sir  Budget 2009 can be described as precise and neat. However, only a few of the Great expectations regarding reforms have been met. Real estate and finance were expected to get a boost, but have been ignored. Against the governments projected expenditure, the estimated fiscal deficit stands at 6.8 per cent, which may cost development projects dear in the coming years. India has not felt the impact of global recession as badly as some other countries. Yet, care should be taken to ensure that todays expenditure does not become tomorrows headache.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Anuka Banerjee, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The budget presented by Pranab Mukherjee is not for the aam admi. Relief on surcharge for income above Rs10 lakh per annum, tax exemptions on commodity trading, lower tax rates on consumer goods such as LCD televisions, branded jewellery and other such measures will not ease the burden of the common man. The marginal tax relief will disappoint the salaried class which is suffering from the steep price rise in everyday goods. The official explanation is inadequate when it comes to indicating the extent of the price rise. The retail prices of essential commodities show that there has been a substantial increase in the local markets.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Ataur Rahman, Calcutta

                
	Sir  In the best of times, finance ministers have found it difficult, if not impossible, to produce a general budget that would please all sections of the population. These are by no means easy times: the global economy is yet to show signs of responding to efforts to nurse it back to health and the national economy is just about afloat. Given these circumstances, the finance minister, Pranab Mukherjee, has done an excellent job of formulating a budget the thrust of which is undoubtedly political but which does not cross the thin line that separates populism from pragmatism.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
J. Akshay, Secunderabad

                
	Sir  The operation was successful but the patient died. That is what happened on the day the budget was presented. Only now do the investors realize the advantage of having P. Chidambaram as the finance minister.           
	The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensex dropped by 900 points while the finance minister was presenting his budget. The stock market rejected Pranab Mukherjees proposals, causing huge loss to investors. The biggest one-day drop in the Sensex in six months after the annual budget is not at all good news for the Union ministry. The fall of the Sensex on Monday after the budget sent shudders through the Indian economy. Investors can now be sure that they do not have much to expect from Mukherjee.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
K.A. Solaman, Alappuzha, Kerala 

      
	Sir  Pranab Mukherjees budget is satisfactory considering the current economic situation. Though the market has crashed, it is sure to bounce back by the weekend. One cannot conclude that the budget has not lived up to expectations. The middle class, whose expectations are always on the higher side, is naturally disappointed at the meagre raise in the tax exemption limit. The projected fiscal deficit too is quite high, but Mukherjee says that it can be controlled. This budget is slanted in favour of rural people but is not so much for the urban aam admi who too have helped the UPA government come to power.           
	Mukherjee has reiterated his governments commitment to enact laws for the rural poor and those below the poverty line. This includes broadening the base of the highly successful NREGA by increasing the wages paid under the scheme. Schemes like the Rajiv Gandhi Vidyut Yojana and others under the integrated rural development programme are bound to raise the standard of living of the rural poor. Mukherjees special incentives to villages where scheduled castes form about a half of the population may help them stand on their own feet. It is a good budget in a time of recession, and there is no guarantee that any other finance minister would have done any better.          
	Yours faithfully,        Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee,Faridabad

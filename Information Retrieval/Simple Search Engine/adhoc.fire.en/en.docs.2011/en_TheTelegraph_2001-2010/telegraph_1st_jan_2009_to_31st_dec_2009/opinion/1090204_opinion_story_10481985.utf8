	When a man was being strangled by an assailant, he inflicted a knife blow on his attackers abdomen, killing him in the process. The man was accused of murder by a fast track court and the division bench of the Kerala High Court confirmed the verdict. The latter held that the accused had exceeded his right of self defence and sentenced him to 10 years rigorous imprisonment for culpable homicide not amounting to murder under section 304 of the IPC. The accused then appealed to the Supreme Court, contending that he had only exercised his right of self defence. The Supreme Court reiterated that the right of private defence should be exercised to the extent of protecting oneself only and agreeed with the verdict of the Kerala High Court.

	Fit and fine        
	An application for appointment to the post of a bus conductor got rejected as the applicant had a deformity in his left hip. He filed a writ petition. The single bench of the Madras High Court dismissed the petition. Upon appeal, the division bench held that the rules prohibited appointment only in respect of defective vision or hearing, bow legs, knock knees and flat foot. It maintained that since the applicant was not suffering from any of these deformities, depriving him of the job would amount to violation of the fundamental right to life which includes the right to earn a livelihood. The court observed that the transport corporation was only appointing a conductor and not a dance teacher. (P.

	Helmet a must        
	The driver of a two-wheeler, who was not wearing a helmet, was run over by a van. While granting compensation to the victim, the Kerala High Court observed that if the driver of a two-wheeler in an accident was not wearing a helmet, the insurance company could plead contributory negligence. It added that the motor accident claims tribunals should address the question in such instances and also suggested the addition of a clause in the insurance policy, making helmets compulsory for two-wheeler drivers.

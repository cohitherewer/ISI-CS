The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | monster in the making
                                                                                                                 MONSTER IN THE MAKING                                  Bona Fide - Malvika Singh                              
	Walkouts from Parliament have begun yet again, invading the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha regularly like a virus. Such disruptions of serious discussion and debate only goes to show the lack of commitment of the Opposition to larger issues that affect India. As a citizen, I have never been able to comprehend why a difference of opinion cannot be argued cogently and with clarity in an effort to convince the majority of the position taken. It shows up the limited intellectual abilities of the bulk of the elected representatives who seem unable to present alternatives in a language that is civilized, thoughtful, sans abuse, snide remarks and baseless accusations. The circus is embarrassing and shameful.        
	The time has come for the right authority to ensure full attendance, complete sessions of debate, and that no walkouts or boycotts take place. This can be done by issuing two yellow cards and then suspension from the session. It is the citizens hard-earned money that these men and women are playing around with, and there has to be some accountability. If the elected representatives want to continue the business of Parliament as they have for the last decade in particular, they should create a special fund by donating a percentage of their personal wealth to maintain their unacceptable shenanigans. They must also cease to occupy private houses owned by the State and supported by the tax-payers. A radical overhaul of the archaic system is imperative. The restructuring needs to happen now, and the processes have to change immediately, before India is exploited any further. This, too, should be high on the agenda of the prime minister.        
	It is due to the weak, often self-serving, political bosses with vested interests and no overarching plan for development that the bureaucracy has become proactive in serving itself first, divorced from the really urgent political, social and economic needs and demands. The babus have begun to take political sides, batting for their chosen political masters and not for the job at hand, regardless of ideologies. This has encouraged illegitimate and wrong practices that have, over the years, turned into the deadly virus called corruption.                
	Watch closely        
	I am always surprised to find leading, honest and successful politicians turn a blind eye to facts presented before them about the many irregularities indulged in by the babus, immediately under them who sit in their private offices. It is as though they believe a fairy godmother will wish the truth away. They seem to be in perpetual denial. In the process, they have managed to nurture and protect an impossible monster that has overwhelmed them. Today, the bureaucrat presides over the elected politician instead of the other way round. The same can also be said of the backroom boys and girls, men and women, who control the many political dispensations. Something has to give and expose the rot.        
	Protection of bad governance, corruption, malpractice and irregularities indulged in by elected politicians and civil servants have put India in the list of third world countries. Many of the politicians responsible for reducing the polity to this abysmal level get excited and patriotic whenever correct criticism is directed at India as a State. It is these leaders alone who have destroyed the ethics and values of this nation-state. Add to this, their inability to engage intellectually with experts because of their lack of interest in the subject of the ministry they happen to be in charge of. This indifference has corroded the influence of the government on ideas and alternatives that will take India to the global high table.         
	We need an intelligent, literate, committed political class, aided by a smaller, cohesive, carefully selected band of babus, closely monitored to deliver the agenda for India.

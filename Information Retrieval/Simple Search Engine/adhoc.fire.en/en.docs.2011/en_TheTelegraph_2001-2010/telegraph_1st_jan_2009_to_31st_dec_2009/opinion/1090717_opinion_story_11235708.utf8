	A new tune                  
	Sir  The approach of Asif Ali Zardari towards India is a clear break from that of the past heads of State of Pakistan (India changes Pakistan tune, July 13). Whether or not he is able to enforce his will through decisive action, his ability to speak the truth makes him different from his predecessors. After the 26 /11 terror attacks in Mumbai he said that Pakistan was suffering from a cancer, referring to terrorism (CIA monster, May 12). But in spite of admitting that terrorism was corroding Pakistan, Zardari was able to do little to curb it, and then the Taliban overran the Swat valley. So far, there seems to be little reason to believe that Zardaris worry will be translated into action against terrorists.           
	Earlier, Pervez Musharraf did not admit that terrorism was being bred in Pakistan  he denied the presence of terror camps there and insisted that extremists were a minority. But on the ground, Musharraf was strong in action  he tried to curb radical Islamist forces and keep extremist elements in check. The offensive on Lal Masjid cost him a section of his civilian support. India might keep in mind that it should not be taken in by words alone and should insist on clear action on the ground.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Fatal fall          
	Sir  It is unfortunate that there were two accidents in two days at the Metro railway construction site in Delhi (Metro Man returns, July 14 ). A few accidents had already taken place since work started. These not only cost human lives but also shake peoples confidence in the reliability of safety measures. One can only wish that there are no more such incidents and the construction is successfully completed.           
	Moreover, a metro system above the surface takes up road space and so increases traffic congestion. It also spoils the citys beauty and may not be environmentally friendly. The solution is simple: have all metro tracks underground.          
	One reason for building overhead metros is the steep rise in construction costs underground. But this could be recovered by the issue of public bonds and by raising the fare a little.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Mahesh Kapasi, New Delhi 

                
	Sir  It is rare that the ruling and the opposition parties are unanimous on an issue. But that did happen when both the chief minister and the leader of the Opposition in Delhi refused to accept E. Sreedharans resignation over the Metro mishap. The Metro chiefs dedication has gifted the capital city with a widespread rail network. The man in the street would find no reason for Sreedharans resignation, given in order to accept responsibility for the accident at the metro site.           
	However, if some politician had resigned after the accident, thus following the ideal of Lal Bahadur Shastri, who was once the Union railway minister, there might not have been any such sympathy wave as arose immediately for Sreedharan.           
	Reportedly, no measures had been undertaken by the Delhi Metro Railway Corporation even after cracks were discovered in a pillar. To ensure accountability among contractors and officials, stringent action should be taken against the culprits responsible for such accidents.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Subhash Chandra Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi              
	Sir  In ancient vastushastra, it was ordained that the architect should be a man of character. E. Sreedharan, the chief of Delhi Metro, in tendering his resignation over the fallen bridge for which he was not directly responsible, has shown moral strength rare in modern times. Delhi Metro and the earlier Konkan railway could progress so well because of the technical competence as well as the high sense of ethics of those involved in their construction. People like Sreedharan are national assets and should be guiding transport projects at the national level.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Raghubir Singh, Pune

                
	Sir  The two major accidents at the surface metro construction site in Delhi a few days ago not only took the lives of innocent employees but also gave rise to fear among the people living nearby. The plan of setting up surface metro in Calcutta has already been put into action. The construction has led to large-scale felling of trees and digging of roads in Salt Lake. After the accidents in Delhi, people living close to the construction sites in Calcutta no longer feel safe. One hopes for a safe and steady progress of the project.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Umang Sharma, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Just after the first major accident at the Delhi Metro Railway work site, another accident occurred in which six people were injured. From the photographs, it seems that none of the mobile cranes deployed belonged to either Gammon India or the Delhi Metro Railway Corporation. Their markings suggested that they are owned by private contractors.           
	Such cranes are usually imported from second-hand markets outside India. Seldom do the cranes have the operational load moment limiter, an important safety device. Such cranes can cause serious damage to life and property. While awarding contracts, large Indian firms should thoroughly check the condition of cranes instead of going by the lowest rate.           
	Yours faithfully,       
R. Sekar, Visakhapatnam

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Plunging in
                                                                                                                 PLUNGING IN                                                    
	Behind the celebrations over the passing of the right of children to free and compulsory education bill lies a fundamental question. Is it better to give things a push-start, or to have every detail worked out before taking the plunge? The Union minister for human resource development, Kapil Sibal, clearly believes in jumping in at the deep end first  and making everyone else do the same  once a broad framework has been put in place. And the new law enabling all children between six and 14 years of age to demand subsidized elementary education from the government does have both goal and framework. Not that the plunge is unprepared for. The moment has been long in the making, beginning with debates within the constituent assembly, to the drafts of the National Democratic Alliance, till compulsory elementary education changed from a directive principle of state policy into a fundamental right through a constitutional amendment in 2002, and then on to the efforts of the United Progressive Alliance in its first incarnation, till it came to fruition this month. It was high time. But the problems of educating every child, even those who need to work, or who are disabled, or for whom going to school is a difficult, sometimes frightening, first-generation adventure, are yet to be addressed on a practical level.        
	The questions raised by the new law lead in different directions. Why 14, why not 16? asks one. A similar worry is directed towards the below-six child, although the law directs states to arrange for the pre-school education of three to six-year-olds. This opens the door to a host of problems. The Centre-state funding formula is vague, although the states have been given a number of responsibilities, including the opening of neighbourhood schools wherever needed and free travel for students. Already, the states feel that they were not consulted before the final planning in spite of education being on the concurrent list. The unease over the possible exclusion of differently abled children has been quelled by Mr Sibals assurance that they would be included in the 25 per cent reservation for disadvantaged children that every school, government or private, must henceforth provide.        
	In spite of many more doubts, what is promising about the legislation is that it requires a combination of governmental effort and civil societys participation to become meaningful. This includes parental presence in school managing committees, although the mindset required for this synergic relationship is yet to evolve. But even if the push-start option gets things moving, it cannot make up for the laws peculiar blankness about teachers. Where are they to come from, how trained must they be and how rewarded if they are to make private tuition superfluous for even the first-generation learners? There cannot be a law about education without a serious look at the educators.

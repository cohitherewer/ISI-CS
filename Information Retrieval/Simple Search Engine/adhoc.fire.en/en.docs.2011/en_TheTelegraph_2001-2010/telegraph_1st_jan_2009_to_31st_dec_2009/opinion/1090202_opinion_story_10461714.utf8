	A recent news item proclaims that China has become the worlds third largest economy earlier than expected, having overtaken Germany in 2007. This follows the publication of revised estimates by the Chinese National Bureau of Statistics which show that in 2007, their economy grew by 13 per cent instead of the earlier estimate of just under 12 per cent. Although Chinas rapid economic growth has slowed down quite appreciably, it is more or less certain that the Chinese economy will soon overtake that of Japan. And, why should it be a surprise if it overtakes that of the United States of America in the foreseeable future?        
	This news comes at a time when the Chinese have just completed 30 years of the process of economic reforms initiated by Deng Xiaoping towards the end of 1978. He is reported to have justified the reform process by remarking Engels never flew on an aeroplane; Stalin never wore Dacron! Deng was careful not to tread on too many toes, and deliberately shied away from a big-bang approach  changes were introduced almost one step at a time. Perhaps this gradual approach helped to stave off extreme opposition from the more dogmatic Maoist factions.        
	Given the overwhelming importance of rural China and the agricultural sector in those days, it is not surprising that the reform process started in the rural economy. The implementation of the family contract system gave land contracts to individual families. Families had to sell a certain amount of grain to the state at specified prices, but could sell production above the quota in the market. Another major step was the dismantling of the collective communes. Chinese agriculture was also transformed by the introduction of chemical fertilizers, pesticides and hybrid seeds.               
	Changes in the industrial sector proceeded at the proverbial snails pace. Some idea of this can be gauged by the fact that even as late as 1992, state-owned and collectively-owned enterprises contributed as much as 86 per cent of the total output of Chinese industry. However, the late Nineties witnessed two very far-reaching reforms. Thousands of SOEs were dismantled and urban housing was privatized. The former was initiated by the state in order to lay the foundation of a modern economy  the aim was to transform the SOEs into modern corporations whose products could compete with the best in the world. (This process was not without teething troubles, with countless allegations that managers were privately selling off state assets.) Some steps were also taken during this period to modernize the financial sector.        
	Whether by accident or design, the Chinese also adopted an approach towards industrialization that was very different from the Soviet model of reliance on heavy industries (also characteristic of the Indian planning process). Instead, China relied on the development of labour-intensive light industries. It is only during the second half of the reform era that emphasis shifted towards the production of heavy manufacturing industries. The early emphasis on labour-intensive production allowed the economy to successfully absorb a growing population into gainful employment  a feature which has been singularly absent in the Indian economic experience.        
	Of course, despite the many initiatives taken by the Chinese leaders to create a market-friendly economy, their economy is in many important respects very different from that of Western capitalist countries. In fact, it resembles the Indian economy in several ways. For instance, the currency is not fully convertible, and capital flows in and out of the country are controlled. The government still controls prices of some commodities such as electricity and fuel. Although private sector production now accounts for two-thirds of the countrys manufacturing output, the SOEs continue to dominate important sectors such as banking, telecommunication and aviation. The government does not seem to have any plans of relinquishing control of these strategic sectors. The most significant difference from most other countries is that rural land is still the communal property of the village  individual families only have use rights.        
	By almost any yardstick, the Chinese reform process has been a tremendous success story. No country in the world has come even close to matching the performance of the Chinese economy, which has recorded close to double-digit rates of growth for several years in succession. The Chinese economy now contributes 6 per cent of total world output, which is three times its share in the late Seventies. Its economic clout now matches its political clout in the international arena.         
	However, all is not hunky-dory as China faces some serious economic and social problems. In the economic sphere, the global slowdown has cast its shadow over the Chinese economy. Its export sector is large, and the lack of world demand for Chinese products has had a significant negative impact on the overall economy. The most pessimistic estimate suggests that the growth rate could actually be as low as 5-6 per cent during this year  this would mean an almost 50 per cent drop in growth rates. The economy would then not be able to create the required number of additional jobs.        
	The social problems are perhaps more severe. Unfortunately, the fruits of growth have been very unevenly distributed amongst the Chinese population. The Chinese Gini index of income  a standard measure of inequality  has been rising steadily and is now 0.47. This is significantly higher than that of India (0.37) and the US (0.41). There has been a tremendous disparity in the rates of growth across regions as well as sectors. While the regional economies of eastern and coastal provinces have been transformed, other parts of the country have witnessed relative stagnation. Similarly, the urban-rural divide has widened significantly over the last 15 years.              
	The effects of the increasing inequality have been exacerbated because the various tiers of government have not stepped up social-sector spending to appropriate levels. Chinese people no longer enjoy the job security they did in the pre-reform era. This is particularly unfortunate because unemployment, especially in rural areas, has been rising steadily. There are also reports that the healthcare system below the county level is on the brink of collapse. Some of the poorer provinces have witnessed an absolute fall in the number of hospital beds on a per capita basis. All this has contributed to increasing social protest  there has been a sustained rise in what officials call mass group incidents.        
	Mass discontent can have severe repercussions on leaders in totalitarian regimes. The Chinese leadership is aware of this fact, and is trying to take remedial action. There is increasing emphasis on the need to correct regional disparities, and the government has decided to step up public expenditure in backward areas. The leadership has now decided to give priority to the need to build a harmonious society. If this goal is pursued with the same vigour with which the earlier reforms were pursued, China will certainly become a significantly more egalitarian society.

	Unfair deal        
	Disciplinary proceedings were initiated against an inspector of the railway works for buying substandard wood and he was pronounced guilty. When the appellate authority dismissed the appeal, he filed an application before the Central Administrative Tribunal and won the case. The Union of Indias appeal to the Madhya Pradesh High Court was dismissed. When the Union of India appealed to the Supreme Court, it dismissed the appeal, holding that natural justice had been violated. The officers request that the person who had assessed the wood be summoned had been turned down. The court held that if a person applied for a particular witness the authorities could not turn him down. (Union of India vs Prakash Kumar Jandon)        
	Humane approach                    
	 When an anonymous letter alleged that a man was guilty of caste bias, a complaint was filed against him. An enquiry found him guilty and he was awarded a punishment transfer. After his representation that his case be considered on humanitarian grounds was rejected, he approached a tribunal. During the pendency of the case a second order was passed and he did not join his new post. The Supreme Court held that the transfer order was illegal as it was based on an anonymous complaint and not on administrative exigencies. And so, although in such cases not joining is treated as no work, no pay, the authorities were directed to treat his period of non-joining as leave and reconsider his case. (Somesh Tiwari vs Union of India)                    
	No damage        
	 A patient filed a complaint of negligence against a doctor when his hearing was impaired due to medicinal side effects after undergoing kidney transplantation. When expert opinion was sought, the doctor nominated for the purpose opined that the use of the life-saving drug was justified. However, the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission slapped damages to the tune of Rs 4 lakh with interest on the doctor. When he appealed to the Supreme Court, it held that merely because the patients hearing was impaired did not mean that the doctor had been negligent. It added that a lot of medicines had side effects and the drug was used as a desperate measure to save the patients life. (Martin F. DSouza vs Mohd. Ishfaq)        
	SOLON

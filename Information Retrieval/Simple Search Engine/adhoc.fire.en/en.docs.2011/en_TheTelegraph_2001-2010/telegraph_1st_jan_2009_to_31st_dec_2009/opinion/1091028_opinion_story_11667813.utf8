                                                                                                                 LEGAL FAQS                                  Advocate Nibedita Roye answers your queries                              
	Q:My daughter, 23, was in a relationship with a classmate for four years. Although the boy had repeatedly said that he intended to marry her, he is now not interested in taking the relationship forward. He has even told his parents and friends that my daughter is cheap, and that there was no love between the two. Many of their common friends knew about their relationship but are silent now. My daughter has gone into a state of depression as he goes around maligning her. She has enough SMSes from him and pictures to prove their relationship. Please suggest some legal steps.        
	Soma Hazra, via email                
	A: Your daughter should send a legal notice to her classmate through an advocate immediately, warning him to stop causing disrepute to her. If he continues it, she can file a defamation suit against him, claiming compensation for the injury caused to her reputation.              
	Q:One of my neighbours has turned a part of his house into a lathe factory which is causing a lot of pollution in our area. When I protested, he and his accomplices began to badmouth me. I have lodged written complaints both with the pollution control board and the municipal commissioner, but in vain. It appears that the municipality issues false licences to such factories without proper inspection. Is there any way out of this nuisance?        
	S. Ghatak, Calcutta                
	A: You should lodge a complaint with your local police station regarding the nuisance caused by your neighbour and also file a civil suit for temporary and permanent injunction against him. If a prima facie case is established the court might pass an order, restraining your neighbour from carrying out the annoying activities that endanger the health and safety of his neighbours.         
	Q:Our building has six flats. None of the occupants can use the roof of our building as our late landlady constructed an unauthorised asbestos shed, which has been let out on rent for the past 15 years. How can we have the roof legally vacated?        
	Sandeep Das, via email                
	A: Since the unauthorised asbestos shed has been let out for the last 15 years, only her legal heirs have the right to evict the tenant. You, being co-tenants, have no legal right to get the roof vacated. However, you could inform the Calcutta Municipal Corporation about the unauthorised construction and wait for it to take action in this regard.

                                                                                                                 YOUNG INDIA                              What do the values that Gandhi stood for mean to schoolchildren today?                                        
	Gandhian principles have often been described as rigid and are believed to cultivate discipline in society. Some equate Gandhi with non-violence, though the concept of ahimsa was not his contribution. He preached peace and applied this principle to politics. It worries me when I see politicians breaking all decorum in Parliament to suit their vested interests. There is no doubt that the spread of non-violence is imperative for instituting change in an unstable world. The path of truth is the path of non-violence. Once society learns to speak only the truth, perhaps we would not need such programmes as Sach Ka Saamna.        
	We want fast results and short-term gains, and in the process of attaining these goals, we tend to disregard truth and non-violence. It is also true that these standing principles do not bring instant success but bestows one with the confidence and perseverance needed to triumph. Even in this day and age, people have shown active resistance through non-violence. Recently, Islamic clerics came out showering roses, demanding the closure of a liquor shop in Lucknow. The shop-owner promised to move his premises elsewhere. For the protesters, it was a moral victory over what was perceived as an unattainable task. Even today, peaceful resistance through hunger strikes has been successful in securing public support for justice.        
	It is well known that vegetarian food is better for our diet. A similar principle was laid down by Gandhiji. The frenzy of health-conscious living finds inspiration in his philosophies. He was also opposed to alcohol and promiscuity. These principles could provide a guideline for a better society with lower incidences of deadly diseases. Gandhi was also a staunch believer in brahmacharya. For him, it meant control of the senses in thought, word and deed.        
	The idea of his that still has to do a lot with Indian polity is simplicity. Wearing khadi and completely withdrawing from a Western lifestyle are perhaps impossible today. At present, Gandhis code of simplicity has translated into modified conduct. Even after 62 years of independence, a large section of Indians live in deprivation. Thus, it is important for the rest of the society to lead a simpler life, so as to empathize with, and express compassion for, fellow human beings. The present austerity drive might curb the perks of a politician but it would also allow the poor to relate better with their leaders. Gandhis belief in equality still has relevance, though undercurrents of discrimination still pervade the social order.         
	Gandhian principles have modified effects on our lives today. His principles were intertwined with the practical, day-to-day problems of the masses. Gandhis loyalties lay not with abstractions, but with living human beings. In everything he did, he tried to mould a new Indian who could stand on his own feet and make India truly free, a process that is yet to meet its coveted destiny. I have conceived no such thing as Gandhism, Gandhi declared. I am not an exponent of any sect. I never claimed to have originated any philosophy. But Gandhism will continue to be an integral part of our existence as Indians and as citizens of this world.

	In India, even a toddler knows who Mahatma Gandhi is. But I am sure you could count on your fingers the number of people who actually follow his teachings. There are a few people, though, who do strive to pursue his teachings in real life. When Barack Obama was asked if he had a chance to invite a famous person to dinner, whom he would choose, he said Mahatma Gandhi. Obama said that it was by following Gandhis teachings that he had become the man he is today. He even has a picture of Gandhi hanging in his office.  
	But what do his teachings actually represent? Do they involve protesting non-violently or never telling lies? Different people make different meanings of his teachings. To me, he simply symbolizes hope. He gives new meaning to the proverb, Where there is a will, there is always a way!  he teaches me that if you think you can, then you can! And that itself is half the battle won. The battle may not necessarily have to do with freeing a country from oppression. It can simply mean the determination to score a 100 in a subject in the next examination if you have managed 89 in one.        
	Gandhi has taught me that although violence may sometimes seem to be the easy way out, it does not pay later; that failure is the stepping-stone to success; that it is of utmost necessity to respect your parents without whom you are nothing. The Father of the Nation has taught me to value life, the importance of believing in myself, of living life to the fullest and of smiling through its darkest hours.

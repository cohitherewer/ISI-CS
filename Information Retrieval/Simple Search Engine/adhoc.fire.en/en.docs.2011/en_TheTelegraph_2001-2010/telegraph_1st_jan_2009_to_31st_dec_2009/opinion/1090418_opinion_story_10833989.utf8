	A rudderless front                  
	Sir  In the run up to the Lok Sabha election, the so-called third front has not been performing as expected. When all the national parties revealed their prime ministerial preferences, the third front showed little clear and unanimous thinking on the matter. This has led to confusions among their supporters. The third front has become a ship without a captain, each leader doing as he wishes. A prominent personality, who can effectively lead the front, is yet to emerge. Without it, the front cannot live up to the standards of a modern democracy.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Troubled hills          
	Sir  Eyebrows have been raised against the Bharatiya Janata Party for fielding Jaswant Singh as a candidate for the Darjeeling Lok Sabha seat with the support of the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha, whose objective is to have a separate Gorkhaland. States based on ethnicity have been part of the history of Indian federalism since Independence. No separatist bogey was raised during the creation of states like Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Meghalaya, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Uttarakhand. Then why are the Gorkhas being condemned as undemocratic? If they feel that they are different from the Bengalis in language, foodhabits and dress, their sentiments should be respected. If the Gorkhas want to live separately, then they cannot be forced to be a part of West Bengal. That would amount to a kind of colonialism.          
	The Marxists, who are opposing the idea of a Gorkhaland, are themselves trying to form a third front including the Telengana Rashtriya Samiti, whose policy is to divide Andhra Pradesh to form a Telengana state. So, is whats good in Andhra Pradesh bad in West Bengal?          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Jaswants hill ride: 9 hours, 40 stops (April 8) and the picture of the cavalcade arranged by the GJM have really upset me. It is true that in Darjeeling, the majority of the people are Gorkha. The Gorkha National Liberation Front and now the GJM are demanding a separate Gorkhaland and their intransigent politics has devastated Darjeeling, the hill queen.           
	In this troubled situation, all that matters to politicians is horsetrading for the one seat in Parliament. I am concerned that the BJPs commitment to the idea of a Gorkhaland will open a Pandoras box if it comes to power. The bogey of separatism in Kashmir is still frightening us. Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh have been divided for better administration and not over ethnicity. The integrity of the country should not be jeopardized for vote-bank politics.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  The Raigad district of Maharashtra is in a rain-surplus belt. But the scarcity of drinking water has turned it into a luxury, in the absence of irrigation projects or drinking water schemes. Unfortunately, no leader or political party has made any serious effort to tackle this issue. Now that industrial projects are about to make an entry in the district, there is a surfeit of leaders and voluntary organizations opposing the projects on flimsy grounds.           
	The governor claims in his speech before the legislature that SEZ projects will generate 65 lakh jobs in the state. But leaders from the ruling party fuel local resistance to the projects. It is the public that pays for this duplicity. On top of this, the same leaders and parties approach the people for their votes. This amounts to a desecration of democracy.                     
	Yours faithfully,

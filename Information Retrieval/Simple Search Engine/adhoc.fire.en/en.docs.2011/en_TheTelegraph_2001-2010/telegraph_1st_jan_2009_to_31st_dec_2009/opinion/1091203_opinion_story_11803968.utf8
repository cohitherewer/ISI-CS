	Act now                  
	Sir  The editorial, Time matters (Nov 27), rightly says that Pakistan has an uncanny sense of timing. It is possible that Pakistan is trying to beguile the international community by convicting the seven terror suspects of the 26/11 carnage just a day before the anniversary of the tragedy. The timing for the filing of an application by Pakistan before the supreme court against the release of the Jamaat-ud-Dawa chief, Hafeez Saeed, was as perfect. The application came just before the prime minister of Pakistan, Yousaf Raza Gilani, met the Indian prime minister at Sharm el-Sheikh. Only a year has passed since 26/11. It may be too early for Pakistan to try to lessen the effect of the Mumbai carnage with such tactics. The wounds remain; so do concerns for India. Pakistan had initially dragged its feet on bringing the perpetrators to book even after a lot of time had gone by since the attacks.          
	Not only India but also the world has failed to make Pakistan mend its ways. This is also because of the fact that the response of the world to the 26/11 attack has been largely uneven. The Mumbai massacre revealed the gaps in Indias intelligence apparatus, the inability of its security forces to deal with external threats, and the ineptness of its political machinery.          
	Even though 26/11 is the most vivid image of terrorism in the national consciousness today, India has been putting up with jihadi terror attacks since a long time. It is time for India to be more concerned about Pakistans agenda of malice against it. The former needs to be efficient in fighting terror  the army, the national intelligence agency and the National Security Guards must have a better co-ordination. Expansion and elaboration of human and technical competence are also required. India needs to act fast, before the terrorists can plan yet another attack on the country. Pakistan should be made to realize that India would not tolerate State-sponsored terrorism any more.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  In Pakistan, a trial against the perpetrators of terror attacks has finally started, with the Lashkar-e-Toiba chief, Zaki-ur Rahman Lakhvi, as one of the indicted. But Pakistan does not seem to be too keen on acting against the elements present within its own State machinery that patronize terrorism against India.          
	The United States of America, too, has been following double standards in its approach towards terrorism. On the one hand, the US has asserted that Pakistan should crack down on terror groups flourishing on its soil. But on the other hand, the US wants to continue providing financial aid to Islamabad, knowing well that this aid may be used to strengthen and arm Pakistani terrorists. India has been trying to unite the international community against Pakistans support of terrorism. But the attitude of the US and China conveys that Pakistan is hardly under any pressure from them to eliminate the terror outfits or to take action against the seven accused in the 26/11 attacks. The editorial rightly concludes that it is possible that this trial would go the same way as that of the JuD chief.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Dilbag Rai, Chandigarh 

                
	Error report          
	Sir  The technical problems that hampered Indias first computerized common aptitude test are the result of inefficient planning (Online birth pangs dog CAT, Nov 29). That the controllers did not arrange for a backup system to be followed in case possible impediments crop up demonstrates their incompetence. Modernization at the cost of harassment of the examinees is unfair. Since the test was being conducted for the first time, such problems could not have been ruled out.          
	The authorities should have carried out online mock tests, and should have put up a list of measures to be adopted if any problem arose. The dates for the rescheduled tests might clash with other important examinations. The dignity of the CAT exams has been tarnished by this incident. Also, it was nave to presume that all students taking the test would be proficient in computers.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Abhirup Bhunia, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The technical hazards that impeded the online CAT exams harassed the candidates, who could not access some of the questions. The foolproof security on the server had apparently blocked even the test questions. The organizers have apparently run the security system without proper preparation. Although they seem to think that this mess was caused by isolated technical glitches, it has affected the confidence of candidates.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  Firing bullets has become a prominent mode of celebration during marriage parties in certain Indian states. In Delhi, a woman was killed and three others were injured in two such incidents. The government should take strict legal action against those engaging in such meaningless acts.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
S.C. Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Bailing out
                                                                                                                 BAILING OUT                                  In an occasional series on aspects of the Indian judicial system, this week Anirban Das Mahapatra focuses on the types of bail and ways of getting them                           Star accused: Sanjay Dutt after he was released from Yerwada jail on bail in 2007                                  
	The names bond. Not the Quantum of Solace kind, but that which gets you out of a sordid brush with the law. The world knows it by another four-letter word  bail.        
	Every other day, newspapers are full of reports of people applying for it. Then there are those terms, bailable and non-bailable offences, which are associated with almost every conceivable crime but are seldom explained in detail. There is also that convenient ejection seat which many people use to wriggle out of trouble  the anticipatory bail. But should you be in a situation that requires you to get a bail, do you know what exactly needs to be done?        
	Theoretically defined, a bail means a legal bond that ensures the release of an arrested person from police custody. The concept of bail hinges on the fact that the law assumes every accused person to be innocent until proven guilty. So even while an accused is under trial, a bail can assure his or her temporary freedom from custody.        
	That, of course, brings us to the issue of bailable and non-bailable offences. The notion that bailable offences are those in which bail can be granted, while non-bailable offences leave no scope for an accused to apply for bail, is a myth, say legal experts. In both cases, the accused are entitled to bail. Its just that the latter entails certain conditions.        
	Bail in a bailable offence is a matter of right for every citizen, says senior Supreme Court advocate and human rights activist Colin Gonsalves. It is granted by a court to an accused person entirely upon his or her own personal bond and request, and requires no guarantees except for the accuseds promise to turn up regularly at court hearings and to turn himself or herself into the hands of the law if and when proven guilty.        
	A non-bailable offence, on the other hand, is one where the decision to grant a person bail rests solely in the hands of a court of law. Bail granted in non-bailable offences also requires a surety in the form of a third party who guarantees to the court that the accused will turn up at hearings and not abscond during court proceedings, besides yielding to the law if proven guilty, says Gonsalves. Sometimes a non-bailable offence also requires a surety in the form of a financial guarantee called bail amount, which is subject to forfeiture if the accused either absconds or fails to turn up during hearings, he adds. The amount to be guaranteed is also determined by the court and varies from case to case.              
	Needless to say, non-bailable offences are of a more serious nature than bailable offences. A detailed list of bailable and non-bailable offences is provided under the first schedule of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). To cite a few examples, bailable offences range from being a member of an unlawful assembly, assaulting a public servant, bribery and influencing or impersonating at an election, to adulterating food and drink items. Non-bailable offences, on the other hand, include counterfeiting of currency, rape, culpable homicide or attempt to do so and kidnapping.        
	The process for applying for bail, say legal experts, is fairly uncomplicated. Upon being arrested for a bailable offence, all one needs to do is ask the police to furnish bail on the spot. The police are bound to oblige.        
	In the case of a non-bailable offence, a person is required to furnish an application for granting bail to a judicial magistrate, in most cases the lowermost court authorised to probe the offence he or she has been arrested for. Apart from a request, the accused must produce a third-party surety who would guarantee his or her appearance in court, and arrest in case of conviction.        
	The law, however, states that it is entirely up to the court to decide whether or not to grant bail to a person arrested for a non-bailable offence. And the decision can depend on a number of factors. For example, the CrPC states that bail may be denied if there are reasonable grounds for believing that (the accused) has been guilty of an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life, or if the accused had been previously convicted of an offence punishable with death, imprisonment for life or imprisonment for seven years or more, or if the person was previously convicted on two or more occasions of a non-bailable and cognisable offence.        
	However, the person can always approach a higher court in case his or her bail application has been rejected, says senior Supreme Court advocate and former law minister Shanti Bhushan. Upon being rejected by a lower court, an application can be taken up to a higher court of authority, and can travel all the way up to the Supreme Court, he adds.        
	That is precisely what actor Sanjay Dutt did in 2007 after being tried and found guilty by a special court and sentenced to six years of rigorous imprisonment for his alleged involvement in the 1993 Mumbai blasts. Dutts lawyer moved the Supreme Court, not only challenging the lower courts decision but also seeking bail. The apex court admitted his plea and Dutt was subsequently granted bail.              
	But then, such procedures can take time. So the law also allows people the privilege of arranging for bail in advance, in the form of anticipatory bail. The CrPC states that anticipatory bail can be obtained when any person has reason to believe that he may be arrested on accusation of having committed a non-bailable offence, which may either be false or trumped up against him owing to personal enmity or partisan reasons. Provided under Section 438 of the CrPC, anticipatory bail can be sought by a person from a sessions court or a high court. In granting anticipatory bail, the court may, if it thinks fit, direct that in the event of such arrest, (the person) shall be released on bail, states the law.        
	However, this clause is often abused. Very often, the rich and powerful use their connections and present false apprehensions to the court to obtain bail, says Delhi-based criminal lawyer V.K. Ohri. An extreme form of abuse, says Ohri, is the oft-used tactic of obtaining anticipatory bail from a city or town different from that where the offence was committed, often by providing false addresses and domicile proof. What makes it worse is that the court doesnt try people for perjury if they are found to have provided false statements and reasons while seeking anticipatory bail, says Ohri.        
	But the law does finally have its way, warns Ohri. If the reason for seeking anticipatory bail is found to be false, it would work against an accused during the proceedings of the actual case for which bail had been sought earlier.        
	So know your law, and tread with caution.

	Home truths                  
	Sir  India should be grateful to Vijay Mallya for buying out Mohandas Karamchand Gandhis personal belongings at an auction in the United States of America (Hic! Rs 9 crore for Bapu heritage, March 7). Mallya had salvaged the pride of the nation once before when he bought back the sword of Tipu Sultan. One does hope that the government allows him to import these items duty-free, unlike the last time when a huge amount was demanded as customs duty. Several national treasures have been carted out of the country before and after Independence. These are now surfacing, as the owners are putting them up for sale. The Centre should have a policy and appropriate funds in place to ensure that these treasures can be purchased and repatriated. Otherwise the government will continue searching for solutions, and a Mallya may not come to the rescue every time.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The government of India behaved rather childishly while trying to retrieve objects used by Mahatma Gandhi from a collector. The prime ministers advice to a cabinet minister, to do whatever it takes to reclaim the articles, is in contrast to the teachings of the Mahatma. It is ironic that those who vouch for their commitment to Gandhian ideals often betray such sentiments in public. How could the Centre conclude that bringing back these things at any cost would enhance its devotion to Gandhis principles? Apart from some cosmetic brush-ups here and there, no concrete action has ever been initiated to spread his teachings to the masses. It is precisely these momentary gimmicks that are responsible for the burial of whatever values the Mahatma stood for. The present political and social scenario, thickly clouded by corruption, nepotism, dishonesty and violence, owes its characteristics to the neglect of Gandhis teachings, which were never allowed to grow roots on Indian soil.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  With Vijay Mallya buying the Gandhi memorabilia that went under the hammer in New York, the curtains have come down on an unedifying episode from which the Centre should have steered clear. Apart from its skewed logic, that everything Gandhi had touched, owned or gifted others in his lifetime ought to be brought back to India, the fact that the government even negotiated with James Otis, who had provided the items for the auction, has done more harm to Indias image than any good. To let a non-Indian purchase the memorabilia would not make us revere the Mahatma any less. Indeed, Gandhi would have been shocked to see the government waste millions on collecting memorabilia rather than spending it on the poor, whose cause he advanced.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  In its effort to safeguard certain personal effects of Mahatma Gandhi, the government of India found a benefactor in Vijay Mallya. It is ironic that the man who saved the country from the embarrassment of losing these items used by the Father of the Nation is none other than a flamboyant liquor baron. The incident is a classic example of how the nation treats the Mahatma, who has been reduced to a symbol of the great soul of India, which we all so proudly speak of. But how many care to remember the values that Gandhi upheld? The politicians who flaunt their khadi have huge assets in their names and speak the truth only when it is convenient for them to do so. Even social workers, who pledge to work for the downtrodden, lead a glamorous life.          
	No doubt the nation should be grateful for Mallyas gesture, but perhaps Gandhi, a teetotaller who prized asceticism, would turn in his grave if he knew that the saviour of these objects is someone who stands far from all that he taught and lived for. Many of us respect Gandhi, but equally, we aspire to be like Mallya  the king of good times. If Gandhis legacies are to be saved, we should preserve the principles he lived by.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  On February 7, I went to submit my voter registration application form to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation in Behala. I went there well ahead of the opening time, but was not surprised by the long queue. What astonished me was that only three counters opened at 12 pm, one for Behala West and two for Behala East, to cater to more than 500 people. The counters were supposed to work from 10 am. Since the queues were long, arguments broke out from time to time. To my surprise, not a single CMC volunteer was present to solve the disputes. As so many were waiting, the police should have been around. There was no provision for drinking water or seating for the aged and the physically challenged. After five hours, as my turn came, the person at the counter said that he could accept my form, but it will be rejected later as my parents do not have Electoral Photo Identity Cards registered under my current address. I concluded that a person trying to settle down in Calcutta cannot have an EPIC.          
	Yours faithfully,

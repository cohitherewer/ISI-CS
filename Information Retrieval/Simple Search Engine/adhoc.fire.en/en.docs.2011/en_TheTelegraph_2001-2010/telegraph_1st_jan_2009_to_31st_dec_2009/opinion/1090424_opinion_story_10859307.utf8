The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Broken treaties and broken vows
                                                                                                                 BROKEN TREATIES AND BROKEN VOWS                                                      On the other side of humanity                            
	Partitioned Lives: Narratives of Home, Displacement and Resettlement Edited by Anjali Gera Roy and Nandi Bhatia, Pearson Longman, Rs 595         
	One of the greatest displacements of people in the world took place when India was partitioned on the eve of its independence. Some ten-and-a-half million people crossed the border at Punjab, with Hindus and Sikhs going eastwards while the Muslims moved westwards. And one million men and women crossed the border at Bengal  the Hindus moving west into India, and the Muslims eastwards into the newly-created country called Pakistan. In addition, there was the savagery of the riots wreaked upon ordinary people by fellow human beings. Such destruction is difficult to comprehend by any sane mind.         
	That may be the reason why, even after sixty years, this subject still invokes interest among readers. This book is part of a series started in 1997. Like the earlier works in that series, this volume concentrates on the human side of the tragedy. It tells stories of loss, anger and helplessness in the face of a sudden upheaval that none could apprehend nor thwart. More than the resentment, the focus is on the sadness experienced by the people, who had to rise up to the occasion and struggle with the tempest that upset their home and hearth.        
	The book deals with the massive migration of people that took place on both sides of the border and the mayhem and violence that followed. It also deals with how the survivors built up their lives again from nothing. For the majority, leaving their land was extremely painful, but for some, this journey offered better prospects in their newly adopted land. The book not only uses the traditional sources but also explores literature, film, media and oral accounts to examine this multifaceted problem from diverse perspectives.         
	At the beginning, Nonica Dattas paper on Amrita Pritam sets the mood with a quotation from Pritams autobiography by invoking a Sufi idiom: I am the soil of Meditation, I am the line of divine hierarchy. Apart from a useful introduction, there are 15 scholarly papers on topics ranging from the partitions of Punjab and Bengal and their aftermath to a study of the diaspora in Canada. Probably the book also does justice in including quite a few papers on Bengal, thereby giving space to the state, which was earlier more or less usurped by Punjab. But the main thrust of the book lies in the examination of literature and cinema that dealt with the human factor of a tragedy that still remains unprecedented in human history.         
	In the introduction, the editors, Anjali Gera Roy of the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, and Nandi Bhatia of the University of Western Ontario, sum up the purpose of the book and the diverse angles from which the subject is covered. Most of the contributors are well-known academics but a few new names have also been included to give the book a broader perspective. These include Nonica Datta, Nicola Mooney, Debali Mookerjea-Leonard, Somdatta Mandal, Jennifer Yusin and Deepika Bahri, Sukeshi Kamra, Manas Ray, Shuchi Kothari and Rita Kothari, Pippa Virdee, Deborah Nixon and Devleena Ghosh, Prabhjot Parmar, Amber Fatima Riaz, Paulomi Chakraborty, Shubh Mathur, and Jonathan D. Greenberg. The papers, taking recourse to memory, nostalgia, trauma and angst in their individual ways, give us some idea of the displaced mentality. The book also manages to give a balanced view of the event that has now become almost blurred with the passage of these sixty years.         
	Alongside themes of love and martyrdom those of cultural and religious identities are also explored. Similarly, fiction and films, which mirror the images of the time more emphatically, find enough space. There are two interesting papers on refugees. Children, as well as women, are not forgotten and we get to know something of their traumatic existence. Amber Fatima Riazs paper gives us a peek into the conditions of the mohajirs, the Muslim migrants in search of the land of their dreams.         
	But the editors add a new point of view by including the paper by Deborah Nixon and Devleena Ghosh recounting a British soldiers account of the Partition. Thus the book breaks new ground by not limiting itself to the contours of geography and time and reaching out to all irrespective of religion and nationality. The stories of upheaval and migration, of suffering and torture, discussed by these scholars add to the study of migration in the history of the sub-continent. These narratives also struggle to find the bond that exist between people irrespective of their apparent differences.                          SHAMS AFIF SIDDIQI

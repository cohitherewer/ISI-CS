	In the beginning is always the word. Actions have to follow directly from policies that can only be articulated in words. The speech made by the president of the United States of America, Barack Obama, in Cairo University is significant because it presages a change in the USs attitudes and policies towards a very volatile part of the world and the worlds population. His predecessors rhetorical style had made the war against terror appear to be a war against Islam. This had made George W. Bush hugely unpopular and misunderstood. Mr Obama used his speech in what he called the timeless city to articulate his full name, to claim his Islamic heritage and to seek a new beginning in the relationship between the US and Muslims across the globe. He emphasized the congruence between the aims of the US and those of Islam  principles of justice and progress, tolerance and the dignity of all human beings. This was aimed at bringing applause.         
	Mr Obama, however, used his oratorical skills to tell his Muslim audience that despite his refashioning of the image of Islam prevalent in the West he was not about to change the equations the US has with Israel. He made it clear that the USs bonds with Israel are unbreakable, and that the denial of the Holocaust was baseless, ignorant and hateful. He advised the Palestinians to abandon violence. What was unexpected in Tel Aviv and even perhaps in the Muslim capitals of West Asia was Mr Obamas criticism of some aspects of Israels policies. The president declared the conditions of the Palestinians to be intolerable, and condemned the expansion of Jewish settlements on occupied land as undermining the peace process in the region.        
	Mr Bush had used the rhetoric of revenge. Mr Obama has used the rhetoric of healing. The velvet glove, however, only disguised the mailed fist. Mr Obama made it clear that the security and values of the US would never be compromised. He remains committed to the cause of eradicating al Qaida and defeating the Taliban. He expected all those listening to him  especially Muslims and Zionists  to join him in the battle against all forms of militancy and extremism. The register has changed from crusading zeal to collective commitment to a common cause; the tone from that of superiority to that of partnership.        
	It was a new voice and a new style, significant for being so rare. Mr Obama is famous for his audacity of hope. He has now demonstrated that he has the courage to build bridges across chasms that seem unbridgeable. The blueprints of the bridges are not yet clear but the intentions are. Most important, for too long in the West a prayer to Allah has been seen as being equivalent to the growl of fanaticism. Mr Obama has taken the first crucial step to erase that easy and false equivalence. The world will now await the deed to follow the word.

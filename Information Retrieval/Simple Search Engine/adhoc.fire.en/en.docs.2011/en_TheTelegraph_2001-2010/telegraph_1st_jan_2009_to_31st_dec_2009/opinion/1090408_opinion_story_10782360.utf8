	Promises to keep                  
	Sir  In its desperation to win the Lok Sabha elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party has promised rice or wheat at subsidized prices to families living below the poverty line in its manifesto (Tax cuts and cheap rice, April 5). The economy is in a bad shape thanks to global recession. The farm loan waivers have also affected the exchequer adversely. It is possible that the promises made by political parties in their manifestos will have no effect on the people. Voters are angry with the leaders for the non-implementation of programmes and schemes that had been promised earlier, and for their failure to provide essential commodities at reasonable prices. Now, it seems that the BJP is competing with its rivals to supply rice and wheat at low prices which, in reality, is a near-impossibility. The focus of the parties should be on increasing agricultural production and strengthening marketing strategies at the grassroots. Instead, they are busy making lofty promises before the polls.           
	Yours faithfully,       
R. Sekar, Visakhapatnam 

                
	Sir  Many a eyebrow has been raised because the BJPs election manifesto promises to explore all possibilities to build the Ram temple in Ayodhya (Advani keeps out law-for-temple vow, April 5). There is nothing wrong with the BJPs emphasis on the Ram temple and Hindutva since the Congress and other secular parties have been busy appeasing minority communities and caste groups for the last 60 years. The Congress depends on the Muslim vote and the support of the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes for its survival. Indias regional parties have also indulged in caste-based politics since their inception. Even the Left, which focused mainly on the working classes, have started pampering the minority community. All this just goes to show that caste and religion, rather than merit, determine politics in India. Given this situation, the BJP has every right to mobilize Hindu votes before the elections.           
	It is disappointing to note that politicians who have been practising discrimination on the basis of caste, community and religion are now preaching sermons to the BJP about values such as secularism. After every election, the Congress and its allies unite to try and keep the communal BJP out of power. But the truth is that the voters, unlike secular parties, are not afraid of the BJP. Otherwise, what explains the fact that the percentage of votes polled by the BJP has increased significantly from earlier times?           
	Yours faithfully,      
Danendra Jain, Agartala 

                
	Sir  The BJP manifesto has touched a raw nerve because of its attempt to assuage the grievances of retired servicemen. This is perhaps the first time ever that a political party has come out in support of this particular segment. It is possible that the BJP was goaded into action after its prime ministerial candidate, L.K. Advani, reportedly visited former servicemen who had been protesting near the Jantar Mantar last month. Whether the BJP will fulfil its promise or not is yet to be seen, but it has already won many hearts. The party in power has not been able to address the grievances of former soldiers, leaving these men fighting a lonely battle.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Raghubir Singh, Pune

                
	Sir  The countrys two major political parties, the Congress and BJP, have come up with their respective election manifestos that are full of promises. But what if the concerned political parties fail to fulfil their poll promises after coming to power? Unfortunately, these are the days of coalition politics, and every political party finds it easy to attribute its inability to carry out its pledges on the lack of consensus among allies.          
	Therefore it is imperative that election manifestos be given some legal validity. The Election Commission should de-recognize political parties that break the promises they make after coming to power. Political parties should prepare two types of poll-manifestos: the first can be used if the party succeeds to form a government on its own, and a second one if it comes to power in alliance with other parties. Otherwise, they may have to work at cross-purposes with their alliance partners: the BJP has mentioned the construction of the Ram temple, a Uniform Civil Code and the abolition of Article 370 in its manifesto even though a majority of the constituents of the National Democratic Alliance opposes these issues.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

                
	Parting shot          
	Sir  The Union minister, Oscar Fernandes, has informed that 5 lakh jobs have been lost across India according to a preliminary report. Maharashtra, too, has lost around 3 lakh jobs, according to the figures released by the state government. Unfortunately, our political parties are not doing enough to reduce unemployment in the state.           
	Maharashtra, it seems, will soon have the dubious distinction of becoming the state with maximum unemployment. Already, it is gaining infamy as the state where even existing jobs are vanishing. The chief minister, Ashok Chavan, should concentrate on employment generation and the early completion of various mega projects to improve the economic situation.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
A. Pawar, New Mumbai

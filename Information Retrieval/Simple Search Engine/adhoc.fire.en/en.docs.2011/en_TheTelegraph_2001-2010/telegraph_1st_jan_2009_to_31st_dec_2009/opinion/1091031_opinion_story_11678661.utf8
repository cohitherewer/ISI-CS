	Jibanananda Das is easily the most significant Bengali poet since Rabindranath Tagore, who famously described Dass imagery as vivid and colourful. The anxiety of influence notwithstanding, the latters style was consciously different from Tagores. On October 21, at a musical evening organized by the Institute of Allergic and Immunologic Skin Diseases at Rotary Sadan, Sanjay Ghosh attempted to string together a few of Dass poems with Tagores songs. The singers, Suchhanda Ghosh and Kamalini Mukherjee, sang the songs paired with poems read by Sovansundar Basu. The songs were well chosen, particularly Onek paowar majhe majhe, Amra dujona swarga-khelona and Dukkhero timire jodi jwale. The audience was treated to beautiful renditions of Amra dujona and Megho-chhaye sajalo baaye by Mukherjee. Ghoshs voice was a source of discomfort for the singer as she approached the higher notes in Onek paowar and Andhokarer utsho hote, and often in the lower octave too (sanchari of Dukkhero timire).         
	The second half was dedicated to solo performances by the two singers. Mukherjee continued to be impressive, especially with E ki karuna karunamoyo, Amare tumi ashesh korechho and Je dhrubapada diyechho bandhi. In Hridaye chhile jege and Je chhayare dhorbo bole, she glossed over the nuanced differences between antara and abhog. When Ghosh took the stage again, the unease in her voice had cleared remarkably, and she was able to leave a mark of her distinctive gayaki. Amar shakol niye boshe achhi was evocative even though Ghosh did not resort to the familiar excesses. The note-perfect rendition of Aponare diye rochili, Amar praner majhe sudha ache and Kolahal to baron holo made for a satisfying listening experience.

	Saugandhikam presented an evening of dance at Gyan Manch on October 21. The programme consisted of three parts: Upasana, Rangbahar and Tagores dance-drama, Chandalika. The evening commenced with Upasana, which was choreographed by Sanjukta Banerjee. Rangbahar, the creative dance segment, featured various performances based on Tagore songs and Nazrulgeeti. Fusion was an interesting collaboration, and it incorporated three dance styles  Manipuri, Kathakali and Kathak. The different moods were expressed with the help of neat movements and nimble footwork. It was an enjoyable evening, and each performance deserved praise. Uma Banerjee organized the event, while Madhumita Basu was the compre.

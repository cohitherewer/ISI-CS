                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Unhealthy change of mind    
	Sir  The Union minister for external affairs and state Congress chief, Pranab Mukherjee, has said that the Left Front has failed in the fields of health and nutrition in West Bengal in spite of being in power for 30 years (Pranab delinks Left past and future, April 6). This is undoubtedly true. Yet Mukherjee had praised the same government for its excellent work in public health before the Congress and the Trinamul Congress had formed an alliance. Can we not expect a minimum degree of integrity from our public personalities?           
	Yours faithfully, Sudarsan Nandi, Midnapore             Evil at home 
  
	Sir The article, Daddy dont (March 29), presented a scary picture. It is not enough to acknowledge the presence of incest. The media should focus on condemning the act and help victims fight against it. The tender minds of children are bound to be affected by these reports. We have to concentrate on educating them about hazards and making them conscious of their capacities. Let us not dampen their spirits. We should point out the importance of fathers in their lives and teach them to value relationships so that they are able to face tragedies like these with sensibility and valour.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Neena Parekh, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Reena Martins article, Daddy, dont, reveals the severity of a social evil like incest. It was shocking to read Cuffs on another rapist father (March 27) as well. The psychological disorder of these perverted fathers is an assault on the norms of civilized society, especially in a country like ours where fathers are regarded as god. The recent incidents point to the degradation of social values, although there is no doubt that the modern generation will overcome the social curse. Our religious leaders will do a lot of good if they put their efforts into restoring the social fabric through their teachings rather than ruining the country with their fanaticism.           
	Yours faithfully, Ranadhish Choudhuri, Calcutta                       
	Yet to grow up           
	Sir  In Meshed in adolescence(April 3), Swapan Dasgupta discusses the influence exerted by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh on the the Bharatiya Janata Party. While the conflict brewing within its top echelons is definitely cause for worry, the BJP is not the only party plagued by this problem. The 2009 elections are not likely to throw up a single party as the winner. This is the reason behind the incessant bickering in most parties.           
	While the RSS has been an integral part of the BJP, it is very important for the latter to grow beyond its narrow identity that makes it take up fanatical issues such as Ram Janmabhoomi. With the world economy in turmoil and terror assuming frightening proportions, it is time political parties came forward together to fight them. I fail to understand why they are busy segregating Indian society into majority and minority communities while, ideally, the identity, Indian, should be nurtured first. It is to be hoped that under the leadership of Mohan Bhagwat, who is being hailed as progressive, the winds of change will begin to blow within the RSS.           
	But it would be unfair to classify the BJP alone as a party trapped in adolescence. Which party in India has really grown to adulthood? Parties that propagate dynastic politics do not understand the meaning of the term democracy, and parties that depend solely on their musclemen are yet to outgrow their notes for votes mindset. The only thing that has really matured is corruption.           
	Yours faithfully, Alokananda Bhattacharyya, Guwahati

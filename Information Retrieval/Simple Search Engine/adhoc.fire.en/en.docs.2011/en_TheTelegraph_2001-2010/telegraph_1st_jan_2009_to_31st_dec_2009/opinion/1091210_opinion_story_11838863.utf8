The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Goodbye Afghanistan, welcome Kashmir
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        GOODBYE AFGHANISTAN, WELCOME KASHMIR                                  Barack Obamas plan to withdraw troops from Afghanistan by 2011 may be spoiled by an insecure Pakistan, writes Somak Ghoshal                          Fragile peace                                  
	Barack Obamas exit plan from Afghanistan, like almost everything else he has said since he became the president of the United States of America, is peppered with mixed messages. Unlike his predecessor, George W. Bush, whose world view was strictly black and white (Either you are with us or against us), Obama loves to play to the full gallery. So, to please those who support the war, he has promised to send an additional 33,000 troops to Afghanistan (30,000 in his initial address to the US marines at West Point on December 2, and 3,000 more a few days later). For those who are opposed to military action, Obama has pledged a swift departure from Afghanistan over the next 18 months by gradually phasing out US presence. Obama seems to believe that escalating war efforts would yield the desired results, although Lyndon Johnsons catastrophic experiments in Vietnam in the Sixties or Gorbachevs surge in Soviet deployment in Afghanistan in the Eighties do not exactly make for success stories.        
	Ironically, the key element in Obamas speech was success. He emphasized that his administration wishes to bring the war in Afghanistan to a successful conclusion. Although he made an oblique reference to the wrenching debate over the [legitimacy of the] Iraq War (Obama had earlier said it was not his war), his final verdict on Iraq should warm the hearts of die-hard Republicans: Today, after extraordinary costs, we are bringing the Iraq war to a responsible end we have given Iraqis a chance to shape their future, and we are successfully leaving Iraq to its people.        
	Even if US troops are to withdraw from Iraq by 2011, as Obama says, it does not mean that they would be leaving a better nation to the Iraqis. Recent reports in The New York Times reveal how pitifully unprepared the Iraqi militia still is to handle security in their homeland. As Iraqi police forces struggle to get a grip on the equipment and crisis-management strategies devised by the US troops, American soldiers have been instructed to stand by and watch quietly. According to a mutual agreement between the US and Iraq on July 1 this year, the marines are allowed to intervene only if Iraqis solicit their help. In other words, Iraqis are being weaned of the protective embrace of their invaders, who are now engaged in the task of rebuilding a nation they have singlehandedly ruined. The result is mutual incomprehension and exasperation on the part of the US and Iraqi troops.        
	An NYT report illustrates the situation tellingly: a suicide attack on a full market in Kirkuk, one of the most unsafe cities in Iraq, is followed by even bigger mayhem as clueless Iraqi policemen stand around, without having cordoned off the affected area or even taken the minimum precautions against a second blast (which routinely follows an initial suicide attack) or sniper attacks. Everything that the Americans taught them to do under such circumstances appears to have escaped their minds.        
	The reason why Obama wants to prolong US presence in Afghanistan is to train an independent Afghan security force, which will be able to protect the country on its own after the foreign protectors go away. If such an idea in Iraq is flawed, then applied to Afghanistan it sounds like wishful thinking. Compared to Iraq, the rate of literacy in Afghanistan is staggeringly low, and corruption astonishingly high. At present, 90,000 Afghan soldiers, along with 93,000 police officers, are struggling to maintain something as basic as attendance rosters. Many commanders are collecting bogus wages by proxy. New recruits dont have to pass tests to qualify for the job; mere participation in the drills is good enough for graduation. It would be a miracle if the US troops are able to push the number of trained Afghan soldiers and police officers anywhere close to the target that the Obama administration has set before itself: 240,000 soldiers and 160,000 officers by 2011, when America intends to pull out of Afghanistan.              
	It is true that the training of Iraqi forces by US marines has had some, if limited, success so far. Thats because the insurgency in Iraq is mostly concentrated around cities and towns. However, in Afghanistan, the troublemakers are spread across treacherous mountains and rural settlements in remote corners. It is difficult to make any foray into these regions not only because of inclement weather and inaccessible roads but also because of the soaring distrust of foreign occupiers among the tribal population. The incorporation of a significant number of Tajiks into the Afghan militia by the US has alienated the Pashtuns even further. The Pashtuns may not be on the best of terms with the Taliban, but still prefer them to the Americans. However, Americas key to a decent exit from Afghanistan, as Obama himself has admitted, lies not in escalating the war to ensure an unequivocal victory, but rather in leaving as friends who helped transform the life of the Afghan people, oppressed by the regressive Taliban regime for years. To forge this special relationship, the US must try winning hearts and minds, as General Stanley McChrystal, the US commander-in-chief in Afghanistan, said: New resources are not the crux.        
	A similar idea has been reiterated by Andrey Avetisyan, the Russian ambassador to Afghanistan, who pointed out recently that the US has been making the same mistake that the Soviets had made in the Eighties  of holding towns and bases without consolidating influence. Influence, in this case, can be exerted in many ways, perhaps most palpably by improving economy and education, and by establishing a credible democracy to oversee governance. Americas track record, in all three respects, has been more than dismal.        
	It is unlikely that Obama would suggest a quick-fix measure to deal with the crumbling Afghan economy, given that his own nation is yet to recover from a severe financial crisis. And while the government and non-governmental organizations have established many schools across Afghanistan, the spread of education has surely not been a priority with either the present or the previous US administrations. The fact that the cost of deploying a US soldier in Afghanistan for a year equals the budget for building about 20 schools puts Americas claims of improving literacy in Afghanistan in a sinister context.        
	Finally, the less said about Americas man in Kabul, Hamid Karzai, the better. Although riddled with corruption, Karzais government returned to power this year, with warm US support, after a massively rigged general election in August. Obamas eyewash on Karzais comeback is unlikely to have any leverage with even his most ardent admirers: We and our allies prevented the Taliban from stopping a presidential election, the US president said, and  although it was marred by fraud  that election produced a government that is consistent with Afghanistans laws and Constitution. In reality, the run-off to the first round never took place because Abdullah Abdullah, the main opposition candidate, pulled out of the race, and Karzai was returned to power on the basis of his earlier performance, which had fallen short of the 50 per cent majority stipulated by the Afghan constitution to allow him to continue in office.              
	Building up American influence in Afghanistan merely begins with engaging in the domestic politics of a nation that has traditionally been governed by a social covenant among various ethnic groups under a sovereign king. To look beyond Afghan politics is to confront that more sinister creature, Pakistan, which has been openly abetting militant Islamic activity along its border with Afghanistan for years. Generations of US leaders since Harry S. Truman have recognized the primacy of stabilizing Pakistan so that the US can have a solid foothold in South and Central Asia. And in exchange for huge financial aid from the US  Pakistan became a virtually bankrupt economy as its banking system was damaged by ill-considered Islamist policies  especially since 9/11 and President Bushs War on Terror, Pakistan has at least kept up appearances of cooperation with the US. It is only now that the Obama administration has come up with an ambitious plan in order to kill two birds with one stone  the Afpak policy.         
	Obamas exit plan from Afghanistan, with a new deadline of 18 months, has suddenly endangered the feasibility of a fruitful Afpak policy. Pakistan is already fearful of a Taliban backlash after the US leaves Afghanistan. So, in the interest of having better ties with its volatile neighbour, it is unwilling to be swayed by Obamas offer of a long-term security guarantee, trade benefits, upgraded military supplies or even a greater regional collaboration with India. It is in the light of this reaction from Pakistan that the Obama administration should rethink its strategies.        
	Apart from its just apprehensions of a malevolent Taliban, Pakistans reluctance to work with Obamas deadline is explained by what a stable Afghanistan augurs for Indo-Pak relations. For Pakistan, clearing up the Afghan problem, even provisionally, to Americas (and perhaps to Indias) satisfaction, is to relinquish control over a key member of the Islamic bloc  and that means seriously weakening Pakistans stakes in Kashmir. The jihad corridor, as India has learnt to its detriment, runs from the Kashmir valley through Pakistan and straight into the heart of Afghanistan. After the Soviet occupation ended in 1989, scores of mujahideen from Afghanistan, generously sponsored by Wahabbi money, had migrated into Kashmir to fight for azadi and stoke the sentiments of Indian Muslims. That trend has become entrenched over the years.        
	Unless the Obama administration decides to put in place a comprehensive Indo-Afpak policy, Americas role in Afghanistan is not going to be curtailed in any appreciable way. As in Iraq, a process of military disengagement may begin, as diplomatic instead of armed intervention becomes the rule rather than the exception. But ultimately a stable Afghanistan, if created without full checks and balances, has the potential of destabilizing Pakistan further and threatening Indias national security. One of the major ways in which the US can avoid these blunders is by reviving the Indo-Pak dialogue on Kashmir, something that has been put on hold since the 26/11 attacks by Pakistani terrorists last year.              
	Since Partition, both India and Pakistan have been intractable about their demands regarding Kashmir. During the peak of the Cold War, Pakistan was led to behave intransigently, fuelled by military support from China. But the Cold War is over, and even Indo-Chinese ties, though not warm, are amiable enough to have workable trading relations in spite of a lingering border dispute that keeps flaring up every once in a while. Like Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, China, too, has learnt to accord at least a token respect to India as an emerging regional power. The result has been beneficial for all. In the same way, until Pakistan is able to come to terms with its own place in the regional power order, the possibility of a lasting peace in South and Central Asia remains highly tenuous.

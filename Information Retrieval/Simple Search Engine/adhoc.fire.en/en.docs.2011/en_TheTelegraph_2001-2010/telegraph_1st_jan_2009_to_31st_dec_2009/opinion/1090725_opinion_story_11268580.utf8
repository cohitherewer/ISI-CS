	Royal treatment                  
	Sir  It would cost Rs 5 lakh to convert Jyoti Basus bedroom into an intensive care unit (Basu ICU at home, July 19). It is baffling how the state exchequer is being appropriated so shamelessly for the treatment of the communist who is responsible for the abysmal state of government hospitals today. Basu, the former chief minister of West Bengal, has also travelled abroad on several occasions for treatment, using public money. The royal lifestyle of the patriarch contradicts the ideology that the Communist Party of India (Marxist) preaches to the masses.          
	Yours faithfully,         Anindya Dasgupta, Serampore, Hooghly 
        
	Touchy topic          
	Sir  I suppose our leaders are oblivious to the promises they made to the electorate and are discussing meaningless issues in Parliament. There was no need to raise a storm about the frisking of A.P.J. Abdul Kalam at the Delhi airport (Touchy about frisking, not security risk, July 22). Kalam himself has not complained and the airport officials confirmed that he was cooperative. The frisking must not be seen as an insult to the nation or as racial discrimination, but as a proof of concern for the passengers safety.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
S. Mukherjee, Burdwan

                
	Sir  Any dignitary would have objected to the security check. But Abdul Kalam agreed to obey the protocol of a foreign airline, which has tendered him an apology requesting him to fly Continental Airlines again while visiting America. Instructions should be given to all airlines to treat distinguished citizens according to existing rules.          
	Yours faithfully,       
S. Balakrishnan, Jamshedpur

      
	Sir  As a former president, Abdul Kalam has certain privileges that we are bound to honour. The way in which he was made to stand in queue with other passengers and subjected to security check is seriously embarrassing. Can the Continental Airlines officials imagine frisking Bill Clinton or Condoleezza Rice? Calling this a standard procedure or saying that the staff failed to recognize Kalam is not enough.          
	Yours faithfully,      
K.A. Solaman, Alappuzha, Kerala

                
	Sir  While speaking to a Continental Airlines official, I asked if George Bush, the former American president, would be frisked by their security staff. She answered, Yes, sir, like any person such as yourself. I wonder why India maintains a list of dignitaries who expect special treatment. If they are so touchy about it why do they not maintain their own entourage and fly on a special plane, bypassing security checks all together?                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Manindar P.S. Suri, California, US

                          
	Parting shot          
	Sir  The traffic conditions on Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road in central Calcutta are disastrous. There are five to six schools located along that stretch and between 7.30 and 8.00 in the morning, when everybody is in a rush to drop children off to school, the situation is worst. Traffic policemen are nowhere to be seen. Even if they are present, they are incapable of controlling the situation. The main culprits are the minibuses, trams and autos that are driven rashly, and generally in the direction opposite to the one in which traffic is supposed to flow on the one-way street. This results in several bottlenecks, which take an eternity to clear. The Royd Street-R.A.K. Road junction needs proper traffic signals. On behalf of all the parents who escort their children to school, I would like to request the Calcutta Police to deploy competent policemen who would turn up on time for duty.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Md. Badruddin Ahmed, Calcutta

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Staggeringly ignorant or unusually smart?
                                                                                                                 STAGGERINGLY IGNORANT OR UNUSUALLY SMART?                              Can a new president with half-a-dozen first ladies and a dubious past revive South Africas political future? asks Jyotirmoy Pal Chaudhuri                        Charismatic and canny				                                       
	On Saturday, May 9, Jacob Zuma, the president of South Africas largest political party, the African National Congress, was sworn in as the president of Africas most significant and powerful state. In an election held towards the end of 2007, Thabo Mbeki, the then president of South Africa and of the ANC, lost to Zuma in the ANC presidential elections. In accordance with ANC tradition, the president of the party also becomes the president of the country. Zumas assumption of power, therefore, would correct the aberration.        
	This was made possible because in South Africas fourth general elections, held on April 22, ANC won 264 seats in the 400-member national assembly. The party secured about 66 per cent of the votes cast. Twelve more parties were in the fray. The Democratic Alliance and Congress of the People (Cope) were two other parties of any significance. The DA, a party of liberal whites headed by the feisty leader, Hellen Zille, a former anti-apartheid campaigner, got about 17 per cent of the votes and Cope, a new party set up by ANC rebels after the ouster of Mbeki, secured little over 7 per cent of the popular votes. Because of the system of proportional representation, DA and Cope have 67 and 30 seats respectively in the legislative assembly.        
	Zumas parents were Zulu peasants. He herded his grandfathers goats when other children, coming from more affluent families, went to school. He joined the ANC in his mid-teens. From then, until he was 50, he devoted his life to the liberation struggle; first as a prisoner on Robben Island for 10 years with Nelson Mandela, then as an activist in the armed underground, and finally as ANCs head of intelligence. When the white minority rule ended in 1994, Zuma became the minister for economic affairs and tourism in his native Kwazulu-Natal. He worked as a minister till 1999, when he was made the vice-president of ANC, a position he held for about 10 years.        
	According to former cellmates at Robben Island, when Zuma first came to prison, he could speak only Zulu. By the time he left Robben Island, he was reading the English versions of Leo Tolstoys novels. With no formal education, flamboyant polygamy, numerous children, silk ties, lavish lifestyle, luxury homes and expensive cars, Jacob Zuma remains an enigma. Now Zuma is 67, and recently he married his sixth wife  a wife 30 years his junior. South Africa now becomes the only country in the world with half-a-dozen first ladies.        
	These, however, can be dismissed as trivial personal matters. But there are quite a few other issues pertaining to the new president of South Africa which cannot be ignored at all. Zuma was accused of accepting more than 4 million rand ($5,96,000) between 1995 and 2005 from his friend and former financial advisor, Schabir Shaik, in exchange for using his influence to help secure government contracts for Shaiks companies. Sentencing Shaik to 15 years imprisonment in 2005, the presiding judge said that the payments to Zuma can only have generated a sense of obligation in the recipient. Zuma denied any wrong-doing, and both men maintain that the money was intended as a loan, part of which Zuma has already repaid.               
	A month ago, the supposedly independent National Prosecution Authority announced that it was withdrawing all charges of corruption, racketeering, tax evasion, money laundering and fraud against Zuma. Immediately after that Shaik was released from jail on medical-parole after serving two years and four months of his 15-year sentence. Zuma made a public announcement stating that if elected president, he would consider granting a pardon to Shaik. Not a bright picture at all.        
	But Zuma has his bright side as well. He is undoubtedly a man of remarkable qualities. He connects easily with black slum-dwellers and white tycoons alike. He is charismatic and canny. He has been a wily negotiator who majesterially ended the strife between his fellow Zulus in early post-apartheid era. Zuma is a good listener and a skilled conciliator. He works hard and has impressive energy for a man of his age. After the heroic, aristocratic Mandela and the aloof, technocratic Mbeki, South Africans seem to be ready to welcome a man of the people as the president. Zuma can charm the birds out of the trees.        
	But the question is: can Zuma take South Africa out of the mess it is now in? With vast mineral resources, well-run industries and excellent infrastructure, South Africa is the biggest African economy. But it is sinking into recession after 16 years of expansion. Business confidence is low, and after growth averaging around 5 per cent a year between 2004 and 2007, the economy is expected to contract by around 0.8 per cent this year. Mining and manufacturing have been hard hit; so have been export and retail trade. Preparations for next years football World Cup, which South Africa is hosting, and a stimulus package of 690 billion rand over the next three years have not succeeded in preventing job- cuts and increase in poverty. South African cities have high rates in all sorts of crimes  murder, mugging, rape, and so on. The country has a population of over 47 million, of whom a staggering 5.7 million are AIDS victims. Unemployment is over 20 per cent and rising.         
	The ANC government under Mandela and Mbeki has set up a broad-based welfare state which provides cash benefits to 12.5 million people. To help people get out of the squalid shanty towns, it has built 2.7 million low-cost homes, housing around 10 million people. Some 80 per cent of all households are now connected to electricity and clean water. More than half of the state schools no longer charge fees. A large number of free health-clinics have been set up. Some 60 per cent of the AIDS-infected are receiving antiretrovirals. South Africans, especially poor black South Africans, have got used to seeing the government perform. The economic downturn will cripple the new incumbent. For sheer economic reasons, it will be virtually impossible for him to match the track record of his predecessors.              
	However, this is not the only challenge Zuma will face. With a huge cloud of scandal hovering over him, Zuma faces a serious credibility crisis. In 1998, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission accused the ANC in the 1970s and 1980s of gross violation of human rights and routine use of torture for extracting information. Zuma was the head of ANC intelligence at that time. He loathes the press, which, in his opinion, has started a vicious media campaign designed to find me guilty in the court of public opinion. Zuma wants to review the status of the constitutional court, which has spoken against him several times. I do not think we should have people who are almost like god in a democracy. Zuma expresses his strong dislike of the authority and power that the constitutional court enjoys. Many are convinced that it is because of the behind-the-scene machination and manipulation of Zuma that the NPA was forced to drop the case against him. They are also sure that the day when the new president grants pardon to his benefactor, Shaik, is not far off.        
	These problems are unlikely to intimidate Zuma. His support base is vast and very effective. His victory over Mbeki in the ANC presidential elections was stunning. Zuma has total control over the Congress of South African Trade Union (Cosatu), the countrys largest trade-union federation, and is very close to the communists  the two partners of the ANC in the tripartite alliance to run the government. Julius Malema, the undisputed leader of the powerful Youth League, is one of Zumas staunchest supporters. In fact, Malema is known as the powerful bullyboy who does all the dirty work for Zuma. With the support of the ANC, Cosatu and the Youth League, Zuma faces no serious threat to his authority.        
	There is no reason to believe that in the near future the DA and Cope will be able to expand their support base and be strong enough to challenge the ANC or Zuma. On the contrary, Zuma, with his unscrupulous political style, may succeed in making inroads into these parties, and weaken them. It is cold out there if you are out of the ANC, he warned them. Very cold.        
	In Black Orpheus, Jean-Paul Sartre asked, What do you expect to find when the muzzle that has silenced the voice of blackman is removed? That they would thunder your praise? The non-whites of South Africa were subjected to the ugliest form of social and economic discrimination in the most pervert political system installed by the white minority. The muzzle was finally removed when Mandela was elected the president of South Africa in 1994. Belying Sartres apprehensions, under Mandelas most dignified and majestic leadership, South Africa had an unbelievably smooth, bloodless transition. There was no political reprisal, no act of collective vengeance, no vendetta. The whole world adored Mandela for his magnanimity, statesmanship and vision. Mbeki did all he possibly could to retain the image his illustrious predecessors had projected. Can Jacob Zuma match it? Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the winner of Nobel Prize for Peace, is not very sure. We have let down our guard and quickly forgotten the struggles of our past. Please allow us old people to go to the grave smiling, not with our hearts broken.              
	Some years ago, Jacob Zuma was tried on a rape charge. The female involved belonged to an HIV-infected family. When asked about the danger of HIV infection, Zuma explained that after having sex he had showered to stave off the disease. Staggering ignorance or extraordinary smartness! The world would soon find out.        The author is former professor and head, department of history,

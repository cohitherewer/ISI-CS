	When the music ends                  
	Sir  On June 18, the world of music lost one of its greatest masters, Ustad Ali Akbar Khan (The magician bows out, June 20). Yehudi Menuhin once called him an absolute genius, the greatest musician in the world.           
	The Ustad was an exponent of the Seni gharana of Maihar and Rampur of his father, Baba Allauddin Khan. Apart from recordings of classical music, his film-music is unforgettable too. His music to Tapan Sinhas Kshudita Pashan won him the Best Musician of the Year award.          
	He is no more, but his music is there to inspire us. His legacy will be continued by the pupils of the Ali Akbar Colleges of Music in Calcutta and abroad. The country has honoured its great son with the Padma Vibhushan award, but the nation itself will be honoured if it gives its highest honour, the Bharat Ratna, to Ustad Ali Akbar Khan posthumously.          
	Yours faithfully,        Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad               
	Sir  The greatness of Ustad Ali Akbar Khan as a sarodist does not consist only in the melodic charm and novelty of his style. Neither is it the case that his style is shorn of fast-paced riyazi materials and thrives only on melodic phrases and rhythmic variations. The uniqueness of Khansahib lies in his ability to integrate different nuances of sarod technique into a unique creative framework. This encompasses the gamut of technical subtleties, imaginative brilliance and, above all, an amazing ability to improvise, which is far beyond mere virtuosity. This is a rare feat that remains unparalleled to this day.           
	Those who had heard him in the 1950s, 60s and early 70s, would recall how he would unfold a raga by playing a highly imaginative, well-organized, yet not too conservative alap, a poetic jod, and a wonderful thok-jhala, speckled with bol patterns produced by high-speed jaba-work that more than testified to the riyaz he had put in.           
	Over the years, his gat patterns and style had changed, but in innovation, too, he stands alone. More than technique, what has made Khansahib a one-in-a-million artist is the transcendent quality of his art that defies orthodox theorizing.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	No free time          
	Sir  In response to Swapan Dasguptas article, Cry for freedom (June 26), I would like to add that the present regime in Iran has spent 25 years trying to make young Iranians deeply pro-Islamic, anti-American, anti-Western and anti-Israeli. As a result, most of them are now resentful of Islam (at least in its current, State-imposed form), are rather pro-American, and have a friendly curiosity about Israel. Many dream of life in the United States of America, and quite a few even welcomed the occupation of Iraq, hoping it would bring freedom and democracy closer to them. Seeing how the USs invasion has benefited the Shiites in southern Iraq, they even joke that George W. Bush is the thirteenth imam.           
	These young Iranians are the best hope there is for a peaceful re-gime-change. Each year they mark the anniversary of the protests in the summer of 1999.Their soft power could be more effective than that of the US marines. They are educated, angry, disillusioned, and when they leave college, most of them will not find jobs appropriate to their training. Given time and the right circumstances, they could take the lead in exerting the kind of organized social pressure that would allow the advocates of reform and of transformation to gain the upper hand in this dual state.           
	However, their protest often takes apolitical forms. Many want to emigrate to join the millions of Iranians living abroad. If they can afford it, they slip over to Dubai for a few days, where the restrictions in public are perhaps less stringently enforced.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Nanak Ganguly, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Mahmoud Ahmadinejads startling victory in the presidential elections in Iran through alleged rigging is a body blow to the pro-reformists there. Political observers who had hoped that Iran might unclench its fist under a new leader and enter into dialogue with the US are disappointed over the return of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad at the helm of affairs.           
	At the same time, his win will be welcomed by the hawks both in Iran and in Israel. It can be inferred from the results of the recently concluded election that many Iranians are yet to open up to moderate values in politics and religion. That the Iran Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, endorsed the result, and enjoined all Iranians to avoid provocative behaviour and rally around Ahmadinejad, underscores that very little has changed in Iran, and that the republic will continue to adopt an adverserial position towards opposition.                     
	Yours faithfully,

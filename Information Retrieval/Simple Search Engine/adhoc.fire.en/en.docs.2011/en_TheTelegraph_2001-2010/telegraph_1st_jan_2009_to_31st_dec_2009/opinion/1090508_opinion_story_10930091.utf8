The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | At every corner
                                                                                                                 AT EVERY CORNER                                                              
	What do you get when a self-confessed advertising and commercial photographer suddenly decides to move to documentary photography and chooses Indian street food as his subject? You get a series of simple and straightforward images (in the words of the photographer) showing rows of people chomping samosas in Calcutta (but surprisingly no sign of the legendary chowmein or the egg roll), college students flexing muscles as they munch on the Mumbai vegetable sandwich at Khao Gali (bottom, centre) and, of course, hundreds of men, with that unmistakably tea-crazed look in their eyes, jostling each other to get their favourite beverage from the ubiquitous shacks spread all over the country (top, right).        
	Sephi Bergerson, an Israeli photographer now based in New Delhi, admits that his pursuit of street food in India turned out to be an exploration of colour and texture. No surprise then that his STREET FOOD OF INDIA (Roli, Rs 695) presents an assortment of colourful photographs that have little to say; they look only prettily cosmetic. This being India, there is no lack of volunteers: Bergerson is quite amused by the eagerness with which Indian men preen themselves at the drop of a hat before the camera. Look at the vegetable vendor near Lahori Gate in Delhi (left), vaguely threatening with an overgrown carrot. Who would not be tempted to stop by at his stall for a plate of chaat? Then there is the water-carrier, known as bhisti (bottom, left), an ever rare species. Or the Ram Ladoo-seller flashing a smile in Delhi (bottom, right). The most authentic images are those that capture people eating unawares. But these are few and far between, the best being the photograph of a line of Bengali babus taking a tea-break in Calcutta. Only a cup of piping tea at the end of the day can bring out that classic look of bovine contentment mixed with ennui.        
	In the introduction, Bergerson claims (with a touch of vanity) that as he pursued his subject he could watch his style develop. He would have done the reader a big service had he also explained how exactly his style evolved with time. The images at the beginning and the end of the book do not look substantially different, neither in terms of aesthetics nor technique. One does not get the sense of any sequence in the randomly arranged photographs. Although Calcutta and Delhi, and to some extent Mumbai, may be the hub of street food in India, is the South all so bereft of such delicacies? For a foreigner in India, Bergerson also seems to be benignly trusting of the heavenly delights of street food  to the extent that he remains a bit too reticent on the question of hygiene and nutrition. Given the amount of oil and ghee (that too adulterated) that goes into the making of the mouth-watering street food, any eatery round the corner could be justifiably called Heart Attack Central. And even a cursory peek into the by-lanes of Varanasi, so famous for their kachoris, is enough to put the fear of food-poisoning into the heart of the most ardent foodie.                          SOMAK GHOSHAL

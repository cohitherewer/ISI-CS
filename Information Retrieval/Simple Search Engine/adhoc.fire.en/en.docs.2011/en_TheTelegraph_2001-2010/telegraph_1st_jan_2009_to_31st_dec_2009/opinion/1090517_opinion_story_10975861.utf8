The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Partys progress
                                                                                                                 PARTYS PROGRESS                                                          
	The peoples verdict is in favour of stability. There is no other way to read the election results. The buzzwords of psephologists and pollsters have all fallen by the wayside. The people who voted felt that the Congress was the only party that could provide the leadership for a stable government. What cannot be ignored is the fact that the Congress has more seats than all the parties that constitute the National Democratic Alliance. This is an index of the peoples faith in the Congress and in its leadership. To a very large extent, this faith grows out of the kind of leadership that Manmohan Singh provided for the last five years. Mr Singh revealed that he has in him the qualities to rise to the big and demanding occasion. His handling of the Indo-US nuclear deal and the threat that loomed over his government because of it was proof of his real mettle. Mr Singhs soft-spoken personality redefined the idea of strength in politics. He replaced arrogance by humility. He proved that the meek can inherit India.        
	The swing in favour of the Congress meant the decline of the regional and caste-based parties. One critical factor in this process was the decision of the Congress to go it alone in many important states. The Congress derived the courage to do this from the vision of Rahul Gandhi. Young Mr Gandhi has been the target of a great deal of criticism and denigration. Even The Telegraph, in one of its leaders, took a pot-shot at him. Mr Gandhi is obviously a man who knows his own mind. With remarkable courage of conviction, he realized that for the revival of the Congress it was better to walk alone than to use the prop of smaller parties to win minor dividends. This augurs well for the Congress in the future.        
	One important aspect of Mr Singhs government was its genuine attempt to reach out to all sections of the people. It did not discriminate on the basis of religion or caste. It is significant that under his tenure there was no major communal conflagration similar to the one which occurred in Gujarat in 2002. A new dimension was added to this inclusive character of the government at the initiative of the Congress president, Sonia Gandhi. She pushed through the National Rural Employment Guarantee scheme and the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan. Both these schemes successfully reached out to the poorest in the country irrespective of their caste or creed. The people of India obviously felt that the Congress-led government spoke for all Indians, and therefore they voted it back to power.        
	Stability came in the form of good governance and the inclusive policies of the sarkar. Mr Singhs understated achievements guided the ship of State. And Mr Gandhis hard work revived the flagging morale of the party. The Congress thus returned to India. India thus turned to the Congress.

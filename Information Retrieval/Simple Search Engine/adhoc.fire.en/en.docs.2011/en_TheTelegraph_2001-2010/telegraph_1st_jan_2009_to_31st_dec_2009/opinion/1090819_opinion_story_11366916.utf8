                                                                                                                 THE FOUR MARIES                                  Stephen Hugh-Jones      
	After all, the plural of spy is spies, of army armies, of casualty casualties. Likewise, reply becomes replies. However it is stressed and however pronounced, the English plural of -y is surely -ies.        
	Or is it? In this case, one can see an argument for Julys. In Britain, Julie, pronounced and stressed like duly, is a common girls name. My papers weather-whizz wouldnt like to look as if he were discussing two young women fresh from the swimming pool.        
	But the issue goes wider. Lets take to drink. The plurals of whisky or brandy are no problem: they both become -ies. But suppose you taste three wines from the French region of Burgundy. Were they three burgundies or three burgundys?        
	Since in this usage the name is given no capital letter, the answer is burgundies, just as for sherry, named after the Spanish town of Jerez. Likewise, a football match between Manchester United and Manchester City is a local derby  from the Derby horserace  and with a second such match you have a pair of local derbies.        
	But suppose there is a capital letter, and the word is strictly a name. In the days of the Soviet empire, were there two Germanys or two Germanies? Most of the press wrote Germanys. Wrongly, in my view, since there was a solid 19th-century precedent to the contrary: the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies (the second one, bizarrely, being a slice of southern Italy), which was always so spelt.        
	On that long-established analogy, Germanies was correct. But what about personal names such as Sally or Sandy? Or Mary?        
	There are four Maries, or Marys, in one old Scottish ballad (with a wonderful tune: in the days when Indian schoolchildren had British history rammed down their throats, I hope, at least for some, that song formed a part of it). One verse runs:        
	Yestreen the Queen had four Maries,/ The night [ie, this night] shell hae but three./ There was Marie Seaton and Mary Beaton/ And Marie Carmichael and me (me being Marie Hamilton, doomed to execution, at the queens insistence, because the king fancied her).        
	That Maries in the first line looks natural enough: the stress is clearly on the second syllable, as in the French name, Marie; and a French name may have been familiar at the court of Scotland, often allied with France against us English.        
	But four of them? I dont believe it. And in the second couplet, the stress is plainly on the first syllable, as in the English Mary. These days, Id write Mary for each of them and Marys for the lot.        
	One idiomatic British usage gives you the choice: the Hooray Henrys, a derisive term for loud and yobbish scions of the English nobocracy, can be spelt that way or Henries, as you prefer. But with surnames there is no choice: the Dimbleby brothers, Britains best-known television commentators, are the two Dimblebys, period.        
	Happily, that doesnt prevent another idiomatic usage. The talented, self-conscious, not to add self-obsessed Bloomsbury Group, who lived in that district of London in the early 20th century  people like Virginia Woolf, with J.M. Keynes on the fringes  are unkindly known today as the Bloomsberries.

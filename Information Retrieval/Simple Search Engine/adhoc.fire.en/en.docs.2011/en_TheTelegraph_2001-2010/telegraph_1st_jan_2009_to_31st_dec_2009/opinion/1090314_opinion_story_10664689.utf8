The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | the states in politics
                                                                                                                 THE STATES IN POLITICS                                                          
	The fire of elections is making the cauldron of Indian politics bubble. What is evident from the churning is that a third space has opened up and has acquired importance in the Indian political scene. In this space, the two major parties claiming a pan-Indian presence, the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party, have no say. The other party with pan-Indian ambitions, the Communist Party of India (Marxist), is trying to carve out a big role for itself in the third space, but may, as trends unfold, find itself a bit of a misfit in what has come to be referred to as the third front. Stripped of all the details and the personalities, the formation of the third front represents a revolt of the states against the centralizing tendencies that emanate from Delhi. In all the three political parties mentioned above, every critical decision of strategy and tactics affecting the future of the party concerned is actually taken by a central body or individual, operating, more often than not, out of Delhi. Thus, the people who actually work for these parties in the states find themselves left out even when decisions taken from above adversely affect them on the ground. This is one of the principal reasons behind the emergence of regional parties. The third front, because it is to a large extent a coming together of these parties, can be seen as a revolt of the states against the centralizing force that runs parties like the Congress and the BJP.        
	The political articulation of these regional parties varies  from an assertion of caste to the assertion of a provincial identity. But what makes them appear as different manifestations of the same phenomenon is their refusal to accept the fiats of a leadership that is located outside the region. All these parties demand that they be treated as sovereign on their own turf. This assertion is also a declaration of defiance against parties that run on the whims of an individual or are dictated to by cabals whose members have never faced the people in an election. The puppeteers sitting in Nagpur and calling the shots in the BJP are as far removed from the popular electorate as the general secretary of the CPI(M). The Congress, in its turn, headed for five years a government whose prime minister was not a member of the Lok Sabha. This top-down approach to politics is now facing revolt from the state level, and the face of this rebellion is usually a regional satrap.        
	The national parties could save themselves by borrowing a model from the Board of Control for Cricket in India. There, no one who has not won his spurs in the regions gets appointed president of the all-India body. It is only by working upwards, from the locality to the province and to nation, that India can preserve and honour its federal character. The increasing importance of the regional players on the national stage is pushing Indian politicians to think about this. To ignore this would be to invite trouble from the bubbling cauldron.

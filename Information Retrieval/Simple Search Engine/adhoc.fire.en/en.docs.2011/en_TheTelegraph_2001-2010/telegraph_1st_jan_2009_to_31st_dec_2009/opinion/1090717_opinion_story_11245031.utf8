                                                                                                                 LAW OF THE TURF                                                    
	Their faith in electoral democracy is at best half-hearted, but half-partisan warfare remains central to the theory and practice of West Bengals ruling Marxists. That is why the rule of law and the authority of even their own government must be subservient to the party cadres raj. The events in Mangalkot show yet again the ugly face of this proxy rule. The members of the legislative assembly who were attacked there belong to the countrys biggest political party. If they could face an assault by Communist Party of India (Marxist) supporters in this manner and that too in the presence of the police, life must be very insecure for ordinary people in large parts of the state. The failure of the police and the administration to handle such situations has become routine in West Bengal. This is an inevitable consequence of the party replacing the government at all levels of the administration. As the CPI(M) loses more and more turf with every election, it seems to increasingly abandon democratic or even administrative methods and rely on half-partisan battles. The result is the withdrawal of the administration, while the cadre takes over. It is immaterial whether the partys leaders planned or connived in the assault on the Congress MLAs in Mangalkot. The point is that they have a created a system that runs independently of the leaders intervention in a particular event.         
	However, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee must take the blame for what happened in Mangalkot. He has condemned the attack on the MLAs. So has Biman Bose, the secretary of the state unit of the CPI(M). But the complete administrative failure in the event is not an internal matter of the CPI(M). It is all about the state governments constitutional obligation. The chief minister must realize that, irrespective of his partys faith in extra-constitutional methods, he has to rule by the book. It is not enough for Mr Bhattcharjee to condemn the incident or blame the Opposition for provoking turf battles. The people may not be too reassured by his promise to take action against guilty CPI(M) activists. His governments record in punishing erring policemen also does not inspire much hope. The chief minister has yet another opportunity to prove that he is serious about mending the governments ways. He has to begin by dismantling the system that put the partys rule above the government. But does he have the power or the will even to try it?

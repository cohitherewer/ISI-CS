The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | feelings and flight
                                                                                                                 FEELINGS AND FLIGHT                                                                  
	A few years back, we were escaping to Rishap in Darjeeling district during the Pujas when we were waylaid by a group of gaily-dressed revellers at a misty mountain bend. The men reeked of country liquor, and swayed like apparitions as they demanded a donation from our driver for their Navaratri festivities. After some altercation and money changing hands, the matter was settled amicably. We were gifted with sindoor-smeared pedas (which smelt of goats), and suddenly some women materialized out of nowhere to paint our foreheads with a thick pink paste. So the madness of Durga Puja in Calcutta, from which were running away, had followed us to the hills  a realization that grew stronger later when we saw goats, sheep and buffaloes being sacrificed in dozens to the Mother Goddess.        
	But Priyamvada Chhetri (all names changed) from Darjeeling, who has been living in Calcutta for the past three years, says that Durga Puja back home is a low-key affair compared to what she witnesses in this city. She was excited at the prospect of participating in the greatest festival of the Bengalis in her first year in Calcutta, but anticipation soon gave way to exasperation when she found Puja organizers wasting lakhs on their precious pandals. Now the Pujas leave her mostly unmoved. Priyamvada would rather enjoy the four days of well-earned rest at home than join the clamorous throngs outside. Most of her friends from the hills, who have lived in Calcutta for quite some time, share her feelings. They think that Bengalis are loud by nature, and the Pujas are an extension of their character.         
	The cynicism of Priyamvada is not to be found in Karma Dorjee, who has arrived in Calcutta from Nepal this year to study in a private institute. Had he not been summoned home for Dashain, which is the Nepalese counterpart of Durga Puja, he would have gladly been a part of the carnival in Calcutta. At the same time, he is happy that he is returning since he is already feeling homesick. The frantic pre-Puja shopping going on around him is making him all the more nostalgic by reminding him of the smell of new clothes, which are an integral part of Dashain as well. Karmas classmate, Aaron Lepcha, does not share his sentiments. Being Christian, he has never participated in the Dashain celebrations in Shillong, where his home is. But he has heard that Durga Puja is a grand festival in Calcutta and in his first year in this city, he is going to watch the drama unfold.        
	The Chinese Christians who have shops all over Bentinck Street are also left non-plussed by the Pujas. If anything, it is a time of increased activity rather than of leisure since business picks up in this season. The shops are open till late at night and it is work, work and work. But Durga Puja is good, one of the shop-owners adds, perhaps because the extra earnings will ensure greater happiness during the celebrations for the Chinese new year, eagerly awaited in February.         
	Vikas Tamang, who is 65, has been working as a watchman in various apartments all over Calcutta for the last 30 years. He is from Nepal but now that his wife is dead and his sons have families of their own, he no longer feels obliged to go back every year. Settled in Calcutta for good, Vikas looks forward to the Pujas these days because they signal a break from the humdrum. He looks admiringly at the workmen suspending strings of bulbs from the top of the boundary walls of the apartment where he works. This building will look pretty when it is lit up. Come and see us on Saptami night, he tells me.         
	The tour to Rishap had marked my first year in the hills during the Pujas. After the initial misgivings, I had been enchanted on Dussehra night when tiny clusters of light twinkled in the darkness and the wind carried the smell of incense. It had suddenly seemed too beautiful to be true and I had wished for the umpteenth time for a home in the hills.

                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Rush hour                  
	Sir  At times, the scheduled site for the arrival or departure of trains in Howrah is changed from the old to the new complex and vice versa.This inconveniences passengers, especially the women and the aged, as well as those who accompany them to the station. They have to rush to the new point of departure at the last minute. Moreover, vehicles are required to pay the entry fee twice while moving from one complex to the other. The railways should look into this matter and ensure that the problem is solved at the earliest.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sensible measures          
	Sir  It is heartening to note that some researchers in the United States of America have found that changes in household practices can reduce emissions substantially. Line-drying of clothes, as practised in India, is one of the foremost measures suggested by the researchers to reduce emissions in that country(US, hang em like India , Oct 27).           
	I had discovered a similar Indian method of saving energy during a survey on a proposed water-supply pipeline project. In the course of the survey, we noticed that villagers had spread paddy for drying on the tarmac in several places. The Dutch engineers accompanying me were very impressed by the fact that considerable energy was being saved through this practice. Indians have been using a number of energy-saving methods such as this one in the course of their daily lives for ages. With modernization and improvement, one hopes that these ancient techniques will help save energy and reduce emissions further.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Line-drying of clothes will certainly reduce emissions. But the US should also think of taking up solar cooking during summer months. This will reduce the emission of greenhouse gases and ensure that the food being consumed remains healthy. Similarly, the country should also adopt the method of cooking using gobar gas to cut down on emissions.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Powerful choice          
	Sir  The Maharashtra electricity regulatory commission deserves applause for providing consumers in Mumbai with the option to choose their power supplier and switch over to another utility if they so desire from next year (Right to switch power supplier, Oct 27). This step should be implemented in every Indian state as it will change the nature of power distribution in the country. Consumers will get the twin benefits of cheaper tariffs and better supply. It will also end the monopoly enjoyed by single suppliers and facilitate healthy competition among vendors  a phenomenon that has changed the face of Indian telecommunications. The people of West Bengal need this facility at the earliest because of the miserable condition of power supply here.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  Casteism is prevalent in India. Racism too seems to be on the rise, not just in the West but also in the less-developed nations. Therefore, it is imperative that human rights organizations across the world take immediate action to curb this evil practice. Individuals, too, must realize that every man or woman has the right to live with dignity. The need of the hour is to tighten international laws to curb racial discrimination. Barack Obama, who recently received the Nobel Peace Prize, should lead the world in putting an end to this inhuman practice.                     
	Yours faithfully,

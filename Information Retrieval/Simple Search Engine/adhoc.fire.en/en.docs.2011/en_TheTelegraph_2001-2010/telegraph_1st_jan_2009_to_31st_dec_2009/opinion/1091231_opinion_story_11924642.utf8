The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | year of gloom
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        YEAR OF GLOOM                                                    
	This has not been an easy year for anyone across the world. The global economy remains in the grip of a slowdown. There are some signs of recovery but there is no certainty that the recovery will be sustained. Even optimists do not argue that things will improve dramatically in 2010. Profits, investments and employment generation will remain at a very low level. The shadow of recession has dominated all human activity in the year that ends today. The Indian economy and, therefore, economic enterprise in India have been relatively better off than those in some of the developed countries. But this can offer small comfort within the overall picture of the slowing down of the rate of economic growth and its attendant consequences. The problems of poverty and inequality in Indian society were further marginalized because of the concerns regarding the downturn in the economy. The other issue that grabbed the attention of most people is what is happening to the climate. It is clear that economic development has adversely affected the global environment. No one denies that the developed countries have to bear the responsibility, for historical reasons, of polluting the world in the past. There is, however, no agreement on what steps the developing and the poor countries should take to reduce pollution in the present and in the future. Nationalist sentiments have often overwhelmed concerns about the predicament of all human beings if environmental pollution is not drastically reduced.        
	The gloom emanating from the economy and the environment lifted somewhat with a coloured person taking over the presidency of the United States of America. Not only did Barack Obamas swearing-in mark a historic occasion ending many years of racial discrimination, but it also marked a shift in the USs attitude towards the rest of the world. Successive US presidents have rode roughshod over the views of the rest of the world. Mr Obama, in his various statements, has shown a greater sensitivity towards the opinions of other countries and their leaders. The beginning of his presidency also represents a major triumph of democracy in the US, a country whose dream of freedom had been vitiated by the presence of racial inequality.        
	Democracy in India is apparently thriving, as is evident from the turnout in the elections this year. Despite this, there are question marks on the future of the full blooming of democracy in India. One concerns the obvious prevalence of dynastic politics and the importance of individual leaders in political parties. The other relates to poverty and forms of social and economic inequalities and discrimination. These do not disturb the framework of democracy but they do threaten the promise of freedom, which has to be fulfilled if democracy is to be meaningful. Nothing in 2009 suggested that this problem was addressed.

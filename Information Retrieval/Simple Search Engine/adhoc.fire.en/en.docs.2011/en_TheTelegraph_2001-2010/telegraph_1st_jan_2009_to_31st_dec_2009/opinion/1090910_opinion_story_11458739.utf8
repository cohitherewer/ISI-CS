The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Swept with confusion
                                                                                                                 SWEPT WITH CONFUSION                              For a more nuanced understanding of the past, students must be rid of their preconceptions, writes Dayita Datta                                                
	History properly taught should help men to become critical and humane, just as wrongly taught, it can turn them into bigots and fanatics.  Christopher Hill               
	It is only when some largely pointless controversy is stoked in the Op-Ed pages and television chat shows that attention is focused on history, its place in the curriculum and the values and skills it seeks to inculcate/indoctrinate. The new national curriculum and the textbooks brought out after a long and fruitful collaboration between practising historians and practising teachers are steps in the right direction. But state education boards and the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations have not caught up, so most of what constitutes school history is an inherited consensus based largely on hidden assumptions, rarely identified, let alone publicly debated. (J. Slater, The case for history in school, The Historian, No. 2)        
	To make it worse, history in the junior and middle school is often dumped on mediocre teachers of limited subject knowledge and minimal curiosity, who are content to cover the textbook, not teach the subject or the critical skills it develops. (It is not uncommon for such teachers to answer, when asked what they are teaching, Now Im on Chapter 10.) Research has shown that there is a close relationship between teachers subject knowledge and the quality and range of learning experience in the classroom. About 70-80 per cent of students end their class X examinations with relief that they never have to take up history again.              
	By the time I get to teach students in class XI and XII, they have been thoroughly turned off the subject. At the Plus Two stage, history is an optional subject, so I suppose I should be grateful that a few students have retained some genuine interest in it. But for a significant number of students it is the subject of last resort. To make matters worse, any mention of the national movement  especially Gandhi  elicits only bored sighs. Ask them why and the answers begin to emerge: they have had an overdose of the freedom movement, and of the presentation of prominent figures like Gandhi or Nehru as saintly personages instead of flawed human beings operating in contingent circumstances.        
	However, most have swallowed the demonization of Jinnah and of Muslims, which might have something to do with their being from north India, and having absorbed the family lore about riots, trains full of corpses, lustful Muslims looking for Hindu girls  all fuelled by Bollywood films catering to the lowest common denominator. Students find it difficult to believe that a non-practising Muslim could channel his energies towards founding a Muslim State. Nor can they understand that the Pakistan that emerged was in some ways a disappointment for those who had sought it.        
	Given this state of history teaching, in most schools and, in some cases, colleges, the ignorant and rabid reaction to L.K. Advanis and Jaswant Singhs jejune attempts at more nuanced appraisals comes as no surprise. I have found that the teaching of world history offers a parallel perspective: students understand Jinnah better once they realize that Theodore Herzl and David Ben Gurion were both non-practising Jews. They then begin to understand the fundamental contradictions of the States envisaged by Jinnah and the founders of Israel and the similar nature of both States as they have developed over the years  sectarian and militaristic. As for the eastern aspect of Partition, it does not enter their minds, the Punjab bloodbath having received the greater share of attention. As I am often the only Bengali in the class, it is left to me to add this dimension. As a teacher, I often bemoan the lack of accessible films (like the brilliant serialization of Bhisham Sahnis Tamas, or the recent Khamosh Pani) about the eastern experience.              
	Conversely, Partition is the one area of Indian history students are keen to read around  precisely because of the family stories and experiences of grandparents, some of whom may be living with them. The other area is the Holocaust. Over the years, I have wondered why this is so. From students reactions to such books and accounts, I do not think it is about wallowing in horror  I think it has more to do with the human quality of such experiences. Our little history library has a number of stories and novels about Partition as well as the Holocaust, and they are read avidly.        
	Students come to lessons with strongly rooted ideas and preconceptions about the past, which even well-meaning teachers find difficult to eradicate. (Some years ago, I was disconcerted to realize that despite having done examinations in modern history in Class X, some students thought Gandhi was responsible for Partition.) It is important that teachers of history understand and take account of students preconceptions and ways of thinking, if we are to move them to a more sophisticated and powerful way of understanding the past and the present. Hills emphasis on a critical and humane citizenship remains as valid today as when he made it.

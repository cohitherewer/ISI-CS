	Change can be a deceptive idea in the case of West Bengal. It is thus much easier to predict what may not change than to guess what may. The states love affair with bandhs and strikes, for instance, may not change even if the political scene changes. Last weeks strike at the Haldia Petrochemicals suggests how the future may unfold. Two things make the strike an ominous signal. It was organized by the trade union wing of the ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist); and this was the first time since its inception that the unit was shut down by a strike. The CPI(M) was the original sinner in forcing the culture of strikes and bandhs on the state. The HPL strike, therefore, raised the disturbing question of whether the party, if ousted from power, could revert to its old game. That this fear originates in Haldia is darkly symbolic. The industrial town and its petrochemical projects in particular are held up by the CPI(M) as showpieces of its attempts to re-industrialize the state. Yet, these icons of the new industrial hope for the state have to be shut down if the political fortunes of the party are threatened. The CPI(M)s return to militant trade unionism would be similar to the Bharatiya Janata Party trying to clutch at its fundamentalist politics in the face of a crisis.        
	That the Trinamul Congress opposed the strike can hardly offer much hope. If the present political trend continues till the next assembly polls, the party has a realistic chance of forming the next government in West Bengal. Its leader, Mamata Banerjee, wants to change all that she thinks has gone wrong in the state under the long Red rule. She now takes pains to assure sceptics that she is not opposed to the idea of industrialization. But her partys record in thwarting several new projects, especially the Tata Motors small car unit in Singur, has only darkened the states economic horizon. If her party had opposed the strike in Haldia, it was clearly more for its rivalry with the CPI(M) than out of a genuine concern for the states economic revival. It is hard to imagine a time when West Bengals politicians will change enough to put the states interests above their personal or partisan goals. That precisely is the fundamental change that the state needs. Power changes people, but the loss of it also changes them. A role reversal by the CPI(M) may not change much in West Bengal.

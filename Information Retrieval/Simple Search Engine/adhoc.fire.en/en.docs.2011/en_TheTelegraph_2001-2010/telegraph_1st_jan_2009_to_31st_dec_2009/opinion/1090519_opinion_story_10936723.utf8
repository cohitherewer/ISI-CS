	Soiled hands                  
	Sir  The article, Maa, mati, manush: Sounds nice but not on the fields of distress (May 12), was interesting, informative and scholarly. It dealt with problems that are affecting not just West Bengal but also India and the developing world in general. It is a fact that industrialized nations are richer than those still dependent on agriculture. Even in India, industrialized states are better off than their agrarian counterparts. Indian farmers do not earn enough and hence, agriculture has become unattractive for them. And yet farmers of industrialized nations are often rich. The explanation for this disparity can be found in the structure of small landholdings prevalent in India, especially in West Bengal. The effects of the Green Revolution having worn off, agriculture has become less mechanized now. Given these reasons, one can understand why Indian farmers almost always live in poverty. Yet the solution to the dilemma cannot lie in rapid industrialization brought about by snatching away of fertile agricultural land.           
	After having peaked in the early 1990s, India s per capita foodgrain production remained stagnant throughout that decade, and has declined to levels prevalent in the 1980s in the 21st century. The per capita food grain availability, which is production - export + import, has followed a similar pattern. All this is because the population of India has grown at a rate faster than that of agriculture since 1991. The world food crisis last year, when the prices of rice, wheat and other agricultural products reached an all-time high, is proof of a similar worldwide problem. With the incomes of people in developing countries improving, individuals have started demanding a better lifestyle and a healthier diet, which had so long been the prerogative of Western nations. Due to the change in eating habits and the increase in world population, world food production has not been able to cope with the rise in demand.          
	With more and more young farmers disillusioned with agriculture, and Indias (and perhaps the worlds) food security under threat, West Bengal can achieve prosperity not by decreasing the land under agriculture but by decreasing the number of people involved in agriculture. This can be brought about by shifting them to industry. In West Bengal, prime agricultural lands can be kept intact and industries built in the less fertile areas. The growth of industries will wean the population away from agriculture and the economies of scale will set in. At the same time, consolidated land holdings will allow mechanization of farms and that, in turn, will bring in a greater yield. This will make agriculture more financially attractive.          
	West Bengal should take advantage of the fact that most of the non-agricultural land here is in the districts of Bankura and Purulia, both of which are in the mineral belt. If industries are set up there, the people of these two districts, who are some of the poorest in the state, will be immensely benefited.          
	Bringing about these changes might not be easy, but they constitute a more viable alternative to the acquisition of prime agricultural land for industry in regions near Calcutta. The places closer to Calcutta cannot continue to develop while other regions remain neglected. In the longer run, India needs another Green Revolution to increase crop yields significantly. Till then, we need to strike a delicate balance between agriculture and industry.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Devadeep Purohit is right in pointing out that most villagers do not want to work in farms. Archaic farming methods still followed in India and the surplus of labour in agriculture make the income of farm workers much lower than of those employed in the industrial or service sector. However, the creation of industry such as the Tata Motors plant as an antidote to the miseries of the farmers may not be a great idea after all. Employment to such factories would demand specific skills, which most villagers would not have.          
	Instead, India should focus on jobs in the service sector, particularly the construction sector. Today, there is a serious shortfall of residential apartments all over India. The potential buyers are middle-class families which can afford flats in the range between Rs 5 lakhs and Rs 20 lakhs. Unfortunately, most flats in Calcutta and other cities cost above Rs 40 lakhs. A chief reason behind the high costs is the current land-ceiling act that does not allow builders to construct complexes with 20,000 or more flats. If such complexes become a reality, then builders would get to enjoy the economies of scale, and even with a smaller profit per flat, they can have an adequate income. These housing complexes will also provide immediate employment to millions of unskilled workers across India who can work as the masons helpers or otherwise. Farm workers, who were getting very low wages in villages, can thus have a higher-paying job.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Devadeep Purohit has misconstrued the reasons behind the farmers dislike of what they do. If the son of Bush Senior can be a president like him, and if Amitabh Bachchans son can be an actor, then why should a farmers son not be a farmer? With skyrocketing prices of agricultural products, it is nave to think that agriculture is unprofitable. The reasons behind the rise in the number of people leaving agriculture in search of other jobs have to be sought in something beyond the alleged lack of profit in farming.          
	Actually, rural people are reluctant to work hard  a fact that the state governments report on the execution of the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme for the financial year 2007-2008 bitterly pointed out. Also, the ongoing graffiti war with slogans like chashar chhele chasha (the son of a farmer is a farmer), is lowering the social prestige of farming. Little wonder then that todays kids, with dyed hair, sunglasses on the forehead, Ipods stuck in the earplugs, do not find agriculture cool even if they are from agricultural families. They do not want to soil their hands although it is agriculture that has helped them maintain their standard of living.                    
	Yours faithfully,

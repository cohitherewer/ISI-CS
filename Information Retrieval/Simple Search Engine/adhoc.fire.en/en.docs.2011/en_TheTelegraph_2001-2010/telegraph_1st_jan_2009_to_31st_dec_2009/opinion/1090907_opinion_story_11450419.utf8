The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | An aid to governance
                                                                                                                 AN AID TO GOVERNANCE                          - Regulation can involve the public by being transparent					 					      Commentarao -S.L.Rao                                                                  
	The telecommunications regulatory authority of India was the first independent regulatory commission, soon followed by the Orissa electricity regulatory commission. The Electricity Regulatory Commission Act in 1998 was the comprehensive legislation that led to the creation of the Central and state electricity regulatory commissions. Some states had their own legislation for electricity regulatory commissions  Orissa, Haryana, Andhra Pradesh and so on. Subsequently, others came into being for oil and gas and for competition. Many are in the offing  for coal, civil aviation, roads, railways, airports, ports (absorbing the tariff authority for major ports or TAMP), energy as a whole, broadcasting, cable television, communication (a sectoral regulator to promote, facilitate and develop carriage and content of all communications), water supply and sanitation, and for groundwater. Education and health may also be regulated by independent bodies.         
	Prayas (a highly qualified non-governmental organization) conducted the first survey of electricity regulatory commissions in 2000. The report was reviewed by an expert group consisting of E.A.S. Sarma, Madhav Godbole and myself. My book, Governing Power, was the first comprehensive review of independent regulation as a form of governance.              
	These and other papers and conference findings identify gaps between the different regulatory commissions on each of the major issues: independence and autonomy, their empowerment, accountability, transparency and public participation and enhancement of the quality of professional inputs for the regulatory bodies. New legislation that the government is considering for a standard approach between the different bodies must take account of suggestions. The purpose must be to make regulatory bodies sturdy and independent, and with common objectives and functions.        
	Thus, selection committees for regulatory bodies must not be ad hoc standing committees. Delays in constituting them must not take place, delaying (as they have repeatedly done) the selection process. Statutory selection committees must not be composed primarily of current or ex-bureaucrats but of others like sitting or retired superior court judges nominated by a chief justice, directors of reputed institutions like the Indian institutes of technology, lok ayuktas, the chairman of the Central administrative tribunal, and the chairman of a national regulatory commission, with the ministerial secretary as convener. Not more than one current or retired government official, if at all, must be selected for any regulatory body, to signal the independence of the commission. The selection committee should justify its recommendations and the government, if it does not accept the selections, must record its reasons. These documents should be placed in the public domain and reported to the appropriate legislature.        
	The age limit for all appointments should be with reference to the date of appointment to ensure that appointees serve one full term of not less than five years. The procedure for the removal of members should ensure absence of political considerations. There must be no second term of office. No member or convener of a selection committee shall seek appointment as chairman or a member of any of the regulatory bodies.        
	To provide financial autonomy to the regulatory bodies, each must have a separate fund raised through a cess on the regulated item. The bodies should be allowed to fund inhouse consumer advocacy, promotion of consumer organizations and professional consulting support.        
	The governments directives to the regulatory bodies must be transparent and severely constrained, so that there is minimal interference in the work of the bodies. All the regulatory, licensing and other related powers must be incorporated as inherent powers of the regulatory body and not subject to government discretion. This will avoid the present farce of regulatory bodies created but not notified with their authorities.         
	The primary accountability of the regulatory body should be to the concerned legislatures before whom their annual reports must be placed within a prescribed time limit. These reports must explicitly disclose the number of public hearings held, the orders pronounced and their implementation by the government concerned, the directives issued by the government either under the statute or otherwise, the views of the regulatory body thereon, and the administrative and financial constraints imposed by the government on their functioning. It must also disclose the decisions, statements or announcements of the government on matters that are essentially within the domain of the regulatory body as well as such other decisions that tend to preempt the decisions of the ERC.        
	Government audits of regulatory bodies must be only of the expenditures, not of their decisions or their financial effects on the government. All proceedings of the regulator should be translated into local languages and made available to the public, if necessary, by suitably pricing them, and through publication on the web. All regulatory orders should be circulated to the print media, especially in local languages. The regulator must be permitted by law to formulate a scheme to fund consumer organizations, provide for their training and to hold public hearings in states or districts, as the case may be, by rotation.        
	The objectives of regulatory bodies must have common features. Thus they must encourage, even stimulate, competition; in cases where natural monopolies or other factors inhibit the development of competition, simulate its effects by regulation. In sectoral regulation, they must have the powers not merely to promote competition, but also efficiency of operations and capital employed, to achieve rapid growth, and enable equity of access and geographical dispersion of services. All regulatory bodies should have powers to make regulations, issue licences, set performance standards, determine tariffs of the whole sector and not just parts of it, to enforce regulations, lay down licensing conditions, and take punitive measures including suspension or cancellation of licences in case of violation.                     
	The present structure of independent regulatory bodies has developed in a haphazard manner. It needs to be more uniform. The suggestions made here will go a long way towards making it so. However, legislatures and the executive are reluctant to allow the creation of such quasi-judicial bodies that will take away authority from them, giving it to non-elected bodies. Already it is accepted that they should not be given adjudicative powers, which must be with appellate bodies that are headed by someone from the higher judiciary. Electricity, telecom, competition, securities, already have them. They will surely come up for other sectors. We must try to limit the proliferation of both the regulatory and the appellate bodies by combining them, also ensuring coordinated functioning.        
	This new institution of governance enables public involvement through transparent functioning. It involves all stakeholders in decisions that affect them. Accountability is ensured by the fact that they justify all decisions.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A classic return
                                                                                                                 A CLASSIC RETURN                                  THEATRE - Ananda Lal                                                  
	Little Thespians welcome return to regular drama with Patjhad, based on Tennessee Williamss The Glass Menagerie, proves just how superior the script of a classic play is, compared to the stagings of short fiction that the group has experimented with of late. S.M. Azhar Alam merely Indianizes the locale from St Louis to Darjeeling and compacts the original in his Hindi adaptation for it to work its intrinsic magic again. He directs with a brisk pace that successfully undercuts Williamss sentimentality and heavy symbolism, but he should slow down the love scene considerably, for its dialogue comes out too rapid-fire and pat instead of awkward and tentative. The cast exudes confidence: Uma Jhunjhunwala as an alternately cheery and infuriated mother obsessed with her own past charm and the desire to find a man for her daughter; Heena Parwez as the fragile introverted girl; Surendra Kapoor as the angry young son (see family, in picture); and Mohsin Khan as a rather loud and opportunistic gentleman caller. Alams set design with three pyramidal walls of veneered planks aesthetically suggests the wooden panelling in hill houses.        
	Two other Hindi productions came visiting recently. Manoj Joshi Creations Chanakya, brought from Mumbai by Sangit Kala Mandir, is a costume spectacular written by Mihir Bhuta, retelling the history of Chanakya stopping at nothing to achieve his goal of uniting all of India under one monarch. Bhuta pictures him as a patriotic visionary who single-handedly elevated Chandragupta Maurya to emperor and for whom, says Joshi, nothing was greater than the nation. A fine sentiment, no doubt, but let us not forget that Hitler said the same thing. Building the Mauryan Empire entailed ruthless, violent conquest of many lesser kingdoms. Those not convinced by this counter-argument may fruitfully read Tagores book, Nationalism, warning against jingoism. Also, the Mauryas could not overpower the far south or far east: does that mean Chanakyas concept of an Aryan India excludes these states? Joshi himself directs and acts the lead (a part that obviously has the best lines) as a powerful but shrewd saint-politician (pardon the contradictory compound).        
	As a centenary tribute to Allahabad director, Anukul Bandyopadhyay, a theatre festival featured his Allahabad disciples, Rupkatha, in Jo Bhige Barish Mein, a Hindi translation of Joy Goswamis Jara Brishtite Bhijechhilo. Without wanting to sound anti-feminist, I confess I am not a fan of this cloying text about a womans flight to freedom, so I cannot support director Asim Mukherjees selection. Neither did his solo actress manage to improve upon Goswamis painfully mawkish monologue.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | less of a dirty word
                                                                                                                 LESS OF A DIRTY WORD                                  Sumanta Sen                              
	To the upper crust of society, politics has become a dirty word. It is something to be blamed for every problem, something to be sneered at in cocktail parties. So it has perhaps come as a bit of a shock to members of the glittering set to find people from their ranks contesting the 15th Lok Sabha elections. They are not many in number, but that is not important. What is important is that they realized there was little point in condemning the political world from a distance. If perceived wrongs had to be set right, then they had to join the game and try to start the rectification process from within.        
	They are all contesting as independent candidates. These days, such people seldom win elections and the top banker in Mumbai or the airline owner in Bangalore may well fall by the roadside. The point, however, is that unlike others in their peer group, they were not willing to be just disturbed by the goings-on around them, they decided to act. That singles them out as honourable exceptions in their society and also sends out the message that if the world of politics is really bad then it is because a whole lot of professionals have not thought it necessary to join it.        
	It may be argued that even while joining the fray, these individuals have sought to retain their identity by not being a part of this or that party. But then, that is the point that perhaps they are seeking to make, that once you are in a party you cannot act according to your judgment. Their training in their careers militates against this, they refuse to be cogs in the wheel. And they are not the only ones; even those in political parties often find it difficult to toe the party line. So, instead of going through that experience, they decided to be on their own. At least this way, they will never face the charge of having violated party discipline. Also, their independent status is far removed from that of those who seek to contest on their own after having been denied party tickets. In the case of the latter, the motive is personal; that most certainly is not the case with the others.                
	Second try        
	The question is whether such individuals efforts to bring about a change will end with the declaration of results and their possible defeat. If that happens, then the whole purpose will be lost. It will be much more meaningful if even after May 16 they keep on telling people that if they want changes they must not shut themselves up in a glass cage. There is little to be had by condemning politicians as useless crooks and at the same time taking care to ensure that their own children do not choose politics as a career. The stronger the insistence that politics is not for students, politics is not for artists, the larger grows the vacuum in the world of politics, to be filled by hoodlums.        
	And it is just not a question of keeping out unsavoury elements. Almost throughout the country, parliamentary politics has become family business: at various levels, first claimants for nominations are sons, daughters or wives of leaders and very often others with better credentials are left out. This is a phenomenon that has developed over the last 60 years or more and will not die out in a hurry. But questions most certainly will be raised in a bigger way if more and more qualified people join politics. A question begging to be asked is why children of established leaders should be seen as the automatic choice to step into their parents shoes, and in the former princely states the erstwhile rulers be seen as the first choice when it is time to look for candidates. The mere presence of trained professionals may act as a deterrent to this practice being continued.        
	In this country, there is no dearth of admirers of Western democracies. They would perhaps do well to keep in mind that in those countries the political world is not kept apart from the rest of society. That should be good enough reason to think afresh.

	Home truths                  
	Sir  The recent tirade by Kabir Suman, the Trinamul Congress MP from Jadavpur, against the malfunctioning of political parties, particularly his own, presents an accurate picture of the ongoing political drama in West Bengal (Slave Suman slams party, Nov 16). Barely six months back, Suman was at the forefront of a political movement by the change-seekers. The TMC turned him into a politician, and used his popularity to garner votes. It is good that within the space of a few months, Suman has understood that the only change evident, if any, has been in the bank balance of a few corrupt politicians. The commoners plight remains the same, and is unlikely to change.          
	The drama is further accentuated by the reactions from members of the Communist Party of India (Marxist). These were the same men who had maligned Suman before the general elections. Now, all of a sudden, they seem to understand how difficult it is for a man with a strong personality to stay on in a party such as the TMC in which only Mamata Banerjee and her acolytes call the shots. The rest of the leaders have apparently been marginalized. The poor voters of West Bengal, who had hoped for change, will now realize that they have been running after a mirage. When it comes to exploiting public money, political parties tend to act alike.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Kabir Suman, who has expressed his dissatisfaction with the goings-on in Mamata Banerjees party, does not sound very convincing when he claims that work for the betterment of the rural poor has not been undertaken by any political party.           
	Suman should have realized this much earlier. He should not have expected that all the pending work would be completed as soon as he became a member of parliament. Although it is an established fact that villagers and tribal communities have been deprived of the basic amenities of life, Suman should understand that neither the TMC nor the CPI(M) can bring about a change in things overnight. Development will take time. The pledge to work for the betterment of the poor has to be translated from words into action. Suitable and effective work should be undertaken to that end, and such activities should be carefully monitored till they are completed.          
	However, it is reassuring to hear that Suman has been pained by his experience of the deprivation in the states rural areas. It is now hoped that the leaders will take serious note of his complaints and show some effort towards ameliorating the condition of the sufferers. Only time will tell what happens next, and in what manner.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  A common man will be able to appreciate Kabir Sumans comment that he is not being able to work for the welfare of the people in his constituency owing to interference by his own party. Suman is perhaps the only man in West Bengal politics who cannot be castigated for his forthright views. Given the situation though, it can be said that the days of Sumans political life are numbered.          
	Intellectuals who have got themselves entrapped in politics should take a lesson from Sumans experience. While their concern for the people is beyond doubt, there is reason to suspect that some of them are being co-opted by the Opposition in a bid to achieve political mileage.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Class apart          
	Sir  The report, Challenges change with time: Sachin Tendulkar (Nov 15), shows that Tendulkar has won as many hearts with his conduct and demeanour as with his style of batting. His sensible attitude, which is reflected by the fact that he has never got involved in any controversy in his 20 years of cricketing career, makes him worthy of admiration. He has emerged as perhaps the most talented, tenacious and successful batsman in the history of the game and his accomplishments have been monumental. He is as solid a batsman as Sunil Gavaskar and can be as destructive as Vivian Richards. This lethal combination of attack and defence equips him to play well on all kinds of wickets, and against any kind of attack. Tendulkar has become an inexhaustible source of inspiration to the countrys youth.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Vinod C. Dixit, Ahmedabad 

                
	Sir  It was exciting to read what former cricketers had to say about Sachin Tendulkar (I find myself in his batting: Richards, Nov 15). Tendulkar has been the most complete batsman of his time, and arguably the biggest cricket icon as well. His batting is based on the purest principles: perfect balance, economy of movement, accuracy in stroke-making along with an indefinable quality given only to geniuses. Tendulkars achievements seem greater still when looked at in the light of the burden of expectation he has had to bear from his adoring, but somewhat unreasonable, followers. Tendulkars aura may have dimmed, if only slightly, as the years have taken their toll on his body. But the master batsman remains, by a distance, the most admired cricketer in the world.                    
	Yours faithfully,

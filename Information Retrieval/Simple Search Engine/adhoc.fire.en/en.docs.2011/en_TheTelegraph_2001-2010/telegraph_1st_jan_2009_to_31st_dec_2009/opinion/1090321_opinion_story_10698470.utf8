The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Similar, yet different
                                                                                                                 SIMILAR, YET DIFFERENT                              Ananda Lal      THEATRE                                                
	Artistic coincidences occur in strange ways, as when Chandrasekhar Kambar and Girish Karnad independently wrote plays on the same Kannada folk tale at around the same time (Siri Sampige and Naga-mandala respectively), and speculation arose about who got the idea first. Likewise, Shailesh Parekhs The Prophet and the Poet (picture) for Bangalore Little Theatre, presented by Rabindra Bharati University, bears remarkable similarities with M. K. Rainas Stay Yet Awhile by Prayog (Delhi), which came to Calcutta in mid-2007, when Parekh was compiling his script. Not only did both use Sabyasachi Bhattacharyas The Mahatma and the Poet as their source, they also had identical dramatis personae (Gandhi and Tagore, of course, but just one other character, a narrator linking the episodes and epistles) and even performatory modes (an emphasis on reading from fixed positions on stage and no attempt at realistic portrayal).        
	Consequently, those who had seen the earlier production felt the loss of newness here, though the inspiring elements in the Tagore-Gandhi relationship and correspondence continued to enthral. It became a comparative analysis of gain and loss. Rainas text had more to offer than this one, which Vijay Padaki, the director, wrongly edited down from Parekhs substantial original, and unnecessarily added a poem by William Radice. But Padaki gained in the choice of staging at Jorasanko, whose moonlit courtyard and historic verandas bestowed a dignity and spirit to the occasion, as if occurring in Tagores own presence. Sanjeev Iyer as Gandhi contributed a controlled performance and covered up for Abhijit Gangulys nerves and memory lapses as Tagore  just the opposite of Stay Yet Awhile. As in that play, the narrator had hardly anything significant to do.        
	Another interesting concept is Path (The Waterfall), a bilingual version of Tagores Muktadhara by the Institute of Factual Theatre Arts, though one wonders about the meaning of the primary title. Muktadharas ecological value grows by the day, yet few groups touch this classic drama on industrialization, water-sharing and nature conservation amid government vacillation. Director Debasish Dutta scores theoretically in his decision to use both Bengali and English, but their random application makes little sense, and the casts poor enunciation of the English lines makes us wish he had stuck to Bengali entirely. Duttas visual design, colourful and symbol-heavy, is the most memorable aspect, with a multi-level installation set by Samir Sarkar and extending to the highly eclectic costumes. Among the characters, one remembers the bald and unclothed Bibhuti, slithering underground like a reptile.

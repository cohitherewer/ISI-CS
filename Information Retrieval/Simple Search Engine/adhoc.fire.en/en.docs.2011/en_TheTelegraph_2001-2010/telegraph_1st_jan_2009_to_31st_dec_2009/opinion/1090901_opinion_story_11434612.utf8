The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | ART FOR PEOPLES SAKE
                                                                                                                 ART FOR PEOPLES SAKE                                  Malvika Singh                              
	India is about to swamp the art and museum scene in London end-September onwards. Anish Kapoor, albeit a true Londoner, is an Indian artist whose extraordinary sculptures and installations had taken the world by storm some years ago, and he continues to create the unexpected. Close on his heels, on September 30, another hugely inventive artist, Subodh Gupta, who hails from Bihar and whose art is synonymous with the real, tactile India, unveils his work. Unlike Anish, Subodh lives in India, his work reflects India and celebrates the symbols of India within a universal public space. Juxtaposed with the vibrancy of an emergent India, the Victoria and Albert Museum is celebrating the maharajas of yore, with all their trappings of opulence, which captured the imagination of the colonial rulers. The British managed well to keep the royals subservient to them, as M.K. Gandhi led India into a non-violent struggle for freedom. Later, Sardar Patel worked relentlessly to amalgamate all the kingdoms into one federal, democratic republic.        
	The life and times of Indian maharajas during the British rule have been of enormous interest for the West. Many exhibitions have been arranged over the years and the subject has been an attraction for the last few decades. For most non-Indians, this is a recent period in Indias complex and centuries-old history, and therefore easier to comprehend and identify with. But, for us in India, this celebration of the erstwhile royal is becoming a trifle pass. A new generation is far more energized by the challenges and creativity of a modern nation-state. Subodh Gupta will be the symbol of that inclusive India, grabbing international attention, competing with the world in this new millennium.                
	Forgotten treasures        
	There is a candid confidence in the new maharajas. Whatever their profession, ranging from politics to the arts, the young are asserting their new identities with formidable skill. There is an excitement that has overwhelmed the crusty, complaining generation that came after the one that was involved in the liberation of this country from British domination. For the first time, in my memory, there is a determined generation carving out its place as it attempts to correct the corrupted legacy of the past few decades where the mechanism of governance went into a state of denial and became exploitative and only for the few. As the young in politics work to empower the neglected mass, their counterparts in other professions are beginning to lay fresh foundations to operate within. A restructuring is happening that is often unseen on the surface though rooting itself in firmly.        
	Last week, there was an Art Summit in Delhi, something unheard of five years ago. There was a buzz around the event, representing the vitality of a changed India. We are bound to see a mushrooming of many exciting developments, where diverse strengths and assertions will compel the growth of ideas, skills, and institution-building alongside sensible modalities that encourage change, debate, discourse and movement.        
	Many of our institutions that were cast in stone during the first decade following the Independence have become moribund. Our national and state archives, run by bored babus, have lost a great deal of material and remained unfriendly places. Our museums, too, remain mummified in the garb of dead monuments, again run by babus who have no love for the great treasures that lie in the basements and those that are displayed in the grubby halls. Command economies across eastern Europe, the erstwhile Soviet Union itself, and other smaller and poorer nations have renewed their pledge to keep their legacies healthy for the sake of the future generations. India lags behind, with no concern whatsoever for its own treasures.

	Open wound                  
	Sir  Ramachandra Guha deserves to be praised for his brilliant, touching and timely article, Two anniversaries (Oct 24). In this context, it may be pertinent to recall that the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, who is a Sikh, had once commented that the issue of the anti-Sikh riots of 1984 cannot be kept alive forever. Singhs views could have been considered just had the criminals who butchered ordinary Sikh men and women following Indira Gandhis assassination been punished. It is appalling that India is yet to punish the culprits or rehabilitate and compensate every riot victim even after a quarter of a century. The nightmare of the pogrom against the Sikhs will continue to haunt the community if the the victims wounds do not heal over time.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Ramachandra Guha has taken his readers back to a sad chapter in the history of India. It is unlikely that the wounds created by Operation Blue Star will heal quickly. The Sikhs believe that the armys storming of the Golden Temple could have been avoided, and that an entire community had been punished brutally for the action of a few of its members. Sikhs, as well as followers of other religions, are of the opinion that Indira Gandhi was responsible for bringing the situation to a point where the army operation became inevitable. After her assasination, rumours about Sikhs rejoicing spread fast, thereby angering some members of the Congress. Eventually, supporters of the Congress took to the streets and attacked defenceless Sikhs savagely. Subsequently, there have been attempts to play down the incident by suggesting that infuriated Congress supporters had been swayed by the tragic murder of their leader.          
	But what happened after that was equally shameful. Members of the government became complicit in the act by deciding not to punish the perpetrators. Ranganath Mishra, a former Chief Justice of India, played an important role in effacing the sins of the government. He was later rewarded with a Rajya Sabha seat. It is also tragic that the human rights groups, which protest against the attacks on Muslims frequently, have not been as vociferous in their condemnation of the incident.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The article, The phantom enemy (Oct 23), analysed the Maoist movement in India with precision. Ashok Mitra has been a Left ideologue for a very long time. He was a senior member of the state cabinet, and is also a Marxist. It seems that this article presented him with an opportunity to study different communist groups in and outside India. Had he still been a member of the state cabinet, perhaps the government could have looked at Maoist activities more rationally. Mitras apprehension about the future stages of the Maoist movement seems logical.          
	The government has been rattled by the sudden spate in Maoist attacks in the state. Unfortunately, it is now committing the same mistakes that Mitra warns of in his excellent piece. Mitra clearly mentions the consequences that can be expected if the government decides to quell the Maoist insurgency by force. It is surprising to note that both the state and the Central governments are gradually falling into the trap laid by the Maoists. Among the states haunted by the spectre of terrorism, such as Kashmir, Assam, Manipur, Nagaland and Tripura, the application of force on the part of the State has not yielded the desired results. Forcing the militants to the negotiation table has not proved to be effective either. Such a strategy has achieved only partial success in Nagaland and in Tripura. It appears that the problem of Maoist violence can only be solved by bringing development to the impoverished areas. Even Atindranath Dutta, the police officer abducted from Sankrail, is convinced that the government should think about development instead of battling the Maoists.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  In his article on the Maoist rebellion, Ashok Mitra states, The Maoists believe revolution to be a feasible proposition in India. Maoists, Naxalites or Stalinists have always believed that revolution is the only means to liberate people from economic penury. But no communist country has ever been as successful as the democratic nations, which have a free economy. For example, South Korea, which has not experienced a revolution, has a per capita gross domestic product on a purchasing power parity basis of $27,600. Compare this with communist North Korea whose per capita GDP (PPP) is $1,800. Similarly, the figure for Taiwan is $31,100 compared to mighty China, which has a per capita GDP (PPP) of only $6,000. Mitra should note that none of the communist countries could achieve relative economic success even after a proletariat revolution.          
	Mitra has also been critical of the Tatas for grabbing adivasi land in Jharkhand. He says that the Tata steel factory has not improved the quality of life of the tribal population there. But Mitra should also reflect on the Marxist government in Bengal giving the Tatas agricultural land by uprooting a large number of people, and then claiming it to be a historic step for the welfare of the people.          
	Mitra also writes, The foot soldiers of that revolution will be the suppressed and oppressed adivasis now ready for a glorious uprising against the tyrannies of State power. But what he fails to acknowledge here is that the Marxists are in power in Bengal, and the Maoists and their supporters in the tribal community are waging a war against this Marxist State.           
	It seems that the author is of the opinion that the adivasis are poor because they are exploited. On the contrary, the adivasis are actually poor because their capacities have never been utilized properly by the State.          
	Yours faithfully,

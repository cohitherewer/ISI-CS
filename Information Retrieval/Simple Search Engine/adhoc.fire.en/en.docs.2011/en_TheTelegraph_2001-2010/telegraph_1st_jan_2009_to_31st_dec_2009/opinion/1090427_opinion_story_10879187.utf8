	Secret lives                   
	Sir  The editorial, Shock value (April 21), is proof that the media have become more sensible. Instead of forcing viewpoints on the readers, the media are asking us to be free thinkers. It is true that every individual has the right to think on his own terms and have his own sense of right and wrong. For too long, the people who have been given the right to run the government have ruled the minds of the governed. They try to tell us what we should think or do. For example, value education is an invariable part of the syllabi in schools. But what is shown to be the correct path is based on the moral values and judgments of others. We are stopped from being honest with ourselves. This is why most people today are hypocrites. People cannot say whats on their mind because their first instinct is to worry about societys reaction.          
	The same thing happens with sex. Sex is an issue because of the way society thinks about it, and for a very long time it has believed that sex is a crime. Why then have sex with your spouse? Why should sex education be banned in schools? School-goers of a certain age ought to learn about sex so that they can take decisions on their own and have a better control over their lives. Sex education is necessary, especially for girls who need to be aware of their bodies to lessen chances of being abused and to stop feeling scared of the world outside. As for boys, sex education will give them a better understanding of sexual activity and teach them to be responsible individuals. Of course, committees set up by the government cannot be expected to understand the importance of any of this.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Keeping in mind the widespread sexual abuse in todays society, I firmly believe that the solution does not lie in introducing sex education. It lies in imparting moral values, which schools do not seem to be doing these days. Sex education will not prevent perversion. What is needed is the revival of moral science as a compulsory subject from Class I. Lessons on good habits, duties of the individual to the family, society and the country, along with physical activities like yoga, could help build a healthy society and nurture a healthy mind.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Salil Gewali, Shillong 

                
	Sir  Contrary to the editorial, Shock value, I think sex education in schools creates suspicion and confusion among the guardians and teachers about the knowledge imparted to young people, and its possible impact on the society. The government could experimentally introduce sex education in small areas in different parts of the country, and use the response of the people to either expand or disband the idea of the imparting of sex education. This attempt will be more convincing than the arbitrary decision taken by political leaders. As Indian society is basically conservative, sex education is bound to face opposition from different quarters. Today, India is more vulnerable than before. The pluralism in culture and religion complicates decisions such as the introduction of sex education. Sexuality is linked to a number of aspects of Indian society. It is not a private matter for individuals. Naturally, if sex education in schools is flawed, the impact of it will be felt outside the classroom. No government, so far, has felt comfortable about making sex education compulsory in schools. Even the education systems envisaged by people like Rabindranath Tagore, Swami Vivekananda, Mahatma Gandhi and S. Radhakrishnan did not include sex education for adolescents.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Cut short          
	Sir  Hemchhaya Des report, To beard or not to beard (April 22), gives a fair idea of the hazards of interpreting Article 25 of the Constitution. Although still rare, once in a while controversies do occur in India over the insistence of a member of some religious community to adhere to religious practices that are not permissible in secular institutions. The recent case is the controversy in a school in Madhya Pradesh which rusticated a boy for keeping a beard. The apex court has upheld the stand of the school. One wonders why members of a particular religious community should always raise the spectre of persecution when there is none. Since charity begins at home, it would be interesting to see if any madrassah would allow its own students of other faiths to display their religious symbols on their persons.          
	Yours faithfully,       
A.K. Ghosh, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  The point raised by the article, To beard or not to beard, is pertinent at this time, when politicians are going out of their way to appease particular communities to increase their vote bank. The Constitution guarantees citizens freedom to practise their religion. But that does not mean that the faithful can go naked in public if their religion so prescribes. If shaving is forbidden in Islam (the root of the controversy in the school), then how is it that Muslim actors have no beard? It should be understood that India is a secular country and citizens should be tolerant of one anothers religious activities. It is time institutions made common rules for all irrespective of religion. Islamic fanatics from outside India are trying to foment trouble in the country. Unless we learn to ignore the propaganda and live in harmony, India will soon get destabilized.                     
	Yours faithfully,

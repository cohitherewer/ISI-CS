	Copenhagen is turning into exactly the sort of shambles everybody feared it would be. The only official text still has almost 2,000 square brackets indicating points of disagreement. And now all the rival, unofficial texts are starting to emerge.        
	The first to be leaked was a Danish proposal, backed by a number of other industrialized nations. It would simply scrap the Kyoto Protocol, the only legally binding treaty in existence that makes countries reduce emissions, and ditch the measures it contains on financial assistance and technology transfer to the poor countries. A new treaty would be constructed on a green-field site, with everything up for grabs.        
	The developing countries were furious  but in the next few days the BASIC group (Brazil, South Africa, India and China) will release its own proposed text. The least developed countries, the African bloc and the overall G-77/China group are also expected to present their own texts, as are the small island states.        
	One hundred and ten heads of State will show up for the final couple of days, so something will have to emerge that can be presented as a success. But it is likely to be merely a ringing statement of principles that steers around all the unresolved disputes, and then everyone will go home leaving the job half-done.        
	But cheer up. Last chances are rarely what they seem. The job of removing all the brackets from the text will probably be resumed next year, with the goal of bringing something closer to a final draft back to another Conference of the Parties as soon as possible.        
	So what does this process remind you of? If it were all happening within one country, and the blocs of states manoeuvring at Copenhagen were local interest groups defending their turf, then you would recognize it instantly. It is the normal, familiar political process transposed to the global scale. And that is new.        
	It is hard to celebrate a process as clumsy, and occasionally as ugly, as the horse-trading and arm-twisting going on at Copenhagen  but that is how human politics works. We may all recognize that there is a global emergency, but every government still has its own interests to protect. Nevertheless, we have come a long way.                
	Necessary choice        
	Seventy-five years ago there were only about 50 independent countries in the world, and more than half of the human race lived in somebody elses empire. The one existing international organization with any pretensions to global authority, the League of Nations, had collapsed, and we were entering the worst war in human history. Sixty years ago, there was a new, more ambitious global organization, the United Nations, created mainly to prevent more wars, in particular a nuclear war. There were a 100 independent countries, many of them dictatorships, but they did represent the interests of their people better than the empires. The world was divided ideologically into East and West and economically into North and South, but the realization was dawning that we were all in the same boat  and in the end we did avoid nuclear war.        
	Now there are 192 governments at the Copenhagen conference, most of them democratic, and they know that we are all in the same boat. So, for the first time, we have real global politics. It is as messy as politics at any other level, but it is better than what we had before. Some on the Right think that climate change is a Left-wing plot to impose a world government on everybody  nothing of the sort is remotely likely.        
	We are all just dealing as best as we can with threats that require a global response. We bring our old political habits with us, because there is no better model available. If we succeed, the world will be more politically integrated than ever before. Not because it is desirable but because it is necessary.

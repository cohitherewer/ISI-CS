                                                                                                                 FAST FORWARD                                                    
	Things are moving fast in the Central human resource development ministry  and this is impressive and exciting. Not only has the minister, Kapil Sibal, initiated public debate and taken radical decisions in the field of education, but he has also managed to bring the states to some sort of a consensus over these issues and changes. So, there are encouraging new policies regarding education, as well as the first steps towards their translation into actuality. The making of the Central boards secondary examination optional, the introduction of grades, the idea of a purely academic collegium that would help the Centre appoint the vice chancellors of Central universities, a single overarching agency in higher education, a non-theological Central Madrasa Board, private accreditation bodies  these are all innovations with far-reaching implications. The Centre, the states, various educational institutions and regulatory bodies, administrators, teachers, guardians and students will now have to evolve new kinds of working relationship in order to implement these changes in policy and in approach.        
	As with all such changes, there can be endless debate over the pros and cons of each. But their real efficacy will be proved only in their implementation. There is nothing inherently right or wrong about optional board examinations and grades. But whether they make a positive difference to the lives of students will depend entirely on what each school, or state, or family makes of these policies, and in what direction they are taken within the existing social, cultural and pedagogic realities in India. In a country of more than a billion people, where examinations, marks, ranks and other forms of competitiveness are a part of deeply entrenched forms of thinking and acting, where teenagers are seldom thought capable of making their own choices in life by guardians and teachers, the significantly new ways of conducting the business of education introduced by Mr Sibal may either prove anarchic and disastrous, or they may foster a mindset that could revolutionize attitudes to education in the country. All would depend on the reception and implementation of these ideas, policies and decisions. India is too vast and varied and too used to being India to take too easily to being asked to be something else.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	On a hopeful note                  
	Sir  The proposal to upgrade Presidency College to a unitary university has been approved by the chief minister of West Bengal, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, and by the governor, Gopal Krishna Gandhi, just before the birthday of the first Indian president, Rajendra Prasad, who studied in Presidency before Independence (Buddha thrusts forward with Presidency freedom struggle, Dec 2). A bill to grant the 192-year-old institution the status of an independent university will be placed in the assembly during the current winter session of the House. Attempts to make Presidency an autonomous body started from the time of the former chief minister, Siddhartha Shankar Ray, and continued in the tenure of Jyoti Basu. Hopefully, Bhattacharjee will succeed in his effort.          
	Financial autonomy will be the most important achievement for Presidency if and when it becomes a university. It is likely to have access to more funds for research and teaching, and this will help it grow. Many new posts, and therefore jobs, will be created. Moreover, the college will be able to free itself from Alimuddin Streets control. Students will benefit from all this.          
	Recently, the BA and BSc Part I and Part II results of Calcutta University caused turmoil among students. Disgruntled candidates registered their protest, and some students of Presidency College demanded the review of their answer scripts. Reforms are needed to make the education of students and the evaluation of their performance smoother and fairer. Calcutta eagerly awaits the emergence of Presidency as an elite and world-class university at par with Indian institutes of technology, Oxford and Cambridge.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Soumik Ghosh, Calcutta

      
	Sir  Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees bold step to free Presidency from the shackles of Alimuddin Street is a welcome move. Mamata Banerjee must also be given credit for advocating Presidencys cause at The Telegraph-Calcutta Club debate. What Dipak Banerjee, an iconic professor of economics, had written in the Presidency College magazine in 1972 will finally come true if the bill is passed in the assembly.          
	Many feel that making Presidency a university will revolutionize the academic scenario of Calcutta. But one needs to temper that optimism. Although a Nobel laureate like Amartya Sen had studied in Presidency, yet, at that time, the socio-political environment was different. In the last 32 years of Left Front rule, the college has been turned into a political hub. An atmosphere conducive to high standards of education is needed for Presidency to achieve excellence. Before making the college a university, the government should consider banning political activity in its premises. If these maladies are not dealt with, making Presidency a unitary university will produce no result. As Sukanta Chaudhuri pointed out in Presidency: future tense (Dec 3), excellence will come only with matching infrastructure. The government should create a committee of renowned academicians with a view to improving the college. And if Amartya Sen heads the committee, it will be a step towards making Presidency a world-class university. The issue of autonomy has gained momentum. Now it is for the chief minister to ensure that bureaucratic hurdles do not stall the proposal.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
S. Mukherjee, Burdwan

                
	Sir  Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees resolve to make Presidency a unitary university appears to be a political gimmick. I fully agree with Sukanta Chaudhuris assertion that merely making the college a university will not stem the degradation that has eaten into it. The Left Fronts grip on the college cannot be entirely wished away. Presidency College has always been synonymous with the Calcutta University. The present and past alumni of the Calcutta University are also the products of Presidency. Chaudhuris view that a Presidency University can only flourish by interacting with other institutions and by being a part of the universal schooling agenda may not go down well with the Left. Freeing the university from political influence may well be a hard task. And the elation shown by the so-called intellectuals may be short-lived.                    
	Yours faithfully,        Prabhakar Bhattacharya, Ichapore, North 24 Parganas       
	Sir  Although Presidency is about to become a university, its infrastructure is still not up to the mark. Sukanta Chaudhuri has discussed some of the most pertinent problems that the college faces. Presidency should be freed from the constrictions of politics and bureaucracy. The college is famous for some well-known personalities who studied there. It is hailed as the numero uno among colleges in West Bengal. This external glamour creates a facade which hides the internal problems and corruption. The university status will increase Presidencys responsibility. To become one of the top institutions, Presidency should opt for a complete makeover.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Oindrila Thakur, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Being an alumnus of Presidency College, I feel that the college should ban all students and employees unions on becoming a university. Otherwise, no reform would be able to revive its past glory. Presidency should also invite the best teachers from across the world who are actively involved in cutting-edge research. It should ensure proper funding for its research laboratories in all the relevant departments, and ask renowned scientists to visit Presidency and speak to the students.          
	Yours faithfully,      
S.S. Manna, Calcutta

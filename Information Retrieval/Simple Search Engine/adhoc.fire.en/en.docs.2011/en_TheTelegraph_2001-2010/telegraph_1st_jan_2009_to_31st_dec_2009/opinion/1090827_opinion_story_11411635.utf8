The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | presumed dead
                                                                                                                 PRESUMED DEAD                                                    
	There are two things that the naming of the new head of the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan confirms. One, that a drone attack in early August did kill the TTPs former leader, Baitullah Mehsud. So long, allegations of the death of Mehsud had been hotly refuted by the Taliban, who, however, acknowledged that he was seriously ill. The lack of access to, and information on, South Waziristan made it impossible for Pakistans media, and for the international media, to verify the news. Knowledge of Mehsuds fate is important because his death would signal a breakthrough for Pakistans anti-Taliban offensive, which has not had much success in felling important Taliban leaders. It would accord to the United States of America a major victory for its controversial attacks from the air. In spite of doubts, therefore, Pakistans information ministry has tried its best to push the news of Mehsuds death and the resultant disarray in the Taliban ranks. The attempt has set off a media war with the Taliban, who contest and confuse official interpretations with their own versions of what had taken place, and is still taking place, in their midst.         
	Even if it is now fairly clear that Mehsud is dead, the same cannot be said about the end of the succession battle. The new leader, Hakimullah Mehsud, is evidently a man who cannot lay claim either to Baitullah Mehsuds influence or his stature. The succession has been disputed from the start by another close associate of Mehsud. The second implication of the news of Mehsuds death thus means an increase in violence as rival Taliban leaders stake their claims to leadership or express their solidarity with the claimants to Mehsuds political legacy and famed wealth. Hakimullah Mehsud, reputed to be a hot-headed gentleman, is believed to have started the process already by sending out his men to bomb and terrorize Pakistans towns and cities and hit out against the Shiite leadership. This means more complication for Pakistans anti-Taliban strategy. Now it has to aim at not one, but several, epicentres of conflict as the Taliban, without a strong leadership, splinter further. However, the divisions within the Taliban could also make it easier for Pakistan to deal with the scourge. Unfortunately, Pakistan is neither willing to take the battle right into Waziristan by compromising its position on the eastern border nor completely demonize and destroy the Taliban.

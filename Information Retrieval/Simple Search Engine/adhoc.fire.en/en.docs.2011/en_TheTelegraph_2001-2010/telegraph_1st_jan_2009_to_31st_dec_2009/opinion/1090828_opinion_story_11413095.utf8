	New light on an old icon                
	The Ayatollah begs to differ: The paradox of modern Iran (Penguin, 9.99) by Hooman Majd is a critical, illuminating and occasionally witty examination of the contradictions that afflict modern Iran. Majd succeeds in challenging the prevailing stereotypes to depict an Iran that has more to offer than women in hijab, hawk-eyed moral police and thundering imams. Hence, we come across opium-smoking clerics, women cabbies and youngsters in Western wear who are nonetheless proud of their Persian heritage. The authors ability to penetrate this very public image of a country to reveal its inner churning can be attributed to his sharp journalistic skills, liberal education and his access to powerful men who are shaping Irans destiny. But Majds evidence of a New Iran can appear flimsy at times, and seems to be tinged by his own desire to see his motherland as a cosmopolitan and reformist state. Majds book offers one way of looking at Iran, but it is not the only way.                        Gandhi rsquo;s dilemma in war and independence (Frontpage, Rs 195) by Ranabir Samaddar is a scholarly work that revisits the tumultuous 1940s to shed new light on a man who, according to the author, symbolized the ironies of that time. Significantly, even as Samaddar scrutinizes Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi rsquo;s views on a myriad issues mdash; war, decolonization, problems of governance and so on mdash; he emphasizes the need to examine whether the Mahatma was as certain of his politics and its methodology as it is made out to be in modern times. 
    First love (HarperCollins, Rs 250) by Brinda Charry falls miserably short of being ldquo;an unforgettable collection rdquo; of short stories. Charry is fascinated by the intricacies of the ldquo;human condition rdquo;, but her unimaginative plots and dreary prose fail to keep the readers engaged. The settings and protagonists vary in every story, but there is no escaping the drudgery. In ldquo;Mallika rdquo;, a brother and a sister touch the life of a eunuch in unexpected ways; ldquo;The Secret rdquo; is a chronicle about a bored, ageing bachelor savouring the momentary thrills of a bigamous existence, while ldquo;First Love rdquo; depicts a teen romance and the deceit that comes in its wake. The book doesn rsquo;t take long to finish, but one is likely to forget Charry rsquo;s characters and their chequered lives even more quickly.

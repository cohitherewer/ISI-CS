The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | island off asia
                                                                                                                 ISLAND OFF ASIA                                                    
	No country is an island, even when the concerned country is geographically an island, and a very big one at that. The comment is directed at Australia, which, it would not be an exaggeration to suggest, suffers from a kind of identity crisis. The immediate reason for reiterating this is the decision of the Australian tennis officials to boycott a Davis Cup match in India on security grounds. It will be recalled that a few years ago, the Australian cricket board had ruled against the Australian team playing in Sri Lanka. No one will deny that India is a target for terrorist attacks but this has not brought normal life and sporting events to a standstill. The United States of America, the United Kingdom and many European countries are also on the radar of terrorists, and perhaps feature more prominently than India. The moot question is would an Australian sporting body stop a team from touring or playing in those countries? Would a bomb blast in Britain lead to the Ashes series from being called off? Throughout the period when public places in Britain were prone to bomb attacks by the Irish Republican Army, the Australian teams happily played on British soil. Obviously, Down Under, some countries are more equal than others.        
	At the heart of Australias identity crisis is the fact that its history and its geography pull in two different directions. Since it was colonized by white settlers who then proceeded to marginalize the aboriginal population, Australia has seen itself as belonging to the Anglo-Saxon or the white world. Yet in geographical terms, it is proximate to Asia, and part of the larger entity called Australasia. Even if Australia wants to be part of the European Union, its future lies in closer collaboration with the countries of its region. It cannot, for its own future interests, allow its sporting bodies to take decisions that are easily interpreted as displaying animosity towards Asian countries. The suspicion that Australia is hostile to its Asian neighbours is aggravated by the racism that exists there. Some Australian political leaders have openly articulated racist sentiments. A historical process has made Australia apparently a white country. This cannot overrule a geographical reality. Politicians who claim to rule Australia, and the common people of Australia must collectively recognize that their future lies with Asia.

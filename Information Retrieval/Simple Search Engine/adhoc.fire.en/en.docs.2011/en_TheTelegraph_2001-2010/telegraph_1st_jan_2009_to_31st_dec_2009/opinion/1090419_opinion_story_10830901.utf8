	Ignorance and other demons                  
	Sir  I was surprised by the election manifesto of the Samajwadi Party, which said that if Mulayam Singh Yadav comes to power, he would prefer to discontinue the teaching of English and the use of computers. The Samajwadi Party leader also thinks it is futile to use advanced machinery in cultivation. It is amazing that such a viewpoint has attracted people like Sanjay Dutt and Nafisa Ali to join this party. Are they not aware that their leader is bereft of common sense and is bankrupt of ideas?          
	Yours faithfully,       
N.S. Dua, Calcutta 

      
	Always a hit          
	Sir  The recent death of Shakti Samanta, the well-known director of innumerable films in Hindi, has put an end to an era of clean and wholesome entertainment. Popularly known as Shaktida, he will always be remembered for his blockbuster directorial ventures like Howrah Bridge, Aradhana and Amanush. He was instrumental in bringing to the limelight stars like Rajesh Khanna, whom he cast repeatedly in his films.          
	Samanta was equally successful with films in his mother tongue. Amanush, with Uttam Kumar from Bengal, is still considered one of his best projects. In his last phase, Samanta gave Amitabh Bachchan a superhit with the bilingual Barsaat Ki Ek Raat. Samanta will always be remembered for his ace directorial skills.           
	Yours faithfully,       
R. Sekar, Visakhapatnam 

                
	Sir  Shakti Samanta was once known as the wizard of entertainment. He started by making B-grade movies in the early 1950s and became one of the most successful names in the business a decade later. As the maverick star of the Sixties, Shammi Kapoor helped Samanta steer his career to success. So did Rajesh Khanna in the following decade. The filmmaker was unequivocal in admitting this.          
	It was Samantas love for films that brought him to Bombay in the early Fifties. Howrah Bridge brought him success. He tried his hand at socially relevant films with Insaan Jaag Utha in 1959. Disheartened by the lack-lustre response the movie received, he reverted to entertainers and found a saleable star in Shammi Kapoor. Later, he teamed up with Rajesh Khanna, and went on to make innumerable hits. With Khannas waning popularity, Samantas grip over the box office also started slipping. No movie he made with other stars, except Great Gambler and Barsaat Ki Ek Raat with Amitabh Bachchan, could bring him the same success. He eventually handed over Shakti Films to his son. Samanta became president of the Indian Motion Picture Producers Association and later was chairman of the Central Board of Film Certification.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Abhijit Roy, Jamshedpur 

                          
	Parting shot          
	Sir  On my first trip to Orissa, I was enchanted by its beauty. But what played spoilsport were the stringently enforced rules at the Hindu temples. These admit only Hindus and people of any other religion are forbidden.           
	In a country like India, where we are used to coexisting with people from diverse cultures and religions, this is a huge blow. It exhibits the rigid and orthodox side of Hinduism. I saw some tourists and devotees being stopped from entering the temple because their colour suggested they were not Hindus.           
	If people of all religions are allowed into mosques, chapels and synagogues, why this injustice in Orissa? Such regulations are reportedly in force in some other states as well. These restrictions foment suspicion among peoples. Perhaps it is time to rethink them.          
	Yours faithfully, Shwetasree Chowdhury, Calcutta

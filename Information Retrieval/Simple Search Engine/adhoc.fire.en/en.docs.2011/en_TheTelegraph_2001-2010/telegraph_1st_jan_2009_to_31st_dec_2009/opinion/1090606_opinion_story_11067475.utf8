	Tell-Tale: Fiction, Falsehood amp; Fact at the Experimenter gallery (ended May 23) was a two-part exhibition bringing together 10 contemporary artists under a single curatorial idea. This way of showing contemporary art is fairly new in the city, particularly in the extent to which the unifying idea had been thought through (by Paula Sengupta, who was also one of the artists), and in the gallerys attempt to inspire site-specific work. The show, especially the first part, was lit with care, and that made a great deal of difference. However, cerebrally-driven shows, like this one, should be wary of clutter.         
	Art made out of ideas and concepts needs physical and mental space to unfold properly in the viewers consciousness; knocking against artworks in the process of trying to reflect on them is not the best way to experience them. One has to be able to walk around them freely and contemplate them from a distance without other pieces coming in the way. I was almost falling into the sunken, cloth-and-video part of Archana Handes excellent All is fair in magic white while trying to view its accordion-fold version. Instead of trying to squeeze in 10 artists, the gallery could have shown just six (three in each part). That would have made Tell-Tale intellectually richer and visually more spare  especially when the pieces were of such varying quality.

	Another way of minimizing clutter is to not put captions on the wall, and prepare, instead, simple hand-outs that viewers may consult if they wish. The labels in this show were shoddily printed and pasted, and the curatorial comments on the wall became inadvertently funny because of the wobbly lettering  a typically Calcuttan lack of professional finesse. It was a good idea to put the curators essay only on the gallery website. Senguptas copious, and somewhat glib, interpretation of each work would have been intrusive for viewers who prefer to do their own looking, thinking and judging. It is always a dodgy practice to take a set of words like post/colonialism, globalization, history and narrative, already worn out by academic over-use, and then try to use them as keywords in relation to works of art.         
	There is a risk that a show conceptualized too discursively will reduce its exhibits to what they are about. Straddling art and theory is a tricky game that must be played with tact and caution, lest academias investment in explication ends up destroying arts necessary reticence and ambiguity. Art, in order to be art, must exceed the idea that begets it or tries to contain it. Otherwise the work becomes illustrative, or ends up telling a story or making a critique as a writer, critic or journalist would. And this is what happens with Rajesh Debs Political Box or Anupam Chakrabartys Kaalbaishakhi (particularly when it is shown in isolation from Chakrabartys other, more layered and nuanced, works in paper). Senguptas own Coxs Bazaar, in spite of its complex assembly of materials, fitted a little too predictably into a prevalent genre of nostalgia-driven, root-seeking, quasi-historicist Partition narrative. Sarnath Banerjees elaborate joke, Lalbazaar: Lower Pile, did not quite manage to rise above tired humour and unremarkable draughtsmanship.        
	In contrast, the work of Debnath Basu, Adip Dutta and Abhishek Hazra  skilled, sophisticated, intellectually challenging and therefore impossible to paraphrase or theorize upon (even when the work itself appropriates theoretical discourses, as Hazras does)  pulled Tell-Tale up to a level of brilliance and freshness that one expects from younger artists. The mix of fineness and murk in Basus graphite images on paper makes his Fataru much more than a visual rendering of Nabarun Bhattacharyas fiction. Even the texts next to the images become part of Basus grey world of the imagination.         
	Duttas giant sculpted books of steel-wool and paper-pulp shock us into an imagined tactile response to them. The book becomes another focus of desire and repository of wordless stories when surrounded by his lovingly wrought drawings of ordinary objects, which look surreal when depicted in such painstaking detail. And Hazras wittily difficult, but precisely thought through, cocktail of Tintin, structural anthropology, Derrida, Matisse and the bizarre whimsies of online advertising keeps one delightfully suspended between jest and earnest.

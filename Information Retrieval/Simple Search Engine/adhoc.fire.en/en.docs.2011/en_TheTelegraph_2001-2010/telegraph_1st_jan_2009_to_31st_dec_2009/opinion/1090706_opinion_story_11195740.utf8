The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Obtuse passivity
                                                                                                                 OBTUSE PASSIVITY                                                    
	Although it is no surprise, it is nevertheless depressing that Calcutta has managed to be the worst city to do business in according to the World Banks latest survey covering 17 Indian cities. This is quite an achievement, because Indian cities happen to be amongst the worst in the world to do business in. If an imaginary city were constructed which had the best scores of all Indian cities, it would be the 67th best city in the world. Calcutta is not so bad when it comes to starting a business. It is better than Mumbai, Guwahati, Ahmedabad, Ranchi, Cochin and Bangalore. But the differences are small: it takes 30 days to start a business in Calcutta, and 41 days in Cochin. Calcutta can boast that it is better than China. But entrepreneurs had better think twice before they rush to Calcutta; here it takes longest to close a business. Calcutta is about the worst when it comes to getting a construction permit: it takes 258 days and costs 25.5 times the national per capita income. It does so badly even after having computerized and reformed the process. Once a building is constructed, it takes an average of 107 days to register a property in Calcutta; only Bhubaneshwar is worse at 126 days.        
	India is notorious for the number of taxes a business has to pay and the frequency of payments; Calcutta beats all but three cities by requiring 68 separate payments in a year. Local taxes are small compared to income tax  about a quarter as much in Calcutta. But the number of times businessmen have to run to tax offices, stand in queues and persuade clerks to take the money is intolerable. Foreign trade does not involve particularly high costs, but still it takes 20 days to export and 31 days to get through import formalities in Calcutta. It takes over three years to enforce a contract in Calcutta; only Ahmedabad and Mumbai are worse, but then there is a lot more business and hence more disputes in those cities. Most of the delay is in getting a judgment out of courts. The plaintiff is likely to lose a quarter of his claim in legal costs.         
	These comparisons do not show Calcutta in a favourable light; the West Bengal government is likely to claim that they have been made to show Calcutta in a bad light. Figures may not always answer the right question; but they do not lie. And the World Banks study presents the government with a golden opportunity. Improving administrative performance of cities is quite easy; it mostly involves setting up procedures, some computerization, and supervision of staff to ensure that they work. Above all, administrative reform costs little money; often it saves money. That is something that should appeal to the finance minister; here at last is his chance to do something useful.

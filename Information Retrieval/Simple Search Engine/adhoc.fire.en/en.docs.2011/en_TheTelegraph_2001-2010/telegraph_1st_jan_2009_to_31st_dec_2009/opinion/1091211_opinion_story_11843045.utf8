	Richard Darnton, a Harvard professor and author of The Case for Books: Past, Present and Future, reckons that Google has digitized some ten million books that should be available to readers sooner rather than later. Since this ten million also include books within copyright, the case is in the American courts for alleged infringement of copyright. But the question is, once the case is decided, on what terms would these books be made available because neither the author nor the publisher would give away the rights, gratis.        
	Hence the terms of settlement would have a profound effect on the book industry in the future. On the positive side, Google would make it possible for readers to access millions of copyrighted books currently in print on computer screens (or on hand-held devices) with payment going to authors, publishers and to Google. Many books covered by copyright but out of print will be available through subscriptions by institutions or individuals.        
	While these might be the early days, there are questions we need to ask: first, will the price be moderate, that is, affordable by institutions as monopolies  which is what Google would eventually become  tend to charge monopoly prices? Second, since we are suffering not so much from a lack of information but from a surfeit of it, would books on-line be efficiently classified? The reader today doesnt want to wade through a pile of information; he wants it broken down into subjects and specializations. Third, how up-to-date would the information be, and how would Google ensure that the reader is updated as new publications come out? This is particularly important for science, technology and medicine (and other professional courses) where the latest publications always take precedence over the backlist.        
	Pricing will be a crucial factor in the enterprise and a three-way mechanism between Google and publisher/author has been established to work out the compensation package on a book-to-book basis. This is a stupendous task and no pricing formula has been worked out so far. It wont be easy because publishers and authors would not comply in the absence of advances and royalties.        
	But this is just one half of the question. What is the price that Google would demand of its customers? The standard pricing formula doesnt quite work here because we dont know what Googles unit cost would be. Would it be the fee they pay to publishers/authors for buying their copyright divided by the number of hits the book is likely to get? What if the fee demanded is too high, as is likely to be since publishers/authors will wish to extract the maximum, especially if it is a one-off deal? Will Googles price then remain affordable?        
	The nub of the problem with the digital library will be its marketing. How does one display the product to get the customer to see it? Maybe with the rapid spread of personal computers this will not be too difficult. Whatever it is, we can be sure that technology will change the face of publishing at a much faster pace than it has done so far, even if we have to pay a price for it.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | False alarm
                                                                                                                 FALSE ALARM                                                    
	It may have been just an unfortunate choice of words when Barack Obama said on Monday that he wanted to overhaul the tax code of the United States of America to make it easier for US companies to create jobs in Buffalo, New York, than in Bangalore. He was talking about the elimination of tax deductions that American companies can claim for investing in their foreign subsidiaries. Under present US law, companies can claim a credit on taxes paid in other jurisdictions against their US tax bills. But many are suspected of inflating and accelerating those tax credits; many also are suspected of shifting money to tax untraceable accounts in offshore tax havens. The administration says that US companies pay an effective tax rate of less than 3 per cent on companies foreign profits, estimated to be about $700 billion a year. Mr Obamas statement was part of a tax reform to improve revenues in the US economy. But many in India saw it as an attempt to restrict Indias outsourcing industry, of which Bangalore is emblematic. Wholly owned subsidiaries of leading US companies have thousands of employees in India to handle back-office and customer service functions, particularly financial services firms such as banks and credit card companies. Many American companies have over the years also expanded their marketing, distribution and sales forces in India to take advantage of Indias rapid economic growth and the rising incomes of a burgeoning middle class.        
	The latest proposal for reforming the US tax code reverses a decades-long philosophy of capital export neutrality: taxing residents on their worldwide income, while providing relief from double-taxation through a foreign tax credit. Biases between domestic and foreign investment are eliminated when taxes are applied on global income. At the same time, policymakers also believe that US companies operating in other countries should not have to pay higher taxes than those applicable to their domestic competitors, as that would make them uncompetitive (a philosophy of capital import neutrality, in other words). While US companies have been critical of Mr Obamas proposal, it is not clear what impact it will have on their investing in India. True, it is a tax disincentive, but companies move jobs to India because of lower labour costs, not because of differential tax rates. The cost advantages of moving those jobs to India are still very high.         
	Across party lines, both Democrats and Republicans are more or less opposed to this latest attempt at international tax reform. After all, openness to trade by itself improves US tax revenues. This is not about trading jobs in Bangalore, India, for jobs in Buffalo, New York. It is changes in US tax policy that have been under consideration for some time. As one eminent US tax expert said, it wont make a beans difference to India.

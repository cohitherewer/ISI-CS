	Home thoughts                  
	Sir  It is but natural for any group of people to try to carve an identity for themselves, and to protect their own interests by having a homeland. The brave Gorkhas do deserve a state of their own, considering the fact that they have always fought for our country. But do the Darjeeling hills belong to the Gorkhas alone? What about the indigenous population of the Lepchas, Bhutias and the many Marwaris or Biharis who have settled in the region since many generations? On the other hand, would all Gorkhas who do not even hail from Darjeeling claim to be a part of the new Gorkhaland if and when the statehood demand comes to be realized?           
	Would a Lepcha, who has been living in Darjeeling for hundreds of years, be less a part of Gorkhaland than a Gorkha who has migrated, to say Dehradun or Delhi, long ago? All these questions should be considered by the authorities before they decide to act on the Gorkhaland demand. It is true that the Darjeeling hills have been neglected by the state government for years. But it is not impossible to reverse the situation. The tripartite talks taking place on the Gorkhaland demand is the right way to resolve the issue (Hill state plea reaches table, Dec 22). The grievances of the neglected people can easily be addressed through meaningful dialogue.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Suresh Agarwal, Siliguri 

                
	Sir  The editorial, Steep climb (Dec 15), raises several relevant issues, which need to be given serious thought. It is true, as the editorial says, that the Telangana problem gave an impetus to the demand for Gorkhaland  justifiably so, since the latter is an older demand. The basic difference between the Gorkhaland movement of the 1980s and the present one lies in the fact that the second is a mass movement supported by all. What links the two movements is the identity crisis suffered by the Gorkhas over the years, and not so much their economic deprivation. At the same time, it cannot be denied that economic factors played a part in both the movements. Let us not forget that for the past 20 years, people in the hills supported the Gorkha National Liberation Front despite the fact that it did not quite address the major concerns of the Gorkhas. Only continuous financial deprivation could have made them so desperate.          
	The blame squarely lies with the insincere state and Central governments. The West Bengal government failed to enforce responsibility and accountability on the functioning of the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council. Taking advantage of the political docility of the Gorkhas, the government turned a blind eye to the corruption within the DGHC. Had it been sincere, one wonders whether the people would have rallied round the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha in the way they are doing today. By insisting on a separate Gorkhaland, the hill people are asking for a right that is guaranteed to them by the Constitution of India. They are not asking for the partition of Bengal, since Darjeeling was never treated as a part of Bengal by its rulers.           
	Finally, it would be wrong to impose the observation that social and economic indicators from the new states such as Jharkhand, Uttaranchal and Chhattisgarh do not indicate major success stories on the proposed Gorkhaland. Gorkhaland can set an example of good governance and prove that it is an exception.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Amar Rai, Darjeeling 

                
	Sir  It is strange that our chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, is unwilling to permit the creation of Gorkhaland because he thinks that the division would not help the common people. But how much has the common man been benefited by his chief-ministership? If Bhattacharjee had really been mindful of the peoples welfare, then almost half the states youth would not have been jobless.           
	The Gorkhaland movement has been around for decades. The state government has done nothing to improve the conditions of the hill people in the intervening years between the movements inception and its present state. How sensitive the Communist Party of India (Marxist) is to the hill people can be deduced from the number of Gorkha leaders it has in the government. If there can be talks of Telangana being carved out of Andhra Pradesh, then why not a separate state for the Gorkhas, who share virtually nothing with the rest of Bengal?           
	Yours faithfully,      
Bhaskar Sen, Calcutta

                
	Sir  My son studies in Delhi Public School, Siliguri. He has not been able to attend school after the recent political turmoil in the Darjeeling More area caused the school to shut down. I am seriously worried about this disruption.           
	I wonder why West Bengals socio-political problems are increasing by the day. And why is the administration being unable to handle the situation in a way that causes minimal trouble to ordinary people?           
	Yours faithfully,      
Ardhendu Kumar Bose, Siliguri

                
	Parting shot          
	Sir  Rajiv Gandhi once said that Calcutta is a dying city. Truth is always bitter, and his remarks were not appreciated by most. Today, Calcutta is a dead city. We could not make our city clean, and now it is nothing but a big garbage dump. Roads, pavements, junctions, riversides  everything is occupied by hawkers, jhopriwallas, autorickshaws, and party offices. Vegetables vendors sit on the roads, be it at the Rashbehari crossing, Ballygunge station area, Tollygunge Circular Road or at the Howrah station subway. The authorities never spare a thought for the pedestrians who are left with very little space to walk, thanks to the teeming encroachers.           
	Newly made roads are dug up the very next day and then left in that state forever. Hand-drawn rickshaws continue to ply the roads of Calcutta, and so do old autorickshaws. Even after so much fuss, the authorities could not stop all old vehicles from running in the city. Bengalis may take pride in their aesthetic sense, but they have no civic sense. By letting everything come to such a pass, they have proved that they are lily-livered people who cannot even protest against injustice.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Tapan Biswas, Calcutta

	Following the terror trail               
	26/11: Mumbai Attacked (Roli, Rs 295) edited by Harinder Baweja combines flawless research and critical analyses to get at the truth behind the terror strike in Mumbai last November. In the Editors Note, Baweja states that the book is an attempt at understanding the enormity of Mumbai 26/11. The contributors  mostly journalists as well as a former police commissioner of Mumbai  put together pieces of evidence with dexterity to recreate the unimaginable horror in the readers minds. Chris Khetan pays homage to those securitymen who gave up their lives battling the terrorists while Rahul Shivshankar and George Koshy retrace the trail of blood as it passed through Nariman House, Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus and Cama hospital among other places. Excerpts from Ajmal Kasabs interrogation as well as the interview of a LeT operative provide crucial links to the identity of those who perpetrated this audacious attack. Significantly, the book also raises fingers at the abysmal failure of Indias intelligence network, as is evident in the piece written by Julio Ribeiro, the former police commissioner. Balanced and written crisply, this book sheds light on a dark and disturbing episode.                        
	Fated to love (Penguin, Rs 299) by Qaisra Shahraz traverses contemporary Pakistan, Egypt and London to talk about love and loss. Zarri Bano, the beautiful daughter of a rich landowner, is besotted with the successful businessman, Sikander, but her father opposes the match. Zarris brother dies in an accident and her father declares Zarri to be the heiress of his vast fortunes. In keeping with a cruel, feudal tradition, Zarri is forcibly married to the Holy Book and is condemned to a celibate life. Love triumphs in the end, but this offering from Shahraz lacks the richness of some of the other recent works by her compatriots.                        
	BPO-SUTRA: tRUE STORIES FROM INSIDE iNDIAS bpos amp; cALL cENTRES (Rupa, Rs 95) compiled and edited by Sudhindra Mokhasi recounts 150 distinctly unfunny tales full of strange expressions about the life and times in Indias burgeoning call centres. Included in the collection are stories such as a TSR solving a technical issue with the help of beer, missing mouse balls and so on. This forgettable treatise also has some glaring instances of shoddy proofing.                                
	I am A SPECIAL GIRL (EastWest, Rs 195) by Amitava Banerjee tells the story of Mouri, a differently-abled young girl with doting parents, who is exposed to music, laughter, family life and her native culture and history even as she struggles with a dreaded neurological condition. But it isnt just light and happiness that fill Mouris life. Her parents are forever anxious because of the burden of her illness. Then, there are the indifferent doctors who prefer to couch the truth in alien medical terms rather than help her parents understand the implications of her disability. Banerjees attempt to portray the triumph of the human spirit over seemingly insurmountable odds could have been lauded had it been less melodramatic.                        
	Failure INC. (Macmillan, Rs 185) by Howard Eisner is a practical business book that lists 52 ways to go under in business. There is nothing new about some of Eisners suggestions: the best training for your new project managers, he writes is on the job.         
	But some others may raise eyebrows. People dont like bad news, so never report any is one such advice that might alarm those who are concerned with the lack of transparency in the corporate world.

	Blame game        
	 In a bus accident, a passenger broke his upper arm and the nerves in his hand were also affected. Doctors informed him that his arm was permanently damaged. The Motor Accident Claims Tribunal awarded him Rs 2,50,000 as compensation. The Metropolitan Transport Corporation of Madras appealed before the Madras High Court, contending that the injury was due to contributory negligence on the part of the victim for he had put his hand outside the bus. The high court held that the victim was partially guilty of contributory negligence. The victim appealed before the Supreme Court which held that the high court should not have disbelieved the doctors diagnosis. The court further held that if he put his hands out, the injury would have been confined to his wrist. (G. Gnanan vs Metropolitan Transport Corporation)                           
	Troubled marriage        
	 A man was granted a decree of divorce by a trial court for being subjected to mental cruelty by his wife. The decree was upheld by the Delhi High Court. One example of mental cruelty on the husband was that the wife had an abortion without his consent. The wife appealed before the Supreme Court, stating that the evidence regarding the abortion without the husbands consent was faulty. As for the other examples, the wife stated that they were part of the usual ups and downs of married life. The court, after going through the evidence, held that the letters written by the wife stating that she was not interested in the marriage and abusing her in-laws amounted to mental cruelty. So the husband was entitled to a decree of divorce. (Suman Kapur vs Sudhir Kapur)                    
	Right to a home        
	 The Supreme Court has held that when a wife claims maintenance from her husband it includes a right to residence. The judgement was delivered when a woman claimed the right to her husbands property as part of the maintenance to be given to her. The court held that the purpose of granting maintenance to a lady was to enable her to live in a manner which she was accustomed to. Hence she was also entitled to accommodation which was of the same standard as before. It further held that accommodation could be provided either by giving her a lump sum or by settling a property on her. (Komalam Amma vs Kumara Pillai Raghavan Pillai)

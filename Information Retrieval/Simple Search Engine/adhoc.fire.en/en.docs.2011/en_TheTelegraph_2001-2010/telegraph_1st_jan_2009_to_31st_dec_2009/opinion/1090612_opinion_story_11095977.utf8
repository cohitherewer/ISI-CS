The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | dangerous ploy
                                                                                                                 DANGEROUS PLOY                                                    
	No matter how things change, West Bengal seems to have no escape from its cycles of political violence. The people who voted so overwhelmingly for the Opposition in the last elections did so to protest against the ruling Marxists culture of violence and political terror. But the Trinamul Congress has clearly taken its victory to mean a licence to carry on with such politics. Its activists are now out to destroy offices of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), burn the homes of its supporters, attack or even kill them. The ugliness of the political vendetta raises the question whether Mamata Banerjees men are any better than the comrades. Their acts of vandalism have already tarnished her victory. These may end up aiding the CPI(M)s campaign that the TMC is hell-bent on bringing back the anarchic days of the early Seventies. Worse still is the prospect of her party hoping to win the 2011 assembly polls by playing by these dirty rules. Her strategy to use violence and lawlessness to force New Delhis intervention in the state is not only undemocratic; it is also a dangerous ploy. There is also a dark irony in the CPI(M) victims complaining against the police and the administration. In its long reign, the party has politicized  and ruined  the administration.        
	However, the saddest part of the story is that the warring politicians in either camp have no qualms about killing all hopes for the state. It has long been said that West Bengals politicians are the worst enemies of its promise. The bitter political battles that forced Tata Motors to shift its Nano project from the state to Gujarat showed how truly West Bengal has become a state of unreason. The Marxist rulers did not take the Opposition into confidence while working on the project. Ms Banerjee responded to that mistrust by killing it. An important project that could have changed the states economy was reduced to an issue of political victory or defeat. The same attitude of confrontation is partly responsible for the current spell of power shortage. Petty political interests have prompted the Opposition to resist the governments attempts to acquire even small plots of land for setting up power transmission sub-stations. Even the distribution of relief to the poor people rendered homeless by the cyclone, Aila, is fodder for partisan politics. Sadly, even the so-called civil society is also caught in the web of this tit-for-tat politics.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A blank screen as yet
                                                                                                                 A BLANK SCREEN AS YET                          - Not a resurrected US but a defeatist one cheered Obama        Swapan Dasgupta                                                  
	A spectacular event such as the coronation of a new president of the United States of America is invariably replete with symbolism. To those with undying faith in the American Dream, it was the pedigree of the man at the centre, the resurrection of a Bible last used by Abraham Lincoln, and a vintage bus in the eye of a momentous storm in Alabama that defined the day and told the story of Americas renewal. To use the evocative words of the historian, Simon Schama, American democracy came back from the dead. To those less fascinated by American exceptionalism, it was Barack Obamas promise to harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories and a recognition that the US can no longer afford indifference to suffering outside our border that set him apart from a country obsessed with itself.        
	For me, however, the real symbolism of last Tuesdays pageantry was, first, the sorry spectacle of the former vice-president, Dick Cheney, the brain behind the George W. Bush administration, in a wheelchair. And, second, an uncharacteristically tense  even nervous Obama faltering over the first words he uttered after assuming the presidency; he was, in a pedantic constitutional sense, already president before the chief justice, John Roberts, triggered the false start. Viewed in conjunction, the debilitated Cheney and the faltering Obama symbolized the travails of an uncertain America that had unequivocally delivered a knock-out blow to existing certitudes but was still groping for a new deliverance recipe.              
	At the best of times, it is difficult to pin Obama down. An accomplished political chameleon, he admitted in the prologue to The Audacity of Hope that I serve as a blank screen on which people of vastly different political stripes project their own views. He maintained this ambiguity by stressing that on economic matters he wasnt going to get bogged down by the dogmatic big government versus small government debate, but would strive to forge a government that works. A proactive approach to climate change, a cause that binds the fraternity of liberal faddists, was his only concession to specifics.        
	On national security and Bushs War on Terror, Obama was unsparing in his indictment of his predecessor: We reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals, and, our power alone cannot protect us, nor does it entitle us to do as we please. Yet, lest he be accused of wanton appeasement, he guarded his flanks with the inspirational assertion that we will not apologise for our way of life, nor will we waver in its defence, and for those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents, we say to you now that our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken; you cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you. As a robust assertion of indefatigability this was great stuff; even Ronald Reagan couldnt have done better.        
	A restatement of American determination was necessary. Barely a week before the inauguration, in an audio message whose authenticity hasnt been contested, Osama bin Laden repeated his proforma call for jihad against Israel. To the inspiration behind al Qaida, the time for a new onslaught was opportune. God, he said, has bestowed us with the patience to continue the path of jihad for another seven years, and seven years and seven years. The question is: can America continue its war with us for several more decades to come? Reports and evidence would suggest otherwise.        
	The terrorist leaders assessment wasnt off the mark. In recent weeks, there has been compelling evidence to suggest that neither the US nor its Western allies have the stomach to persist with Bushs War on Terror. In his speech at the site of the 26/11 carnage in Mumbai, the British foreign secretary, David Miliband, argued that the term, War on Terror, was misleading and mistaken for two reasons. First, because it conferred an artificial unity of purpose on different groups that included the Hamas, Hezbollah, Lashkar-e-Toiba and even the Naxalites; and, second, because it also implied that the correct response was primarily military. Miliband, who boasted to his Indian interlocutors that he was clued in to the thinking of the Obama camp, inferred that the Afghanistan and Iraq wars were misadventures.        
	To believe that the real misgivings centre on the war in Iraq which, at present, seem to be going rather well for the US-led alliance is being wilfully escapist. During the long election campaign and after, the critics of Bush maintained that the invasion of Iraq diverted resources from the real war in Afghanistan. Now that the Bush-Cheney orthodoxy has been unceremoniously junked and a commitment has been made by Obama to restore Iraq to its people, does it imply that Nato will apply itself single-mindedly to crushing the resurrected Taliban?        
	The answer is uncertain. Both the governments and public opinion in western Europe seem dead set against committing more troops in Afghanistan, especially at a time of mounting economic difficulties. Their preferred course is to extricate Nato from the thankless and seemingly unwinnable war involving strange people, and let someone else assume the burden of pacification. Since Pakistan is more than willing to regain its strategic depth in Afghanistan, there is an inclination to outsource Afghanistan to Pakistan. The generous aid package linked to Pakistans total involvement in the US war aims in Afghanistan bolsters this conclusion.        
	This line of action is also accompanied by the nave belief that a resolution of the Kashmir problem (to Pakistans advantage) will allow Islamabad to free itself from the clutches of local jihadis. Indias strategic establishment is concerned about the inclination in Obamas foreign policy circle to unsettle the perceived pro-India tilt of the Bush administration. Reaching out to the Muslim world has become the Wests priority. But it is an initiative premised on the recognition of its own weaknesses.              
	The harsh reality, which bin Laden shrewdly gauged, is that a long cycle of untroubled prosperity has softened the West to the extent that it no longer has the fortitude to exercise difficult options in the realms of either economic management or foreign policy. Islamist theology on the other hand glorifies protracted hardships and suffering for the sake of an eventual victory. Also included in its calculation is the belief that strategic retreats based on deceit and duplicity  what is called al Taqia  may be imperative in a long war for supremacy. It is worth recalling that the former Pakistan president, Pervez Musharraf, invoked the Sunnah to justify his countrys seeming abandonment of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan after 9/11.        
	The US has long witnessed an emotional tussle between its exceptionalism and its universalism. Like Bush, Obama too believes in Americas manifest destiny. But whereas Bush had a mandate to flaunt American machismo, Obama has to contend with a groupthink based on pluralism, compassion and the exercise of soft options. In his address, Obama disavowed the risk-averse faint-heartedness that he implied lay behind the perception of American decline. But in his heart he was aware that it wasnt the invocation of old American values  hard work and honesty, courage and fair play, tolerance and curiosity, loyalty and patriotism that won him the election; it was a defeatist America that cheered the countrys first African-American head of state.        
	To prove bin Laden wrong, the new administration will have to persuade Americans to rediscover the real meaning of America, a project that left Bush decimated, Cheney immobile and the 44th president flustered.

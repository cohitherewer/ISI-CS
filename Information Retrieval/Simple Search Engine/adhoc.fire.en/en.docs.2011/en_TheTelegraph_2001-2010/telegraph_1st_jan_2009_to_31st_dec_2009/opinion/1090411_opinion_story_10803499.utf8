	One gets a sense of dj vu on seeing Chandana Hores recent paintings with their thick layers of paint like dollops of cream on the surface of especially rich cake, bright, often jarring, colours and figures either bent with age or pensive with the burden of grief. For her recently-concluded exhibition of paintings and watercolours at The Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre (Recent Works, March 21-April 4), Chandana Hore is in look, style and mood very similar to her earlier show at the same venue. So much so, in fact, that they could easily be mistaken as clones of each other.        
	The painter had lost her eminent father a few years ago, and her mother, the artist, Reba Hore, a day after the opening of this exhibition, and death, or the spectre of death, is ever-present in her paintings. Being the offspring of such eminent and respected artists must be quite bothersome, however easily one may have got along with them in their lifetime. And if one is an artist oneself as well, the pressure is possibly even greater. In keeping with this mood of doom and gloom, faces furrowed with age and sorrow, corpses covered with shrouds, blood-red roses like stigmata, flabby and overweight bodies unable to resist the gravitational pull any longer appear again and again in her paintings like leitmotifs. But Chandana had obviously done these paintings long before her mothers death, so one wonders if she is actually despondent by nature. That may sound unkind but viewers may find these works heavy going.        
	Her flowers, potted plants and cacti, a collection of which could always be seen at their home in Santiniketan, are painted in a different manner altogether. These watercolours in warm, pastel shades, and blooms suggestive of fertilization and of birth and growth, as also of pupa and chrysalis, point to life-giving energies that are at the opposite pole of the intense, inward-looking, somewhat self-obsessed world of her paintings overshadowed by death. As a fellow human being one can sympathize with her sorrow, but wallowing in sadness alone doesnt make much aesthetic sense. And that is what Chandana does here rather self-indulgently. She seems to be unable to break out of the wall she has built around her.        
	Her favourite colours are blue, green, black and violet juxtaposed with striking effect with fiery red, orange and a flaming yellow. These colours may bring to mind a certain post-impressionist artist named van Gogh. Or perhaps even Matisse. But, as the initial reaction to seeing wide swathes of pigments in particularly violent shades locked in a battle with contrasting colours wears off in a couple of seconds time, one realizes that her painterly skills have not developed much since her last exhibition. She begins with impasto and winds up with it as well, and this heavyweight technique can have the deleterious effect of suffocating viewers. Viewing these paintings twice, as it were, is an oppressive experience.        
	Chandana writes about her work being about women, female longings and frustrations, and also about bondings and sensuous friendships. Seemingly genderless beings sit in close proximity with similarly neutered persons. Babushkas (how did they appear in her frame of things, however well travelled she may be?) complete with headscarves sit in passive anticipation of nothing in particular. Once again these tired figures inevitably bring back to mind the women in Arpita Singhs superb paintings without their corresponding richness of associations and wealth of visual information. These figures are just vast, bloated and amorphous in their jelly-like profusion.        
	The lightness of being in her transparent watercolours can indeed be unbearable  at least, at times. With the exception of the blooms, here again world-weary faces recur in shades of jaundice yellow and black touched with red, the colours running into each other. Death and intense grief can have an ennobling effect on certain artists. Here the only fallout is boredom.

                              Word play        
	 They love him, they love him not. Although the Bharatiya Janata Party has dissociated itself from all that Varun Gandhi had to say one sunny afternoon in Banderkheda, the party is yet to make up its mind about dumping him as its candidate from Pilibhit. And this is not entirely because of the moral compunctions the party may have about abandoning a young man whose memories of abandonment by his own illustrious parivar may still be quite strong. The party actually is not too sure of the fallout within the BJP itself, now that Varuns stocks seem to be steadily rising among the party rank and file. There is already a clamour for Varun to be a campaigner in states like Gujarat, Karnataka and Jharkhand. The party may be uncomfortable with the brazenness of Varuns kind with days left for the polls but the old, wise RSS men at Jhandewalan may not be feeling the same way.                
	 PA Sangma is one more wannabe kingmaker. The former Speaker from Meghalaya may be tight-lipped about his plans, but his mission does not seem to be very different from Prakash Karats or LK Advanis. Like them, he too wants to stop the return of a Congress-led coalition. Sangma is said to have met both Advani and Karat. The latter reportedly urged him to return to the national political scene and contest the Lok Sabha elections. Sangma is currently an MLA, while his daughter is an MP from Tura. Significantly, Sangmas scheme of things does not include the Nationalist Congress Partys boss, Sharad Pawar, another aspirant for the big chair.                            
	 The Left is already doing wonders for Mayavati. Left leaders went for her dinner party and came back highly impressed. The Dalit queen is supposed to have kept them entertained with stories of how she has controlled the Yadavs, the mafia and also about her ascendancy to power. These were heard in rapt attention. Nowadays, these tales are narrated over the phone to anyone who calls up the leftists.                            
	 In the cool climes of Jammu and Kashmir, things are once again warming up fast. Omar Abdullah is reported to have been put on notice by the Centre for his style of functioning. This followed complaints by senior bureaucrats about the CMs absence from office. Files are said to be piling up and decisions are being delayed. The army is also not too happy with the CM after he ordered an inquiry against the Rashtriya Rifles after the firing incident in Sopore. Given that Omars success or failure has far-reaching consequences for the Congress crown prince, Rahul Gandhi, the UPA is obviously not taking any chances.                             
	 Its a story about the triumph of the human spirit. It is also a chronicle of the unique way in which a woman reacted to tragedy. In Bachiyan village in the district of Satna, young Prabhat Kumari appeared for her Class XII examinations. There is nothing exceptional about this, except for the fact that Kumari appeared for her examinations barely 24 hours after nine of her relatives were burnt alive by dacoits. Kumari escaped their fate because she was not present at home when the dacoits attacked. She has stated that she wants to get into the police service after her graduation  a response refreshingly different from those of others in a region where matters are usually settled by the gun.                             
	 Narendra Modi is supposed to have made the two titans in the BJP kiss and make up, but there is no doubt that the rift is a sign of troubled times ahead for the party. Part of this may be caused by the insecurities of the party president, Rajnath Singh, who has been in the quest for a group to call his own ever since he found himself catapulted to the party chiefs chair. The meteoric rise of Sudhanshu Mittal was the result of this insecurity. Mittals hold is supposed to have been strong enough to assure party tickets to those whose candidatures were severely objected to by the rank and file. Singh and the partys rootless gen-sec, Venkaiah Naidu, may promise more trouble. Then there is also the unresolved issue between the Karnataka CM, BS Yeddyurappa, and Advani loyalist, Ananth Kumar, which even LK Advani has given up on.              
	 If the seat matters, so does the seating. This seems to be particularly true of the Bahujan Samaj Party where the seating arrangement of party members often reflect their clout or its absence. From this one indicator, it is apparent that the BSP leader, Satish Mishra, is not doing too well. Mishra has been the architect of the partys Brahmin-Dalit social alliance, which is now the bedrock of BSP power. But all that is in the past. Mishra, who used to be seated next to Mayavati  a rare spectacle given that behenji seldom allows anyone to sit next to her  was relegated to a chair behind her immediately after losing the Bhadohi seat.      
	Though he continues to sit on the podium, Mishras chair is now placed some distance away from that of the UP queen. The buzz is that if he fails to deliver in the Lok Sabha elections, he might soon find himself deprived of the honour of sharing the podium as well.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | An irreverent footnote to history
                                                                                                                 AN IRREVERENT FOOTNOTE TO HISTORY                                                      At the centre of things                      
	MY CHINA DIARY 1956-88 By K. Natwar Singh, Rupa, Rs 395              
	A combination of anecdotage and self-importance usually makes the memoirs of Indian dignitaries tiresome reading. K. Natwar Singhs personal account of happenings in China between 1956 and 1988 makes a refreshing change. He admits endearingly that he liked being at the centre of things even when he just took notes, and the reader relishes a voyeurs satisfaction as the author rubs shoulders with the great, observes their foibles, records what they say and do, and passes his own dry comments.        
	The book is in three sections, each with a prefatory note. The first, covering the years 1956-58, is a record of Natwar Singhs posting as a junior official in Indias Beijing embassy. He kept a diary and though one suspects its been touched up with the benefit of hindsight, most entries indicate contemporary spontaneity. The second section describes Zhou Enlais six-day visit to India in April 1960, and meetings with Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, Govind Ballabh Pant, R.K. Nehru and Morarji Desai. Zhous tte--tte with Jawaharlal Nehru is not included since the author didnt have a ringside seat.        
	The final section covers Rajiv Gandhis visit to China in December 1988, accompanied by a more assured Natwar Singh. He has left the foreign service and joined politics full time, as he had predicted in 1957 he would, and the prime ministers youth and inexperience add to his confidence. He describes Gandhis meetings with Chinas great, especially the all-powerful Deng Xiaoping, who treated Indias leader with paternalistic indulgence. Theres a ring of authenticity about Gandhis uncharitable dismissal of P.V. Narasimha Rao as negative, indecisive and uncommunicative. Natwar adds that Narasimha Rao must have had a powerful horoscope to scale the heights he did and admits trying to scuttle the future prime ministers career with a governorship.        
	Another luminary he quashed was General K.S. Sundarji who had a rather exaggerated opinion of his military worth and announced rather nonchalantly that India could take on Pakistan and China simultaneously. While even Gandhi listened in stupefied silence, Natwar looked the army chief in the eye and said, General, in 1962 we had Krishna Menon to sacrifice. In 1986, whom do we sacrifice, you or the prime minister?        
	Natwar sees the 1988 trip in the same light as Richard Nixons visit in 1972 which, according to Margaret Macmillan in Nixon and Mao, changed the world. Gandhis visit broke the ice, true, but far from changing the world didnt resolve the Sino-Indian dispute. Perhaps it could have. Bearing in mind that Zhou had offered de facto acceptance of the McMahon Line in 1960 and that Deng favoured economic cooperation, Natwar claims he advised Gandhi to push through a new parliamentary resolution to pave the way to a Sino-Indian agreement. This is a very good idea, Natwar, the prime minister responded enthusiastically. We have two months. You take charge of it. We are not told why nothing happened.        
	The diarists eye for detail, his gift of the bon mot and pungent wit make the book an easy read despite appalling howlers in the Endnotes. When the Chinese clapped all through a Soviet circus that was good only in patches, he comments dryly, I suppose it helped them keep warm. Of the many British diplomats, he says, punning on Longfellows Psalm of Life, that they are looking before and after and pinning for what is not. He even endows D.K. Baruah with his own mischievous humour. When his Chinese guide pointed out the Western Hills, the author of Indira is India, India is Indira asked innocently, Before or after liberation? When Radhakrishnan tells Mao that socialism will become democratic and humanistic under him, Natwar mutters, Hope springs eternal.        
	Some might complain the diary could have been witness to history like the accounts of Nehruvian India by Australias Walter Crocker and the Canadian, Escott Reid. But as Natwar confesses, Hindus have no sense of history. Despite claiming to be the only member of Gandhis entourage to know anything about China (which doesnt speak highly of South Block), he also says flatly, I do not understand dialectics. Natwar likes the Chinese but not their system. He provides instead a footnote to history that may be slight but is all the more perceptive for its irreverence.                          SUNANDA K. DATTA-RAY

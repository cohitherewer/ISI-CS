The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Bring on the donors
                                                                                                                 BRING ON THE DONORS                                  The amendments to the Transplantation of Human Organs Act promise to increase the pool of organs available for transplant. But will it root out the illegal trade in organs, asks Devlina Ganguly                          BORN AGAIN: Both these children have undergone liver transplants                                   
	Last year, Amit Kumar, a Gurgaon-based doctor, was charged with having performed more than 500 illegal kidney transplant surgeries over a decade. Kumar used to hoodwink poor patients into parting with their organs and transplant them in his rich patients. The shocking exposure raised serious questions about the effectiveness of the Transplantation of Human Organs Act, 1994, which, among other things, sought to curb the illegal trade in organs.        
	Last month, the Union law ministry finally cleared the long pending amendments to the Transplantation of Human Organs Act, raising hopes that the new provisions would go a long way in addressing the shortcomings of the existing Act and also contain the rampant illegal trade in human organs.        
	Experts point out that the Transplantation of Human Organs Act, 1994, had failed on many counts. Says A. Gopal Kishan, president of the Hyderabad-based Indian Society of Organ Transplantation, It limited the number of donors by inserting certain clauses as to who could donate an organ to whom. This caused an acute discrepancy between demand and supply. For instance, though almost 1,50,000 kidney transplants are required in our country annually, we can barely procure 10,000 kidneys for transplants. This shortage gives a stimulus to the unholy nexus dealing in illegal organ transplants.        
	The original Act specified that first relatives (father, mother, brother, sister, son, daughter and wife of a patient) could donate organs without obtaining permission from the government. The amendments will now make it possible for a second degree relative such as a grandparent, grandchild, uncle, aunt, nephew, niece, half sibling and so on, to donate an organ without having to obtain the governments permission to do so.        
	Incidentally, each state has an authorisation committee under the ministry of health and family welfare that grants permission for organ donation between unrelated persons.        
	The amendments will also legalise the swapping of vital organs between willing but incompatible donors. Under this system, when a donors organ is not compatible with his own relative but is suitable for another person needing an organ transplant, two families, unknown to each other, can exchange organs between them.        
	Medical practitioners agree that this is a vast improvement on the previous Act. Dr Sadiq S. Sikora, head of the department, surgical gastroenterology, Manipal Hospital, Bangalore, points out, The existing Act made it difficult to utilise the scope of organ donation to the fullest. The inclusion of second degree relatives will increase the pool of donors, so there will be no need to resort to illegal means to procure an organ.        
	However, others point out that though these amendments will theoretically increase the pool of organs available for transplant, the numbers may not be big enough to curb the illegal trade in organs significantly. Says Dr Debasish Banerjee, consultant kidney and liver transplant surgeon, AMRI, Calcutta, The amendments are focused more on cadaver transplants. One should remember that they do not really focus on stopping the illegal organ trade.              
	The amendments do make a serious effort to tap organs from cadavers or brain dead patients. For instance, it will now become mandatory for all intensive care units in hospitals to maintain a record of patients who are brain dead, so that their families can be approached for organ donation. Kishan goes a step further, The government should set up a body to see how many brain dead patients can be harvested at any give time. We should emulate the organ transplant system that is followed in Spain where every corpse can be tapped for organs unless the person had expressly forbidden it.        
	Agrees AMRIs Dr Banerjee, It would help if India adopted the concept of presumed consent as practised in countries like Spain and the Philippines. Under this, a deceased or brain dead person is classified as a potential donor in the absence of explicit opposition to organ donation before death. The implementation of presumed consent has led to a highly successful organ transplant programme in Spain.        
	Of course, adopting a similar programme in India may not be easy. As Dr Banerjee explains, In Spain, healthcare is mostly provided by the government. So if a person avails of government services, he or she has an obligation to give something back to society. But in India the private sector is the dominant player in medical services. However, the government could introduce this model in a few centrally run health institutes and, depending on the response, other government hospitals could follow suit.        
	Of course, the entire issue of organ transplants is fraught with socio-legal concerns. Says Calcutta High Court advocate Amjad Ali Sardar, Seen from another angle, cadaver transplant is an encroachment on a persons basic fundamental right. An individual is the master of his or her organs and it would be an offence to take out his or her organs at a time when he or she is in no position to agree if the procedure should take place.              
	The amendments have also made the punishment for illegal trade in organs stiffer. Section 18 (1) of the existing Act states, Any person who renders his services to or at any hospital and who, for purposes of transplantation, conducts, associates with, or helps in any manner in, the removal of any human organ without authority, shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to five years and with a fine which may extend to Rs 10,000. The amendments, on the other hand, propose that those involved in the trade, including doctors, will be punishable with imprisonment of two to seven years and a penalty of Rs 10,000- Rs 20,000.        
	The amendments also provide certain incentives to living donors. They will be entitled to a 50 per cent discount on second class rail travel, lifelong free medical check-ups and care in the hospital where the organ donation took place and get a customised life insurance policy worth Rs 2 lakh.        
	But these moves, welcome though they are, will not meet the acute shortage of organs, says Kishan. The government should take the initiative to start awareness programmes about organ donation. Just as there is a lot of awareness regarding eye or blood donation, a campaign should be undertaken to motivate people to donate organs.        
	That will perhaps be as important as passing a law to facilitate and regularise organ donation in our country.

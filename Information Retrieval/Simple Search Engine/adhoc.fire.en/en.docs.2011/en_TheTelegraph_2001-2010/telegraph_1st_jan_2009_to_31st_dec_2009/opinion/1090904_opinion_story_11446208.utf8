                                                                                                                 LEFT OUT                                                    
	An elected government is one of the few things that the people can call their own. There must be strong enough reasons, therefore, to deprive them of their right to have such a government. The Election Commission has not cared to explain why it left Jharkhand out of the state assembly polls scheduled for next month. The state has been under presidents rule since January this year and the assembly kept in suspended animation. The commissions silence is somewhat intriguing, given the Union home ministers assurance in the last session of Parliament that the polls to the state assembly would be held after the monsoon. Obviously, the commission believes that the situation in the state is not suitable for the polls now. But it should have spelt out the reasons behind its decision for the sake of transparency.         
	What is thus an act of omission on the commissions part has led to an unnecessary political controversy. The state unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party has smelt a Congress conspiracy in the commissions decision and decided to move the Supreme Court. In the Lok Sabha polls in the state, the party handed the Congress a humiliating defeat. The commissions decision to further delay the polls in Jharkhand has prompted the insinuation that it is giving the Congress more time to put its house in order. Of course, the BJPs conspiracy theory may well be a political ploy. The commission and the Centre may have felt that the Maoist challenge makes the Jharkhand polls a special case. There is no doubt that the rebels are the biggest threat to any election in the state. The commission would be absolutely right if it thought that it needed more time to ensure a free and fair poll in Jharkhand. But it needed to dispel any misgiving by explaining its decision. It can, and actually should, do so even now. It does not have to answer politically motivated charges, but it has a duty to assure the people that their democratic right is not being unnecessarily withheld.

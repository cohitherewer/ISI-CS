                                                                                                                 POWER FOR THE YOUNG                                  Malvika Singh                              
	Elections and politics in India have got very convoluted and rather meaningless for the electorate. Pre-poll seat sharing, in what is defined as coalition politics, has been reduced to a charade of changing partners ever so often for personal aggrandizement, with no concern whatsoever for the country, its basic problems, the needs and demands of its layered society, or for working towards providing a basic infrastructure to permit natural development, growth and peace. This peculiar and detrimental mindset has to alter radically and the strange breed of politicians that has perversely held India to ransom with petty politics has to be replaced. The new narrative must be infused with intellectual energy and the challenges need to be taken on with fervour and commitment to deliver the goods and services Indians deserve from their elected representatives.        
	There are endless ironies in our political space that merit simple questions. Has Prakash Karat, for example, been able to vote for a candidate from the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in his constituency? I assume that since he lives in south Delhi, he is registered as a voter there, and south Delhi has never had a Left candidate! Therefore, here is the question  does he vote for the Congress, the Bharatiya Janata Party, for some politically innocuous individual, or not at all? Is he registered as a voter somewhere else where he is not a resident? These are interesting details that are very telling in the larger saga, and they may well be the same for a majority of politicians and strident leaders across the country. Surely, one way of tackling this peculiar syndrome is by ensuring that those professing to be national parties fight each other as distinct entities at the hustings and forge alliances based on ideological commonalities thereafter. This would reduce some of the nonsense that overwhelms and suffocates us with its mindlessness.        
	Old ties        
	Imagine a scenario in Uttar Pradesh where the Youth Congress announces 80 candidates, many unknown to Lucknow and Delhi but residing in the constituency itself and working there, and gets them to fight as best as they can without the help of the political machinery on the ground, using party supporters and the citizens themselves to assist them in campaigns and door-to-door encounters, thereby making the entire experience of electioneering more inclusive. Two things are bound to happen: first, the discredit and public annoyance that come with blatant compromise would get diluted and second, the youth in the party, anonymous and not connected with or dependant on the disconnected, insular heavyweights in the party hierarchy, may just pull off more than 10 seats! Since it cannot get any worse for the Congress in UP, the party should break out of this ridiculous logjam and risk change in both attitude and the selection process of candidates.         
	If there is genuine concern about the political corrosion, it must be accompanied by the acceptance of the possibility of having to sit in the Opposition, and wait for the respect of the people to grow for the party so that it can return to power. Needless to say but important to reaffirm is the fact that the older lot of Congressmen and women cannot bear to give up their lucrative positions. It is this lot that is holding back the party. If the young leaders in the party were to rise and state that they do not want to be identified with opportunist elements who want to misuse the vote banks and the growing vote share of the Congress to kill the party and contest the post themselves, the corrective on the ground would be initiated. People are sick of todays brazenly opportunist coalition politics. There could be a renewal of the Congress if it has the conviction to stall the politicking within its ranks and back the Youth Congress.

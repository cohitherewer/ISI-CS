	Desperately seeking a suitable boy                
	Wedding album (Oxford, Rs 245) by Girish Karnad is a new play in English by one of the masters of modern Indian theatre. The action, in a total departure from Karnads interest in mythology, moves around the life of a family of Saraswat Brahmins settled in Dharwad. The Nadkarnis are trying to get their youngest daughter, Vidula, married to an eligible bachelor from the same community settled in America. The plot is ever-familiar: a dysfunctional mother pottering around the house, a slightly barmy father who behaves like Mr Bennet in Pride and Prejudice, while Vidulas elder sister, Hema, married and settled in Australia, suffers from the hangover of her dismal past. There is a precociously funny neighbourhood boy desperate to make a pass at Hema. Finally, the son of the family, Rohit, is unable to decide between his Christian girlfriend, Isabel, and a prospective Saraswat bride whose father is willing to sponsor his post-wedding education in Germany. There are light moments aplenty as well as disturbing interludes full of dark and unforeseen mysteries.                         
	YOURE HIRED (Penguin, Rs 199) by NASHA FITTER tells you How to get that job and keep it too. If you expect that advice to come in a few magic words, then you are in for disappointment. This is a sizeable volume that begins at the very beginning, with Practical English Grammar, and ends with Professional etiquette. The range of topics covered is baffling but thoughtful: helping those who are likely to say, Hi, myself Jyoti, others who cannot get their verbs to agree with the subject, or those who cannot get their acts together while appearing for job interviews                        
	A NICE QUITE HOLIDAY (Westland, Rs 250) by ADITYA SUDARSHAN is a first novel from a lawyer, and expectedly has a young law clerk as its protagonist. The other characters, no surprise, include a judge, a couple of activists who provide a controversial report on AIDS, and a famous writer who is stabbed to death. The writing is taut though a bit tedious at times for the grim legalese that intrudes into perfectly lucid bits of prose.                        
	CYBURBIA (Little, Brown, Rs 495) by JAMES HARKIN comes with a menacing subtitle: The Dangerous Idea Thats Changing How we Live and Who we Are. This is a fascinating chronicle of how cybernetics  the idea of ourselves as messengers navigating an endless loop of information  has changed the templates of our existence. With his deep absorption in living virtually through networking sites like Facebook, Bebo or MySpace, modern man has forgotten what life was like before the invention of such trendy means of communication. This is a study of how this preoccupation with cyberspace has changed human behaviour profoundly.                                  
	The mysteries of the fortress amp; other stories (NAPL, Rs 225) by Saradindu Bandyopadhyay presents a selection of the authors Byomkesh stories. Translated from the Bengali by Shankar Sen, the collection includes riveting pieces such as The Invisible Triangle, Iron Biscuits and The Crooked Circle. It is easy to get into the collection, given the irresistible brilliance of Saradindus plots, but the same cannot be said of the translation. The English is correct but somewhat stilted, and more often than not inflected by Benglish sentences such as Byomkesh saying, Why? Is there any doubt on that issue? Unfortunately, just as conversations in primly bookish Bengali would sound ludicrous, they would appear equally hilarious in an English that is painstakingly formulated with the help of a grammar manual. This volume comes with some interesting illustrations, though many of them look like weak imitations of the immortal sketches of Feluda made by Satyajit Ray.

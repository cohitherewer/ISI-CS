The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | In a failing State
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        IN A FAILING STATE                                  BONA FIDE - Malvika Singh                              
	Blackmail seems to have become an essential ingredient of politics and political play in India. Wherever you turn, leaders are demanding responses based on fast-unto-death or gun-to-the-head and suchlike. We have taken on the rather unfortunate identity of an anarchic, very loosely governed, rapidly failing State. For a great and resilient civilization to have descended to this level because of a selfish political class is indeed sad.        
	Where is that dedicated and committed national leadership that India could, once upon a time, boast of on the international stage? The tragedy is that the average babu has used this moment of political weakness to tie up his inappropriate political masters in tight and complicated knots. In turn, the masters are content to abdicate their electoral mandate, and hand over responsibility to the babu in return for a productive personal life. Retired babus living off government sinecures, old minds carrying the worst bureaucratic baggage, are also stalling change, blocking all fresh thinking, being unable to operate outside their failed little boxes.        
	We need to be led. Committee baazi  a legitimate way of passing the buck and delaying all decision-making  has killed this country and poisoned the baton that has to be passed to the next generation. When the baton was passed in the early Sixties, it was not polluted. Today it is diseased. Where is the commitment to the national interest? If our leaders and their manipulating advisers are playing spinmasters for both sides of the troubled games, making money on the future of their children, then how can we talk of pride, patriotism and intelligent nationalism? The legacy we are leaving behind is far worse than what we had inherited in 1947. Our own people have betrayed India.                
	Young leaders        
	Dialogue and discussion, give and take, intelligent, well-reasoned, carefully thought-out arguments, and dignified consensus are all fundamental to policy-making and to good, transparent governance. We have lost these socio-political values and therefore, clean ethics. We have become a bungling, crude and corrupt State where probity has no place. Bureaucrats run amok, exploiting all those who work to generate wealth for this country. They have legitimized corrupt practices and their masters  the leaders of modern India  condone their wrong-doings. Indians have had enough of this humiliation. The despicable behaviour of some senior elected representatives, who happen to be sitting in the Opposition benches in Parliament and in some legislative assemblies, have degraded India in the eyes of all Indians.        
	There has been a generation-shift and Indians do not want to be embarrassed by the attitude of their leaders. They want intelligent action and delivery on the ground. They are sick and tired of the old and unacceptable politicking that has besieged us for the last 30 years. The play of politics has to be reversed if we are to become a strong global entity.         
	For India and Indians, the recent speeches in the Lok Sabha on the Babri Masjid debate by P. Chidambaram, Salman Khurshid and Pranab Mukherjee, all from the treasury benches, made one proud of the emphatic and undiluted positions they took. That is contemporary, emerging India. Small wonder then that parochial posturings lost out in the last election. There are lessons to be learned by archaic politicians  India has changed. India wants a leader to bring dignity back to the public domain. India is humiliated with the ongoing shenanigans in Andhra Pradesh on the Telangana issue, most of which is manipulated by operators in Delhi who give warped advice to those who call the shots. We need a strong leader to transcend self-centred and manipulative politicians.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Land question
                                                                                                                 LAND QUESTION                                                    
	Loyalists and debutants both face the same predicament when they try to make new investments in the state of West Bengal. The Tatas discovered much to their embarrassment how difficult it is to overcome opposition to land acquisition in the state. Now it has been revealed that the ITC group cannot proceed with its food processing plant near Sankrail because of problems relating to acquiring the land required for the project. The plight of ITC is very significant because this company is known for its loyalty to the state: despite all the trouble that West Bengal has gone through, ITC has never removed its headquarters from Calcutta. The chairman of ITC, Yogi C. Deveshwar, is justified in his despair and his disappointment. He admitted that the West Bengal government has taken the necessary steps to give the land the company requires, but the land is now under litigation. The entire project is thus held up and its future is, at best, uncertain. It will be very unfortunate if a company the size of ITC with its history of loyalty to West Bengal is forced to take its investments elsewhere. It will mean a loss for West Bengals economy; it will mean no expansion of employment opportunities; and most importantly, it will further reduce the image and credibility of West Bengal as a possible business destination.        
	The political class of West Bengal and sections of the intelligentsia are oblivious of the problems involved in acquiring land for industry in the state. There has to be a general recognition that land has to move away from agriculture to industry, and this land cannot be in areas like Purulia. Land for industry has to enjoy certain locational advantages. It is significant that both Tata Motors and ITC preferred land that was close to Calcutta and to the river. Land in West Bengal for historical reasons is fragmented, and has layers of rights of various kinds. These circumstances make impossible the free operation of a land market. This is one of the principal reasons why business houses need the help of the state government to acquire land for their projects. Increasingly because of litigation and political opposition, it is becoming impossible to get land for industry. Even critical infrastructure projects, like power plants, are getting mired in controversy. If this state of affairs continues, as seems likely, West Bengal will remain economically a backward state. Mr Deveshwars anguish is shared by all those who want to build a better future for West Bengal.

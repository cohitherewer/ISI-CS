                                                                                                                 TALK FOR THE SAKE OF PEACE                                  Bona Fide - Malvika Singh                              
	Television is rightfully obsessed with frequent news and discussions on the growing assaults by Maoists on the State, and these incidents have brought an utterly neglected and ugly reality into sharp focus in the minds of the Indian public. Abject neglect and exploitation of the tribal community have stirred great anger against a State that has not been able to deliver the basics to a vast number of people whose voices have gone unheard and whose grievances remain unaddressed. The policies are faulty, and have been hugely politicized by the various political parties in the Union of India. Every dispensation has been responsible in some way, and should share the blame for the raging violence.        
	Everyone is in agreement as to why things have turned out to be this bad in terms of the exploitation of the people by corrupt governance and of the armed and mindless assaults by the Maoists. Hence, it is imperative that the political parties, activists, human rights institutions and the Maoist leaders and their representatives engage in a dialogue, declare peace and announce their commitment towards change and development. It is not difficult to do this, and there is no other way forward.        
	The intelligentsia have a number of highly skilled individuals  attractive in demeanour and deft in debating convincingly with an eye on scoring brownie points. To watch them in action is unnerving, as they continue to harp on past horrors such as substandard and exclusive governance. Instead of trying to look forward by thinking out-of- the-box and compelling the administration to adopt fresh and radical positions to alleviate the sufferings that we see around us, these privileged activists seem to be stuck in a time warp of their own.         
	Some are calling for the State to announce a ceasefire, although not a bilateral one. In other words, they support the violence and killings as revenge for the failures of the past. There is no attempt on their part to bridge the gap between the government and those who consider themselves to be enemies of the State, nor are they volunteering to lead the dialogue process and disseminate information for the public domain. This is one way to begin building a national, constitutional consensus on contentious issues that plague our polity.                
	Fresh ideas        
	This is not the way to correct errors; nor is this the way to uplift the poor and build an egalitarian society. Times have changed since the early days of the Naxal movement in the 1960s, and so have the responses of another generation of Indians whose beliefs, views and aspirations seem to have become different. They have the time and the energy for setting fresh parameters, thereby changing the mechanisms of governance. But they are unwilling to accept violence or the disruption of everyday life and living, whatever may be the cause. They would rather work to alter the faulty processes and mechanisms, instead of assaulting the State in retaliation to what they believe it has done to them.        
	Ordinary people are sick of violence and political blackmail. They want the basic dignities of living and working to be accessible to them. Successive governments have failed to deliver these amenities, but militancy does not, and cannot, deliver the goods either. That is the plain truth. Therefore, creative and radical ideas are the need of the hour. If all the stakeholders work towards building consensus, issuing a mandate and then putting in place the mechanisms to ensure delivery, things are bound to improve. If there is a collective will, it shall happen. If not, exploitation will continue unabated by another set of players. History has shown that one set of exploiters is replaced by another with the promise of freedom and equality. But they often put their people behind the rigid bars of a doctrine that is followed by the State.

                                                                                                                 MISSION NOT IMPOSSIBLE                          - Britain can draw on its experiences with Iran and advise the US					 					      Sunanda K. Datta-Ray                        Against the iron fist				                                             
	Ayatollah Ali Khamenei may have helped to put the great back into Great Britain, in Anthony Edens memorable words justifying his Suez adventure in 1956. The danger is that this illusion, combined with genuine horror at events in Iran since Mahmoud Ahmadinejads landslide victory on June 12, with Israeli instigation in the background, might provoke another disastrous regime-change mission.        
	The Iranian supreme leaders denunciation of Britain coincided with a series of happenings at home that prompted the admittedly never very restrained Daily Mail to declare that public life is a sewer and nothing will ever get better. It seems unbelievable today that, as prime minister, Harold Macmillan spent an hour every day reading Anthony Trollope and Jane Austen. Or that Clement Attlee held that what politics needed was first of all principle, secondly principle and thirdly principle. That is the noble legacy Gordon Brown is squandering.        
	So many ministers and parliamentarians being caught with their snouts in the trough recalls Kautilyas claim that it is impossible for a man with honey on his tongue not to taste its sweetness. The Mozambique version, as someone remarked, is summed up in a single word, Cabritismo, meaning a goat eats where it is tied up. Cabrito is the word for goat.        
	No fall could be greater for the sceptrd race than to be compared to corrupt Indians and venal Africans and found to be more greedy, grasping and cunning than either. Its back to Clives astonishment at his own moderation. But Clive could claim some achievements. Moreover, he plundered a distant subject race, not his fellow countrymen. Members of parliament are not alone in fiddling expenses. Theres 100 million missing from the London Development Agencys 2012 Olympics budget. And one of Londons deputy mayors has been handed to the police for entertaining his mistress on his corporate credit card.               
	To continue the tale of rapacity, the Prince of Wales has earned himself the sobriquet of Prince of Sales because of his profitable dabbling in real estate at a time of grave national distress. Reportedly, he is cutting down on expenses and will holiday in Scotland instead of Switzerland. His wife wears the same dress more than once, he has installed energy monitors that name and shame employees who waste electricity by forgetting to switch off lights, and his three residences have energy-efficient boilers. The report on his finances released this week suggests, however, that while he has been economizing on private expenditure, his spending at public expense has gone up considerably.        
	Khameneis allegations followed by the expulsion of two British diplomats from Tehran have come as a shot in the arm at a depressing time. Laced into the anger is smug satisfaction that Irans supreme leader considers Britain the most treacherous and the most evil of his countrys Western enemies. Iran also blames the British Broadcasting Corporation (whose Persian language service the British government helped to set up) for the current anti-Ahmadinejad disturbances. Obviously, the Iranians think there is bite still left in the toothless old lion. Their abuse compensates even for the slight of Britain being dubbed Little Satan against the American Great Satan.        
	There is no denying that history gives Britain notorious prominence in Irans political demonology. Hostility goes back to the 19th century when Napoleons excursion into Egypt spurred Britain to secure the route to India. Having first approved of Reza Shahs seizure of the Peacock Throne, the British exiled him in 1941 because he was suspected of being pro-German. The Anglo-Persian Oil Companys interests determined British policy and in 1953 MI6 helped the CIA to overthrow the nationalistic prime minister, Mohammad Mossadeq, who had nationalized oil. In the Sixties and Seventies, the Shah was regarded as a reliable policeman of Western interests and Anthony Parsons, Britains ambassador, reported back as late as 1978 that the monarch was safe. The British commando rescue mission at the embassy in 1980 further embittered relations that had already been soured by Iranian suspicions of British support for Saddam Hussein.         
	Shades of the petulance that changed Harrington Street to Ho Chi Minh Sarani, the Iranians renamed Churchill Avenue in Tehran, where Britains embassy stands, to Bobby Sands Avenue, after the Northern Ireland hunger striker. In 2007, the Iranians seized 15 British sailors accused of trespassing in their waters. Now, the British have blocked nearly 2 billion in Iranian assets. Britains tit-for-tat expulsion of two Iranian diplomats followed.        
	There are fears now that if relations with Iran worsen Britain might call in the European Union and the United States of America. Barack Obama was thought until recently to have been too muted in his references to Iran. His more determined tone coincides with both the escalation in the Anglo-Iranian confrontation and the US Congresss consideration of the Iran Refined Petroleum Act which will punish companies and individuals for dealing with Iranian oil interests.        
	In condemning Irans iron fist and lamenting the searing image of Neda Salehi Agha-Soldan, the female protester who was shot down in the street in Tehran, Obama has also clarified the two points that concern his administration most. First, the threat of Irans nuclear weaponization. Second, the danger of Iran exporting terrorism. The objections may seem valid but evidence to support them can be concocted for political reasons. It has long been clear that there was no substance to the reason George W. Bush advanced to justify invading Iraq in 2003 in defiance of the United Nations. He did not invade because Saddam Hussein violated human rights; he invaded because (so he claimed) Saddam Hussein was building a nuclear bomb.        
	The danger is of the same charge being repeated to justify attacking Iran which has reportedly moved more than $75 billion out of the country because it fears some kind of contingency. Presumably, the inquiry that Brown has commissioned, and which will oblige him and Tony Blair to testify in public as Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice did in the US, will further establish that the Anglo-American alliance perpetrated a fraud on the world by invoking Saddam Husseins non-existent weapons of mass destruction. No wonder Brown, egged on by Blair whose already damaged credibility is even more at stake, was so reluctant to make the inquiry public. He yielded only because so many scandals have weakened his authority.               
	Without being morally vulnerable like Brown, Obama, too, is under pressure, most notably from Israel and its American lobby, to take a more hawkish line towards Iran. Binyamin Netanyahus mocking offer of token statehood to the Palestinians ridicules the US presidents two-state formula. Netanyahu has similarly flouted Obamas call for an end to Jewish settlement in the West Bank. Now, the Israelis are trying to persuade Obama that Iran is guilty even by his own two-point calculation. First, they claim to have evidence of Ahmadinejads nuclear programme; and second, they accuse Iran of supporting terrorists (meaning Israels enemies) in Syria, Lebanon, Gaza and the West Bank. It follows that Khamenei and Ahmadinejad richly deserve Saddam Husseins fate.         
	Khameneis hyperbole exaggerates Britains capacity to shape the course of events. Brown is especially weak because in spite of boasting in a recent interview that he can walk away at any moment from Downing Street and Chequers, he is also desperately anxious to continue as prime minister until after the next election. But he owes it to his country and its historic past to be less supine with the US than his predecessor. Dean Achesons comment about Britain having lost an empire and not yet found a role was unkind and unfair. Britain can draw on its own vast experience to advise restraint on Obama and help save the world from the consequences of Americas refusal to learn from history. Iraq and Afghanistan, where Britains historic footprints are imprinted, are more than enough.       sunandadryahoo.co.in

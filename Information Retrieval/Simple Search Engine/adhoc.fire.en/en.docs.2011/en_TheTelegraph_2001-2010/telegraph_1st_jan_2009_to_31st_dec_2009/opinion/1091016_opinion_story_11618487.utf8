                                                                                                                 FAMILIAR WORRIES RETURN                                  BONA FIDE - MALVIKA SINGH                              
	The brutal assertions of Naxalite-Maoist groups are managing to get the back up of the authority, and their accelerated attacks on the public domain, killing and injuring innocents, are having a huge backlash. Decades ago, there was sympathy for movements that gave a sane and strong voice to the plight of the people and communities that had been marginalized, exploited and neglected by the State. Human-rights groups were emphatic in their support of the cause but governments and their administrations ignored the pleas and demands.         
	Distanced and unheard, the leaders of these movements became more and more militant. To aggravate the growing tension, past home ministers described the volatile reality on the ground as a law and order problem, nothing to worry about. As a result, the war against the State and the democratic framework rapidly escalated and today, the strident militancy and attacks by Naxalite-Maoists on civilians who man state institutions are spinning out of control.        
	Equally, ordinary people, particularly a new generation looking for change, charged by hope in spite of belonging to deprived communities and less-privileged sections of society, are looking for a radical correction by the State, in the form of peace and calm, development and progress. The young are looking for a restoration of civil society sans State exploitation. The time is ripe for a democratic, political leader to reach out and draw in that generation to work out a fresh process and create a new mechanism that will include these hitherto forgotten people in the larger pattern of development. An honest and impassioned reaching out to marginalized tribal communities will have an immediate and possibly positive response. It has to be a joint venture, involving the State, political parties and the people. The challenge to cut down corruption and deliver the basics to the poor can only be met if the players believe in creating an egalitarian society, think out-of-the-box, and grapple with dynamic alternatives of governance.                
	Urgent concerns        
	People want peace and safety, not to be ignored, set apart and have their patience and tolerance tested. The tribal bill, in its existing avatar, did nothing for the communities it was meant to protect. It supported the alienation of these communities from the rest of India by compelling them to be seen as standing apart from the mainstream, dependant on a fair execution of the dole.         
	The hidden wealth of the forests attracts another breed of rapacious merchants looking to further exploit the helpless poor by dangling money for pattas of forestland and ancient, protected trees. The exploitation continues relentlessly, aided and abetted by administrators who turn a blind eye, as the laws mandated to ensure protection are broken with impunity under their watch.         
	The recent scandal, where government officials allegedly took bribes from companies in the US, must be brought to an immediate conclusion. The government needs to make an example of this by dismissing the public servants involved. Inquiries by the CBI could well carry on until the persons involved retire. A complaint like this from the ambassador of India to the prime ministers office needs fast-track investigation and punishment.        
	It is time to initiate correctives. One interesting exercise would be to see how many children of serving bureaucrats are studying in expensive universities abroad. When asked, the answer given is that they are on scholarship. Great to know that every bureaucrats child is of extraordinary intellectual calibre! Lots remain hidden within the sanctum of the inclusive club. Members of this club need to be made accountable. India will arise out of the morass and emerge as an Asian superpower only after its administrators undergo a thorough cleansing process.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Mind the Gap
                                                                                                                 MIND THE GAP                                                          
	It is an appalling fact that out of the 20 ministers (including the prime minister) sworn in on Friday, as many as eight were from the Rajya Sabha. In other words, there are eight ministers in the first round who have not been directly elected by the people. This really does not uphold the fundamental principle of democracy: government of the people, by the people and for the people.        
	The electorate voted for good and stable government and was also emphatic that the Congress party was in the best position to fulfil these two aims. By definition, good and stable government is predicated upon a government based only on merit. This means that the new cabinet of Manmohan Singh should be manned by people who are as committed to good governance as he is and are capable of implementing his vision and policies. The logical expectation from these premises  and these premises follow directly from the verdict of the electorate  is that there should be no compromise in the way ministers are chosen to run the new government. This expectation seems to have been somewhat belied by whatever has come to light about the process of cabinet formation. The first step of the new government appears, alas, to have been a false one.        
	It is clear that only those personalities who have no challengers within the existing hierarchy of the United Progressive Alliance came up before the president to take the oath. Some more ministers will take the oath a few days later. This staggered swearing-in does not present an edifying spectacle because it is evidence that the haggling with the allies is taking a longer time than expected. Yet the Congress is in the unassailable position to dictate terms. It need not  and more importantly, should not  pander to the demands of some of its allies who have fewer than two dozen seats in the 15th Lok Sabha. If the Congress cannot call the shots now, can it ever?        
	There was the expectation that the new government would lay a premium on youth by injecting into itself new blood and fresh ideas. All indications would suggest that no such attempt has been made. There is thus the odd phenomenon of old politicians with a new mandate. The process and criteria of selection suggest that the Congress, despite the confidence the people have reposed in it, has failed to move out of its prevailing mindset. This criticism, admittedly a little harsh, can be undone if the second round of inducting ministers is more decisive and less concerned with pleasing allies. Mr Singh has demonstrated that he can have his way even at the teeth of severe opposition. Brushing away the allies and his own partymens greed for office should come easy to him as he has the support of the people of India. Mr Singh should watch the distance between expectations and delivery.

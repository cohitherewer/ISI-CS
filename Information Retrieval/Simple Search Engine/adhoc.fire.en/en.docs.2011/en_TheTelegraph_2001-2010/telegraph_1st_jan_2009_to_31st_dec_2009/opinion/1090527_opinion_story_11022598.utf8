	A new prime minister may not mean an end to the current spell of Nepals political instability. No one would know this better than Madhav Kumar Nepal, the new incumbent in Kathmandus Singha Durbar. He leads a coalition of 22 parties. Even by the standard of Nepals fractured polity, it may prove to be an awesome task to lead such an unwieldy team. Most of the parties in the coalition have very little in common in terms of ideology or state policy. Obviously, they came together only in order to share power, no matter how uncertain the new governments tenure may be. Also, the controversial circumstances in which Mr Nepals Maoist predecessor, Pushpa Kumar Dahal, had to resign may make things even more difficult for the new prime minister. He will constantly have to face pressures from within his coalition and subversive attempts by the Maoists, who form the largest group in the countrys parliament. The Maoists may not go back to guerrilla warfare, but they can create enough problems for the new government inside parliament and on the streets. They may emerge yet again as the worst threat to peace and stability.        
	Mr Nepal has identified his first two tasks  to carry the peace process forward and draft a new constitution within the stipulated period. Both tasks require a wide political consensus. His coalition may be too big to manage easily. But it reflects the direction in which Nepal will move as a new republic. Democracy and federalism are to be the two pillars of the emerging system. Both are untested tools of state policy in a country that had been ruled by a monarchy for over 250 years. Federalism, in particular, would be truly representative of Nepals ethnic diversity. The rise of small ethnic parties in the past few years indicates the new trend. However, peace and political consensus are essential to this new process of nation-building. Mr Nepal will do well to take his lessons from the Maoist governments failure. Mr Dahals accusation about India being behind his exit is part of the familiar stuff of Nepalese political rhetoric. His brief regime fell because the former guerrilla leader mistook confrontationist politics for state policy. He thus betrayed the mandate the people had given him to bring peace and democracy to Nepal. That remains the mandate for the new prime minister too.

	 In keeping with the glorious tradition of rajneeti, Sharad Pawar, we hear, has decided to pass on the mantle to a family member  his daughter, Supriya Sule. Senior Nationalist Congress leaders have not dismissed the rumour; instead they are losing sleep over it. PA Sangma, Tariq Anwar, Praful Patel and Devi Prasad Tripathi, the founding members of the NCP, have been heard grumbling about serving under Sule, who is far too young and inexperienced. In fact, Ajit, Sharad Pawars nephew and another contender for the post, has not passed muster with these leaders on similar grounds. With Pawars chair seemingly out of reach, they have decided to scout for greener pastures. Sangma has already carved a separate niche for himself in the Northeast. Patel and Anwar have also reportedly sent feelers to the parent party to take them back. Tripathi, perhaps the wisest of the lot, has taken to praising Rahul Gandhi to brighten his chances of returning to the Congress fold. Meanwhile, Ajit and Supriya are also battling each other for the job. Seeing the commotion around him, Pawar might just be tempted to keep his crown.                
	 Residents of Varanasi are on the lookout for Murli Manohar Joshi these days. There is some talk about political activists having approached the police to try and find their man. The reason? Ever since Joshi got elected as a member of parliament, he has not been seen in Varanasi. Bharatiya Janata Party leaders are trying hard to play down the incident by saying that it is the handiwork of disgruntled party workers to embarrass Joshi, who is tied up with his preoccupations in Delhi and in Allahabad. Nontheless, Joshi is unlikely to be pleased with this unholy alliance in a temple town.                            
	 What does the Congress do with its stalwarts who are well past the sell-by date? The party offers them gubernatorial posts, of course. Arjun Singh, Shivraj Patil and Santosh Mohan Dev are some of the names under consideration to fill up the vacancies that are likely to come up in Raj Bhavans across the country. Singh and Patil are, reportedly, unwilling to quit active politics but they have very little say in the matter. Patil is supposedly on his way to West Bengal. Now that might get didis goat, as she is keen to ensure that the current governor gets an extension. As for Singh, he might find himself either in Mumbai or Gandhinagar, and he must be hoping that it is the latter. Unlike Messrs Singh and Patil, Dev will be happy with a Raj Bhavan stint. After his loss in the recent Lok Sabha elections, the poor man has been rendered irrelevant in Assam.      
	Meanwhile, some are saying that the Congress is already cursing itself for pulling out SM Krishna from his quiet perch in Mumbais Raj Bhavan since he has failed to give a good account of himself as the external affairs minister. The party must be hoping that it doesnt come to regret its choice of Singh, Patil and Dev as well.                            
	 The Congresss call to shun royal titles has found few takers among the blue-blooded tribe and their followers. In Bhopal, supporters of Jyotiraditya Scindia found a novel way to beat the high commands orders. Scindia was in Bhopal recently to attend a series of political functions and, sure enough, the customary signs, banners, posters and cut-outs were all there to welcome the royal leader. But what was surprising was that Jyotiradityas name was missing on most of them. The picture  of Jyotiraditya  was supposed to speak more than the words. Titles such as Mister, it was felt, were too modest and hence dropped, and in some of the posters written in Hindi, the enterprising supporters addressed him as Madhavnandan (son of Madhavrao Scindia) to make it sound more reverential. Suresh Pachauri, the state party unit chief, must be wondering if it is time to teach Scindias supporters to be reverential to the high commands diktat for a change.                            
	 The Maharashtra verdict is pending, but Congressmen, taking their cue from exit polls, are already planning to bring back Vilasrao Deshmukh as the CM. But in Haryana, where the party is expected to win as well, Bhupinder Singh Hooda is all set to retain his throne. It seems that Birender Singh and Kiran Chaudhary, leaders who are keen to succeed Hooda, will have to wait awhile.

	 If the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha can have their own dedicated channels, is there any reason for the railways, the single largest employer in the country, not to have one for itself?      
	It is not known what Mamata Banerjees views are on this matter, but a railways advisory committee, packed with Trinamul Congress supporters, has recommended that the railways must start its own television channel to inform and educate countless Indians who travel by train. The Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha channels rely on the public sector for their funding. The advisory board is of the opinion that the railways will be able to bear the cost for such a venture by allocating only a fraction of its revenues. After hearing this bit of news, the cynical-minded must be wondering whats next. An Air India TV perhaps that would give its viewers exclusive coverage of pilots fighting among themselves 30,000 feet above the ground?

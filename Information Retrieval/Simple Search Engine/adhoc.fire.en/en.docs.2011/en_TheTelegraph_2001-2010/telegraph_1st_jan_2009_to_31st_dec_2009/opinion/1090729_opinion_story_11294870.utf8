The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | And, equality for all
                                                                                                                 AND, EQUALITY FOR ALL                              The government will soon bring in a law for the setting up of an Equal Opportunity Commission to fight discrimination against various groups. Shabina Akhtar reports                                                      
	Does your male colleague earn more than you? Have you been a victim of prejudice because of your sexual orientation? Are you being treated differently because of the community you belong to? If yes, help may soon be at hand. The government is planning to set up an Equal Opportunity Commission (EOC) to help redress such discrimination in both the public and private sectors.        
	The Indian Constitution guarantees equality through the Fundamental Rights and the Directive Principles of State Policy. Yet reports of stark inequalities make news every now and then. A recent survey conducted by Madhu Chandra, spokesperson for the North East Support Centre amp; Helpline, Delhi, indicates that 86 per cent of the people from the North East feel discriminated against in their own country.        
	Justice Rajinder Sachar  chairperson of the Sachar Committee which was set up to look into the status of Indias Muslims  noticed similar discrimination against the community. In 2006 he wrote in his report, It is a well accepted maxim in law that not only must justice be done but it must appear to be done. It is in that context that the committee recommends that an Equal Opportunity Commission should be constituted by the government to look into the grievances of the deprived groups.        
	Subsequently, the government accepted the proposal and an expert committee was set up to draft the scope and function of the commission. Now that the draft bill is ready all that remains to be done is to get it passed by an Act of Parliament, says professor emeritus T.K. Oommen, a member of the Sachar Committee.        
	The Equal Opportunity Commission Bill seeks to address discrimination of all kinds. Its primary aim is to create an equality benchmark and code of fair practices for both the public and private sectors, says Javeed Alam, chairman of the Indian Council of Social Science Research, Delhi, and a member of the expert group that helped in drafting the bill.        
	Alam says that the code of fair practices would differ from sector to sector. For instance, the code for educational institutions would be different from that for the housing sector or for the police, he explains.        
	According to the draft bill, the Prime Minister will be the chairman of the EOC. Other members of the commission will include the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, the minister for minority affairs, Opposition leaders from the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha and the chairman of the Rajya Sabha.        
	The bill also proposes equality auditing  where the commission monitors the extent to which its codes are being followed by different sectors. After auditing, a report will be prepared and submitted to the chairman.              
	H owever, despite its laudable objectives, experts point out that the commission will be no more than a toothless entity. Thats because though it will be empowered to probe a case of discrimination and suggest action, it will not have any power to punish offenders. Says Faizan Mustafa, vice-chancellor of the National Law University, Orissa, We need a commission where grievance will be redressed. But this commission is more likely to collect and compile data. It would be merely informing the government about the status and cases of discrimination. I feel this is where the commission is lacking.        
	Besides, as Zoya Hasan, former member of the National Commission for Minorities (NCM), Delhi, points out, In a country with a plethora of commissions, its bound to overlap with the functioning of the existing ones such as the National Commission for Scheduled Castes, the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes or the National Commission for Minorities. Whats the use of a new commission if it is not given a quasi-legal status? I am forced to say that commissions like the NCM are better off, for they can take action if and when required.        
	But the draft committee feels that with the right to issue a suo moto notice, the EOC will not really be powerless. Says Alam, We have deliberately not given the commission quasi-legal status. There are so many commissions with elaborate procedures that are headed by retired judges. Are they of any help? Our aim is to create a statutory body that would be more accessible to the public.        
	Alam points out that since the research team of the EOC will build up a database of discriminatory practices in various sectors and institutions, when an aggrieved group approaches it, the EOC would be able to draw from its database and bolster their case. The EOC, like the Equality and Human Rights Commission of Great Britain, would be making recommendations to the government which would be morally bound to listen, though not legally bound to act on it, adds Alam.        
	While many experts take issue with this very fact  that the government would not be legally bound to act on the commissions recommendations  others worry that the bill is almost becoming synonymous with the ministry of minority affairs. I simply dont understand what the bill is doing in the ministry of minority affairs. After all, this bill is not just for the minorities. It is meant to cover everybody who feels discriminated against  because of their belief, way of living, caste or religion, says Hasan.              
	Salman Khursheed, minister for minority affairs, counters, It is a new concept, so people are bound to have apprehensions. But in the long run it will be beneficial not only for the minority community but also for any section or group that feels discriminated against. We are in discussion with different ministries and commissions to iron out any possible overlap. And once the problems are sorted out, the bill will be tabled in Parliament, hopefully very soon, he adds.        
	Oommen sums up the position, The setting up of the EOC will help us rise above reservation policies. Its time Indias diversity was reflected properly in both the private and public sectors. This will be possible only if the various sections are given an equal opportunity to acquire proper education and decent jobs.        
	Will the Equal Opportunity Commission be a step in that direction? Time, as they say, will tell.

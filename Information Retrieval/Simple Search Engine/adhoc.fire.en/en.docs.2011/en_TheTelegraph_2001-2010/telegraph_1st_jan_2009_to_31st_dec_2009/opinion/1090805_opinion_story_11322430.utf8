	Grannys care        
	A baby whose mother died during childbirth was being brought up by her maternal grandmother. The father applied for custody of the child under the Guardians and Wards Act which recognises the father as the guardian. The grandmother contended that while the child was well cared for with her, the father had a meagre income and had to support an ailing mother. The family court ruled in favour of the grandmother while the High Court of Indore ruled in favour of the father. The grandmother appealed to the Supreme Court. The apex court held that although the Act recognises the father as the guardian, such right is not absolute and courts should give paramount consideration to the welfare of the child. The court appointed the grandmother as the childs natural guardian. (Anjali Kapoor vs Rajiv Bajaj)                           
	Cheque mate        
	 A cheque issued to a man was dishonoured because the amount mentioned in the cheque in figures was Rs 75,000 while that in words was Rs 70,000. The man sent a notice under the Negotiable Instruments Act, claiming Rs 75,000 from the person who issued the cheque. When he still did not pay up, the man filed a complaint under Section 138 of the Act. However, the trial court acquitted the accused. On appeal, the Karnataka High Court dismissed the order of the lower court and referred to the provisions of the Act which states that in case of such discrepancy the amount stated in words should be paid. It directed the accused to pay Rs 80,000 to the appellant as compensation. (Shri N. Hasainar vs Shri M. Hasainar)                     
	Fatal ride        
	 A group of students travelling in a goods vehicle met with an accident. One of them died and the others were injured. The Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal awarded compensation to the family members of the deceased and the amount was upheld by the Punjab and Haryana High Court. The insurance company appealed to the Supreme Court, contending that the compensation was not payable as people should not be travelling in a goods vehicle. The Supreme Court held that as the victims were travelling as gratuitous passengers in the vehicle, the insurance company was not liable to pay any compensation. (National Insurance Co. Ltd vs Rattani)

	Even a few years ago nobody imagined that climate would become a major subject of international negotiations, and that too a controversial one. The problem of carbon emissions and global warming has given a new urgency to all discussions on climate. Climate change across the world caused by carbon emission has linked it to the survival of planet Earth. It cannot be denied anymore that global warming is a direct consequence of industrialization, which is conventionally always equated with progress and modernity. That very process now threatens survival. Western countries, read the developed world, having experienced the benefits of industrialization and enjoying high standards of living and creature comforts have woken up to the adverse effects of industrial development. They are trying to impose stringent restrictions on carbon emissions on the countries of the developing world, especially China and India. These two countries are on the fast track of economic development and are therefore identified as two major sources of environmental pollution. The contention of the West is that if an environmental catastrophe is to be avoided, India and China have to adhere to a low-carbon development path. This was in summary terms one of the messages that Hillary Clinton brought to India. The logic of this position is undeniable but as the government of India has pointed out in all international fora devoted to the issue of climate change, it is utterly unfair and skewed in favour of the Western world.        
	Indias views were most cogently and forcefully put forward by Jairam Ramesh, the environment minister. India, Mr Ramesh said, would not accept any legal restriction on emissions. India has to industrialize fast to lift the standards of living of millions. It cannot, therefore, accept restrictions on carbon emissions; such restrictions would only hinder and slow down its economic development. To compensate, the developed world has to reduce its emissions, and it committed itself to doing this more than ten years ago in Kyoto. There is no sign that this commitment has been met. India cannot be made to suffer because for historical reasons it is a latecomer to industrialization. Yet the stakes are very high. An environmental disaster would make economic development everywhere quite meaningless. A compromise formula that allows India and the West to reduce emissions but at different speeds needs to be found.

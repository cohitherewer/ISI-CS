	Dream come true                  
	Sir  By winning the French Open, Roger Federer has ended the debate as to whether he is indeed the greatest tennis player of all time. Federer is the only person who has reached the finals of all four Grand Slams on at least four occasions. Apart from the French, he had won each of the others at least on three occasions  five consecutive Wimbledons and US Opens, and three Australian Opens. By winning the French Open this year, he has joined a select band of players who have achieved a career slam by winning all the Grand Slams. He is one step ahead of Pete Sampras, who never tasted success on the clay of Roland Garros. But statistics apart, what endears Federer to all is his exemplary sportsmanship. Let us hope he continues to regale us with his craft for some time yet.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Ambar Mallick, Calcutta

                
	Sir  As the report, The greatest? Federer rests his case (June 8), states, comparing greatness is a truly complicated business. But heartiest congratulations to Roger Federer for finally having found the missing piece in his jigsaw puzzle by winning the French Open. There is no doubt that he truly deserved it. Winning a Grand Slam at 27 is an achievement. Tennis is one of the most tiring sports in which age is a major factor behind playing well, and consistently so.           
	However, the French Open final lacked the spark that is expected of any final match. A Roger Federer-Rafael Nadal final would have been classic and the match would most definitely have been pushed to a five-setter. Instead, Federer won in straight sets. Apart from the second set (pushed to a tie-break), there was hardly any competition between Federer and Robin Soderling, and it was mostly a one-sided match. Federers aces and backhands had practically no answer. This makes one wonder if Federer would have won the match with such ease if Nadal had been his opponent.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Roger Federers uncontrolled display of emotions revealed what this title means to the Swiss star. As a runner-up for three consecutive years, the title had eluded him repeatedly. With the exit of his Nemesis, Rafael Nadal, Federer easily triumphed over Robin Soderling. Lately, Federer has been struggling to regain his missing form, he was prone to injuries, and had inconsistent victories. Still, he was beating his opponents in five- or four-setters. It was his tenacity that saw him through this phase.           
	The French Open final proved to be entertaining and had all the ingredients required to make it exciting: threat of rain, a crazy Spanish intruder, and, of course, a quality game of tennis that made Soderling graciously concede to his rival, You really gave me a lesson in how to play tennis.          
	But is Federer the greatest player that the game has ever produced? Answering this would require us to judge players across generations who played under different circumstances. Reaching a conclusion may be tricky, but we can safely say that Federer has entered his name in the pantheon of the tennis greats. Nevertheless, he has now got all four slams and equalled Pete Samprass record of 14 Grand Slams. Sampras was 31 when his tally reached 14; Federer is 27, and hopefully still has a few more big years in his kitty.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Media management          
	Sir  The decision of the Board of Control for Cricket in India to call back Virender Sehwag from the ongoing T20 World Cup was wise and bold. Sehwag has confessed that he was injured in the semi-finals of the Indian Premier League tournament while diving to stop a ball. His injury is best known to him. It is the duty of the team management to see that the players selected are physically fit. It seems that Sehwag had hidden his injury so far which has now been found to be serious. The timely intervention of the media forced the BCCI to take a correct decision. Sehwag may be a very good player, but he cannot take his team out for a ride. An enquiry must be ordered to find out how an unfit player was selected in the first place.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Benu Kumar Bose, Calcutta

                
	Sir  It seems that sections of the media are resorting to false reporting to improve sales and fulfil some hidden agenda. The news of the fight between Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Virender Sehwag that never actually happened is the latest example of this trend. Recently, there were false reports claiming that Mamata Banerjee was trying to bargain for as many cabinet ministries from Manmohan Singh as possible. Before this, the media had given the idea that she had kicked the Tatas out of West Bengal though Banerjee had categorically stated that she had no dispute with the Nano plant. Her only point of contention was the land for ancillary industries. Dhoni has done well by reading out a terse statement to the media and putting all speculations to rest.

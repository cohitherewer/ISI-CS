	Who made those portraits of Rabindranath Tagore and Subhas Chandra Bose that hang in so many private and public rooms in Bengal? And when were they made? The names and dates of the painters or photographers are irrelevant here: these are not the images of art or history, but are icons in every old and new sense of this very old word. So, when Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee held on to his favourite portrait of Tagore in the Writers Buildings against the Election Commissions Off with their heads, he was not only being a man of culture but was also acting on a rather more primal impulse than is expected from a communist chief minister. However secular the figures of Tagore and Bose in Bengals (and Indias) history, the feelings, taboos and rituals associated with their likenesses belong to the realm of the sacred. Walter Benjamin has been proved wrong here: incessant mechanical reproduction has not worn off the aura around these images. They look serenely out of picture-frames, calendars, posters, banners and hoardings; stand atop pedestals in the middle of city-squares and fish-markets; are sold as luridly coloured little statues on rural fairgrounds; or worshipped with incense and garlands on their birthdays and on Independence Day. But when have idols not been part of the most banal of realities in India, managing even to incorporate elements of self-parody within their public augustness? And when has their worship not been part of the rhythm of ordinary life, effortlessly mixing reverence with affectionate familiarity?        
	The ritual of hanging Tagore, Bose and the Mahatma (whom the EC allows) as part of a pan-Indian, ostensibly secular pantheon (though with regional variations in the intensity of feelings directed at the first two) is a uniquely Indian phenomenon. Every other society hangs its pictures in order to invoke a specific political, religious or cultural context. Oxbridge college halls and chapels hang their patrons, dons and alumni, and the portraits are usually centuries old or commissioned works of art by eminent painters. Catholic countries hang the pope, while dictatorships hang their dictators. But it is only the Gurudev, the Netaji and the Mahatma who transcend all contexts. They look down unfazed from their exalted perch upon every kind of human action and inaction (trivial, nefarious or historic), often adding an element of high visual irony to many a bizarre scene unfolding below.        
	So, getting to keep Tagore hanging in his workplace means far more to the chief minister than, say, placing postcard images of Proust, Kafka and Mayakovsky (his other favourites) on his bookshelves. God and Lenin must remain out of the picture altogether. But the need for a spirit of the place who will bless and make good the common dross by being there in no other form but its photographic likeness is too ancient to let go of merely for the sake of modernity.

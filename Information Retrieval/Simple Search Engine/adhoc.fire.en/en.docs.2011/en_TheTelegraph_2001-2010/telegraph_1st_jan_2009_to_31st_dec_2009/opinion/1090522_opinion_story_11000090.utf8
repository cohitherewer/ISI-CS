The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Riding on hope
                                                                                                                 RIDING ON HOPE                                                              
	Black and white, and the implied grey, are the perfect colours for prison. Yet the photographer, Renuka Puri, in documenting the daily lives of the inmates of the womens section in Tihar Jail  IN CUSTODY: WOMEN IN TIHAR (Roli, Rs 395)  found unexpected colour within, emanating from the endurance and liveliness of the prisoners, their sense of community and order, their desire to learn new skills and form friendships, to carry on with their usual rituals, such as Karva Chauth (left), while doing mandatory work in the kitchen, laundry or garden.         
	Taken from the top, an angle favoured by Puri, the picture captures the sense of ordered freedom within confinement that is a remarkable feature of Tihar, the largest prison in southeast Asia famous for its reforms. The text, by Amba Batra Bakshi, is lucid, informative and restrained. Like the pictures, it never spills into melodrama or sentiment as it outlines the daily lives of the women, their relationships with one another and their officers, their hopes and despairs, or the rules they must follow. Crimes are not the object of the writers unassuming sympathy  she only notes that no one admits to guilt. In the Karva Chauth picture, the women sit around a special meal prepared by their peers in the kitchen. Their sense of community is palpable, but the bars through which the lens looks down capture the other, inescapable, reality within.         
	Eighty per cent of the women in Tihar are under-trial prisoners, and of those convicted, 60 are serving life sentences at the time the book was being made in 2003-04. But the old may never see the world outside again. That the wide horizon the prison architecture generously reveals may remain unreachable is tellingly captured by the next picture (clockwise top right). Such a moment of desolation is unusual, for most of the pictures catch the women learning or applying new skills, such as making candles or working in the beauty parlour, chatting in a cell or praying in the barracks, eating, cooking, gathering for a panchayat meeting, even dancing. But the photographs hold the vivid faces and expressive bodies within well-designed but unmistakable bars, doors and locks, or show the women in beautifully laid-out grounds that almost make one forget the high surrounding walls.         
	The most delightful, and most poignant, photographs are of the children who live with their mothers. Tihar has crches run by NGOs where the children obviously have fun, but over their oblivious little lives falls the shadow of bars (clockwise lower right). This is Puri at her best, her black, white and grey creating a moment of light, shadows, architecture and movement that reveals its metaphysical core. Even the personalized space in a cell (clockwise bottom right) is a source of comfort in a life that is both devastating yet riding on hope. The drama is in the face that keeps looking up and out.                     BHASWATI CHAKRAVORTY

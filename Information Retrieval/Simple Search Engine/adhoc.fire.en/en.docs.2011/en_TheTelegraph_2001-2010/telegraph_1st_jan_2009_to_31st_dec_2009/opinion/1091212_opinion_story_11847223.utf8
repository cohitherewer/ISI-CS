The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Not for arts sake
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        NOT FOR ARTS SAKE                              Soumitra Das      Visuals Arts                                                
	The Irish poet, Michael Longley, during his recent visit to Calcutta, said in an interview that a poet is not like a journalist. Contemporary problems are not necessarily grist for a poets mill. He termed some of the poetry written in his own country during the bloody movement over a decade ago, Trouble Trash. One may or may not agree with the poets point of view, but a lot of contemporary art is inspired by crises that are in the news. Deeksha Nath, who curated the exhibition, Astonishment of Being (Oct 31 to Nov 29), wrote the following lines in her catalogue article: In this mood of jubilation that the two worlds denote, we have and must keep our eyes trained on the unresolved, unjust and inhuman, on the faces of evil and the facts of distress. Nath, who is a New Delhi-based critic and curator trained abroad, juxtaposed new media work along with art work of the more traditional variety.        
	Many of the works exhibited in the show were triggered off by the volatile situation prevailing in regions belonging to India, like Kashmir, the terrorist threat, and other problems that beset the country. But contemporaneity notwithstanding, the works she put on the exhibition cannot by a long shot be written off as Trouble Trash. On the other hand, it was a well-thought-out exhibition, and some of the works, particularly those that took a lateral view of such problems, were of an exceptional quality.        
	The topical ones could not be easily ignored for they used media such as photography and the graphic novel that trendy artists dont give a miss. The focus of the photographs and graphic novella of Malik Sajid, himself a Kashmiri, is the ground reality of his troubled state and its effect on the lives of ordinary people. Agitators, gun-toting policemen in an empty street, anxious crowds, rows of photographs of people lost, and an old man in black inside a beautiful mosque. They are good journalistic exercises but quite commonplace otherwise.        
	They come close to Gauri Gills documentation of Afghani Sikhs in Delhi with which she created an installation. Gills approach is presented as philosophical  photography used within a cultural discourse. It is easy to read such values in a series of images  any series of images. Gills visuals needed to be bolstered by the bittersweet writings of children from this community in Delhi on their memories and thoughts of their homeland. Even if one were to stretch the definition of art to its furthest, would this combination of photographs and text really qualify as art?        
	The same can be said of Malik Sajids graphic novella, Terrorism of Peace (picture). It is no doubt a dramatized version of the ordinary Kashmiris predicament, but its appeal, in spite of some interesting visuals, is more akin to that of a pamphlet or propaganda material. Art and politics can go hand to hand, but art has something more to convey than a single plane of reality. And neither Malik Sajid nor Gauri Gill do that. Hence Prayas Abhinavs video, A Place to Stay, may be about just that  a man travelling all around Mumbai in an autorickshaw looking for somewhere to stay overnight.        
	But it conveys more than it shows  the rich and varied life of a city, for one. While Tushar Joags video, Three Bullets for Gandhi, is crude both in its presentation and reading of the Ashok Stambh. The same artists digital print, The Races, is both a metaphor and a dynamic image of momentum gone berserk. Some of the finest works in this exhibition were the two interactive videos of Vibha Gahotra, infinite in their suggestion of mutability and the persuasive power of illusions to convince us of their reality. Both are magical works, quite as fascinating as Ranbir Kalekas four-channel video titled, Not from here  so grounded in everyday truths, yet exploring the shimmering planes of reality that our imagination can reveal.        
	Artists often turn self-indulgent. Mithu Sens watercolour of a hand with a slashed wrist is a stark and compelling image but the aural work, Back from Fear, is chant-like in its monotony. Ironically, many successful contemporary artists, including some participating in this show, bemoan the reach of the market, seldom admitting that it is the market that created them. Would this exhibition have been possible had the market never existed?

	What if Lal Bahadur Shastri had not died unexpectedly of a heart attack in Tashkent in January 1966? When he was named prime minister in succession to Jawaharlal Nehru, most people thought he could never quite fill those outsized shoes. Shastri was a little man, and also a quiet man. Yet his understated character masked a fierce intelligence, personal integrity, a high degree of political courage, and a vision for Indias future. In his first months in office he shifted his most capable Minister, C. Subramanian, from the steel to the agriculture ministry and helped him lay the seeds of the Green Revolution. He started loosening state controls over the economy, and urged businessmen to be more efficient and innovative. Then, in the next year, he led India bravely  and successfully  in a war forced on us by Pakistan.        
	Shastri was a Gandhian in his personal life, and a Nehruvian in his inclusive idea of India. But he was also his own man, whose actions as Prime Minister in 1964 and 1965 showed that he knew how to consolidate Nehrus policies when required, but depart from them when necessary. His death was a tragedy for his family, for the Congress party and for India. Had he lived another five or ten years, Indias economic surge may have begun in the 1970s itself. Given his interest in agriculture, the surge may have been more inclusive than it has recently been. Had he lived that long, we would not have had the Emergency, or the capture of the once great Congress party by a single family. Nor, given his principled commitment to Hindu-Muslim harmony, would we have had the rise to influence of the Bharatiya Janata Party. Had Shastri not died in 1966, Sanjay Gandhi would have ended life as a failed auto mechanic. And Rajiv Gandhi would still be alive, indulging his passion for photography from his hard-earned Indian Airlines pension, and showing his photos to his loving wife and his non-political children.

	One and only                  
	Sir  The Indian cricket team has created history under the ingenious leadership of Mahendra Singh Dhoni and, expectedly, the accolades are pouring in (India to end year as the No.1 Test team, Dec 7). Despite the criticism that has been directed at him, Dhoni has achieved what former Indian captains could never accomplish. This is a moment to savour for Indian cricket: Sachin Tendulkar remains a symbol of excellence, Virender Sehwag is on a career high, Rahul Dravid has staged a comeback, as has S. Sreesanth, who seems to be on a wicket-taking spree. It has taken India quite sometime to become the leading Test side, but the feat will make the teams critics swallow their own words. Moreover, doubts as to whether Test cricket will survive or not have been put to rest. The interest surrounding the India-Sri Lanka series made it apparent that Test cricket still reigns supreme.          
	This is also a time to acknowledge the contributions of former players such as Sourav Ganguly. Sehwag did just that after winning the Man of the Match and the Man of the Series awards. There is no doubt about the fact that the seeds of success were first planted by Ganguly, who led India to numerous Test victories abroad. The present lot of cricketers should forget their internal differences and realize the importance of the potential that they possess. That way, they will be able to capitalize on their success and maintain the top spot. Experienced former players should help the youngsters with advice and encouragement to ensure that India s glory remains unaffected.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Abhirup Bhunia, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  The Indian cricket team led by Mahendra Singh Dhoni should be congratulated for becoming the number one team in Test cricket. This is in addition to the fact that the Men in Blue are one of the top- ranking teams in limited overs cricket. The national cricket teams recent achievements have been certainly praiseworthy. Not since the heyday of hockey has India managed to occupy the top slot in a team sport. Hopefully, India will remain at the pinnacle of success for long, just like the great West Indian and Australian teams of the past.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Vasan Nair, Edappal, Kerala

                
	Sir  Mahendra Singh Dhoni deserves praise for having led the Indian team to the summit in Test cricket. In doing so, India has broken the hegemony of countries like Australia over the top ranking in the longer version of the game. This is indeed a refreshing development. The only area of concern that remains is the Indian teams fielding standards. Indian cricketers need to improve in this aspect if they are to preserve their status as the numero uno Test side. The real challenge for India would be to hold on to its current ranking. For that to happen, the team will need to win more regularly overseas, especially in places such as Australia, South Africa and England. Otherwise, Indias stint at the top of world rankings will be short lived. Even as we praise the efforts of the current team, we must not forget the contributions made by players such as Sourav Ganguly and Anil Kumble who have moulded the team into a formidable unit.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The much-awaited dream of becoming the number one side in Test cricket came true after India beat Sri Lanka and achieved a historic win in Mumbai. Though the Sri Lankan captain tried his best to stand in the way of Indias victory, Zaheer Khan took his wicket and then helped the Indian side to polish off the Lankan tail. There is no doubt that the victory was the result of a team effort. However, it is a pity that Indian fans will not be able to see much of Tendulkar, Dravid and Laxman in action in Test matches this season because of the way the itinerary has been scheduled.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Ashish Kr. Mohanty, Kalahandi, Odisha

                
	Sir  L.K. Sahis article, Process, now respectable (Dec 7), fails to acknowledge one of the critical components that have helped India become the best Test team in the world  the selectors of the Indian cricket team. Kiran More had done a commendable job, and his good work was carried forward by Dilip Vengsarkar and K. Srikkanth. Greg Chappell may have been in favour of dropping Sourav Ganguly, but it was Chappell who laid the foundation of a process in which the stature of a player was less important than his current form. Sahi is too miserly in his praise for Dhoni as well. He only credits him for remaining faithful to the process that had been established earlier by Ganguly. Sahi goes on to write, Dhoni, therefore, largely inherited a team which was solid on a lot of fronts and didnt lack ambition. He says that except three players in the current team, everyone else had played under Ganguly. Would Sahi care to explain why did then Ganguly not achieve the kind of success Dhoni has tasted? Perhaps Sahi must learn to give credit to Dhoni when it is due.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Mukesh Prasad, Jamshedpur

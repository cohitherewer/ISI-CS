The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Crushed By The Rule of Law
                                                                                                                 CRUSHED BY THE RULE OF LAW                                  Neha Sahay                              
	For six years, Zhang had worked as the personal driver of a foreign executive. Young, smart and friendly, he spoke better English than most Chinese, most of it self-taught. Unlike others in the factory, he wasnt a migrant. Born in the city, he was a godsend to the foreigner, more so because he was always eager to show the latter around.         
	Though hesitant to encroach upon Zhangs spare time, the foreigner found he often had to  when the power or water supply to his house suddenly vanished or when his refrigerator stopped working. Only Zhang could find out from the colonys security men the reason for the disruption and call the mechanic. Even when the foreigner learnt to speak Chinese, he couldnt understand what the mechanic said.        
	The driver was indispensable in other ways too. When the boss had an accident, Zhang not only rushed him to hospital, but, as the former lay at home, immobilized for a fortnight, he also cooked and shopped for him. Wanting to explore nearby cities, the boss asked Zhang for directions. You wont be able to find your way around; what will you tell the taxi driver? replied Zhang, offering to take him there. Many a weekend was spent exploring the region under Zhangs guidance; he even went on a week-long road trip with the family.                
	Shared bond        
	Thus, whether the boss was by himself or with his family, Zhang became an inseparable part of their lives. Unlike many Chinese, he was always game to try new food: so, after a long days sightseeing, they never had to hesitate while deciding where to eat. When Chinese food had to be tried out, it was imperative to have him around. In fact, initially, eating out without Zhang was tough, for the bosss daughter was vegetarian  a rare species in China  for whom special instructions had to be given to the Chinese-speaking restaurant staff. Zhang often took them out for dinner, specially on his bosss birthday or on Chinese New Year.        
	Why was Zhang still single, the boss would wonder. The way he talked about his parents and siblings, it was apparent that his was a close-knit family, but they were not dependent on him. Towards the end of the six years, occasionally, a female voice would answer his phone on weekends, and when asked if he was free for dinner, instead of saying, Ya, no problem, he would nod and immediately phone someone. At last Zhangs got a girlfriend, the boss thought.                
	Only once         
	A few months after the foreigner left the city for another job, he returned with his family on a holiday. Zhang again became a part of their lives. On the eve of their departure, he invited them for dinner at his home. In all these years, Zhang had never called them over, though hed pointed out his house to them. That evening, as the door was opened by a woman, Zhang introduced her: My wife. And this, he said, pointing to the little boy hiding behind her, is my son.        
	Zhang had been married almost as long as theyd known him, they realized with shock. The boss asked him why, guilt-ridden at having kept Zhang apart from his family so often. Because I want another child, Zhang answered. If he made his intentions public, hed have to pay a stiff penalty under Chinas one-child policy. So, he had waited till his boss left his city, and he left the factory, before letting his secret be known. His wife had gone to her village for the delivery. His sons birth had been registered there. The second child would be delivered in the city, and that would be the only birth registered there. Zhang, who never swore, smoked or broke a traffic rule, had decided like so many of his compatriots that the single-child rule was the one law he would disobey.

                                                                                                                 OLD FRIENDS                                                    
	Ones friends enemy is not necessarily ones enemy. In fact, he can be a good friend. The Tamil Nadu chief minister threw light on this fact while talking about V. Prabhakaran, the leader of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, in a recent television interview. Since M. Karunanidhis friend happens to be the sworn enemy of his political ally at the Centre, and since he has himself done his best in recent years to disown this friend, the comment has raised eyebrows. Although Mr Karunanidhi has tried to temper his observation by condemning the LTTE as a terror group in a subsequent TV interview, it is unlikely that ruffled feathers will settle on their own. Not that Mr Karunanidhi cares particularly about that. His sole aim now is to secure his home turf, not the government at the Centre. But without his key allies, he has become somewhat dependent on the Congress to trump his political opponents who rely on the same friendship he alludes to in order to defeat him.         
	Seen from Mr Karunanidhis perspective, this is unfortunate. He had certainly tried to play down his relations with the LTTE following Rajiv Gandhis assassination. But he has never been as critical of its actions as has been his chief political adversary, J. Jayalalithaa, who has significantly altered her tune over the past few months to keep up with the rising emotional tempo over the Sinhala-Tamil issue. Given the stakes, it is but natural for Mr Karunanidhi to change tack. The rediscovery of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagams friendship with the LTTE holds multiple promises for the party. It can deflate the opposition bogey and distract attention from the governments failures in domestic issues like power. Mr Karunanidhi needs to hold on to the reins till 2011, when the state goes to the assembly polls. His teasing reference to his ties with the LTTE shows his willingness to risk estrangement with the Congress if the alliance becomes a millstone round his neck.

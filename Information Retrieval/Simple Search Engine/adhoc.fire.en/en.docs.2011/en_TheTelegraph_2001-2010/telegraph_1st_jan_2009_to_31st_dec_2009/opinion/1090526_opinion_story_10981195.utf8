	Other half                   
	Sir  In his article, Two sides to democracy (May 23), Ramachandra Guha has expressed satisfaction over an election conducted honestly and won fairly. At the same time, he has made no bones about the atrocities committed by the police and the paramilitary during an early-morning crackdown on a Gandhian ashram in the interiors of Chhattisgarh on May 17. The heroic guardians of the law gave the sleeping social workers an hours time to pack their belongings. Then they razed the ashram to the ground with the help of the bulldozers sent for that purpose. By the time the whole of India came to know about the results of the critically important Lok Sabha elections, the ashram had been destroyed in a ruthless travesty of the ideals of M.K. Gandhi.          
	Guha rues the destruction of the beautiful ashram in Dantewada and of the humanitarian efforts of its founder, Himanshu, and his co-workers among the tribals of the district. With a civil war going on between the Maoist revolutionaries and the state-sponsored vigilante group, Salwa Judum, the times are indeed dangerous in Dantewada. The fallout of the civil war has predictably been terrible, with more than 50,000 tribals in Dantewada uprooted from their homes. Some of them left on their own while others were forcibly displaced either by the Salwa Judum or by the Maoists. Himanshu and the other members of the Vanvasi Chetna Ashram were trying to rehabilitate the displaced tribals and earned the ire of the state administration in the process.           
	The high-handedness of the administration was proved not only by the demolition of the ashram but also by the way one of the witnesses to the incident  a visiting student from the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore  was tortured by the police when he protested. The budding talent from one of the countrys most prestigious institutes was made to confess under duress that Himanshu was a Naxalite agent and was running a prostitution racket. For Guha, the destruction of the ashram on the day the election results were declared is symbolic. It points to the fact that India is still a 50-50 democracy. People may vote in large numbers, elect new governments to power, but each administration remains as condemnable as the other in its failure to check corruption. Chhattisgarh testifies to this truth. The violence of the Salwa Judum on the adivasis has been continuing for years. It could not have been so had the Salwa Judum not enjoyed government support. One cannot celebrate democracy when the rights of the people are being trampled upon daily in India. It is a pity that the worlds largest democracy also happens to be a 50-50 democracy, as Guha rightly labels it.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Piled up          
	Sir  One of the biggest problems the citizens of Calcutta are facing today is that posed by the inefficient disposal of solid waste. In near future, this may well take the shape of a catastrophe. On a daily basis, about 4,000 mega tonnes of solid waste are generated by households and institutions, and about one third of it lies uncollected. Piles of garbage not only make for an ugly sight but are also dangerous since they expose people to the risk of inhaling the methane emanating from them.           
	I urge the Calcutta Municipal Corporation and the state government to take immediate steps to tackle this menace. It has been seen that approximately one quarter of the generated waste falls in the category of recyclable waste and the rest is either compostable or inert. Right at the source of generation, the recyclable waste should be put into separate bins and carted away to plants especially constructed for the purpose of recycling. Everyone, from householders, factory-workers to the carriers, must be properly informed about the process. It is also advisable to study the methods being followed by other more advanced cities such as Mumbai, Delhi or Bangalore regarding the disposal of solid waste.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  As the number of vehicles is rising in the city, we are facing serious traffic snarls and jams. The city of Tokyo is criss-crossed by multi-layered flyovers, which make it so much easier for vehicles to move uninterrupted at crossroads without having to wait for signals. We need a lot more flyovers in Calcutta, and at important intersections such as the Rashbehari-S.P. Mukherjee Road crossing. We need a wider bridge than the existing one that connects Salt Lake with the airport. Each evening, there is maddening chaos on that bridge.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  My family and I were treated nastily by one of the public relation officers at the passport office of Calcutta. I believe that almost all the officers in that department are as ill-behaved as the one we had the misfortune to interact with. All of them are so proud of their chairs that they do not care to pay attention to ordinary people like us.          
	On May 20, I, along with my son and wife, went to visit a certain public relation officer in the passport office. Entering his room, I asked for an explanation of the inordinate delay in the renewal of my passport in the politest of terms. The officer asked me to wait outside. I waited patiently for about 30 minutes. Since I was not called back all this while, my wife and I reminded the officer of our presence. To our surprise, the officer said rudely that he would not talk to us. Since we had not committed any mistake, I was utterly baffled at the officers manner. As a common man, I want to ask a simple question. How can an officer be called a public servant if he refuses to serve the public?           
	Yours faithfully,      
Himanish, Durgapur 

                
	Sir  Seats are reserved in private transports for ladies, the elderly and the disabled. But strangely, there are no special seats for children although they are as vulnerable as the groups for which seats are reserved. This discrimination is unjustified.           
	Yours faithfully,

                                                                                                                 IN PAIN                                                    
	Violence is always potentially lethal, and the Supreme Courts strictures about ragging never softened this truth. With the shocking death of the 19-year-old Aman Satya Kachru, a first-year student of Dr Rajendra Prasad Medical College in Himachal Pradesh, allegedly by ragging, the most casual of institutional authorities might be made to see that ragging is a crime that kills. The light-hearted, slightly malicious, even transitorily cruel game of initiating freshers into university life has long turned into vicious bullying by seniors, often with a strong element of political intimidation. The danger of such encounters has been exacerbated by drinking and other forms of substance abuse that are now far commoner than before. The four seniors who beat Kachru up were apparently drunk, according to the victim who had complained to the authorities the day before he died.         
	The most remarkable feature of this tragedy is that the college authorities did nothing after Kachrus complaint. The Supreme Court has insisted that no institution should neglect or ignore a complaint of ragging; on no account should it try to suppress it, or let the accused go without severe punishment if guilt is proven. The four students arrested since Kachrus death had had a complaint lodged against them earlier; they had been let off with a token punishment. Too many institutions ignore the fact that ragging is a mentally and physically violent crime, not a mischievous little game among youngsters who know no better. The anti-ragging law is still hanging fire, but why should ragging need a law to be stopped? The indulgence of the authorities has made ragging  therefore violence that invariably hurts and can also kill  so much a part of the culture of university life that a professors son can allegedly lead his friends to beat up and fatally wound a junior in a college supposed to be producing doctors.

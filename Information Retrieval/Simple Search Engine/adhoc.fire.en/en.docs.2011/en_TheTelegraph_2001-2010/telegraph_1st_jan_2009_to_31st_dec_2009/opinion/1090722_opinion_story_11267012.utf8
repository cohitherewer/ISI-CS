The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | I saw him!   No, I didnt!
                                                                                                                 I saw him!   No, I didnt!
          With witnesses turning hostile in so many criminal cases, is it now time to bring in a proper witness protection programme, asks Devlina Ganguly                          Volte face: Zaheera Sheikh, the key witness in the Best Bakery case, changed her statement several times                                         
	Professor H.S. Sabharwal, head of the political science department of Madhav College, Ujjain, died in 2006 after he was allegedly beaten up by Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) activists over the college union elections. In a shocking turn of events last week, the additional sessions court in Nagpur acquitted the six accused ABVP activists for lack of evidence.        
	Unfortunately, two of the seven main witnesses had turned hostile, refusing to identify any of the accused charged with Sabharwals murder. Komal Singh Senger, the college peon, was the key eyewitness along with Manohar Dodiya, a sports teacher. In fact, it was Senger who had filed an FIR on the case. In the end, though, both witnesses refused to identify the accused and denied what was attributed to them in the charge sheet.        
	The acquittal in the Sabharwal case has once again focused attention on the need to have a system wherein witnesses will not turn hostile with such clockwork regularity. Indeed, whether it was the famous Jessica Lal case, or the Best Bakery case after the Gujarat riots of 2002, the prosecution has often been seriously hobbled because key witnesses have suddenly declined to give evidence for the state.        
	The Supreme Court too recently expressed alarm at the growing trend of witnesses turning hostile in criminal cases, stressing that justice would not prevail until a witness protection mechanism was put in place. In cases involving influential people, the common experience is that witnesses do not come forward because of fear and pressure. The apex court made the observation during a hearing in a case where one Samarvijay Singh of Chhattisgarh had crushed a girl under the wheels of his jeep. Many friends of the victim saw the incident but all of them turned hostile when it came to testifying before the trial court. The plight of the girls who were under pressure depicts the tremendous need for witness protection in our country if criminal justice administration has to be a reality, the two-judge bench said.        
	Section 161(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure gives police officers the power to record statements of witnesses. However, Section 162 protects them from being victimised by police officers who may have influenced or coerced them into giving statements. So during the trial a witness has to restate what he said to the police. If he retracts his earlier statement, which often happens because the person is under pressure to do so, he is termed hostile.        
	So is a new law on witness protection the need of the hour? Says Calcutta High Court counsel Protik Prokash Banerji, The criminal law in India provides for the protection of a witness by ensuring that a person arrested in connection with an offence is granted bail only when the court is satisfied that the latter will not harass potential witnesses. When a person out on bail harasses potential witnesses or tries to intimidate them, the bail may be cancelled.        
	However, once a trial is on, there is no specific law that gives any protection to witnesses, excepting a few sections of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. But even these do not provide physical protection to a witness or his family. Section 151 and Section 152 of the Act protect witnesses from being asked indecent, offensive or insulting questions. In the National Human Rights Commission versus State of Gujarat case, the Supreme Court observed in 2003, No law has yet been enacted, not even a scheme has been framed by the Union of India or by the State Government for giving protection to witnesses.         
	The Law Commission of India also recognises the need for a witness protection programme. In fact, it has recommended that a comprehensive law on witness protection be enacted. The commission has drawn attention to special laws on terrorism like TADA and POTA, which had provisions for protecting the identity and address of witnesses, and suggested that a general law dealing with witness anonymity be implemented.        
	However, legal experts point out that a blanket law on witness protection may not be the best option. Says Dip C. Kabir, criminal lawyer, Calcutta High Court, A rape victim does not need the same kind of protection as do witnesses involved in a case of, say, terrorism. So the degree of protection has to vary from case to case. But Kabir too feels that the onus lies on the executive to set up a mechanism for witness protection.        
	One could, in fact, look to the West in this regard. In the UK the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act, 1994, provides for punishment for the intimidation of witnesses. The US has one of the most well developed witness protection programmes in the world. The government not only arranges to relocate witnesses, it also gives them new identities and employment.        
	Says Banerji, In affluent western countries there is a large budgetary allocation for witness protection programmes. The protection does not end with the trial. It continues for as long as it is necessary  and often for the rest of a persons life. In this country we dont even have proper social security programmes. So setting aside a huge amount of money for witness protection is a bit of a pipe dream.        
	But surely something can be done to provide some basic protection to witnesses? Says Joy Sengupta, criminal lawyer, Calcutta High Court, Funds should be made available to an independent agency (so that there is no bias either towards the accused or the witness) that will provide witness protection. Physically protecting witnesses from harassment or threats requires a complete change of identity not only for the witness but also for his or her family and this involves a lot of money. A witness who fears for his life or that of his loved ones will not come forth and testify if he is not assured of foolproof protection.        
	However, human rights activist Teesta Setalvad of Citizens for Justice and Peace feels that the problem often lies with our law enforcement forces. In many cases, the accused use the police to influence and intimidate witnesses. But do our courts punish them? Even in the Best Bakery case, though Zaheera Sheikh served a prison sentence for perjury, the man who allegedly bribed her escaped any punishment.        
	If India cannot allocate enough resources for a proper witness protection programme, what is the way out? Joydev Chakraborty, former inspector general of police (prisons), says, Witnesses often turn hostile out of a sense of insecurity as the accused released on bail might harm them or their families. From my experience in the police force I can say that speedy trials, where a case is wound up while the accused is still in the lock up, can go a long way in alleviating the fears of witnesses and motivate them to come forward and testify.        
	Clearly, until and unless witnesses can be made to feel secure, many of them will continue to renege on their statements. And the guilty will walk free.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Better safe thansorry
                                                                                                                 BETTER SAFE THAN SORRY                                  Despite the Supreme Court guidelines on safety regulations for schools, few institutions have implemented them. Devlina Ganguly reports                                                DISMAL STATE: Most schools are careless about adopting the necessary safety measures            
	A needless tragedy occurred in Delhi recently when five girls were killed and 27 others seriously injured in a stampede at their school. Heavy rains had flooded the premises of the school and a rumour went around that there was a short circuit somewhere. Panic-stricken children rushed down the narrow staircase in order to get out, and five lives were lost in the ensuing stampede.        
	Of course, this is not the first time that such a tragedy has occurred in an Indian school because of a poor crisis management system. In July 2004 a fire swept through a school in Kumbakonam, Tamil Nadu, killing 93 children. The building caught fire while students were sitting in their thatched-roof classrooms. What made matters worse was that the school had only one small exit.        
	The country does, however, have laws that make it mandatory for schools to implement proper safety regulations. For instance, the Right to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, lays down that a school building has to be an all-weather one (which will withstand extremes of weather) and that there should be barrier-free access to the school.        
	Whats more, in a significant ruling in April 2009, the Supreme Court ordered all government and private schools to instal fire-extinguishing equipment within six months. The apex court also ordered all schools to adhere to the safety measures prescribed in the National Building Code of India in 2005. The code provides detailed instructions on how to construct fire-safe buildings. Tables and drawings set standards for schools in particular, including the number and types of fire extinguishers, the quantity of water necessary for a proper fire fighting system and other safety measures.        
	The ruling came in response to a writ petition filed in the Supreme Court in the aftermath of the Kumbakonam tragedy in 2004. The petition had sought that the state should ensure that a government-certified engineer visits each school at least once in two years and issues a stability certificate if the building is found to be in good condition. It also demanded that schools should restrict the number of students they admit in accordance with the facilities available.        
	At that time the apex court had observed, Flagrant violation of school safety regulations continues in the entire country even four decades after the government pledged to enforce them when a private school building in Madurai caved in, killing 35 school girls and injuring 137.        
	As the stampede in the Delhi school shows, little has changed since then. Following the incident, the Supreme Court came down heavily on the Delhi government and other state governments for their utter disregard for the safety of students. Most schools do not have emergency exits, a two-judge bench said.        
	One of the guidelines set down by the Supreme Court in April this year was that every school should carry out a structural evaluation periodically. However, Malini Bhagat, principal, Mahadevi Birla Girls Higher Secondary School, Calcutta, says, Till date, no external authority has come to inspect our school. We have our own internal body that advises us on the safety guidelines.        
	The Supreme Court had also ordered that regular fire drills be conducted in schools so that students know what to do in case of a fire. But experts point out that even this is not being followed in most schools. Says Shireen Vakil Miller, director, advocacy and policy, Save the Children, an organisation that fights for childrens rights in India, With the exception of some elite private schools, most schools have not undertaken proper safety measures for children. For instance, how often are children required to do fire drills in schools? This should be a mandatory exercise once a term.        
	In the UK, for instance, safety measures in schools are mandatory and the principal is required to inform the board of governors about fire drills, how long they took, and other relevant details.              
	But in our country, despite the Supreme Court guidelines and the safety norms laid down in the Right to Free and Compulsory Education Act, theres been very little effort to implement them. Says Shanta Sinha, chairperson, National Commission for the Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR), The commission has not taken up the issue of safety in schools in terms of physical infrastructure as a policy matter. We tackle the issue only on a case by case basis. But we will certainly have to frame some rules. As of now, though, there is no comprehensive policy on the issue. According to the Right to Education Act, NCPCR is the body entrusted with the responsibility of monitoring the rights of children in schools across the country.        
	Some say that the need of the hour is to make a new law that clearly spells out safety norms for schools and also punitive measures for those who flout them. Says Joy Sengupta, advocate, Calcutta High Court, The judiciary has its limitations. The judges can only interpret existing laws, they cant make new ones. In this case, the legislature has to make some new laws whereby the guidelines will have to be followed by all schools. They should also be penalised if they flout the guidelines. At present, erring schools can only be hauled up for contempt of court.        
	Clearly, it is time the state took stringent action to ensure that at least the Supreme Court guidelines on safety standards in schools are maintained. Otherwise, more young lives may be lost all because we were too callous to keep them safe.

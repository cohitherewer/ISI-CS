	Man behind the mask                  
	Sir  Ashok V. Desais reflections on Narendra Modi, though factually correct, betray the authors inclination towards making a good politician out of the Gujarat chief minister (The education of Modi, March 10). Desai rightly points out that Modi has worked hard to come in the limelight. He fought valiantly against Indira Gandhis Emergency. But then, other politicians too have put up a similar struggle in those dark days. Among them, perhaps the most memorable was Jayaprakash Narayans fight against what he considered Mrs Gandhis unconstitutional orders.          
	Modis active participation in the movement against spiralling prices and inflation in the early 1970s was discredited by the rabid communalism he advocated as a member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. He went on doing this after becoming the chief minister of Gujarat. His move against minority communities in Gujarat has marked him out as one of the most villainous characters in Indian politics. Modi has excelled himself by winning a good name as an efficient administrator who brought progress and stability to the state.          
	The last view, I must point out, is based on lop-sided logic. A calculated government-sponsored pogrom is something to be condemned in the plainest terms. Modi was, in fact, heavily criticized at home and abroad as news of the horrible post-Godhra carnage leaked out. Ironically, he also became the cynosure for many who stand to benefit from his largesse. There is no shying away from the truth that Gujarat has made tremendous strides on the industrial front. At the same time, because of Modis crude Hindutva, the states cultural image has taken a sharp beating. We are all aware of what happened at the M.S. University in Vadodara, of the attack on M.F. Huseins paintings and, most of all, on the activists of the Narmada Bachao Andolan. Anything considered against the Hindutva culture has been subdued in Gujarat with an iron hand. As a good administrator, Modi has to his credit this unenviable success story as well. Nol Coward said: Time is the reef upon which all our frail mystic ships are wrecked. Modi may have made for a good chief minister, but he is a dangerous administrator by any sensible reckoning. Modis religion is never religion for the good of the people. How would industries help if people cannot live to enjoy their fruits?                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Ashok Desai has condemned Narendra Modi for the Gujarat riots of 2002. Secularists always drag in Modis name while talking about the riots, as if the Godhra riots are the only ones that have taken place in post-Independence India. Why should the former be given priority setting aside the far wilder killings in the Bhagalpur and Delhi massacres? Had there been no retaliation by the Hindus of Gujarat to the Godhra killings, it would have been unnatural. It is Modis deft handling of the rioters that prevented further deaths. Had Modi been an accomplice in the Gujarat riots, the toll would have been steeper. Desai claims that Modi decided to teach a lesson to the Muslims. If that were so, then why was there not a mass exodus of Muslims from Gujarat? Even Qutubuddin Ansari, a victim of the riots, who was welcomed by the West Bengal government, ultimately left for Modis Gujarat again. Desai has dubbed Modi as autocratic, but he would surely agree that in a democratic country no autocrat can win an election. And, by the way, most Muslims in Gujarat gave Modis party a thumping victory. Muslims were seen dancing in Sanand and distributing sweets after the Nano project was flagged off successfully. An aggrieved community cannot show this kind of joy in a state where they are oppressed by the government.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  A mans thoughts and actions are often influenced by the circumstances of his life. The same holds true for Narendra Modi. Ashok Desai has deftly traced the events leading to the evolution of the young RSS volunteer into one of the most enigmatic Indian politicians ever. During the Emergency, when the first large-scale criminalization of politics took place, Modi developed a hatred of the so-called First Family of Indian politics. While the Godhra carnage during his tenure was unfortunate, it was not the first of its kind. The victims of the anti-Sikh riots of 1984, of the Partition, or of the communal riots in Kerala and Orissa recently have suffered a fate similar to those scarred by Godhra. It is ironic that apart from Godhra, these other instances do not find much mention in political speeches for reasons that can be best attributed to vote-bank politics. Although Modi himself has denied the charges against him and was given a clean chit by the Nanavati Commission, the ghosts of 2002 refuse to lie quiet in the grave.          
	Whether Modi is evading justice remains to be seen, but there is no denying that at present he is a superb crowd-puller. He has given Gujarat a facelift by making it comparatively corruption-free and investor-friendly. Although Modi is often labelled a capitalist and a ruthless dictator, in him Gujarat has found a leader who can take decisions with the big picture in mind, is progressive and, above all, concerned about the states welfare. Moreover, not a single corruption charge is pending against him  a refreshing deviation from the norm set by his colleagues.           
	Yours faithfully,         Alokananda Bhattacharyya, Guwahati

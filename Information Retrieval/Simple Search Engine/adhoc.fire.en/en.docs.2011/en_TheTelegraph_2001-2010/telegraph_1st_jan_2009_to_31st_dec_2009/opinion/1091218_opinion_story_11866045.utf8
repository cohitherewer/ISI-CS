	Bad prescription                  
	Sir  The West Bengal clinical establishment (registration and regulation) bill, 2009, suffers from some inherent fallacies (Tribunal for private hospital bill cases, Dec 7). The legislation aims to control inflated billing by private medical establishments, including pathology laboratories. But while stating that patients cannot be denied life-saving treatment, the bill gives these institutions the right to recover the cost. Thus, the possibility of inflating bills to absorb costs by clinics cannot be ruled out entirely.          
	Moreover, government hospitals do not fall within the ambit of the bill. The scope of the bill is limited to private hospitals because such establishments are profit-oriented. But the bill does not address the crucial question as to who should bear the cost of treating non-payers. Under the new rules, a private hospital will be allowed to recover the expenses in due course of time. Thus, the hospital will have no option but to pass the expenses accrued in the course of dispensing free treatment on to the poor patients. No one is saying that private establishments should deny life-saving treatment to the needy, especially in emergencies such as road accidents. But the cost of such treatments should be borne by the State, which is obligated to ensure the well-being of citizens.

	Sir  The news reports, Tribunal for private hospital bill cases(Dec 7) and Govt hospitals free to harass (Dec 8), as well as the editorial, Care to care(Dec 9), made for interesting reading. In this context, one is led to wonder whether the proposed tribunal is at all necessary since there are few differences between its clauses and those of the West Bengal Clinical Establishment Act. It must also be remembered that part of the malaise in the healthcare system lies with the accreditation committee, which is responsible for a detailed inquiry before applicant medical establishments are given a fit certificate to apply for a license to the licensing authority. The accreditation committee is also responsible for monitoring private nursing homes in respect of their standards of service. Private nursing homes maintain high standards consistently, but the same cannot be said of government hospitals. This indicates that a lot depends on the efficiency of the accreditation committee, which has to carry out regular checks. Transparency and accountability are crucial if the accreditation committee is to provide a reliable and trustworthy patient-care system.          
	It is true that since the government has been encouraging private participation in healthcare, there has been a mushrooming of private nursing homes and hospitals. There are over a hundred registered nursing homes in West Midnapore. Whether a single one of these is equipped to comply with the numerous, clearly articulated clauses of the West Bengal Clinical Establishment Act remains to be seen. The problem lies in inadequate infrastructure as well as the lack of regulation, and no amount of cosmetic surgery, such as the introduction of a tribunal, can provide a cure.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The new healthcare bill designed to bring justice to patients in West Bengal is an attempt to portray the government in a munificent role. But there is more to it than meets the eye. The new bill proposes to establish a tribunal that would decide on complaints of medical negligence in an expeditious manner. The tribunal would also look into allegations of inflated charges and refusal to treat for lack of payment by private hospitals. The government has claimed that this bill would help the poor find justice against medical malpractice. Ironically, negligence committed by the government hospitals is not within its ambit. The majority of poor patients depend on these hospitals for treatment. The proposed tribunal would be of no use to the poor if they were to become a victim of medical malpractice in such places.          
	The government has also indicated that lapses by doctors in their chambers would remain out of reach of this piece of legislation. One wonders what could be the possible reason behind such a peculiar provision. The bill proposes to put competent people in the tribunal. But the composition of the tribunal is not clear yet. Obviously, persons with medical knowledge should be considered as the most competent to judge complaints related to medical science. But, unfortunately, Indian doctors have mostly been reluctant to opine against delinquent colleagues. The bill states that cases would be disposed of within a period of six months . The Medical Council of India, too, stipulates that such complaints must be looked into by the state medical council within six months. In reality, they are kept pending for years. The people are not likely to be taken in by token gestures. Even if the bill is passed in the assembly, it would have little effect on cases of medical negligence.

  Ashok V. Desai                                          
	Alexander Speir, a cadet under training in the Royal Military College, Marlow, in 1802, was extremely short of money. His father, Archibald, was a rich man in Glasgow, but he had told his son never to get in touch with him because he did not want his wife to know about his 16-year-old illegitimate son, or did not want her to know he was financing Alexander. So Alexander had to write to Walter Logan, a friend of Archibalds father who managed much business for him. Sometimes Logan would send Alexander money. At other times, he would ask Archibald and wait for his answer. Either way, little money arrived, and it came after long entreaties.        
	But a cadet had to be properly dressed; and the marching and riding took a heavy toll on clothes and boots. So Alexander would keep a detailed account of his expenses and send it to Logan from time to time. Often he still did not receive the money. And then the College would close down in vacation, and Alexander had no home to go to. Once his professor took pity on him and took him in. He was so outraged by Alexanders penury that he sent an account of 42 15s 2d to Logan. Of this, the drapers (i.e. tailors) bill came to 14 1s 9d, stockings cost 1 6s, and the shoemaker charged 1 6s 7d. A student in a college could not survive without writing; paper cost 5. Perpetually embarrassed about money and about his father, Alexander was keen to leave Britain and try his luck abroad. But his father told him, through Logan, that he had to study more, and that his handwriting was atrocious.              
	Alexander was a well-behaved and motivated student. That led to two disasters in 1804: in May, he was promoted to corporal, and in July to sergeant. As sergeant, he had to make a round of the rooms every night and make sure that every cadet had folded away his clothes and gone to bed. For that he needed three nightshirts and a flannel dressing gown. He also had to fence, and the thrusts and lunges were hard on underclothes; so he needed four stocking-webbed drawers. His clothes were in such poor shape that in August, his captain wrote to Archibald Speir that upon inspection of Alexanders wardrobes, 7 handkerchiefs and 4 pairs of drawers were found unserviceable or missing.        
	Archibald knew William Elphinstone, a director of the East India Company, on whose recommendation Alexander was enlisted in the Companys army. On 7 March 1805, he left Portsmouth on the sailing ship, Surrey  819 tons, 143ft 11in long, with 6ft 2in headroom between its three decks  for Calcutta. He should have carried 72 calico shirts with him on the voyage since none could be washed on the way; but he had only 48. On arriving in August, he joined the first battalion of the 23rd Bengal Native Infantry as lieutenant.         
	After the East India Company forces took Asirgarh, the last Mahratta bastion, in 1819, much of India came under the Companys domination. It kept in place most of the kings who littered India except when they misbehaved, left its own troops in strategic places to keep the kings under discipline, and appointed officers as residents or political agents  ambassadors to the various states. As an army officer, Speir was political agent successively in Sirohi, Gwalior and Nagpur.         
	Once he had found his feet, Alexander took on a concubine; he did not marry her until 1847, when he was on his deathbed. Amongst the children he had with her, four sons and four daughters survived. The youngest, John Alpine Speirs, was sent to England where he studied in Kings College, London, without taking a degree. He returned to India in 1857 and joined Bray and Co, contractors who were building the Poona-Sholapur railway line for the Great Indian Peninsula Railway. After working for them for seven years, he became an inspector of police in Lucknow. In 1866, he married Rachel, daughter of Joseph and granddaughter of Dr James Short.        
	James Short was a surgeon in the service of the East India Company in the late 18th century. In 1800, he was sent to serve the Bacha (Pasha) of Baghdad. There he married Mary, widow of an Armenian named Carrapet. In 1817, he moved his family from Cawnpore to Lucknow, and sent ahead his 12-year-old daughter Mary, together with his infant son Joseph, in a palanquin. On the way, they encountered Ghaziuddin Hyder, Nawab of Oude, returning from a hunt. Mary got out of the palanquin to watch the Nawab pass by. The Nawab liked her looks, took her with him to Lucknow and married her. Little Mary, suddenly finding herself imprisoned in the Nawabs harem, kept Joseph and brought him up. Joseph grew up as an oriental prince. He had four children by his first wife Jane, three by his second wife Amelia, and eight by five slave girls. Rachel was his daughter born out of an affair with Amelia in 1846; he married Amelia in 1860, after her first wife Jane Huggins had died in 1849 and after many more liaisons.         
	John Alpine Speirs had five children by Rachel, two of whom died in infancy. One of the survivors was John Sleeman Speirs, named after William Sleeman, the legendary law enforcer who pursued and eliminated the Thugs who used to waylay travellers on trunk roads, kill them and rob them till the 1870s. John also had two other sons  Alexander John born to John Alpines sister-in-law out of an affair with John, and William Stephen, born out of an affair with the wife of one of his best friends, Joey Johannes.              
	John Alpine Speirs remained a policeman for only 7 years. He was an Anglo-Indian. The government of Her Majesty, Queen Victoria, took over the government of India from the East India Company in 1857, and began to send pure-blooded British gentlemen to rule India. Half-breeds or Anglo-Indians like John Alpine came to be looked down on; Johns prospects in the police were poor. So he went back to railway-building, and worked on railway lines built in eastern India. He left his children in Lucknow with Amelia, the sister-in-law he had an affair with. Of his children, Alexander John, William Stephen and John Sleeman took law examinations. William became deputy registrar of the court of Oude, Alexander practised in Faizabad, and Sleeman in Moradabad.        
	Sleeman did well as a lawyer, and built a big bungalow named Fairlawns to bring up his five sons and two daughters (all legitimate). He retired in 1940 and went to live in a house in Mussoorie called Silverwood. But by that time, all his children had left for England  even those educated in India. By 1945, he could see the end of British rule coming, and left for England. His son, Lawrence, did physics and worked on rockets in England in World War II. Lawrences son, Malcolm, was intrigued by his familys long tryst with India. He researched it and wrote it up in The Wasikadars of Awadh: A History of Certain Nineteenth-Century Families of Lucknow (Rupa, 2008).

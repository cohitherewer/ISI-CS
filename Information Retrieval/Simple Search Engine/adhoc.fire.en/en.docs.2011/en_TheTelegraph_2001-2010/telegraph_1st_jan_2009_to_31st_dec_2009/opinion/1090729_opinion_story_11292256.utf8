The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | lords of misrule
                                                                                                                 LORDS OF MISRULE                                                    
	Indian politicians are not exactly known for respecting the rule of law. They prefer street battles to politics based on principles, especially when they are in the Opposition. Three separate incidents in three states bare this ugly side of Indian politics. In West Bengal, a Trinamul Congress delegation, which included two Union ministers of state, visited Maoist-dominated Lalgarh, ignoring the state governments request not to visit the place. There is absolutely no scope for any confusion about the purpose of their visit. They hoped to use the visit to embarrass the chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, and his party, the Communist Party of India (Marxist). That both the Union and the state governments are currently fighting the Maoists in the area was of no concern to them. It is quite possible that the visit will encourage not only the Maoists but also other groups in the area that daily disrupt the rule of law there. In Patna, supporters of the Lok Janshakti Party were on the rampage, attacking the police and public property. Leading them was Ram Vilas Paswan, an important member of the last United Progressive Alliance government. In Srinagar, Mehbooba Mufti, an important minister in the previous government in Jammu and Kashmir, turned the floor of the state assembly into a fighting ring.         
	All three incidents involve politicians who hold or have held important public office. Their open defiance of the rule of law is fraught with ominous consequences. If some members of the Union government abet such blatant violations of the law in order to settle political scores, lawlessness will be the order of the day. The TMCs decision to send the team to Lalgarh is particularly distressing because it is a partner in the present Union government. The CPI(M) has done the same thing in the past, but that is no reason why its rivals should emulate such politics. The worrying signal from all three incidents is that politicians of all hues are treating the breaking of the law as a legitimate means in their pursuit of power. As and when they acquire power, their preference for unlawful methods will reflect on their governments. It is futile to expect that power will bring a sense of responsibility for such politicians. Such leaders are the worst enemies of the people. They make the flawed Indian democracy look so much more vulnerable.

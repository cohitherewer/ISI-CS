	Mian ki Malhar is marked as a raga for great artists. I have heard Pandit Ravi Shankar failing to play it satisfactorily and therefore, I suppose, Vijay Koparkar of Pune should not be blamed for not being able to do justice to it in his vilambit khayal at an Evening of Malhars organized by The Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture at the Vivekananda Hall on July 25.        
	Koparkar failed to get the best out of the two nishads (sevenths) and high komal gandhar (flat third) of Mian ki Malhar. After attempts to explore the raga with short phrases led to Sarang-like figures such as Ma Re Sa Ni, he depended on nearly the entire compass of the raga for most movements. This made the raga even smaller. The taankari that started after the high tonic was struck around the 29th minute was tuneful but rather unexceptional. The thunderous gamak and halak taans that evoke the Mian ki Malhar atmosphere were conspicuous by their absence.        
	The opening line of the antara, when it was first sung, sounded straight out Bahar, since the nishads were straight and without the necessary oscillation. It sounded better the second time, although Koparkar lapsed into Bahar once more the third time around. It does, however, go to his credit that he hit the genuine Mian ki Malhar komal gandhar in the tar saptak during the drut ektal khayal he sung next. The taankari sounded much better in this khayal, and in the drut teental tarana as well. He went on to sing a Bhairavi bhajan and a tappa. Gopal Mishra, the tabla accompanist, one of the several, able grandsons of the great Bundi Maharaj of Benaras, warmed up the recital with his excellent rounds that were as artistic as they were skilful.        
	Since the scheduled sarod player of the evening, Narendra Nath Dhar, couldnt get leave from the Bhatkhande Music Institute in Lucknow, the evening opened with a sarod recital by Pratyush Banerjee, who played alap and chartal ki sawari (11 beats) gatkari in Megh and drut teental gatkari in Surat. He played a version of the style percolating down from Radhika Mohan Moitra but shorn of much of its stroke splendour and wit.        
	As Pandit Bhatkhande observed long ago, Raga Megh depends very much on its characteristic gamaks. These disappeared from vocal music after Ustad Amir Khan steamrollered Megh into his somnambular ati vilambit khayal format. The gifted sarod-player can work in enough oscillating meends and gamaks into a Megh recital. If he cannot, he can compensate with thunderous bolkari. Pratyush did none of these. Of course, one cannot blame him because most sarod- and sitar-players treat Megh as a pentatonic scale to fool around with.

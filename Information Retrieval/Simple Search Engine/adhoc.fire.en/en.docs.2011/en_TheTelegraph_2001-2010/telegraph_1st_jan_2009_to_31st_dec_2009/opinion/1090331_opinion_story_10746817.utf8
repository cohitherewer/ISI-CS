                                                                                                                 DIVIDED HOUSE                                                    
	Before they are united, potential election allies usually have little in common. The story of disunity in Assams fledgling third front is therefore not exactly unique. Nothing is common among the parties that are trying to forge a united front against the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party. As in the rest of the country, the front in Assam comprises parties that are fighting each other elsewhere. What is worse is that the communists in Assam have no qualms about allying with parties with narrow, sectarian agendas. No electoral cause in Assam can be greater than the cause of peace and stability in the state. That peace in Assam is still very fragile was underscored once again by the assassination of the editor of a local daily last week. Although there is still no conclusive proof of the identity of the group behind the shocking murder, it clearly shows how insecure life can be for the ordinary Assamese. Unfortunately, political parties in Assam seem to be more interested in seat-sharing exercises than in addressing the issue of peace.         
	In their quest for alliance-making, the parties in Assam, especially of the third front, seem to rely heavily on ethnic equations. That explains why the communists have parties such as the Bodoland Peoples Progressive Front in the third front. It is perfectly possible that the Bodos have their loyalties divided among several parties. The important thing for the parties, however, is to foster unity, and not disunity, among different ethnic groups. Amity among different ethnic groups is not  and should not be  an election issue. Assam has paid a heavy price for mutual distrust among these groups. No parties can afford to hope to secure seats in the Lok Sabha at the expense of ethnic harmony. For the democratic process in Assam will be a casualty if ethnic mistrust is the price of electoral gains. This is a mission that should cut across political differences. Democratic politics can work in Assam only if the states multi-ethnic social fabric survives.

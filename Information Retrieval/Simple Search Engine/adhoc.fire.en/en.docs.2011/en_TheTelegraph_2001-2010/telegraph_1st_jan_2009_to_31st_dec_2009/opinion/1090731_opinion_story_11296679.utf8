	A life lived behind the camera                 
	Mrinal Sen: Sixty years in search of cinema (HarperCollins, Rs 399) by Dipankar Mukhopadhyay is an ambitious book that traces Sens evolution as a film-maker against the backdrop of his life and times. Unlike the other books penned on Sen, this revised version of the original biography (The Maverick Maestro) is neither a treatise on film theory, nor a collection of articles. Here, Mukhopadhyay provides a detailed account of the various stages of Sens life: from his fruitful association with the IPTA, the early struggle and ultimate success (Bhuvan Shome), through to the period in which Sens films assumed a more contemplative quality. Mukhopadhyay succeeds in his portrayal of Sens inner world, as well as in his presentation of the film-maker as an experimental artist. Notwithstanding the books anecdotal richness, the tone is a bit too gushing at times.                                  
	IPL, an inside story: Cricket and commerce (Roli, Rs 195) by Alam Srinivas and T.R. Vivek confirms the suspicion that there is now an entire industry of books that milks the IPL to achieve literary success. In this case, the authors, A. Srinivas and T.R Vivek, have come up with a book that ends up asking questions, which have been raised by earlier, equally uninspiring, works. Some of the issues that the duo examine include the leagues impact on cricket and on Indias social and economic fabric. Questions have also been raised about the transparency of certain strategies and processes that were undertaken by the organizers to make the league a success. This book, unfortunately, is as facile as Twenty20 cricket itself.                        
	If it is sweet (Tranquebar, Rs 295) by Mridula Koshy is a collection of short stories that attempts to throw light on the corners of existence that are often deemed forbidden to explore. Many of Koshys protagonists are free spirits struggling to break free of a life of bondage. In The Good Mother, a woman, free from the burden of motherhood, rediscovers love in a different city with a younger man, only to realize that she still is a prisoner of her past. Some of the characters, oppressed by similar strictures, lead double lives. The Large Girl, for instance, recounts a fleeting, secretive affair between two women whose worlds are vastly different from one another. Every story may not impress, but there are some compelling accounts, which prove that Koshy has the ability to turn the mundane into something disturbing and beautiful.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Before the budget
                                                                                                                 BEFORE THE BUDGET                          - Second houses and police violence in a time of gloom					 					      Westminster Gleanings      Anabel Loyd                                                      
	I had thought to wait for the budget on Wednesday before writing this piece but in essence there can be little in it that will be new  and certainly few fireworks. We know the bad news, and further attempts to talk up or kick start a moribund economy remain unbelievable for most of the public, who may dream, but with few expectations of economic upswing in the next few months against a background of a potential and staggering 170 billion deficit in government finances for the forthcoming year.         
	There is some fear that the government lives so far in Cloud-cuckoo-land that it may continue to spend non-existent money for the sake of short-term electoral gain, but it is more likely that we will suffer Alistair Darlings Scottish voice droning through predictable measures to restart the housing and car markets on the one hand while, on the other, making further forced cuts in less obvious areas of desperately needed public spending and slipping in slashes to foreign aid. It is all likely to be as depressing as watching Gordon Brown, in similar accents and still with that insane smile on his face, attempting to justify his morally ruined ministry. The budget will be fully documented and commented upon for anyone who cares to check, but there are worse things in the state of Denmark at the moment and these may prove the final straw for the electorate vis--vis this government whatever the Conservative Party does or does not.              
	We are happy here to pass judgment on corruption in Indian and other systems and to sit comfortably judging events in the Indian election, which is, however flawed, the most extraordinary exercise in democracy in the world, while our traditions of probity and freedom are crashing down around our ears. The stink from Westminster, in a time when we expect a national and united focus on getting us out of a gigantic economic hole dug in large part by the profligate tendencies of our son-of-the-manse leader, is polluting the air of the whole country and no political party is exempt. The scandal over members of parliament expenses is a whiff of rotten eggs rising from parliament, dirtying the hands of our politicians as surely as the more overt financial exchanges in other regimes do, while it comes on top of earlier revelations of cash-for-questions in our esteemed Upper House, the House of Lords. I doubt that MPs taking advantage of the current expenses system today have been doing something new; they are just stretching the elastic in an overly giving process and thinking too little of it. Actually, I dont really believe that, but the thought of a minister on the scale of the home secretary  a post previously held by the likes of the Duke of Wellington, H.H. Asquith, Winston Churchill and more recently by Roy Jenkins and Douglas Hurd  fiddling the books with malice aforethought to claim spurious expenses on second homes is too appalling to accept.        
	Jacqui Smith, the current incumbent, is proving herself altogether frighteningly inadequate, whether or not her apparent personal dishonesty can be judged as mere oversight. Her husband, who, it seems, runs her parliamentary office, her home and, from the sound of things, her expenses, has been caught out  he allowed his rental of two pornographic films to slip into his wifes claims  amid red faces all round. This has been followed by the discovery of massive claims by the minister attached to the second house required by her responsibilities to a constituency far distant from Westminster. The second house expenses are an old dodge and it is certainly essential for any MP or minister to be able to live both in London and in or close to their constituency, but historical expectations of reasonable honesty from our public servants are being destroyed, especially at the government level.         
	Smith, had she or the prime minister any sense of propriety or shame, would have resigned. But, unfortunately, her personal debacle appears contrarily to have stiffened her spine in the public sphere in an effort to prove herself worthy. The results in iron-handed policing during the G20 summit, causing the death of one innocent man and loss of all respect for Londons Metropolitan police force, may be laid first at the door of a woman hanging on to power by her fingernails and terrified of another mistake; secondly and finally at that of her boss, still attempting to revive his domestic fortunes by his performance on the world stage. His misfortune is his inability to emulate either the acting skills or the charm of his predecessor; Smiths is her lack of either humility or honour and, like other inadequate individuals in our society, her confusion between force and strength.        
	Not so long ago, our police force was looked upon as a very good thing indeed, unarmed, trusted by the public and always ready to help. Go and ask a policeman was a standard mantra in most communities where the policeman in question was usually a well-known face in the locality and generally viewed as the epitome of integrity. Contemporary necessity to combat a fear of expected and unexpected violence make policing today a frightening affair, and the policeman or woman as an individual has disappeared behind bullet-proof this and that, an armoury of guns, extendable batons and tasers, and, this month, at the G20, behind the removal or covering of identification numbers in order, it appears, that no one should be blamed for police violence, provoked or not. Several people, mostly there by chance more than design, have told me that the police policy of crowd control by kettling  penning protesters or unfortunate passersby into small areas without water or lavatories, allowing no exit for hours on end  was at best a highly unpleasant experience. Our long traditions of peaceful protest may be at risk from the likes of the hood-wearing hotheads who smashed the Royal Bank of Scotland windows during the protests, but such new systems of crowd control used by the forces of law and order with increasing violence have only compounded the situation, so that we now deeply mistrust the police force we seriously need to rely on.               
	The RBS can rapidly repair some panes of glass; repairing the reputation of the police is a far bigger problem and another nettle that seems unlikely to be grasped by a leadership sinking further into a mire of its own making. Early opening of the files of the Hillsborough football stadium disaster of 25 years ago, now being promoted by the home secretary, presumably to take our eyes off her other problems, may finally bring closure for the families of victims, but will almost certainly do further damage to the national police image, especially when old and life- threatening anti-football hooligan tactics are seen to be mirrored by those used at the G20.        
	More private dirty dealings have emerged from Downing Street with revelations of a smear campaign emanating from an inner office headed by senior aide and dirty trickster-in-chief, Damian McBride, and, by implication, involving higher profile insiders such as the Labour general secretary, Ray Collins, who denies everything. McBride, a man of repellent aspect, who makes Alistair Campbells occasionally dubious press spinning in Tony Blairs day look forthright, honest and entirely in the spirit of the normal political process, has at least had to resign, a rare event in a political culture where falling on swords should be mandatory. It has been generally accepted that Gordon Brown did not know what was going on but he and McBride, a man of considerable intellect, were close. There can be no respect left for a prime minister whose only saviour may be in future a proof of insanity.               
	All we do now is watch in stunned amazement as things go from bad to worse, and we are all caught up in global currents with no hand to trust on the domestic tiller. The promise of a coming general election provides slight hope for greater normalcy but little real expectation of major change in a political system which is as bankrupt as our economy.

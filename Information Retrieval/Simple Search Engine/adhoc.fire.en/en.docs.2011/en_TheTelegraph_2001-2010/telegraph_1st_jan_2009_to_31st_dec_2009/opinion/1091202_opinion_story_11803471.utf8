The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | The gods who failed
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        THE GODS WHO FAILED                                  Fifth Column - Sumanta Sen                              
	When it comes to tribals, the general tendency is to paint a picture of sparsely clad, impoverished people exploited by outsiders in their domain and so seething in anger. The picture may not be wholly distorted, but most certainly is not complete. For, among the same tribals, there are people who have made it good in the world and often at the expense of others of their kind. This is so at Jharkhand, which is now in the process of electing a new ministry with the wretched of the earth in the Santhal Parganas, Singhbhum and in other places where the Sorens, the Kodas and the Mahatos face strong allegations of having built a different lifestyle out of tainted money. Since the same problems plague tribals and non-tribals alike, when discussing tribals, it is perhaps better to talk in terms of class rather than ethnicity.        
	Unless this class distinction is stressed, that which should be a non-issue becomes the dictating factor. In non-tribal areas of north India, it is caste which causes the poor Brahmins or the Kshatriyas to think of themselves as different from the poor Yadavs or the Dalits. In tribal areas, ethnic affinity is actually a non-issue as there can be no real affinity between the tribal who is well-off and those whom he lords over. Unfortunately, no political party of any relevance in Jharkhand has ever sought to highlight this for the simple reason that the Jharkhand brand of politics does not allow thoughts of class division to creep into the psyche. The Maoists profess to pursue a different ideology but, in practice, they also equate both classes as they go about their mission of filling their coffers from all and sundry.        
	With all talks of class kept under wraps, and consequently all references to personal misdeeds pushed under the carpet, a Madhu Koda has no problems attracting huge crowds. Even his rivals avoid these issues.                
	Chaos beckons        
	The Congress, having lent full support to Koda when he managed to become the chief minister, and Koda having allegedly made his pile when he was a minister of the Bharatiya Janata Party, it is natural for the two parties to talk of other things. And Shibu Soren is still known as Guruji for the image he has built for himself over the past many years, his various acts of omission and commission notwithstanding. Elsewhere in the country, the poor can no longer be taken for a ride  they have started asking questions  but in Jharkhand, their tribal allegiance prevents them from doing so.        
	For the most part, they are incapable of understanding that their gods have failed them, and that those whom they thought of as saviours are in league with the exploiters. There was no one to open their eyes to the fact that the Jharkhand movement was being largely sustained by the same section of businessmen and contractors who helped the other side. If the betrayal had started with Jaipal Singh Munda joining the Congress, none of the other leaders behaved differently, betraying the spirit of the movement even while being a part of it. And this is true not just of the leaders of the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha but also of others who had promised a new deal.        
	Jharkhand, as also Chhattisgarh, perfectly exemplifies the reasons why the creation of small states along ethnic lines is no guarantee for overall satisfaction. There will always be those privileged by circumstance of birth and education, and it is they who will rule the roost. If Jharkhand today has become the happy hunting ground of the Maoists, it is because of the collective failure of all the contending parties. They are unlikely to usher in any change, and there is every danger of the ordinary man deciding one day that the democratic system holds no promise for him. Then it will be an invitation to chaos.

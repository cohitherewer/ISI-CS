                                                                                                                 EARLY HOPES                                                    
	The results of the just concluded national elections may be cause for euphoria, but the countrys stock markets have overreacted. For the first time ever, trading on the Bombay Stock Exchange had to be halted on Monday because of an upward surge, rather than a decline, in stock prices. What is even more unprecedented is that it took barely 60 seconds for the BSE sensitive index to jump 17 per cent, or by over 2100 points, before trading was halted for the day. With what can be best described as misplaced enthusiasm, the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India said that Mondays phenomenal rise was justified, never mind that the rest of the regions markets actually fell: Japans Nikkei index was down about 225 points that day. Many market analysts have echoed a more moderate version of Assochams delight, saying that it is a sign of positive things to come. Some others called it a dead elephant bounce, analogous to a dead cat bounce used by financial industry professionals to describe a sudden rise in the price of a stock after a long decline. Investors would be well-advised to consider the facts carefully.        
	For one thing, traded volumes on Monday were barely five per cent of those on a normal day: not exactly the basis for a robust shift of sentiment. Over Tuesday and Wednesday, the markets went on a roller-coaster ride as the Sensex swung several hundred points in either direction  volatility is a sign of uncertainty, not of expectations of stability. While some numbers of foreign institutional investor interest are being put forth  it was put at $1 billion  a wait is necessary before deciding it is here to stay. The economic facts do not support euphoria either: corporate earnings are still weak, and signs of a sustainable turnaround still absent. Much of the euphoria is based on expectations that a stronger, more stable Congress-led government at the helm of national affairs means that much-needed economic reforms can now be fast-tracked. But the challenges the government will face could well complicate both economic reform and revival processes. The very high fiscal deficit, the rupees weakness and the imperatives of social sector and rural development programmes could trump corporate Indias hopes of quick reforms in industrial and financial sectors. Despite the resurgent strength of the Congress, the demands of its smaller partners in coalition mean that good politics, and not necessarily good economics, will decide policy.

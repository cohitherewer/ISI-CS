	Judging decency in clothing can become an indecent business. Reportedly, the judge in the Khartoum court who had to pass sentence on the indecency of Lubna Husseins trousers had to make sure that the pair was body-hugging enough to convict her under Article 152 of Sudans penal code. Ms Hussein, a journalist, had refused to plead guilty and was freed from jail because the journalists union paid the fine on her behalf. Her fight against the law, which prescribes a penalty of 40 lashes and a fine for anyone who commits an indecent act that violates public morality or wears indecent clothing, has taken on symbolic proportions. The law is deliberately vague, she says, in order to punish women. The absurdity of its assumptions are particularly obvious in Sudan. In the north, Islamic law holds sway and women there are supposed to dress decently, although numerous women wear trousers. Most of the protesters who turned up in support of Ms Hussein before the courthouse wore them. If that was a mark of defiance there, in the south of the country it would pass unnoticed, for that area is predominantly Christian. Most of the women who had been arrested with Ms Hussein for wearing trousers had pleaded guilty and were whipped. The unspeakable humiliation the State imposes on women indicates a shameless form of gender-oppression that appears incredible in this day and age. Ms Husseins campaign against such a malicious law is thus more than timely, and support for her fight is pouring in from all over the world.        
	When women fight for a right, it is always seen as a gender issue. Yet womens right not to be punished for wearing trousers can only improve Sudans image, and that of the religion in whose name the State is whipping women. Invoking religion to keep women in their place is the oldest, cheapest and most widespread trick in the world. For example, Iran is still not comfortable with its first woman minister after 30 years; hardliners talk of religious doubts about womens managerial skills. But Marzieh Vahid Dastjerdi has got her position as health minister through a hard line herself, by suggesting that healthcare should be segregated: women should be treated by women only. It is interesting that she has started saying something quite different as minister. From clothing to politics, it is amazing how fiercely, and cannily, women need to fight even today.

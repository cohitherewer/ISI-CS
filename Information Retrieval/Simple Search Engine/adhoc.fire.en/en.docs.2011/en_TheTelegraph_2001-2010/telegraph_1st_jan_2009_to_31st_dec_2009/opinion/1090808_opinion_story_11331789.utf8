The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | An overcast sky on a fairy terrain
                                                                                                                 AN OVERCAST SKY ON A FAIRY TERRAIN                              VISUAL ARTS      Somak Ghoshal                        Sohini Dhar, detail from Meghamallar B				                                       
	Ganges Art Gallerys current exhibition, Eternal Landscape (till August 15), features seven artists. It is obvious from the title that all the participants focus exclusively on Nature, although the epithet, eternal, sounds like a hyperbole when applied to their work.        
	Sandip Roy and Gopal Ghose offer realistic paintings in watercolour in which skill plays a greater part than sensibility. Of the two, Roy is the more talented, more in control of his medium. His images of Purulia and Deoghar, with their fading colours and interplay of light and shade, are as obviously reminiscent of Turner as they are of Constable. Ghose is less concerned with imitating the real. A mountain range, in his canvas, looks icy blue, while a somewhat bare village scene with distant figures against huts and trees looks trite.        
	Mrinal Mandal and Surya Prakash play safe by surrendering themselves unconditionally to existing traditions of landscape painting. Mandal, who works with charcoal, unapologetically draws from Paramjit Singh (and further back from one of the doyens of the Bengal School, Gaganendranath Tagore). Even Prakash makes no bones about copying Paramjit Singh (Seurats pointillism being another influence) in his colourful acrylics.        
	Manisha Dey departs from typical depictions of natural panorama to focus closely on a cluster of leaves or on bamboo shoots sprouting from a mutilated orchard. Her unmodulated use of bright colours brings a touch of hyperreality to her canvases but as such does not add much to them. In Ramlal Dhar, one detects a weakness for intense colours as well, as in his twin visions of Dawn and Dusk, the former bringing the azure skies down to earth, and the latter filling the evening air with the purple haze of twilight. There is a sense of indeterminacy in both the images. They could as easily reflect states of mind as the hours of the day.        
	The finest arrangement of colours and forms appears in Sohini Dhars exquisite work on paper using dry pastel. Dhar, who is best known for her miniature paintings, does not break new ground. In her two versions of Meghamallar, she revives the enchanting fairy terrain typically associated with her repertoire: mushroom-like trees growing on little hills kissed by bundles of clouds.         
	Whereas earlier she had visualized these dreamscapes on a smaller scale, Dhar has executed them now on an enlarged canvas. In spite of keeping close to a tried-and-tested style, Dhar impresses with her alluring, and almost musical, arrangement of shapes and colours. The lyrical magic of the Malhars is evoked by the close proximity of green and grey, of new leaves and the overcast sky.

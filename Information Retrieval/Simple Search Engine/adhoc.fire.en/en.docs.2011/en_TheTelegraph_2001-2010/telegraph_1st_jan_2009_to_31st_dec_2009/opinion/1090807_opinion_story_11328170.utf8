The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | order a probe
                                                                                                                 ORDER A PROBE                                                    
	Not all judicial probes satisfy those who ask for them. But in India, the judiciary is still seen as the peoples last hope for institutional justice. This also reflects their increasing loss of faith in other institutions of the State, especially in the police. But a strange unwillingness to order judicial probes is common among state governments. The Manipur governments refusal to hold a judicial inquiry into the killing of a pregnant woman and a young man in Imphal has only made things worse. The governments position is both unnecessary and ill-advised; it has made more people suspect that the government has something to hide. The swelling of public anger is showing in the apex body of non-government organizations joining the protesters. The chief minister, Okram Ibobi Singh, should waste no more time in accepting the growing demand for a judicial inquiry into the incident. The resignation of a minister has already exposed the rift in the cabinet over his handling of the incident. He needs to order the probe not just to save his coalition government but also to let the truth prevail.         
	Truth is the first casualty as much in a counter-insurgency battle as in a conventional war. Innocents die in these battles in Manipur and elsewhere in the Northeast. But militants often use, and even kill, innocent people as part of their strategy. The latest incident in Imphal has raised serious questions about the killing and the polices role in it, thanks to evidence collected by a New-Delhi-based news portal. Whether the evidence will stand up to judicial scrutiny is another matter. But that is no reason why the government should avoid facing the probe. It is not the States obligation to protect policemen if they are found guilty. An impartial inquiry can help restore the peoples confidence in the administration.

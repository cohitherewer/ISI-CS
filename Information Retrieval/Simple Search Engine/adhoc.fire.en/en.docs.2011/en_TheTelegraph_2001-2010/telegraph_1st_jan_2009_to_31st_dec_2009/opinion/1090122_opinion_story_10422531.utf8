The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Our leader
                                                                                                                 OUR LEADER                          - A nation of Christians, Muslims, Jews, Hindus, non-believers					 					      Mukul Kesavan                                                                  
	In the summer of 2008, well before the economic meltdown that tilted the election in Obama rsquo;s favour, at a time when it was reasonable to suppose that John McCain might become the 44th president of the United States of America, Warren Buffett and Bill Gates, the two richest men in the world, endorsed Obama. These two tycoons, between them worth more than a hundred billion dollars at the time, announced they would vote for Obama. They also contributed the maximum they were allowed to by law to his campaign, despite the fact that he had promised to raise their taxes if he became president.   
	Buffett explained his preference in an interview with a business channel, saying that he preferred Obama to McCain because his economic policies were better designed to achieve the goal of social justice. Buffett and Gates werent alone in their support: right across Silicon Valley, hugely wealthy entrepreneurs, pillars of Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange, like Googles CEO, Eric Schmidt, and Apples legendary founder and CEO, Steve Jobs, came out in support of Barack Obama because, like Warren Buffett, they thought he was an inclusive leader who would (amongst other things) correct the reckless tilt towards the rich that George Bushs two terms had institutionalized.   
	This willingness to vote for leaders and policies that hurt their wallets wasnt a one-off for Buffett and Gates. Both men, for example, had earlier spoken out against George Bushs move to reduce death duties, arguing that wealth transferred across generations wasnt earned by the person inheriting, and therefore it was appropriate for the State to tax it, as it would tax a windfall. Buffett argued that Dynastic wealth, the enemy of a meritocracy, is on the rise. Equality of opportunity has been on the decline. A progressive and meaningful estate tax is needed to curb the movement of a democracy toward plutocracy.              
	When Obama took his oath of office on Tuesday, Buffett and Gates and Jobs and Schmidt (and Bob Farese and Gordon Getty and Sohaib Abbasi and all the very rich men who had endorsed him) must have felt buoyed by the same surge of happiness that had brought millions of people to Washington on a frosty winters day, for the Inaugural. After Obama delivered his speech in that lovely, smoky baritone, bloggers and television anchors began to mine it for nuggets, for that one memorable phrase that might make it immortal, in the way that John Kennedys speech lived on in Americas folk memory on account of the rhetorical power of a single sentence: Ask not what your country can do for you...         
	They didnt find that fine phrase because it wasnt there. There was no resonant or explicit invocation of Martin Luther King or the civil rights struggle except for a throwaway reference to the fact he was being sworn in as president in a town where once his parents wouldnt have been permitted to dine together in a restaurant. Simon Schama has written that the most startling phrase in the whole speech was when Obama spoke of tasting the bitter swill of slavery, civil war, and segregation as though it rose from his gut now and again in filthy reflux. Thats sharply said; it reminds us that the best historians are fine writers.         
	But for me, and I suspect for many others, Gates and Buffett among them, the most important passage in the speech, while it contains the phrase singled out by Schama, is otherwise neither striking, nor particularly original.         
	We are a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus, and non-believers, said Obama, halfway through his speech. We are shaped by every language and culture, drawn from every end of this Earth. And because we have tasted the bitter swill of civil war and segregation and emerged from that dark chapter stronger and more united, we cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass; that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve; that as the world grows smaller, our common humanity shall reveal itself.        
	I have heard or read this sentiment in countless speeches, but when I heard it said by Obama, who has come to embody diversity rather than blackness, it felt like a promise and a benediction. It must have been for this, this talent for making the worn piety sound true, this knack of restoring to good intentions their original force and urgency, that millions upon millions of Americans gave him their money and their votes, even the plutocrats, in fact, especially the plutocrats, who Obama had promised to tax.         
	Sunil Mittal, Anil Ambani and Ratan Tata arent quite as rich as Buffett or Gates, but theyre in the same league, and like their American counterparts, they know who they want as their political leader. In a recent gathering of businessmen hosted by the Gujarat chief minister, Narendra Modi, these captains of industry endorsed Modi, not indirectly, but explicitly for the post of prime minister.         
	Sunil Mittal wanted to clone Modi: If India has 10 Chief Ministers like you, we can overcome all the challenges. You are not only the CEO of one state but could lead the whole country. Anil Ambani, richer than Sunil Mittal, was even more expansive. Not only did he up the numerical ante from 10 to 100, he pressed his late father into his endorsement:        
	Dhirubhai, at a Wharton meeting, said that if one Dhirubhai could achieve so much, imagine what a hundred Dhirubhais could do for India. There is no exaggeration if I may repeat the same for Narendrabhai. You are not the leader of Gujarat alone but the future leader of India.              
	Ratan Tata and Mukesh Ambani stopped short of the my leader obeisance, but they were unstinting in their praise for Modi and the Gujarat he had made. For Tata, Modi was the good M as opposed to the bad M he had left behind him in Bengal, Mamata. For Mukesh Ambani, Modi had an amazing clarity of purpose coupled with determination. He combines his strong Gujarat ethos with a modern outlook.        
	No one mentioned Godhra and the pogroms that came afterwards, though it could be said that that campaign certainly signified a clarity of purpose and determination. And a strong Gujarat ethos could, in contemporary India, be construed to mean a muscular commitment to Hindutva. In his enthusiasm for Modi, Sunil Mittal declared that the Gujarat chief minister was capable of dreaming with his eyes open. I dont imagine he meant this to sound uncanny, but it did.               
	We are a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus, and non-believers. We are shaped by every language and culture, drawn from every end of this Earth. And because we have tasted the bitter swill of civil war and segregation and emerged from that dark chapter stronger and more united, we cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass Substitution partition for segregation and these words could have been written for India, only I cant see the man that Mittal, Ambani and their fellow billionaires want for our next prime minister, saying them. If these hatreds were to pass, who would elect him? Sunil Mittal likened Modi to a magnet. What is that in you, he asked rhetorically, that people are attracted to you? What, indeed.         
	Im not sure I want to know.       mukulkesavanhotmail.com

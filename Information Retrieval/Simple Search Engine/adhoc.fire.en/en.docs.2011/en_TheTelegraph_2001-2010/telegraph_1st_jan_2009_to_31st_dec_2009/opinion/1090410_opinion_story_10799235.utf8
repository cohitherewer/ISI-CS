                                                                                                                 LETTING GO                                                    
	In the end, the people won. Jagdish Tytler will no longer be running for the Lok Sabha from the newly-created Northeast Delhi seat. It cannot be said that he gave in with good grace. Rather he submitted to mounting pressure from the people and his party. Even without making a song and dance about it, significant sections of the Congress leadership quite clearly wanted him to opt out, although some leaders also felt that the law should decide. But the gathering force of the protests, affecting Punjab and later even Delhi, determined the outcome. Keeping Mr Tytler on as a nominee would not have been a viable choice for the Congress. Even a Kakardooma court postponed yesterday the scheduled hearing on the Central Bureau of Investigations conclusion that the 1984 anti-Sikh riots case against the former Union minister could be closed. So, waiting for the law, which Mr Tytler had wished to do, would have further stoked the widespread popular anger.        
	While there appears to have been a neat ending to the sequence that began with a journalist rudely and improperly throwing a shoe at the Union home minister, certain questions remain. It can even be said that those questions have now risen more insistently to the surface of a national life woven intricately of politics and the people, governance, legality, justice and the structures of power. The oscillation between guilt and innocence in the 1984 riots in which Mr Tytler was placed by the findings of successive commissions, including the Nanavati commission, and repeated investigations by the CBI, obviously has less to do with facts than with the operational fictions created by the invisible dynamics of power. That the investigations took a quarter of a century to come to a conclusion unacceptable to the injured community once again demonstrates why people are finding it impossible to trust inquiries overseen by governments. When people intervene, it may be neither orderly nor pleasant; yet it is the governing classes lack of transparency that brings on such protests. Democracy in this form creates ambiguities: Mr Tytler may rightly insist that the court has not yet found him guilty. Had there not been suspicions of earlier sleights of hand and suppression of the recommendations of the various commissions, none of this would have been necessary. What the Congress might have done without the Lok Sabha elections in the offing is another line of speculation altogether.

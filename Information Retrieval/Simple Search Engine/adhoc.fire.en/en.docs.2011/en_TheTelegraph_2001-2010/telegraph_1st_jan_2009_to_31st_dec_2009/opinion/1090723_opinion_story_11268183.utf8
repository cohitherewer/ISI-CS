	The total eclipse drove out Urumqi from TV screens after two weeks of continuous coverage of the violence there. For an Indian, it was disturbingly reminiscent of Godhra and Mumbai. In the first incident, two Uighurs (minority Muslims) were killed (over a rumour of rape) by their co-workers belonging to the majority Han race in a South China factory. This provoked Uighurs in the capital of their own province, Xinjiang, to come out on the streets. Stopped by the police, they turned on Hans in a frenzy of violence. As happened in Mumbais Radhabai Chawl in the 1992-93 riots, an entire Han family was burnt alive inside their home in a mixed neighbourhood. The violence left 184 dead and over 1,000 injured  the majority of them Han. Much later, officials said that 12 rioters were shot dead by the police.        
	Two days later came the backlash by the Hans. Uighurs claimed at least four of their people were killed by the Hans even though Urumqi was flooded with security forces. But the similarity to Gujarat and Mumbai, where Hindus went on a rampage justified as retaliation under the benign gaze of the police, ends there. In Urumqi, Wang Lequan, the Communist Party (Han) strongman who has ruled over Xinjiang for 15 years, himself came on TV urging the Hans to go back.        
	On the first Friday after the riots, mosques were ordered to close. But as the Uighurs gathered around the citys main mosque, the police allowed it to open for afternoon prayers to avoid any incident. They were not so indulgent towards the Hans, some of whom wanted to observe the seventh day of mourning  an important day for them  by lighting lamps in the citys main square where the violence had broken out. On the eve of that day, a ban on public assemblies was declared and security strengthened.                 
	Different picture        
	The role of the media too was starkly different. Of course, Chinese media is State-controlled. In this case, the internet and even the mobile networks were completely blocked. So only Xinhua, the official news agency, ruled. Naturally, it toed the government line by blaming overseas Uighur leaders for the violence. Its visuals of bleeding and dead Hans on the streets left no one in doubt about who was the aggressor.         
	But, simultaneously, the media continuously carried accounts of Uighurs saving Hans. A Han schoolteacher and his wife, escorting their Uighur students from Shanghai, found themselves in the midst of Uighur mobs. But it was the Uighurs who helped them escape, with one woman actually stopping the mob. All through, their students kept calling them, worried about their safety. The citys Islamic Institute as well as its Arts Theatre took in as many people as they could, earning the gratitude of Han families.        
	What Xinhua and CCTV did not focus on was the reason that could have driven the Uighur rioters into such cruelty against innocent Hans. It could not only have been the shrill propaganda of Rebiya Kadeer, the millionaire businesswoman, who fights the Chinese government from the United States of America. She now stands discredited after displaying to the international media photographs of violence unconnected to Urumqi. Newspapers showed Uighurs joyously offering kababs and melons to soldiers in their neighbourhood, but made no mention of the transformation of Urumqi into a Han city with the original residents being pushed into lowly jobs, while their resources are pumped into the rest of China.        
	Xinjiang people, sorry but thank you: thats all we want to hear, wrote a Xinjiang blogger before the Urumqi riots. Is that what Beijing was trying to say earlier this week when it announced its desire to improve its ethnic policy, claiming it was never (our) aim to let the Hans control the region?

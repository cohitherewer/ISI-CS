                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Slippery ordeal                  
	Sir  The action of the journalist, Jarnail Singh, in hurling a shoe, and that too at the Union home minister, P. Chidambaram, deserves condemnation by all right-thinking persons (Journalist hurls shoe at PC, April 8).           
	But the Congresss acceptance of the Central Bureau of Investigations claim  that the statement of a key witness in the inquiry into Jagdish Tytlers role in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots was unreliable  actually indicates the partys unreliability. Earlier inquiries had also mentioned Tytlers role in the 1984 riots. Citizens must thank Jarnail Singh and the Sikh people who protested together. It shows that unity among the people is necessary to expose malpractices by politicians.          
	Yours faithfully,      
B.S. Ganesh, Bangalore

                
	Sir  An Indian journalists shoe-gate has sparked off a row over the manner of his protest. He apologized later, but emphasized that it was his outrage against the governments apathy towards the 1984 anti-Sikh riots that forced him to this. For the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, the Congress nominated two leaders, Jagdish Tytler and Sajjan Kumar, whose roles in the Sikh riots are felt to be controversial.           
	It is more shocking that the CBI gave Tytler a clean chit. Singhs way of protesting was wrong, but it was a symptom of the anger within the community. The Congress is accused of patronizing tainted politicians, but the Bharatiya Janata Party too uses doublespeak when it comes to acting against riot-tainted leaders. Narendra Modi is a classic example of how blatant political parties are in ignoring the sentiments of a particular community. Let us show zero tolerance for riot-tainted politicians.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Md Ziyaullah Khan, New Delhi

                
	Sir  It seems that this is a new era in which mediapersons are ready to go to the extent of emotional outbursts on issues that politicians deliberately distort for their own vested interests (Booted in: agony of 1984, April 8). Several political parties have taken advantage of the protest of the journalist and would like to use him in their campaigns against the Congress in the coming elections, while the Congress has chosen to keep low profile over the incident. Certainly, the incident has forced people to ponder once again what actually took place in 1984.           
	The journalist may be a hero in the eyes of his community, but his act needs to be vehemently condemned. A responsible journalist should use his pen and not his shoe to express his feelings.          
	Yours faithfully,        Prabhakar Bhattacharya,Ichapore, North 24 Parganas             
	Sir  It is unfortunate that a journalist behaved in an inappropriate manner by throwing his shoe at the Union home minister. He has apologized but said that his concern was for the right cause.           
	When justice is done people should feel that justice has been done. It is for the courts to decide the matter and the final verdict must be respected and accepted by everyone. But laws must be strictly implemented for all political parties and politicians. For politicians, equality in law is on paper alone. Most politicians feel that the law is what they think and do, and that the law in statute books is meant only for poor citizens. Even when the law is applied to politicians, the end result in most cases is zero, as evidence often fails to reach the courts, and they are acquitted. Worst, such politicians are again taken in as members of political parties and even hold important public offices.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Mahesh Kumar, New Delhi

                
	Sir  The first target of a hurled shoe was the former American president, George W. Bush. The attacker, a reporter, has been punished with three years in prison. Another chappal attack was targeted at Pinarayi Vijayan, the Kerala secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist). The attacker was severely treated by the other comrades. A similar attack on the Chinese prime minister ended with the attacker being now under trial. Then a journalist lobbed a shoe at the Union home minister. As shoe attacks attract media coverage, these incidents tend to increase. But such an act is against the basic culture of India. No one has a right to pardon the offender. If he is not punished, his act will send out wrong signals to others.          
	Yours faithfully,      
K.A. Solaman, Alappuzha, Kerala 

                
	Sir  Jarnail Singh, the reporter who threw his shoe at the Union home minister, was let off easily as the minister decided not to press charges against him. Political parties would do well to condemn the incident as what happened to P. Chidambaram could happen to any other politician. More important, a journalist is not an activist. Mediapersons have privileged access to politicians for professional purposes, not to make political statements. In a democracy, expressions of protest and dissent must remain confined within the limits of debate, discourse and deliberation. Media can provide a platform for all three. But mediapersons cannot be seen to join the ranks of street fighters.          
	Yours faithfully,      
J.S. Acharya, Hyderabad

                
	Sir  P. Chidambaram may exhibit cleverness by not insisting on action against the offending journalist. His eye is on the vote bank; he knows that any action against the journalist would further alienate the Sikh community from the Congress. To assuage the feelings of Sikhs, it was wiser to drop Jagdish Tytler and Sajjan Kumar from the Congress poll list.           
	Yours faithfully,       
R. Sambamurthy, Calcutta

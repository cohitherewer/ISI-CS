The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | To vote or not to vote
                                                                                                                 TO VOTE OR NOT TO VOTE                                  NO COMPULSIONS      In a democracy, everything, including voting, is a matter of choice                                                   
	I do not understand why a person who did not vote should be lampooned while elected representatives get away with abstaining from voting in Parliament, and entire countries desist from voting at the United Nations. Is it so difficult to see that a person not inspired enough to vote, or willfully holding back his vote, too has a point of view? The media, however, have some explaining to do for trying to whip up campaigns to get people to vote.         
	This years election has been marked by a drive to make people exercise their franchise through suggestions in the media of it being a democratic duty and not a choice. On the one hand, there were NGOs and committed websites at work. On the other, there were celebrity endorsements and political lectures that were clearly either personal posturings or an exercise done for indirect commercial gain. After all, celebrities make it their business to be seen in the media, and to be seen in politically correct quarters has a beneficial impact on their self-image.        
	Even corporate support for such campaigns, it must be pointed out, qualifies as corporate social responsibility, which is nothing but an intervention with an eye on expected returns in terms of public image. This is the difference between a voter registration effort by the Election Commission and one by other agencies; with the EC, one can be sure that there are no vested interests at play.        
	It is not surprising that the media, especially the electronic media, failed to appreciate such subtleties. The best proof of this is the nave manner in which Mumbais low voter turn-out was questioned against the backdrop of 26/11.         
	What was childish was the natural assumption therein that the reply to a security breach can be made through the ballot. Terrorism doesnt operate with an eye on voting percentages; it just looks at the size, importance and potential for damage in its targets. As long as Mumbai remains a strategically important city, high voting percentage or not, it will remain a target. The only way to address the threat would be through security measures that match the citys profile. In a polity where the reigns of both the United Progressive Alliance and the National Democratic Alliance have witnessed repeated terror strikes, how can 26/11 be reduced to an election issue? Interestingly, the commentators who praised Delhis voter turnout never mentioned that the city has had its share of terrorist attacks. What was required in this context was a serious enquiry by the media into the possible reasons for the voters apathy. In Mumbai, the summer heat, the errors in the voting list and the long weekend may have been the possible factors. Perhaps the people were also tired of the citys brand of meaningless politics.        
	Unfortunately, at least one senior politician has recommended that voting be made compulsory. The simple question that crops up is this: is all of life so black and white? The reason one values freedom and seeks democracy is because it has space for shades of grey. In a democracy, everything  including voting  should ideally be a matter of choice. Finally, there is only one thing that can be asked to those who are equating voting with being Indian: how would they judge a person who is a tax-paying individual but doesnt vote? He has paid his dues towards funding the election in which those outside the tax bracket also vote. He did his duty of enabling the process but chose not to vote himself. Would they listen to his reasons or ridicule him in public?                     SHYAM G. MENON

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A fly on ones own wall 
                                                                                                                 A FLY ON ONES OWN WALL                                                                   
	Reality should bore us to death, but it doesnt. To die of ennui would be surreal. But when bored we watch TV  and how better to beat boredom than Reality TV? As I zapped channels lazily of an evening, the essence of reality, it came home to me, is enshrined in reality television. Indian Idol, MTV Roadies, Fear Factor all turn upon a single, simple question  to be or not to be competing. To win, said a football coach, was not everything; it was the only thing. Watching the high-strung contestants fight it out in a high-octane environment of intrigue, fear and loathing, but also of friendliness and flirting, this sounded like a truism. All were dead set on winning, as though their lives depended on it. As the episodes progressed, emotions assumed epic proportions; some stayed on in the programme while others went home; there were histrionics and hysteria  and yet, everybody was a good sport. If human reality is like game-play, at once routine and random, then Reality TV is its closest semblance; and to survive in this world the fit has to play hard as the feeble fall by the wayside.         
	Reality TV owes its origin to a new and narrower kind of competition that came in with the age of cable and satellite television, with an explosion of channels, in the wake of liberalization/privatization of the electronic entertainment industry in Europe. More channels meant a less captive audience and marked a shift in broadcasting strategy from a mass to a niche demographic. As Colin Sparks, the media critic, explains, mainstream terrestrial broadcasters had now to find new ways of holding on to the mass audience of old. Reality programming provide[d] a cheap alternative to drama, wrote Annette Hill in Reality TV. Soap operas morphed into docusoaps as television borrowed the tricks of cinema vrit (direct cinema) to carve up slices of real life in its spontaneous overflow. Now, though often produced by independent companies, once a particular format becomes popular, it sets a genre benchmark and is syndicated to buyers. It is no longer cheap. It also becomes cannier about its claims to truthfulness. The live feed is delayed and rigorously edited. As a programme rises up the popularity scale, it flaunts itself more openly as performance rather than as documentary.        
	Perhaps the commonest dream is the dream to be recognized as being uncommon. Reality shows play up to this by promising to turn ordinary people into celebrities. Sometimes they deliver, in a climate of cut-throat killer instinct. The dead seriousness of the scramble to the top is contained within the simulated capsular environment of a game. The contestants brazen it out before bossy judges; they do not mind getting brutalized. Sometimes it pays to be the victim. Example, Shilpa Shetty of Big Brother fame. As shows like Big Brother bring into our drawing-rooms the private lives of strangers living under one roof, giving themselves up to the public eye willingly, we watch with guilty pleasure, privy to an open secret. But that is not all. Much of reality TV is humiliation TV, where contestants not only abuse one another but also advertise their abasement. The appeal of shame TV is not limited to the viewers schadenfreude: we identify with the participants, and something in us wants to be watched, and walloped, by the invisible yet all-seeing master, Big Brother.         
	Incursion into the private spaces that we ourselves as well as others inhabit somehow becomes normal and reassuring; when we leave home we wont be bothered by close circuit cameras watching us move and act in public. We would find protection in being policed. Perhaps pleasure even. And punishment takes on a new meaning as competition shades into cruelty. Perhaps that is how it should be. A participant in the American boxing show, The Contender, killed himself on being eliminated. Competition can be fun, but fatal too, as it traverses the liminal strait joining the real and the virtual.                    ANIK SAMANTA

	Tables turned                  
	Sir  It is amazing that even after being in politics for decades, Mamata Banerjee has not yet matured as a politician (Siliguri finger at adamant Mamata, Oct 03). One fails to understand the point of Banerjees demand that a Trinamul Congress candidate be made the mayor of the Siliguri Municipal Corporation. North Bengal is a stronghold of the Congress and it is only because of its alliance with this party that the TMC won 14 seats in the municipal polls. If Banerjee thinks that the win is to be attributed to her own strength alone, she is terribly mistaken.           
	The Congress has bent over backwards to accommodate the wishes of the TMC chief in the past. Banerjee should have readily accepted the offer the Congress made, as it was balanced and realistic. Although her strategy of bullying the Congress into conceding seats had worked earlier, it has failed this time, and rightly so. It was high time the Congress taught her a lesson in accommodative and realistic coalition politics.           
	The TMCs high-handed attitude towards the Congress would have backfired sooner or later since the former is, after all, a regional party. Hopefully, Banerjee will learn from the Siliguri episode and do whatever is needed to keep the coalition with the Congress in West Bengal intact for the forthcoming elections. Otherwise, she might have to see the Left Front being elected once again to power in West Bengal.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  By taking the help of the Left Front to install its candidates in the posts of the mayor and the chairperson of the SMC, the Congress has signalled its intention to end its honeymoon with the TMC. The Congress and the Left have shown their true colours by ignoring political ethics for the sake of the mutually beneficial alliance. The Communist Party of India (Marxist), well known for its knack of fishing in troubled waters, has snatched the opportunity in North Bengal to widen the rift between the Congress and the TMC. This is a tactical move to abort the Congress-TMC alliance to the advantage of the CPI(M).          
	Instead of depending on the Congress, the TMC should now strengthen its ties with smaller parties, such as the Socialist Unity Centre of India, that are much more dependable than the Congress. People will not be surprised if the CPI(M) woos the Congress for an alliance in the 2011 assembly elections. Going by the current performance of the Left in elections, a partnership with the Congress will bring dual benefits  the Left will be able to retain power in the state and will be able to shatter the TMCs dream of capturing the red citadel.          
	Yours faithfully,       
R. Sambamurthy, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  It seems that elections in India are fought like wars, with opportunism taking the front seat and ethics going to the back (Cong sups with Left to teach Mamata a lesson, Oct 2). At the very beginning of her campaigns in West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee had declared her one-point agenda of ousting the Left from the seat of power, and for this she had invited all like-minded parties to join her. Now it seems that she wants only the TMC to capture Bengal, sidelining all those who helped her in her mission by uniting the anti-Left votes.           
	The Congress never said that it would support the TMC without getting anything in return. As a national party, it naturally wants to carve a place for itself in Bengal, especially in the north, where it has a considerable presence. Banerjee could have compromised a little while the talk of choosing the mayor of the SMC was on, so as to keep the alliance intact. Because she remained firm in her stance, the Left, taking advantage of the acrimony and deadlock, successfully drove a wedge between the two parties.           
	However, the Congress should also remember the way Banerjee had co-operated when the party had formed the government at the Centre. The TMC, with its 19 ministers, did not bargain with the Congress for seats like the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam did. Now that the Congress has sided with the Left in Siliguri, I fear that this may eventually lead to a break in the TMC-Congress alliance.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The happenings in Siliguri should be an eye opener for Mamata Banerjee. She should not act as a dictator in democratic coalitions. She must remember that whatever the TMC has achieved in the last parliamentary elections has largely been due to its pact with the Congress. If she remains this adamant in the future, she will repent for it in the 2011 elections.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Avoidable perils          
	Sir  The death of a large number of tourists in the boat capsize in Kerala is shocking (Tourists drown in Kerala sanctuary capsize, Oct 1). The tragedy would not have occurred if the tourists had been wearing life jackets. Keeping this in mind, life jackets should be made mandatory in all such situations. The tourists in Kerala would have gladly paid some extra money for life jackets. Even in amusement parks, where adults and children ride paddle-boats, the provision of life jackets must be made. India is a country of many rivers. People sail daily in boats in this country without taking the necessary precautions. The government should come forward to ensure safety for all.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Ashok Kumar Ghosh, Calcutta

      
	Sir  The number of lifeguards usually present on vessels is not enough to save lives in case of emergencies. From the lapses coming to the surface after the Kerala tragedy, it is clear that for the authorities in India, the link between safety and tourism is quite unknown.           
	What is required is a complete overhaul of our thinking pattern vis--vis the promotion and maintenance of tourist spots. Along with informing people about the exciting tourism options in the country, we should also concentrate on making sure that such places are 100 per cent safe. Unless we make safety a priority, tragedies like the one at Thekkady will continue. It is the duty of the tourism authorities to make sure that those who come to our tourist spots return with fond memories.           
	Yours faithfully,

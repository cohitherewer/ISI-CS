	Holier than thou                  
	Sir  Abhijit Bhattacharyya eulogizes Chinas anti-corruption measures. It penalized 151,000 corrupt government officials till November 2008 (How to win the war against corruption, Jan 6). He suggests that India should follow the Chinese model. Yet, punishment in China is allegedly more a tool of political vengeance than an anti-corruption measure; else, how can Chinas rank be close to Indias in Transparency Internationals corruption index? China, which executes thousands of people each year, should learn from Indias more humane administrative process.

	Life in danger          
	Sir  It was shocking to read about the death of the Royal Bengal Tiger after it was rescued by forest officials. It had been attacked by the people of the village it had entered (Drowsy tiger dies in shelter, Dec 31). The tiger was not on a pleasure trip; it left its habitat probably because of hunger. But it was tortured by villagers and worse, it had to succumb to an overdose of Katamine. It looks absurd that we observe Wildlife Day and World Environment Day but are neither truly sympathetic towards animals nor active in protecting them.           
	The growth in human population is a threat to tigers and other animals. The forest is shrinking in order to accommodate ever-expanding human settlements. So the tiger is going into villages in search of food. Also, the forest mafiosi, with the help of local people and corrupt forest officials, are plundering forests for wood and thus endangering wildlife. The absence of control over access to the forests has made the poachers job easy.          
	Additionally, to save tigers, whose count is fast declining in the Sunderbans, forest produce such as honey and natural wax should be extracted from a limited area in forests, so that animals are not disturbed. The government should evacuate the borders of the forests, so that animals get back the lush greenery of earlier times. If the villages near forests are relocated, poachers too will not find easy access since there will be no local help.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Subhankar Mukherjee, Burdwan

                
	Sir  In spite of recurring incidents of tigers and elephants straying into villages near forests and getting beaten up by the villagers, the government is not taking any concrete steps to protect wildlife. Elephants are hit regularly by speeding trains and are found dead on the tracks in north Bengal. It is time that the government segregated the territories of animals and humans, and ensured that the animals stay within their protected territory. Access to these forests should be restricted; that would stop poaching as well. Also, the death of a tiger in the hands of forest officials, who were supposed to protect it, should be investigated.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot  
	Sir  It was a pleasure to read Ramachandra Guhas appraisal of Lal Bahadur Shastri (Changed version, Jan 1). But the authors comment that Nor, given his [Shastris] principled commitment to Hindu-Muslim harmony, would we have had the rise to influence of the Bharatiya Janata Party belittles the leaders achievements. Shastri was a Congress prime minister who sought to unite the nation against all odds. He once invited the leader of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, M.S. Golwalkar, to attend an all-party meeting before the India-Pakistan war in 1965. Shastri even wanted to entrust the RSS with some responsibilities so that the security forces could attend to more strategic duties. But unfortunately, even then, the BJPs influence in endorsing communal divisions could not be avoided.          
	Yours faithfully,

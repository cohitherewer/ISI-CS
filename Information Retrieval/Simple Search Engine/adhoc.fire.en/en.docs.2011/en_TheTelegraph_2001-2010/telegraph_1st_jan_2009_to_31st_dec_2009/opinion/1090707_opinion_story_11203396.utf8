The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | BUDGETING FOR REVIVAL
                                                                                                                 BUDGETING FOR REVIVAL                                                          
	Pranab Mukherjees budget is devoid of any big-ticket reforms, so much so that it can even be written off as a pedestrian budget. Indeed, there is virtually no attempt to break new ground. The finance ministers desire to refrain from generating any controversy is perhaps best exemplified by the very modest revenue that he hopes to collect through disinvestment  just over Rs 1000 crore. And this at a time when government finances are strained to the limit because of the economic slowdown and the consequent drop in tax revenue. Perhaps, the absence of reforms explains the dramatic slide in the stock market, with the Sensex falling by over six per cent.        
	Budgets and finance ministers should not be judged by movements in share prices. It was unrealistic to expect any reforms from a government which had assumed office only a couple of months ago. Once this is granted, the budget cannot be faulted for any major errors of commission. On the contrary, several groups stand to benefit from it. The rural sector is a major beneficiary with new incentives for farmers and a 45 per cent increase in Bharat Nirman, the flagship rural reconstruction programme. The successful implementation of the enhanced rural employment scheme also has the potential to transform the rural sector. A new health insurance scheme for below-poverty-line families is just one of several welfare schemes. All tax payers will benefit, since exemption limits have been increased slightly and the 10 per cent surcharge abolished completely. The corporate sector gains as the finance minister has refrained from increasing excise duties; the controversial fringe benefits tax and the commodities transaction tax have been abolished. However, there are some errors of omission. The most obvious one is that there is no attempt to address the issue of mounting subsidies. Unless subsidies are slashed, there is no hope of restoring order in government finances, which must surely be among the most important objectives in the medium term.        
	However, the Union budget for 2009-10 signals that the government takes very seriously its own slogan of inclusive growth. It provides, in very broad terms, a stimulus to growth by increasing government expenditure in areas such as infrastructure while keeping tax rates more or less unchanged. Its commitment to inclusiveness is signalled by a massive increase in programmes such as the rural employment guarantee scheme, whose outlay is to increase by as much as 144 per cent, and in areas such as higher education and rural housing. The gap between expenditure and revenue will increase  with the fiscal deficit estimated to rise to 6.8 per cent of the gross domestic product. Since the states will also run up deficits, the total fiscal deficit will be over 10 per cent of the GDP. Although this is unsustainable in the long run, the economy may well benefit if the fiscal stimulus helps to move it onto a significantly higher growth path. The budget has addressed the issue of growth while somewhat neglecting the question of meeting the fiscal deficit.

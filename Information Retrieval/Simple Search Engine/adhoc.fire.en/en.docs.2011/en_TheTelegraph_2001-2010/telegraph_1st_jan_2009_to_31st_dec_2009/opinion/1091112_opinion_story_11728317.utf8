	It takes quite a bit to fall below Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia and Pakistan in public health management. But India has managed to put in that extra bit, and has been told off by the World Health Organization for neglecting mdash; unlike these countries, but like 40-odd others mdash; to tackle measles. Around 160,000 children die of it every year in India, and the solution to this seems to be simple: a second dose of the measles vaccine that would immunize almost all children. Just one dose immunizes far less children. Measles can kill or seriously harm children (and adults), but tackling it is not terribly complicated. Because of polio and the other routine immunization programmes, which too are far from perfectly run, the infrastructure already exists in the country for delivering the recommended second dose of the vaccine to all children. The WHO has been urging this since 2004, but nothing concrete seems to have been done yet. Apart from this apathy regarding the measles vaccine, there is also very poor awareness regarding the treatment and after-effects of the disease. Hardly anybody knows that measles could cause pneumonia or that a dose of vitamin A can go a long way towards pulling sick children out of a crisis.  
	As with polio, malaria and diarrhoea, Indias public health management record remains shameful. Trendy and lucrative prevention and awareness programmes, like those for HIV/AIDS, get a great deal of civil and political attention, but less visible and unfashionable threats, even when they put children at mortal risk, generally get ignored or treated with the utmost lack of will. This is a question of the failure of governance, of inefficient and corrupt public administrative structures. But it is also a question of attitude that unites the bureaucracy as well as civil society. The importance given to public issues is still largely dependent on urban privilege in India. The ignorant and the poor dying of measles in the villages or in slums or on the streets get hardly any attention, and among the ignored and the unnoticed poor sick children are perhaps the most easily not seen. Hence, measles, arsenic poisoning or diarrhoea, the last two because of lack of proper drinking water, remain non-issues, whereas municipalities will regularly involve schools in their tree-planting programmes with ostentatious zeal.

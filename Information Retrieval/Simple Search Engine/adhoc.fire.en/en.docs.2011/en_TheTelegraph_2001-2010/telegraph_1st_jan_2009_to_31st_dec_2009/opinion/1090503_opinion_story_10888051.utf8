	This has been one of the most glorious springs. For weeks now in southern England the skies have been as a blue as those of a north Indian winter. The days have been still and the blossom has stayed perfectly intact on shrubs and trees, unshaken by the wind. Cherry and apple blossom, pink and white, has glowed over suburban avenues; cones of chestnut blossom point skywards in parks; in the countryside, hawthorn hedges look as if theyve been freshly dusted with snow. And all these colours  the purple as well as the pink, the yellow as well as the white  are set off against a background of innocent green foliage that has yet to be darkened and stained by the summer to come.         
	I spent too much of my life not paying attention to these things. Seasons would come and go and I would register a few basic facts  that the evenings were lighter or darker and it was cold enough for gloves or hot enough to swim  but the natural glories of an English spring more or less passed me by. What I noticed was the weather, that historic British preoccupation with the daily fluctuations in climate swept in by the North Atlantic airstream. The distrust of the weather has been instilled into the English breast for all time, Nirad Chaudhuri wrote after his first visit in the spring of 1955. He found that its capriciousness could be very provoking, while, at the same time, he admonished English people who complained about its unpredictability because they had no idea how excruciating its predictability can be, meaning the hot, dry certainties and tawny skies of Delhi in summer.              
	The weather is famously the foundation of a whole British conversational style in which Nice day! or Will this rain never stop? are substitutes for the hellos and good-mornings of elsewhere. But seasons, rather than the daily variations within them, are less well observed, even though English poetry has celebrated them from Chaucer to Larkin. Perhaps all I mean is that theyve been less well observed by me, because I live in London where the seasons somehow seem to matter less and because intimations of mortality, the thought that one day youll be leaving all this behind, dont really kick in till youre in your fifties. Now when I look at blossom, I think of the television interview that the playwright, Dennis Potter, gave in 1994, when he knew that death was only a matter of months away (occasionally during the interview he would drink from a bottle of morphine to dull the pain). He lived and wrote in the West Country, with a plum tree in his garden that he could see from his study window. Potter remembered that in previous springs, hed look up from his writing and think casually Oh, thats nice blossom, whereas in what turned out to be his final spring he saw it as the whitest, frothiest, blossomest blossom that there ever could be.        
	Potter said that dying had taught him to see in the present tense and appreciate what he called the wondrous nowness of living (Boy, can you see it! And boy, can you celebrate it!). Things were both more trivial than they ever were, and more important than they ever were, and the difference between the trivial and the important doesnt seem to matter. This may be no more than the everyday philosophy of a Hindu stoic, but in Britain now it seems especially appropriate. The future looks grim: higher taxes, spending cuts, economic and social turmoil, and a political class that resembles dwarves peering up at a tidal wave. The world will look different, but nobody is sure how. Its our children that I worry about is a common sentiment among people who fear that the age of plentiful jobs and good salaries is over for at least a generation. These are all good reasons to marvel at the present and the whitest, frothiest blossomest blossom that there ever could be.               
	**************              
	It was one such fine recent Sunday that India took on the Rest of the World for a Twenty20 game at Hampstead Cricket Club. The game was organized by the British Council and the teams drawn from delegates to the London Book Fair, which this year had Indian books and writers as its focus. I went along because the games sponsor is a friend: Ilyas Khan, who publishes the Asia Literary Review out of Hong Kong, though Ilyas himself has recently moved back to London. Whenever I try to describe him, I realize the inadequacies of fiction as a source of characters that stretch the imagination. Ilyas was born in Lancashire of three-parts Kashmiri to one-part Irish ancestry and then studied Urdu (among other things) at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London. He joined a big bank and moved to Hong Kong and eventually branched out to co-own an investment bank. This made him rich, though being rich is in a way the least interesting thing about him. What money facilitates in his case isnt yachts or glamorous parties but a more elevated range of interests and passions. Ilyas collects first editions of Henry James, owns a precarious football club in his Lancashire home town, fervently admires the novels of Lawrence Durrell and George Gissing, supports Lancashire at cricket (and regards his fellow-Lancastrian, Neville Cardus, as the best ever writer about the game). And this is just a selection of his enthusiasms  I havent, for example, described his to-my-mind contrary championing of Marxism or his plan to raise money for a diabetes charity by running a series of marathons in Namibia or his friendship with Gore Vidal. Found in a novel, he would not be believed.         
	It came as no surprise, then, to discover he was not only funding the match but also playing in it. I didnt get the chance to see him bat because he was among the middle to lower order that the Indian bowlers never reached, but he was an athletic fielder and ran after balls like a boy of fifteen rather than a man in his late forties (which I suppose is what you might expect from someone planning to sweat for 26 miles a day in Namibia). The Rest of the World reached around 145 for four, even though their first batsman was out first ball, caught and bowled. India achieved only 115 or thereabouts, perhaps because their side contained at least one real writer (Tarun Tejpal was too adventurous a batsman, though he took a good catch).               
	**************              
	We had lunch on the clubhouse terrace in the warming sunshine. Salads, chicken, cold salmon and glasses of Pimms. I explained to Ilyas that most of his Rest of the World side were book salesmen, the people who persuaded bookshops to place orders for books. That trade or profession isnt what it was  online ordering and the centralized buying departments of bookstore chains have cut the numbers of sellers on the road  but it has always seemed to me a difficult way to earn a living. You go to a bookshop and unpack the jackets and blurbs supplied by the publisher to advertise forthcoming books. Here is a literary novel by unknown writer Samantha Well-Bred. Here is a biography of Wellington by Julian Lucky-Fellow. Here is a wonderful childrens story by Lucy Stay-Home. You enthuse about them all, sometimes sincerely: their narrative gifts, their connections to newspaper reviewers, their sales track record (if any). And then when the new book season arrives in autumn, you do the whole thing again, but with different books by different authors.               
	I said to Ilyas, So a book salesman needs to feel passionately about the worth of something for a few weeks, or to be seen to feel passionately about it, and then he has to forget it and move on to the newest batch of stuff that he wants the bookshop to order. And it isnt like selling toothpaste. Every book is different. It must be exhausting, this continual change in passionate belief.         
	Sounds just like the world of finance, Ilyas said. You believe in a product until it goes wrong, and then you believe in something else.         
	Given the current plight of neo-liberal capitalism, it may be that Ilyass Marxist beliefs offer a useful back-stop. In a country where every major political party signed up to the financial system that broke it, we shall need some time to find out.

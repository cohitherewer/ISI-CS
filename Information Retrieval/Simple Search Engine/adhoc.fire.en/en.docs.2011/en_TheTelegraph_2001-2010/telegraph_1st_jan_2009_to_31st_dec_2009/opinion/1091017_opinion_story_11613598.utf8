	Spreading sweetness and light                  
	Sir  Diwali lights up the lives of several people. Families come together, exchange gifts and pleasantries, but they also indulge in lavish spending. Diwali also provides us with an opportunity to think of the poor and the sick, as well as about orphaned children. In keeping with the spirit of the occasion, small neighbourhood units can be set up to impart primary education to some of these deprived children. They can then grow up to become good citizens and join the mainstream of society. Diwali is the best time to start such an initiative.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Ugly slip          
	Sir  Only in India can one die in an intensive care unit, that too not from any medical complication but because of a shutdown of the ventilator as a result of power failure (ICU power cut death, Oct 12). This incident underscores the abysmal state of healthcare in India. Such a horrendous incident would not have occurred in developed nations because the administration would have held the hospital responsible for the colossal blunder. Consequently, the hospital would have had to pay a hefty penalty and also lose its business licence. The situation is quite different in India as there are hardly any checks and balances against medical negligence. The tragedy that took place in the G.B. Pant Hospital will soon be forgotten with little or no punitive action taken against the hospital. A legal case against the hospital seeking financial compensation is not a viable option for ordinary Indians. This is because litigations in lower courts can drag on for years.           
	The Clinical Establishment Act makes it mandatory for ICUs and emergency rooms to have back-up power in case of sudden electricity failure. It is not clear whether the Delhi hospital had a standby generator for the ICU. If not, this in itself is a violation of the law. It is also possible that despite having a generator, the ventilator stopped working because of a failure on the part of hospital employees to switch it on.          
	Despite the fact that private healthcare institutions are flourishing,the overall standard of healthcare in India remains pitiful. Reports of gross medical negligence appear almost daily. Medical councils in India primarily function to shield their errant members without caring for the lives of the patients. The political leaders must realize that unless a degree of accountability is introduced within the medical system, anyone can become a victim of medical malpractice in India.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  China recently celebrated the 60th anniversary of the founding of the Peoples Republic, but it has been reported that Chinese citizens were a part of the celebrations only as spectators. This is certainly peculiar. It is often said that India is mired in poverty and corruption. But can it be said that there are no poor people in China, especially when its booming, export-based economy is dependent on cheap, regimented labour?           
	Moreover, even though redressals are few, Indians come to know of the corrupt deeds of their leaders due to the existence of relatively free and fair media. It is doubtful whether Chinese citizens are aware of this story: President Hu Jintaos son operated a State-controlled company, which supplies scanners to Namibia. But Namibias consent to import such scanners was ensured by a soft loan granted to that country by China.           
	This is just one example of a secret that has now been revealed to the outside world. It is likely that the Chinese, too, will learn that their nation is far from perfect.           
	Yours faithfully,

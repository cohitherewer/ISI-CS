                                                                                                                 FOCUSED ELSEWHERE                                                          
	They have a nice way of putting things. Researchers from Radboud University in the Netherlands have found the most scientifically intimidating words to dress up mens stupidity. No woman in the history of the world can ever have doubted that men are a little soft in the head. And they lose it completely if there is an attractive woman around. These, of course, are the braver of the species; they deserve the fair. An equal number of heterosexual men will turn tail and run, if not physically then metaphorically, when there is a likelihood of their having to rub shoulders with a good-looking woman.        
	But the researchers, whose study has been published in the Journal of Experimental and Social Psychology, have protected mens dignity by saying that their cognitive functioning temporarily declines after talking to a beautiful woman because they use up most of their cognitive resources in trying to impress her. That is enough to cow the layman, but the phenomenon itself surely did not entail new research. What would have happened to the universe of uproarious romantic comedy if the silliness of men had not been common knowledge since the beginning of time? Where would Rosalind have been if she could not affectionately deplore Orlandos bad verses, stuck on tree trunks in her praise? Perhaps psychologists had thought they were free of the weaknesses that afflict lesser men. The research was initiated when a psychologist in the university found he could not remember his own address when the lady he was trying to impress wanted to know it. It would, perhaps, have been more fun if the experiment had been carried out on homosexual men.        
	But that would have destroyed another pet theory. The excuse for stupidity, the researchers say, is that when men meet a pretty woman, they are reproductively focused. That would not work for homosexual men meeting attractive members of the same sex. By itself, the reproductively focused excuse is a dead giveaway. Research has already said that it is women who are perennially focused on reproduction, and forever in search of a mate who will be a dependable provider and a good father. So, in this case, reproductively focused presumably means focused on getting into  or on to  a suitable piece of furniture with the lady in question. Women seem to have no cognitive blips on meeting an attractive man for they are busy assessing him for long-term purposes. So that would mean sharpened faculties.        
	It is a relief that life is so little like research results. Heterosexuality would lose half its charm if women looked at men only as potential fathers, with no thought of an immediate tumble in cattle fodder or on a particular piece of furniture. Getting weak in the knees is hardly an exclusively male thrill.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Time to set the record straight
                                                                                                                 TIME TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT                                  THIS ABOVE ALL - Khushwant Singh                          Loose tongue                                        
	I was appalled to read the language used by Rita Bahuguna Joshi, the head of the Congress in Uttar Pradesh, while speaking about the chief minister of the state, Mayavati. The fact that Mayavati herself is prone to using similar language  she called Mahatma Gandhi a natakbaz  was no excuse.        
	Bahuguna Joshi should have realized herself that she had crossed the limits of decency, and tendered an apology  that would have been the Gandhian thing to do. Instead, she chose to say that she had not meant to say what she said and has been misunderstood. I hoped that Digvijay Singh would pull her up and apologize on her behalf. On the contrary, he supported Bahuguna Joshi and tried to divert the focus from her speech to the attack on her house by Mayavatis supporters. I hope Sonia Gandhi will set the record straight. She should either sack Bahuguna Joshi or at least publicly reprimand her. That will restore the image of the Congress as a party that maintains certain standards of rectitude.        
	Why are so many of our political leaders so loose-tongued? Does it not occur to them that by using bad language they lower themselves in the peoples eyes and in the esteem of the party they belong to?                
	The Virani saga                
	Pinki Virani is Muslim. Her husband, Shankar Aiyar, a senior executive with India Today, is a Tamil Brahmin. When I met Pinki for the first time, I asked her how the marriage was working out since both had stuck to their respective faiths. Fine! Just fine, she replied. I say my namaz in one room, he tinkles bells to his deities in the other. No problems, whatsoever. I was happy to hear it. The more Hindu-Muslim marriages, the better. I find conversions demeaning.        
	Pinki started off as a steno-typist, rose to become an editor and finally, an author. Her first book, Arunas Story, is a true account of a staff nurse who was raped and left to die by an employee whom she had warned repeatedly for neglecting his duties. Aruna has been in coma for 31 years  a living corpse. Pinkis account of Arunas trauma and suffering is a truly heart-rending tale, a classic of its genre.        
	Deaf Heaven is her fourth book and her first work of fiction.        
	It is ingenious in many ways. Its time frame is limited to a long weekend in which a lady librarian dies unattended in the library and her body is found the following Monday. It is ingenious in its variety of characters: a girl with a cleft lip, two starlets who make it to the top, producers, directors on the casting couch. The book is also about their talents. There are male filmstars reminiscent of the Bachchans and of the Kapoor family. There is a lady beautician who reminds one of Shahnaz Hussain, and a family, which having made its fortune in Mumbai, move to Delhi and try a shortcut to nobility by becoming polo players and sponsors of polo teams. Above all, Deaf Heaven is ingenious in its language  a khichdi of English and the languages used by the urban middle class of Chennai, Calcutta, Delhi and Mumbai. The novel makes joyful reading and keeps you smiling from page one to the last.                
	Honour at stake                 
	Bill and Sam, two elderly friends, met in the park everyday to feed the pigeons, watch the squirrels and discuss the worlds problems. One day, Bill didnt show up. Sam didnt think much about it and figured that Bill might have had a cold or something. But after Bill hadnt shown up for a week or so, Sam really got worried. However, since the only time they ever got together was in the park, Sam didnt know where Bill lived, and so was unable to find out what had happened to him.        
	A month had passed, and Sam figured he had seen the last of Bill. But one day, Sam approached the park and  lo and behold  there sat Bill! Sam was very excited and happy to see Bill and told him so.        
	Then he said, crying out loud, Bill, what in the world happened to you? Bill replied, I have been in jail. Jail? cried Sam. What in the world for? Well, Bill said, you know Mary, that cute little blonde waitress at the coffee shop where I sometimes go? Yeah, said Sam, I remember her. What about her? Well, one day, she filed rape charges against me. At 89 years of age, I was so proud that when I got to the court, I pleaded guilty.        
	The judge served me a sentence of 30 days for perjury.

                                                                                                                 SOFT SPOT                                                    
	Where Hafiz Saeed, the leader of the Jamaat-ud-Dawa, is concerned, Pakistan seems to be taking two steps backward for every step forward. Shortly before countries began congregating for the United Nations general assembly in New York, Pakistan came out of stupor and allowed the Faisalabad police authorities to lodge two successive first information reports against the JuD chief. This is the first time that the Anti-terrorism Act has been invoked against the JuD leader, who is also a prime suspect in the Mumbai terror attack. Unfortunately, there is not a whiff of Mumbai in the charges levelled against Saeed, who has been accused of preaching jihad and soliciting funds for it. Like so many other times before, the legal ambiguity neither makes it imperative for the government to throw the suspect behind bars nor for the JuD leader to become a peace-monger. The exact nature of Saeeds confinement, to which both Pakistans prime minister and interior minister have testified, continues to be uncertain. To compound confusion, there have been reports of the JuD chief being a prominent guest at the iftar of the army top brass in Rawalpindi. Even more strangely, the Pakistan president continues to vouch for his commitment to bring Saeed to trial at international conferences.        
	Pakistans recent step against the JuD chief is, perhaps, an exigency measure that was needed to push India to the table at the forthcoming foreign-secretary level meeting in New York. Pakistan had made similar efforts prior to the prime ministers meet at Sharm el-Sheikh. It is unfortunate that Hafiz Saeed has been allowed to become the sole determinant of India-Pakistan re-engagement. Pakistans determination to stall Saeeds trial is only matched by Indias insistence on it as a precondition to take the talks further. While Pakistan thinks any action against Saeed would be interpreted as a sellout to India, the latter feels it cannot be seen giving Pakistan the advantage by allowing it a leeway on Saeed. The refusal of the United States of America to stoke the fires in Kashmir or to dictate the speed of the bilateral talks may have given India the confidence to pressure Pakistan to move faster on the terror trials. This is, undoubtedly, necessary. But holding the entire peace process ransom to the fate of one particular terror suspect will do a greater service to the terror machinery than to peace.

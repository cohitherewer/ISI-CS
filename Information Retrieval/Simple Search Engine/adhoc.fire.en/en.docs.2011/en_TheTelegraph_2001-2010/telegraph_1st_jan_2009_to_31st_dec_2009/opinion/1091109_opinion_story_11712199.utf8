	The honourable justices of the Supreme Court passed a resolution in 1997 that they would declare their assets to the Chief Justice of India. An applicant asked the chief information commissioner under the Right to Information Act whether they were doing so; the CIC referred the question to the CJI. The justices demurred, but the Delhi High Court upheld the CICs direction on September 2. On November 1, all the judges declared their assets, excluding H.S. Bedi. The assets they have declared are, on the whole, reassuringly reasonable. The declaration shows that their misgivings about public opinion were unjustified. The calmness, bordering on boredom, with which the people have taken the declaration, should give the judges assurance that they can be bolder. They will no doubt wish to sustain the public confidence they have generated; the best way to do so is to keep the asset statements updated. Most income-tax payers estimate their assets annually when they prepare their accounts for income tax authorities; the justices are no doubt no exception. It would require no additional effort if they declare their assets whenever they submit returns.        
	Many judges hold shares, which is not surprising. Some hold shares in Reliance Industries, which is also understandable since the company has a reputation for rewarding its shareholders well. All Indians are allowed to hold its shares without anybodys permission; the honourable justices are no exception. The dispute between Mukesh Ambani, who in essence controls Reliance, and his younger brother, Anil Ambani, over the division of their family assets has travelled through the courts to the Supreme Court. At least two judges have recused themselves from this matter on grounds of conflict of interest. The presumption is that they or their family members own Reliance shares, and that they fear that a judgment in the matter might be construed as having been influenced by their material interest in the company.        
	These recusals are voluntary and gratuitous; no one asked for them. The fear on which they are based has no basis in fact; no one, not even Ram Jethmalani, has ever suggested that a judge cannot judge fairly a case relating to a company in which he holds shares. Even if some legal vulture were to make the allegation, the judges can be sure that the people of this country will dismiss it with the contempt it deserves. If, nevertheless, a judge is concerned, it is open to him to sell his Reliance holdings, for which there is a ready market. Since the justices have been concerned about public opinion, it would not be a bad idea if all judges moved away from investing in individual companies; there are many mutual funds that can serve their needs equally well. Since their qualms should be those of every civil servant, the government should perhaps set up a portfolio of kosher mutual funds for them.

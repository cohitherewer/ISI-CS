The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A clash of civilizations
                                                                                                                 A CLASH OF CIVILIZATIONS                                  This above all - Khushwant Singh                          For mortals and immortals alike                                        
	The word, fundoo, is yet to find a place in the Oxford English Dictionary. It was coined in Pakistan. It is derived from fundamentalism and is used to describe religious bigots. In Pakistan, it denotes people with Taliban mentality who try to impose their archaic beliefs in the shariat on a rapidly modernizing, urban society. We borrowed it from the Pakistanis to denote similar groups of bigoted Hindus (also Sikhs) who likewise try to impose their medieval concepts of behaviour on free-thinking, Westernized Indians.         
	In both Pakistan and India, their principal targets are young women. In Pakistan, they want them to be encaged in burqas, remain uneducated and unexposed to Western influences. In India, they want women to refrain from drinking, dancing or putting on clothes that expose too much of their bodies. Their methods are the same. They do not care two paise for the law of the land, rough up their victims, and vandalize cafs, shops and cinema houses. They dare governments to arrest them. Governments rarely call the bluff on their actions because they also command a lot of votes. It is, in fact, a clash of civilizations on a national scale  the dying past and the emerging future.        
	We have seen the Shiv sainiks and Bajrang Dalis in action. Now we have the Sri Ram Sena in Mangalore. Its hooligans stormed into a caf aptly named Amnesia (forgetfulness), chanted prayer and went for the women guests. After roughing them up, they tore up the place and laughed heartily. Their leader shamelessly justified their actions. Some of them have been arrested and will be tried under the goonda act. A few may be sent to jail. But we know that in India, anyone who has been jailed comes out a hero.        
	What should be the most suitable punishment for these lawless elements? I believe they should be exposed to public ridicule. Strip them naked and whack them on their bare buttocks. A few slaps would be enough to make them the laughing stock in their localities. Anyone who has had to expose his bottom to public gaze will thereafter never be taken seriously, he will be scoffed at as chooterwala  one with buttocks.                
	Gods own tree                
	Sometime in the last week of January, I asked my daughter to see if any trees in Lodhi Gardens were in flower. She goes for a walk to the park every afternoon. She came back and told me that she did not see any but found one flower lying on the ground. It was pale, creamy white, with many petals, trumpet-shaped and without any fragrance. I promptly announced that it must be a mahua. There is an avenue of mahuas (Madhuca Longifolia), also known as Madhuca Indica or Butter tree. I checked up with Pradip Krishens Trees of Delhi. I was wrong. Mahuas do not flower till March or April. I read more of what he had to say about them. It is probably the most valued tree in the country, providing food and drink to man and beast alike. It grows extensively in the tribal belt across central India. Many tribes, notably the Gonds, eat its flowers raw as food. So do bears, monkeys, deer, nilgai and jackals. It provides butter for cooking. It can be curried, pickled and made into jam (murabba). When fermented, it makes a fiery brew. It was probably mahua that our ancients called somras, drink of the gods. I tried it out once. It was foul-smelling and distasteful. I spat it out. Just about every part of the mahua is useful for humans and animals. Its bark has medicinal properties, its flowers and fruit yield food and drink, and its leaves are woven into plates. It thrives in different climes. So, why is it not grown more extensively?        
	Meanwhile, I still do not know what the flower my daughter picked up was.                
	Young leader                
	On the glowing American horizon,        
	Dawns a new era of hope and communion.        
	Obama, the leader America was waiting for,         
	Emerges from the masses, a rising star.        
	Breaking the barriers of religion and race,        
	Obama smiles, beaming with confidence and grace.        
	Change has come to America, he declares!        
	Elegant orator par excellence,        
	Promises equality, justice and strong defence,        
	And measures to crush agents of violence,        
	Defeat terrorists and their evil designs;        
	Shares Indias desire to isolate centres of crime.        
	Facing challenging tasks at this crucial time          
	Violent conflicts, failing banks and economic trends,        
	He seeks the goodwill and support of all nations,        
	Treating them as partners and trusted friends.        
	Obama now personifies Yes, We Can          
	Our youthful worlds best slogan!        
	Now is the time for all statesmen to join hands        
	And say, Yes, We Will and hail the brave new icon!

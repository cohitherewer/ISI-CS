The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Wrong number
                                                                                                                 WRONG NUMBER                                                    
	The prime ministers office has asked the department of telecommunications to get more active in extending mobile banking into rural areas. This is not surprising, coming as it does from a prime minister who sets so much store on innovation. If his dream were to come true, every villager would be able to pay for his daughters wedding on his cellphone. It is an enticing prospect, and one worth pursuing. But his office has made two mistakes. It is not the remit of the department of telecommunications to promote rural banking. Left to itself, it will ask its favourite daughter, Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited, to do it. People have forgotten how, when asked to do the same thing some years ago, the same BSNL had wheeled a few huge discs into a handful of villages, and called it the triumph of rural telephony. It was only when private operators had to compete with the well entrenched BSNL that they ventured into villages and lent cellphones to teashops for commercial operation. Perhaps since he has no competition, the prime minister does not see merits in competition. It is not BSNL he should turn to, but the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India. Admittedly, Trai, being a proper Indian regulator, is better at stopping initiatives than starting them. But this dog is still young, and can learn new tricks.        
	Second, the prime ministers office is obviously unaware of the obstacles the Reserve Bank of India has put in the way of mobile banking. It had a great beginning in this country; a number of operators, not all connected to a telephone operator, had begun local services. Then the RBI swooped in and told them to stop. It allowed a handful of first entrants to continue. But it issued operative guidelines, which gave a monopoly of all future business to its favourite daughters, the banks.        
	The RBI is mistaken. First, banks are an oligopoly. They are not driven to extend their business. There are many other entrepreneurs, brimming with the animal spirits the prime minister so admires, wanting to serve villagers; but the old lady of Mint Street looks down on these energetic youngsters. Second, the mobile payment business is likely, at least in the beginning, to be local; it would tie together local shops and businesses with customers. The banks are national monoliths; they are not attracted to local business. The RBI has signally failed to persuade them to extend rural banking; it is now determined to see that rural mobile payments also fail. Finally, mobile payments would need the same kind of prudential regulation, involving cash reserves and capital requirements, as banks; in its zeal for monopolizing them, the RBI has failed to think about the right regulatory mechanism. It has proved itself entirely unfit to regulate this new business; it should have nothing to do with mobile payment operations.

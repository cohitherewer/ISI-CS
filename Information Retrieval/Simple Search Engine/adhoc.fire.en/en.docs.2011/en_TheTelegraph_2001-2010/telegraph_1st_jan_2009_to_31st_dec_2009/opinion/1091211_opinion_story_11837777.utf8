	Green thoughts                  
	Sir  In Climate effort with several brackets (Dec 7), G.S. Mudur has iterated the widespread fear of climatologists all over the world. With the help of statistical details, Mudur has convincingly portrayed the spectre of disaster looming large over our planet. The spectre can only be exorcized if industrialized countries were to pledge to observe legally binding emission cuts at the Copenhagen conference. Countries that have prospered on carbon energy, spewing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere for decades, must toe the line this time to redeem themselves.The developing countries are committed to remain steadfast on their growth trajectory. Therefore, developed nations need to give them financial and technological aid to help the latter switch over to alternative energies without compromising on development. Developing countries should voluntarily come up with a slew of measures to curb GHG emissions.          
	The problem assumes apocalyptic dimensions for the coastal and low-lying countries. The Maldives is a case in point. This archipelagic nation is in imminent danger of being swamped by surging sea levels if global temperatures rise beyond the permissible 2 degree centigrade. The cabinet members of Maldives staged an underwater meeting recently to draw attention to their fears. It would be inauspicious for the rest of the world to look askance. The worlds powers have converged in Copenhagen, and are playing various games of political brinkmanship. However, the consequences of failure are not lost on anyone. If the ongoing convention fails and the Kyoto Protocol is sabotaged to make way for a new treaty that is less binding on the developed countries, the situation might spin out of control.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  No doubt the summit on climate change in Copenhagen is a landmark meet to discuss issues related to the environment. Any negligence or absence of sincerity on the part of the participating nations will cost the world dearly. Given the situation,what is praiseworthy is the role of the media worldwide in voicing concerns about the prospect of a climatic catastrophe.          
	The people expect the world leaders to achieve consensus and take a series of decisive steps. Such steps, if executed properly, should begin to yield results inside a few years. Restoration of greenery is the path that would lead to people living in harmony with the environment. Tree plantations on a massive scale and a blanket ban on cutting trees, reduction in the number of vehicles as well as the strict regulation of carbon emission would be useful in this respect. Worldwide awareness programmes should also be undertaken. Governments could formulate legislation that would require each citizen to plant at least one sapling every year. Even if half the worlds population starts planting trees and taking care of them, a major change will take place soon enough.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  When every corner of the globe is deeply anxious about the fate of the planets environment and most countries, including India, are taking the pledge to control carbon dioxide emission, many people are neglecting the environment in their own backyards. Many among us do not care to protest against the increasing damage being done to the environment by the indiscriminate felling of trees in localities. I live in a housing estate where at the beginning of each winter, some residents, without any hesitation or the necessary permission, engage in lopping off leaves and branches for the benefit of having temperate sunlight in their homes. Owing to such massive lopping, the trees lose their balance, and some inevitably fall down every year during storms. Complaints to the relevant authorities have been to no avail. Citizens should raise their voices against such a practice, and politicians, too, should come forward to stop such irresponsible acts that lead to the depletion of natural resources. Causing permanent damage to the ecology for the sake of temporary comforts can prove to be a suicidal approach for mankind in the long-run.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  At a time when the conference on climate change in Copenhagen is trying to reduce carbon dioxide emission, the residents of Bidhannagar in Durgapur are being forced to inhale increasing amounts of carbon dioxide from the sponge iron factories in and around the area. The factory smoke is causing harm to countless people and making their daily lives miserable. Several protests lodged by the residents of the area have not been able to stop the factories from spewing the poisonous fumes.          
	One really doesnt know how these establishments get away with violating certain fundamental rules concerning the lives of ordinary people. Perhaps with the world climate summit under way, the citizens could request the state government to take steps to prevent errant industrial houses from jeopardizing the collective health of the people.          
	Yours faithfully,

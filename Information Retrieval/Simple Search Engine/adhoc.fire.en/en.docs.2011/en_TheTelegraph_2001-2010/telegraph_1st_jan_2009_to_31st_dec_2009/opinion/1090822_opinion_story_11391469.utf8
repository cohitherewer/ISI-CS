The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | closing all debate
                                                                                                                 CLOSING ALL DEBATE                                                          
	Lauding local heroes could well turn out to be the last resort of shallow politicians. If the Bharatiya Janata Party expelled Jaswant Singh from the party for writing a book on Mohammad Ali Jinnah, the chief minister of Gujarat, Narendra Modi went a step further and banned the book in his state. Mr Modi believes that Mr Singh has done serious harm to the pride of Gujaratis by penning a few lines of criticism about the role that Vallabhbhai Patel played during the transfer of power negotiations. Patel, according to Mr Modi, is the local hero. (The fact that Patels ideology and politics were at odds with all that Mr Modi has done and stands for is another matter.) Mr Modi obviously believes that Patel is above criticism and discussion: everyone will have to agree with whatever is Mr Modis view of the man. Would Mr Modi be as touchy about a book that was critical of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, another Gujarati and perhaps more eminent than Patel? The point is that Mr Modi sees himself as a strong leader and therefore cast in the same mould as Patel, the so-called iron man. He thus chose to ban a book that voices reservations about Patels role in the events leading to independence.        
	The point has wider implications than Mr Modis hero worship of Patel and the political gains thereof. There have been too many instances in various parts of India displaying prickliness about criticism of and reservations about perceived local heroes. In West Bengal some time ago, issues of Ananda Bazar Patrika were burnt because it carried letters written by Subhas Chandra Bose to his fiance, who later became his wife. The letters had been selected and edited by a niece-in-law of Bose. But this didnt stop some followers of Bose from going on the rampage. In Maharashtra even a whiff of a criticism of Shivaji leads to mob fury. The formula is simple: either hero worship or nothing. This makes mockery of historical interpretation and indeed of all intellectual discussion.        
	It is not just West Bengal, Maharashtra and Gujarat that are afflicted by this malady of deifying local heroes. This tendency also raises the question of seeing men like Patel and Bose as merely provincial politicians. Other parts of India and various groups also show a refusal to accept any criticism of those they see as icons. The affliction has spread from political leaders to other spheres of activity. Witness the furore in West Bengal when Sourav Ganguly was perceived as being badly treated by the selectors and the then coach Greg Chappell. Indians by nature are drawn to modes of looking at the past through the prism of good leader/bad leader. The flip side of such a simplistic notion is the belief that by banning or burning a book genuine criticism can be stopped. Books can be banned or destroyed but ideas cannot be. The banning of a book says more about the insecurities of the perpetrator than anything about the book or its subject.

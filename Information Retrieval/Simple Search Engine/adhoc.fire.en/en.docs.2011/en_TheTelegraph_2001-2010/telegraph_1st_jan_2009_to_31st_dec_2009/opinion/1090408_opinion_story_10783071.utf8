	There were reports in Chinese newspapers and websites in February about an Indian submarine stalking Chinese warships sent to fight piracy in waters off Somalia, and being forced to surface by the latter. Although the reports have been rubbished by the Indian chief of the naval staff, Sureesh Mehta, they point to the undercurrent of tension beneath the veneer of friendliness in relations between the two Asian heavyweights.         
	India had established diplomatic relations with the Peoples Republic of China on April 1, 1950, becoming the first non-communist country to do so. Friendship, however, soon gave way to confrontation and the two countries found themselves involved in a war in 1962, an event both these countries perhaps wish to wipe off their memories now as they try to improve their relation. Dark clouds appeared on the horizon of Sino-Indian relationships in the wake of the nuclear tests carried out by India in 1998, more so because the then prime minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee cited the Chinese threat as one of the reasons behind the tests. China took the lead in drafting the UN Security Council Resolution 1172 which, inter alia, condemned the tests. In 1999, however, the Indian external affairs minister Jaswant Singh, paid a visit to China and the two sides affirmed that the pre-requisite for stronger India-China ties was that each country should refrain from regarding the other as a threat.         
	The year, 2006, was celebrated as the India-China Friendship Year. The defence minister (now foreign minister), Pranab Mukherjee, visited China in May 2006 to commemorate this event. The visit of the Chinese president, Hu Jintao, to India in November 2006 marked the culmination of the Year of Friendship celebrations. President Hus visit gave a definite boost to the economic, political and strategic relations between New Delhi and Beijing.                 
	Mutual trust        
	During his stay, the Chinese leader talked of building trust through trade and also declared that the two countries were not rivals or competitors but partners for mutual benefit.. He proposed a four-point strategy to strengthen the relationship between India and China. This included increasing mutual trust, enhancing business cooperation, boosting cultural and social exchanges, and stepping up friendly consultation for an early settlement of the border issue. India and China also agreed to expand their economic base. China has now overtaken the United States of America as Indias largest trade partner.         
	In the past few years, Sino-Indian relations have been warming, with a flurry of official exchanges covering issues from border disputes to closer trade and political ties. But while it is true that there has been a forward movement in bilateral relations, discordant voices pointing to doubts, and anxieties about each others intentions and actions can be heard even today.         
	The long-standing territorial disputes between the two nations are difficulties that have remained unresolved for more than four decades. India has its share of concerns vis--vis China. China too has its own concerns. For instance, while India is wary of Chinas special relationship with Pakistan, China is suspicious of New Delhis strategic partnership with the US and its implications for Chinas security. The two neighbours also carry the burden of mutual historical mistrusts and misgivings. As the former national security adviser, Brajesh Mishra, has said, a feeling of distrust still pervades Sino-Indian relations. But the question is whether distrust, no matter how deep-rooted the feeling is, is the final word in Sino-Indian relations. The question is whether we are strategizing for security from China or for security with China. At this stage, both the elements are visible on the face of Indias diplomacy vis--vis China.

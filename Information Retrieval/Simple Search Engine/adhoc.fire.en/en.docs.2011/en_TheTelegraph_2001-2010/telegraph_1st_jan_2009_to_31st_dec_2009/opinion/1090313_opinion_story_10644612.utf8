	Footloose in India              
	Fear and Forgiveness: The Aftermath of Massacre (Penguin, Rs 299) by Harsh Mander is not so much about the grim events of 2002 asabout the continuing climate of dread and loathing that pervades [in Gujarat] years after the storm passed. The author was working as a civil servant when the Gujarat riots broke out. He says in the Prologue that his shock at the degree of brutality was all the more intense because he had seen some of his colleagues enabling, even abetting, the slaughter and destruction. However, what is perhaps more appalling than the killings themselves is the injustice to which the victims continue to be subjected to this day. Mander speaks about the traumas that still shadow the sufferers lives and also about the unusual acts of courage and compassion that seem to provide the only ray of hope amidst the overwhelming bleakness. If It is only truth, however ugly, told with unflinching honesty, which would heal their agony, as Mander says, then his book would surely go a long way in helping the victims recover.

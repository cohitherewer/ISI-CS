	Marked absent        
	 A student in a film institute was not allowed to sit for an examination as she did not have the necessary attendance. She filed a writ petition, stating that she had not attended the classes due to pregnancy. She cited the Maternity Benefits Act and the Convention of Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women. The Directive Principles of the Constitution also require the states to provide humane conditions of work in addition to pregnancy and maternity relief. Dismissing the petition, the Madras High Court held that a certain percentage of attendance was required to ensure that the students knew their subjects. It added that whether such benefits could be extended to educational institutions was for the state to decide. The court also said that even if the convention and the statutes were applicable to students, the period of absence did not tally with the usual duration of maternity leave. (A.

	Man at fault        
	 A man succeeded in obtaining a decree for the restitution of conjugal rights, stating that his wife, an independent woman working as a teacher, had started living with her parents. Upon appeal by the wife, the Uttarakhand High Court noted that she had been harassed by her husband on many occasions. The court also found that she had lodged an FIR to that effect. Dismissing the mans petition, the court observed that working as a teacher and not living with her husbands parents did not mean that the woman had withdrawn from her husbands society without good reason.

	Biased banking        
	 When a company defaulted in repaying its loan to a bank, the bank proceeded to take possession of the assets of its retired director although the companys assets as well as those of the present directors were also mortgaged. The Patna High Court held that if a bank preferred one debtor to another without reason, its action was arbitrary and unconstitutional. Quashing the notices, the court held that the bank had to exercise its discretion in a way that no party had cause for complaint. It granted the bank the liberty to reinitiate proceedings against the persons concerned. (Shyam Kishore Prasad vs Bank of Baroda)  
	SOLON

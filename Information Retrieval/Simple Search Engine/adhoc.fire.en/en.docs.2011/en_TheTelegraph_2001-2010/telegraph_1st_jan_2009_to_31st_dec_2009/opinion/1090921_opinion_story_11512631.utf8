                                                                                                                 WAY TO GO                                                    
	It is unlikely that the prime minister will venture out into Pittsburgh, but if he and his team stepped out of their sanitized locales, they would see American democracy at work. Many groups have been negotiating for months with the local authorities to be allowed to demonstrate; the authorities tried to wear them out. Finally, the demonstrators appealed to the federal district court. Seeing the way the wind was blowing, the city permitted three groups. Two of them, the G6 Billion group and the Bail Out the People group, will be allowed to demonstrate, though they cannot invade the south bank of Allegheny River where the leaders would be meeting  and a group of artists may sing and dance in a park. The court allowed Code Pink to set up a tent city in a park for two days, but then they must clear out to make room for another demonstration led by the former vice-president, Al Gore. However, the court refused to let the Three Rivers Climate Convergence camp overnight in a park because that would leave too much rubbish.         
	These proceedings are a reminder that it is not only people in poor countries who have problems. In August, 9.7 per cent of American workers were unemployed  15 per cent if they were black, and 25 per cent if they were teenagers. Unemployment has been rising in all industrial countries, although it has not reached the United States of Americas level anywhere except in France. That is on definitions used by the US; if the official statistics of other countries are taken, unemployment exceeds 12 per cent in Ireland, and 18 per cent in Spain.        
	There will be much discussion in G20 on global finance. The leaders will be briefed by the Financial Services Board that they have recently created; the press too will hear much about money matters. It is relevant to infuse new life into the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and to consider a new international currency. But none of this is urgent; its relevance arises from the fact that national crises spill out into the international field. A robust global financial system may serve to limit contagion. Official thinking on this question is still running in rather conventional channels  that what is needed is a younger version of the Washington sisters. But institutions designed to bail out countries in economic crises have to follow some rules, and those rules cannot be any different from those that have been followed for 60 years: namely, countries should be given emergency aid but forced to mend their ways. What has been missed is the cause of the crises. They invariably involve inability to service debt. For some good reasons, global debt flows are far larger than equity flows; it is their ratio that needs to be changed for world economic stability. How to do it  that is the question G20 should be asking itself.

                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Still there                  
	Sir  Even after the Supreme Court order stating that construction of memorials at disputed sites in Lucknow be stopped till the final verdict, work appears to be going on still (Statue-stung SC reads Delhi act to Maya, Oct 7). The attitude of the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, Mayavati, seems to convey that she does not want intervention from any quarter. Not even the apex courts order can deter her in this regard. In the face of such defiance, the Supreme Court had no option but to initiate contempt proceedings against the UP government. It has summoned the chief secretary of UP, Atul Gupta, to appear in court on November 4.           
	People might wonder why the chief secretary, instead of Mayavati, who is running the state in her whimsical way, was summoned. As an elected representative of the people, Mayavati is expected to act in accordance with the constitutional provisions. But her government has been flagrantly violating court orders which amounts to the violation of constitutional norms. Her government, therefore, is answerable to the judiciary for its unconstitutional conduct.           
	The Supreme Courts move against Mayavatis government should be an eye-opener for all political parties. Political leaders should realize that they are not above the law.          
	Yours faithfully,        Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad               
	Sir  The Supreme Courts decision to stop construction activities at various memorials in UP is a welcome step. However, this decision is not likely to help much because most of the memorials are either completed or are nearing completion by now.           
	Crores of rupees have already been wasted on these structures. Numerous acres of land have also been wasted which could have been otherwise utilized for building software parks and low-cost housing for the poor, for instance.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Job hunt          
	Sir  The report Jobless dam bursts in city, (Oct 14), reflects more than the present scenario of pervasive unemployment in India. It also shows the great disparity between the public and the private sector. Many Indians slog it out in the private sector, with little security and arbitrary pecuniary benefits, whereas the government, through successive recommendations of the pay commission, has ensured that its employees, at every level, take home substantial pay packets. Government jobs also provide certain standard benefits and security.           
	It is ironic that it is the tax paid by those working in the private sector that pays for the heavy salaries of employees working in government institutions. One hopes that the government would introduce some parity between the pay packets of private and public sector employees at every level.           
	Yours faithfully,        Sudipta Bhattacharyya, Calcutta               
	Sir  That unemployment is the greatest threat today is no news. What is significant is the proportion it has assumed  which is directly influencing the quality of the nations workforce. Any citizen who has passed Class VIII is entitled to take the test for the posts of the Group D employees for which thousands had swarmed to the public service commission office in Calcutta on October 13. Many of the aspirants were graduates or post-graduates. The disparity between the required and actual qualification of the candidates clearly brings out the pathetic job situation in the state.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Abhirup Bhunia, Calcutta

                
	What money cannot buy          
	Sir  It is unfortunate that in the article, A road not yet travelled, (Oct 13), Bhaskar Dutta says that the salaries of faculty members of educational institutions in India should match the standards of pay current in the United States of America. He also thinks that if India cannot afford to pay its teachers high salaries, they would join the foreign institutions when they set up campuses here. They may even run off to the US. While comparing the salaries of Indian and American teachers, Dutta has forgotten to ask whether our drivers, labourers, doctors and journalists get salaries that match US standards. Why plead the case for teachers alone when it is evident that nobody in India gets salaries at par with what Americans get?          
	To blame low salaries of teachers for the poor standards of education is to take a shallow view of the matter. Although teachers salaries were abysmally low earlier, they have recently been raised quite substantially. So the complaint of poor salary no longer holds good. Moreover, huge research grants are often made available to institutions these days, but are rarely used properly.           
	If there is a single reason behind the deterioration of the education system in India, it is the lack of dedication and integrity among teachers. There are grounds to believe that this erosion of values has occurred only after the salary was improved. As in all spheres of society, a general lack of accountability has gripped the education sector. One should not blame the scale of pay for it.           
	Yours faithfully,         Deba Pratim Ghatak, Durgapur

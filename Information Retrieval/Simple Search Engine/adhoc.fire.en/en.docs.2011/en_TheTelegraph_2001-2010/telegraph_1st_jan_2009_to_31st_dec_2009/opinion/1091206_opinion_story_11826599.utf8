The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | the mountain and the sea
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        THE MOUNTAIN AND THE SEA                                                          
	The cabinets of two countries have held meetings in extraordinary surroundings. In the middle of October, the government of the Maldives held a cabinet meeting underwater. On Friday, December 4, the prime minister of Nepal held a special cabinet meeting at 17, 192 feet, close to the Everest base camp. On the face of it, both these events might appear to be gimmicks or stunts to grab headlines in the media. What such an evaluation overlooks is the intention behind the decisions to hold cabinet meetings underwater and close the highest mountain in the world. Both the president of the Maldives and the prime minister of Nepal wanted to draw attention to the serious threat to the environment posed by the indifference and negligence of ordinary human beings and of politicians who determine policies of nations.        
	In the case of the Maldives, the prospect of going under water is an imminent one  not something that can be postponed to some time in the distant future. The islands that make up the Maldives stand at an average of only seven feet above sea level. This means that if, thanks to global warming, the global water level rises to that of a rather tall human being, the better part of the Maldives will sink into the sea. The havoc in terms of lives and dislocation that will cause is mind-boggling. The purpose of making the cabinet meet on the sea floor was to send out an SOS to the world, before the forthcoming climate change conference in Copenhagen. As the president of the Maldives said without any undue exaggeration, If the Maldives cannot be saved today we do not feel that there is much of a chance for the rest of the world. The world can write off the underwater cabinet meeting as a stunt only at its own peril.        
	The motive for the meeting at Kalapatthar, a few hours away from the great Khumbu Ice Fall, was also to draw attention to the plight of the environment. The Nepalese ministers wanted to draw attention to what was happening to glaciers under the impact of global warming. According to the Indian Space Research Organization, the Gangotri glacier has receded 1.5 kilometres in the last three decades. This figure is alarming since it shows that the glacier has been receding much faster than any one ever apprehended. The melting of the glaciers is a phenomenon that has wide-ranging implications for human beings and the environment.        
	The meeting in Copenhagen seems to be fated to end in some kind of stalemate, camouflaged though it will be by pious utterances. Climate change and its consequences remain mired in controversy with every country, developed or developing, thinking in purely nationalistic terms. Climate change threatens all homo sapiens, that is why cabinet meetings underwater and in high altitude thin air have an importance beyond the purely symbolic.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | From the hollow to the core
                                                                                                                 FROM THE HOLLOW TO THE CORE                                                                  
	Caged Phoenix: Can India Fly? By Dipankar Gupta, Viking, Rs 550        
	A professor at the Centre for the Study of Social Systems, Jawaharlal Nehru University, Dipankar Gupta is also a columnist for several Indian newspapers including this daily. This book was written during a term he spent in the fall of 2007 at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, DC. It is, without doubt, a term well spent.        
	Indias growth story has captured the imagination of the world of late. While growth is indeed impressive, what we need to ask is why this growth is not translating into development? Why does India remain caged in backwardness and subjected to its undelivering democracy? In todays world of politically correct stances, foreign scholars are careful regarding what they state about people in developing countries. Hence, negative remarks about Indians are rare and their inherent incapacity to deal with democracy, secularism, and for that matter any impersonal formal institution is not brought to light. Solutions to all social issues in India are needlessly drenched in idiosyncratic history, tradition, mindsets and folklore and the tendency to find the exotic about everything Indian. They are not. The ayurveds were not much different from the Portuguese doctors who came to Akbars court in the 16th century. The tribals of south-west Kerala do not have any special relationship with nature  which is said to have prevented them from being drowned during the tsunami of 2004. They too perished like the rest.        
	The Hollowed Village offers a deep insight into the countryside and how villages are emptying  except possibly in Punjab  as agriculture does not provide a sustainable future for rural folk who are heading for the sweatshops in urban India. The quality of life and earning opportunities in the worst city-slums are better than in the villages they leave behind. Moreover, there is hope of a better life in future. Because economic development everywhere else in the world is usually associated with labour shifts out of agriculture, India is not unique. But this is occurring much faster and is much more widespread than acknowledged.        
	Caste is another issue which Gupta has tackled head on and he offers some interesting critiques. He asserts that caste alone cannot determine political outcome in an election. There is no caste large enough to form a political majority in either a legislative or parliamentary constituency. At best, Yadavs account for 20 per cent and Jats eight per cent of the electorate in certain constituencies. Moreover, there is no love lost between them. Then there is the Scheduled Caste which is not, as is commonly mistaken, one voting block. There is untouchability among untouchables too. Affirmative actions from 1947 to 1989 have outlived their utility, and post-Mandal reservation policy is only reinforcing caste differences and damaging the social fabric. Modern urban and rural life as well blurs and obliterates caste difference, he asserts.        
	Gupta is no less forthright when he delves into politics. Better public delivery of public goods is what the electorate looks forward to. The Gujarat chief minister, Narendra Modi, is a popular leader and he is not presiding over a deeply divided Hindu electorate. Under his leadership, Gujarat has progressed economically and large sections of the population believe he has directly contributed to their welfare. There is widespread acclaim for him in small villages where residents receive piped water and no longer have to wait endlessly for water tankers to arrive so that they can carry numerous bucketfuls to their homes. Irrigation facilities too have improved vastly, changing the fortunes of agriculturists in what was till recently, a poverty-stricken and arid area. Village telephone exchanges, power stations and better transit systems linking town and country have been added. Voters can see and feel the difference in their lives. If other parties are to dislodge him, they will need to excel in meeting the economic and developmental needs of the electorate and not harp on his perceived lack of secular credentials.         
	The myth that India has a large middle class, numbering somewhere between 200 to 300 million, is debunked effectively. Most of Indias growth is accounted for by the services sector and the small-scale unorganized sweatshops while the organized manufacturing sector has remained relatively small. With the much-vaunted information technology sector providing around three million jobs only, the numbers just do not add up.         
	Like most informed and concerned citizens, Gupta points a finger at the low levels of public investment in health and education. The cities and villages are filthy and are possibly similar to what Europe and the US were a century ago. In policymaking towards their cleaning up, we are like that only seems to be the order of the day. He rightly points out that affluence came to the West only when general standards rose across all social classes. For India too, the rules are the same. Being more focused on debunking popular myths, the book is light on policy prescription. Nevertheless, when the last word is read and the book set aside, very few will dispute that it is about time we opened the cage and let the phoenix fly.                          SATRUJIT BANERJEE

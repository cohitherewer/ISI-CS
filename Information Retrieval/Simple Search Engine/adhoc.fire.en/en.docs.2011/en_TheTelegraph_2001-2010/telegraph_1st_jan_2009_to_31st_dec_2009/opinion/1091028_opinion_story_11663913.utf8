The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Pick of the Crop
                                                                                                                 PICK OF THE CROP                                  STEPHEN HUGH-JONES                              
	Two weeks ago, I deplored the growing British habit of using the wrong preposition, notably to, in place of the right one. Here are three new examples that Ive gathered even since writing  and they were only the pick of the crop. One told me that a local sports club, though doing well, was losing ground on the league leaders. No doubt the writer had gaining ground in mind. But he was mistaken. If you must use the phrase, you could say losing ground to. But that would still sound a bit odd. In war, you may literally lose ground to the opposing army. In commerce, you may lose it metaphorically to some trade rival; Britain to Germanys exporters, say, or India to Chinas. But those are cases where your loss indeed goes to the other party. Not so in a football league table. Why not just say plain falling behind?        
	Two more cases came from my favourite semi-literate London newspaper. One spoke of crickets apparent obsession on being the new football. That is weird. Fixation or concentration on, expectation or hope of, pleasure in, wonder at, but obsession with. The other one was crazier still: Louis Mountbatten, it seems, was Viceroy to India. He wasnt. You can be Russias ambassador to India, Australias high commissioner in India (though to might be allowable there) or an aide to either of these grandees. But Mountbatten was viceroy of, just as today Pratibha Patil is president of.        
	But right now Im bored with, indeed tired of, collecting illiteracies. The intricacies of the correct preposition are just as great, and more useful to know. When, for example, should you say pleased with and when pleased by? Pleased with is natural in phrases such as Im pleased with you or Im pleased with my new clothes; it suggests a lasting state of contentment. Pleased by tends to suggest a more definite feeling and cause: in a novel, Im always pleased by a strong plot. More definite and maybe shorter: she was pleased by his warm welcome. In this sense, pleased by can become pleased at, though this is less common.        
	In contrast, one may be angry at, or angered by (angered at is possible but rarer). But angry with can only be directed at some personal or at least living object of discontent: Im angry with him; or I was angry with my dog when it bit my neighbour. You may be worried by your son or by his drinking. You may equally be worried about your son, or about his drinking; the circumstances  that he has no job, say, or that he drinks too much  rather than the son or the drinking in themselves. And you cant be worried with at all.        
	Things normally happen in a country or region or a large city, but at a small place: we met in India, in West Bengal, in Calcutta. In contrast we met at Chhotapur or at the station. But this depends on the context. What is large or small? Do both speaker and listener know the place? I might well say to my Scottish cousins lets meet in Largs (a small town that we all know), at the station. You meet at a bus-stop, at or on a beach, in a wood or field.        
	Countless verbs vary in meaning according to the preposition that follows them: think of run across (in the sense of finding by chance), run by (your scheme, by the sales manager), run into (that is, meet by chance), run on (as epic poems do), run over, run through (the figures, or the rival swordsman), run to (earth, or seed, or maybe lakhs of rupees), run up (large bills).        
	On top of all this come the familiar Anglo-American differences: the Yanks free up, head up, meet with, speak with, visit with and others, where Britons free, head, meet, speak to (though they may speak with, to make plain that both parties did the speaking  few of us will speak to Queen Elizabeth for 25 minutes), or plain visit. And more.        
	One could fill a dictionary with all this, which is indeed a large part of the lexicographers job. But neither The Telegraph nor I have the inclination or the space. Which is something readers may be content with, happy at, pleased by, or thankful for.

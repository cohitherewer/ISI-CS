The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Nuances in Xinjiang
                                                                                                                 NUANCES IN XINJIANG                          - Chinas nationalism is still shaped by memories of defeat					 					      Rana Mitter                        Refusing to be second-class				                                                   
	Back in the eighth century, during Chinas Tang dynasty, many great poets wrote about the pain of being sent away to the far west of the empire, whether as officials on duty, or as political exiles. Over a thousand years later, Chinas far western regions still hold an ambivalent place in the countrys collective mind.         
	Over the last few weeks, the world has been astonished to see a city in China, a country that many think of as a highly controlled State, erupting into riots. The response of the authorities has been swift and decisive: armed police are patrolling the streets of Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang province, and thousands of ethnic Uighurs are fleeing to the interior of the province. Its been made clear that the Chinese State will tolerate no opposition to its rule, and it blames separatists or splittists for the trouble. But behind this story of instant response and repression is a more complex reality.         
	The events in Urumqi bear a superficial resemblance to the uprising in Tibet in March last year. But unlike those events, the Urumqi riots were not primarily about a desire for separation from the Chinese State. They were about an issue that Chinese officialdom finds much harder to deal with: racial discrimination. Officially, China is a multicultural society with 55 different minorities. In fact, the dominant ethnic Chinese (Han) make up around 93 per cent of the population, and show great diversity even among themselves. In fact, many ethnic groups do coexist quite peacefully in China. However, there are some groups whose presence within China has been problematic throughout history. Tibetans are one clear example. Another is the Uighurs, a Turkic people who live mostly in the Xinjiang province on Chinas far western border.              
	The Chinese State declares that Xinjiang, and its entire population, are unequivocally Chinese citizens. Separatist activists within Xinjiang suggest that the region ought to be independent from China. Both positions are stark versions of a more nuanced historical reality. Its certainly true that Uighurs have their own language and script, and many (though not all) do not feel culturally Chinese. However, Uighurs live all over China, not just in Xinjiang. If you go to Beijing, its easy to find areas of the city where the food, drink, and music are all Uighur. Just as easy to find are the migrant workers from the region who are working in the boom cities of the south. It was that interaction that led to the riots earlier this month. Uighur migrant workers had been brought into a toy factory in Shaoguan, a city in Guangdong province, thousands of miles away from Xinjiang, and tensions flared between Han Chinese and Uighur workers over work conditions. A disturbing film appeared on YouTube which seemed to show two Uighur workers being chased and brutally attacked by Han Chinese colleagues.         
	For many Uighurs, this struck a chord. Despite the rhetoric of equality, there is a strong feeling among many ethnic minorities in China that they are treated as second-class citizens. The State often uses rather clumsy ideas to celebrate ethnic diversity: a particular favourite is the love of singing and dancing which various minority groups are supposed to possess, the whole thing described in official propaganda rather like an old-fashioned tourist brochure for a safari. There is often a deeply insensitive, even deliberate attempt to bulldoze (literally) old cultural traditions, such as the recent plan to raze many of the traditional winding alleys in the old city in Kashgar, one of the great cities of the Silk Road, and replace them with a Chinese boulevard and modern office blocks. The impetus for this is largely from the continuing Chinese obsession with technological modernization. Although Chinas Communist Party has long since ceased to believe in social equality or revolutionary change, it has maintained its longstanding assumption that they must show how far the country has come by rejecting most of its past. A little is kept for the purposes of heritage, but much of Chinas history, from the alleyways of traditional Beijing to the magnificent scenery of the Three Gorges of the southwest, has been destroyed to make way for ever larger highways, high-speed trains, and dams. The Uighur heritage in Xinjiang has also been a victim of this drive for secular modernization, which remains unsentimental about the past and peoples attachment to it. But many Uighurs feel that what the Han Chinese do to their own culture is their own business, but that they have no right to reshape a culture that has thousands of years of its own history.        
	Ironically, though, its the issues on which the State has tried to give the Uighurs privileges over their Han compatriots that have sparked tensions at more grassroots levels. The opening-up of China so that labourers can move more freely has enabled poorer Uighurs to try their luck elsewhere in China, particularly in the booming southern and coastal regions. And ethnic minorities are given more leeway under the countrys strict one-child policy: they can often have two or more children. This has led to repeated clashes with poor Chinese who feel that their Uighur fellow-citizens are getting a more favourable deal. In truth, the conditions they are fighting over  ill-paid work in appalling conditions in unsafe factories  are hardly something to aspire to. But in a country with no safety net, ethnic differences become another source of conflict for people who are fighting to rise even a little from the bottom of society.        
	Theres another aspect of the story that makes it a very 21st-century tale: technology. The distance between Shaoguan, where the race conflict began, and Urumqi, scene of the riots, is several thousand kilometres. But over the past decade, China has become wired. Theres near-100 per cent penetration for mobile phones, and although the internet is a more middle-class preserve, it now has millions of users. It didnt take long for Uighur viewers in Urumqi to find out what had happened in Shaoguan, and start their protests. The Chinese State has been relieved that international sympathy for the Uighurs has been more muted than that for the Tibetans last year, not least because it seems clear that there was significant violence by Uighurs against Hans in Urumqi, although this aspect has been publicized much more than the response of Han violence against Uighurs. But the availability of easy communication also raises the possibility of further race riots somewhere else in China that the State cant predict  as authoritarian states go, China is much less effective than it likes to proclaim. Technology brings its own social troubles along with greater convenience.              
	In the short term, the Chinese State will succeed in crushing protest on the streets of Urumqi. The Uighur cause simply doesnt have the political traction to attract sympathy within China. But the underlying cause wont go away. In a sense, the Chinese government understands the problem when it states so determinedly that the Uighurs and Xinjiang are unalterably parts of Chinese territory. There is a perfectly valid case that China and Central Asia are closely linked by ties of history and culture. Even during the Tang dynasty, considered Chinas greatest period of cultural flourishing, wearing clothes and marrying spouses from Central Asia and even India was regarded as the height of cultural sophistication. For centuries, China has been a Eurasian power, and its new role at the helm of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, which binds Beijing, Moscow, and the Central Asian states, is one nod toward recovering that role. The Chinese government could do more to recover that historical heritage today, and use it as a powerful argument against separatism. But it needs to understand that the Tang flourished because it accepted outside culture as an equal part of its own culture. For a century and a half, China has felt on the defensive about its identity and territory because of its experience of being invaded by the West and then Japan. Now it is in transition to a stronger role, but its nationalism is still shaped by memories of defeat and humiliation. China needs to develop a sense of national pride that is positive and fuelled by a genuine appreciation of its status as a multicultural society.

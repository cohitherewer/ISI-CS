                                                                                                                 FOREIGN AFFAIRS GONE BAD                                  CHINA DIARY - NEHA SAHAY                              
	A sleepy little town in Guangdong has suddenly become the focus of attention. A 22-year-old American, who came to China last year to teach English, has been sentenced to three years imprisonment, after which he will be deported. This little town has so few foreigners that none of the international coffee shops that dot Chinas big cities has thought it worthwhile to open a branch here. But somehow, foreigners tend to land in trouble here. This is also the town where two Indians were sentenced to death (now changed to life imprisonment) for drug trafficking.        
	A fierce debate is ranging among expats about the crime and its punishment. The crime  the American tried to blackmail his Chinese student with whom he had sex by threatening to release her semi-nude pictures (which he had taken on his mobile) to a Chinese website unless she continued their relationship, or paid him 100,000 yuan. What provoked him was her reluctance to get into a relationship  she told him she already had a boyfriend. The girl paid him 30,000 yuan but he refused to hand over the memory card containing the pictures till she paid the full amount. But she had already informed the police and he was caught red-handed.        
	After the sentence was read out, the boy apparently said: Its so terrible, and pleaded for a lighter sentence. He told the judge he was willing to do community service (sweep the streets) to prove what a good person he really is, but his sentence ought to be reduced. He told the court he hadnt asked for the money but she had offered it to him, and since he needed it he decided to take it. The judge remained unmoved.                
	Wild ways        
	Expats in the small town are both scornful and sympathetic; some wonder if they should visit him with books and magazines, others recall him being rather stupid. On expat forums all over China, the sentence is being considered too harsh. Three years in a Chinese jail seems like hell to most foreigners. What about bail, many have asked. And how could the matter be heard and decided so fast?        
	The incident has thrown up a whole range of issues. How did one so young qualify as an English teacher? Could he have finished his graduation in America? The merits of employing only women or old men (apparently a rule in some English-teaching schools in China) are also being debated. Whats worse  a horny 22-year-old or a lecherous 65-year-old?        
	Should he have slept with his student? The jurys out on this one. Some think its just not done; others feel a foreign male would have to be gay to resist the Chinese girls who throw themselves at them. How could the girl have slept with him if she already had a boyfriend? Thats what many foreigners are angry about.                
	Ugly picture        
	That the real issue is blackmail has been grasped by only a few. Even then, theres disagreement about the sum: some feel its ridiculously low. A few are ashamed at the bad name this incident has given to foreigners; but a few others find it impossible to believe that a white American male could get so desperate, and wonder if the story has been cooked up. However, the boys picture, with his head in his handcuffed hands, has been published.        
	White men are a rage in China; old or young, they are often seen in the company of very young Chinese girls  not call-girls. The relationship, mutually convenient, can get ugly. Two elderly Australians at the tourist town of Yangshuo, who were asking a pretty English-speaking Chinese waitress to sit between them for a photograph, were startled when she joked that doing so would cost 400 dollars. 400? they retorted. Fours more like it. Their wives sat barely two feet away.

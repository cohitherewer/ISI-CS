The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | What Pakistanis think
                                                                                                                 WHAT PAKISTANIS THINK                          - Pakistans opinion is divided on all questions facing it        Writing on the wall   - Ashok V. Desai                                                        
	The International Republican Institute is located on Washingtons Eye Street; presumably it is an NGO sympathetic to the Republican cause. It commissioned an opinion survey in Pakistan; 3500 adults were interviewed in their homes and places of work in March. First, localities were randomly selected. Then a household in each locality was chosen. After it was covered, the interviewer came out of the house, turned right and chose every third house every time until the sample size was reached. The sample was 33 per cent urban, 27 per cent illiterate, and 13 per cent graduate; of the respondents, 46 per cent spoke Punjabi, 14 per cent Sindhi, 13 per cent Urdu, 8 per cent Seraiki and 4 per cent Hindko. Urdu-speaking Muhajirs, who live mostly in Sind, were thus almost as numerous as indigenous Sindhis. Seraiki is spoken on the border of Sind and Punjab, and Hindko in Peshawar.        
	What struck me was the way Pakistani public opinion has changed since March 2007. Till then, Pakistanis were evenly divided: 43-44 per cent thought that Pakistan was doing all right, and about the same number thought that it was going the wrong way. But three months later, 59 per cent thought Pakistan was headed the wrong way. There was a parallel change of opinion on the Pakistani government: in February 2007, 61 per cent approved of its performance, and 34 per cent disapproved. From June 2007, a majority turned against the government; in March 2009, 79 per cent were against it. What was it that triggered the radical change in expectations? The turning point was Musharrafs dismissal of Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry as Chief Justice on March 9, 2007. That event was Pakistans equivalent of what for us was Indira Gandhis declaration of emergency on June 26, 1975.              
	The proportion of optimists rose briefly after Musharraf made a compromise with Benazir Bhutto, let her return to Pakistan, and submitted himself to a presidential election in October 2007. But the spring did not last. The proportion of pessimists rose to 70 per cent by early 2008, and never fell below that number; in the latest survey, it was 81 per cent.        
	There was another remarkable change in 2007. Till February of that year, a third of Pakistanis said every quarter that their economic situation had improved, another third said it had worsened, and the remaining third said it had remained about the same. But by September 2007, the proportion of those who said they were doing worse than before went up to 56 per cent. It never fell below a half after that. It was therefore not just Musharrafs shock treatment that made Pakistanis feel worse; they actually became worse off.        
	Their condition worsened because of inflation. From 8-10 per cent year-on-year in September 2007, inflation went up to 23-30 per cent a year later. A poor wheat crop coincided with the spike in oil prices. An adverse balance of payments made it impossible for the government to import wheat; and the money spent by foreign powers on the war they were fighting in Afghanistan created demand that spilled over in Pakistan. Pakistan banned foodgrain exports to Afghanistan, but the ban was evaded.        
	The inflation was worsened by two factors. The government gave subsidies on wheat and oil products, and as a result ran a huge fiscal deficit. The fiscal deficit could not spill into the balance of payments because the government was short of foreign exchange. The year 2007 for Pakistan was like 1990 for India. It had a raging payments crisis, and had run out of policy options.        
	So even as late as in March 2009, the greatest worry of Pakistanis was about inflation; 46 per cent termed it the most important issue. The next most important issue, mentioned by 22 per cent, was unemployment; the third, mentioned by 10 per cent, was terrorism.        
	More than 60 per cent throughout the two years regarded religious extremism a serious issue; 20-25 per cent regarded it as unimportant. But people differed on what they meant by religious extremism; the proportion of people who regarded Taliban and al Qaida a problem was always 5-10 per cent lower. Supporters of the army campaign against terrorists in the northwest were always in a minority, although by March 2009 their proportion had risen to 45 per cent, as against 52 per cent opponents. Only 24 per cent supported Americans making incursions into Pakistan in pursuit of terrorists. In September 2006, roughly the same number were for and against Pakistan cooperating with the United States of America in the war against terror. The proportion of supporters fell steadily to 9 per cent in January 2008. Since then, it has risen to 37 per cent, but still, 61 per cent were against in March 2009. And throughout, a majority supported a compromise with the terrorists  72 per cent in March 2009. Eighty per cent supported the deal the government made with the terrorists in Swat; and 56 per cent said that if the Taliban asked for application of Sharia in other places, the government should agree. Strangely, although Nawaz and Shahbaz Sharif are the most popular politicians and although their Pakistan Muslim League is the most popular party in Punjab and Northwest Frontier Province, if religious parties formed an alliance, they would win an election hands down.              
	An overwhelming 78 per cent refused to believe that the terrorist attacks in Bombay were made by Lashkar-e-Toiba; 42 per cent said the attacks were organized by India itself, and 20 per cent suspected Americans. But 50 per cent said that the use by terrorist organizations of Pakistan as a base to attack India from was a serious problem; another 29 per cent thought it was a problem. A third hated India; another 19 per cent had a somewhat unfavourable opinion of India. But surprisingly, 45 per cent had a favourable opinion.        
	The IRI survey bears out our preconceptions about Pakistanis as religious zealots and India-haters. But that is only if we look at the majority. What I find remarkable is the pronounced division of opinion on all questions facing Pakistan. This is why I think that the naively negative policy that Manmohan Singh has followed on Pakistan has reached the end of the road, and that a more nuanced policy is worth trying. Opening the border to greater trade can do no harm; a billion dollars or two of aid for spending on Indian goods may create a bit of goodwill. There are 14 or 18 crore Pakistanis over there (no one knows since there has been no census for decades); it is worth making a few friends out of them. And we do not have to depend on Research and Analysis Wing to find potential friends; the Pakistani press is a serviceable mirror of the Pakistani society. What would help us greatly is if a few million Indians learnt Urdu and started reading Pakistani newspapers. That would give Pakistan a new source of export earnings, and us a valuable source of information on the country. We should even give some Pakistanis asylum once in a while when they get into trouble at home; who knows, they may rise to power one day.

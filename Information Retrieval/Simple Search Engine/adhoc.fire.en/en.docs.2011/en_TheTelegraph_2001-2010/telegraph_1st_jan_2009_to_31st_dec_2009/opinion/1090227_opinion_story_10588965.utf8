The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A moving family drama, but overwhelmed by cricket
                                                                                                                 A MOVING FAMILY DRAMA, BUT OVERWHELMED BY CRICKET                                                      Foreign ground                            
	Netherland By Joseph ONeill, Fourth Estate, Rs 295              
	Hans van den Broek lived in New York with his wife, Rachel, and their infant son. Their life was one of affluence till 9/11 forced them to move to a hotel, where their marriage proceeded to fall apart. Rachel returns to London with the son, and Hans hangs out in New York struck by ennui. The book, however, does not open like this. It opens with Hans back in London, reunited with his family.        
	It is in London that he learns that Chuck Ramkissoons body was found in a Brooklyn canal. Ramkissoon entered Hanss life when he was at a loose end after his wifes departure. In many ways, this is a novel about Ramkissoon. Ramkissoon is a hustler and a racketeer living on the fringes of the Big Apples seedier side. He has one redeeming feature in the eyes of Hans  and even perhaps in the eyes of some of the readers of this novel  he is obsessed with cricket. According to Ramkissoon, the US is not complete, the US has not fulfilled its destiny, its not fully civilized, until it has embraced the game of cricket.        
	But who plays cricket in New York? No white man does. Only Carribeans and South Asian immigrants do over the weekend in parks in the outer boroughs. The parks are in no fit condition to play decent cricket in, but the players make up for the poor playing conditions by their enthusiasm. Hans decides to break his boredom by getting out his cricket gear and joining the play of cricket in New York. He is the solitary white man on the New York cricket pitch.        
	It is through Hans involvement with cricket that the reader gets to know Ramkissoon and his grandiose dreams about cricket in New York. Ramkissoon wants a cricket stadium, and to this end he lays down some turf on a site he calls Bald Eagle Field. He dreams of international fixtures, TV rights and advertising revenues. He is to be the Kerry Packer of the Big Apple, carrying the Brown Mans Burden to civilize the US. Ramkissoon comes from Trinidad, where his forefathers had been indentured labourers originally from India, probably from Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh. ONeill carries off the inversion about the civilizing mission without too much fanfare. This is not the first time that cricket has been seen as a civilizing agent.         
	Here is Ramkissoon trying to civilize the Americans: We have an expression in the English language... the expression is not cricket. We do not say its not baseball. Or its not football. We say its not cricket. This is a tribute to the game we play, and its a tribute to us games are important. They test us, they teach us comradeship. Theyre fun. But cricket, more than any other sport is, I want to say, a lesson in civility. Neville Cardus could not have expressed the sentiments better.        
	What is amazing is ONeills intimate knowledge of the cricketing sub-culture of New York. He recreates it in some detail.        
	In spite of all its promise, the novel does not work. The reader is left dissatisfied. The family drama  broken marriage, coming back together, and so on does not seem to hang too comfortably with the rest of the narrative. There are sections about New York weirdos that are completely out of place. ONeill is at his best when he writes about cricket in New York and the characters that inhabit that space. Unfortunately, this is not a novel about cricket. ONeills intention, one imagines, was to write about a moving human drama in which cricket figures incidentally. Cricket, as it often does, overwhelmed him, and the novel suffered. A pity. A few lovely drives but not enough to tear apart the bowling attack.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Still in a soup
                                                                                                                 STILL IN A SOUP                                  FIFTH COLUMN - Dipankar Bose                                    
	After recession gripped entire North America and Europe, and also Japan, surplus capacity has appeared all over the world. China and India have escaped recession, but not excess capacity. In such situations, large companies from the advanced countries tend to export at prices below their home prices, just above the variable costs, often with covert government subsidies.																					  
	This is what had happened between mid-1997 and 2000, when the Southeast Asian economies crashed following a four-year boom when Southeast Asia had been the fastest growing region, with sharply rising steel consumption. During these years, the Indian steel industry was also going through a slump. The former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics had already been saddled with huge surplus capacity following its break-up. Russia, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan dumped their steel in India at half their home price.  
	Dumping has been going on in India on a grand scale over the last two years. So much so that in 2008-09, India had to launch a record 197 anti-dumping investigations as against 151 in 2007-08. But not a single one has been launched for steel, and the authorities have deferred the decision to implement the safeguard duty on steel items.        
	Since the current recession was preceded by a boom, as is usually the case, steel prices had skyrocketed before they crashed. The wild price variations occurred because of global market forces, which get transmitted instantaneously in a globalized world. They seriously affect investment and production in a capital-intensive sector like steel and in the steel-user industries.                
	Practical problems        
	The situation all over the world now is grim, with major economies, except China, being in the soup. Chances of a recovery are dim. The World Bank has predicted that the global output will shrink by 2.9 per cent in 2009. Much depends on a stable recovery of the United States of America, since Germany, Japan, China as well as Southeast Asia depend largely on US consumer demand.        
	Unemployment in the US is still rising. House prices are still falling, though at a slower rate. Wage-cuts have become endemic. Bank-failures are continuing. The US has only avoided a full-fledged depression, nothing more. But another dip looms large, unless a large second stimulus is injected.         
	Japans economy has contracted by four per cent between January and March 2009. In the United Kingdom, unemployment was up by nearly a quarter of a million in the same period, the worst since 1981. For China, the $585 billion stimulus seems to have worked and a six per cent growth is now expected.         
	The world steel scenario reflects the economic reality. Between January and May 2009, steel output in the Europian Union and the US were down by 44.4 per cent and 49.5 per cent respectively, while in China it was up by 0.4 per cent during the same period in 2008. Indias steel imports increased by six per cent to 1.057 million tonnes, and exports dropped by four per cent to 0.4 mt during April-May this year as against the corresponding months of 2008. Dumping is still going on, specially from the Commonwealth of Independent States, followed by China.        
	It is in this context that the decision to defer the safeguard duty on steel needs to be seen. In India, it takes six to nine months just to get a preliminary probe done before imposing the interim duty. Since a country cannot impose anti-dumping duty retrospectively, exporters continue with dumping for a long time. Further, thanks to the rules of the World Trade Organization, even when such a duty is imposed for a certain product against a particular country, it can export the same item through a third country, which does not even make the product. This is reforms in practice. And the new government still advocates further reforms. Need we say any more?

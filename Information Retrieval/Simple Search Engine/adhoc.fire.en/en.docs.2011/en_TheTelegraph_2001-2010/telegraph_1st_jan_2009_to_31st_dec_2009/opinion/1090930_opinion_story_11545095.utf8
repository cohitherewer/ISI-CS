	Maybe you dont always share my opinions about English. So you differ from me. Or could that be with me? Your views are different from mine. Or could that read different to mine? Or maybe than mine? You think differently from me. Or perhaps differently from the way I do. Or why not differently than I do? The choice of the right preposition is one mark of truly idiomatic English. And it is curiously hard with these words that imply difference, likeness, or comparison, between two things.        
	Shakespeares Shall I compare thee to a summers day? is a classic case. It is often said to illustrate the distinction between compare to, that is, point out the similarity between one thing and another, and compare with, point out the respects in which the two differ. That is just what it doesnt do. The sonnet goes on at once to say, Thou art more lovely and more temperate, and adds other divergencies; Shakespeare is noting the differences, not the similarities. By todays standards, he has simply got it wrong  unless what he means is really Shall I point out the similarities? No I wont, because in fact you are more lovely, etc etc.        
	Back with different, and its kin. Different from is always correct. Indeed, I was brought up to believe this the only correct wording. Not so. The big Oxford dictionary records examples not only of from, but also of to and than from some 400 years ago. Different to can cite notable British users from Jane Austen to Winston Churchill. And Americans are happy  as Britons are not  with different than.        
	Comparison with related words is no help. Sure, one cant say beer differs to water. But what is right with the verb doesnt prove what word is right or wrong with the adjective: to take a parallel, one may hope for a promotion, but one is hopeful of it. Equally, we have to say men differ from women, but we can also talk of a man differing with his wife, that is, having a disagreement with her. Me, I stick firmly to different from, and Id recommend anyone using British or British-based English to do likewise. But theres no iron rule (and an awful lot of Americans).        
	Id certainly ban differently to. X thinks differently to other philosophers, yuk. Yet, perversely, I am attracted  almost against my will  by differently than. True, theres no great gain in saying Indians think differently than Pakistanis instead of differently from. But I think differently today than last week is certainly less clumsy than differently today from the way I thought last week.        
	What about other such words: similar/dissimilar and their nouns; like/unlike and theirs; distinct and distinction; equal/unequal and equality/inequality; the same and sameness; identical and identity? In brief, the rules are these: Similar to (never as); dissimilar to (Ive seen from, but would discourage it); and ditto for similarity/dissimilarity. Like and unlike, of course, need no preposition, but likeness uses to. Distinct and distinction take from. Equal to (dont say unequal to, use not equal to  except in such quite distinct phrases as he was unequal to the task); but equality/inequality need with.         
	The same requires as. Identical can take with or to; the choice depends broadly on whether youre making a large, general statement (politics is sometimes identical with religion) or a precise, particular one (his car is identical to mine). Identity requires with.         
	With nearly all these nouns, of course, you can also say, for instance, the similarity between A and B. Or, equally, the similarity of A and B; indeed sameness must be used in this way or not at all. But identity is out of step: no between, no and, for it the only natural usage is the identity of A with B.
    Enough said, and, I both fear and hope, read. I rsquo;m beginning to see why learning English from the cradle really is different from (or to or than) studying it, as most of the world has to, at school mdash; and why the Esperantists see hope yet.

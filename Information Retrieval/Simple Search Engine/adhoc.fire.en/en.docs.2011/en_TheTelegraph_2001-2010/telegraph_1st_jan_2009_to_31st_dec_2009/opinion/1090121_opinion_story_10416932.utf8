                                                                                                                 BEATEN TO IT                                                    
	Deliberately subjecting a child to pain, fear and humiliation ought to be a criminal offence, especially when it is done in the name of good teaching. This is what the Supreme Court has pointed out, yet again, while rejecting a headmasters plea to set aside his conviction for hitting a Dalit student of Class X, who killed himself later. The incident also shows how a deeply entrenched culture of inequality lies at the core of what drives people to beat other people up in Indian society. Corporal punishment, usually taken to be inflicted on children in educational institutions, must be seen as part of this larger picture. It was crucial to this particular headmaster in Gujarat that the boy he was beating up was a Dalit. The boy had been playing around with the mans scooter, and was thus being punished for polluting it. It is also significant that the headmaster was pleading for leniency, since he regarded his action as chastisement rather than assault: he was driven by a moral purpose. It is still not impossible in India to find legal sanction for retaining certain limited forms of corporal punishment as salutary action taken for the sake of discipline. But for it to be effective, the ban has to be absolute; grey areas always leave room for justifications of abuse. Even if inequality is inevitable in certain forms of human exchange, it is possible to avoid institutionalizing brutality altogether.        
	The latter is what Keralas Idukki district has been striving to achieve since early last year. Involving every member of the community and the district administration, it has set itself a time-frame of a year to eradicate corporal punishment from every institution. This kind of concerted civil initiative is the only way in which the legal measures against corporal punishment can be made part of everyday behaviour and assumptions. Teachers are not the only people who can abuse the power that society and tradition invest them with. Parents, politicians and policemen, among others, all inhabit interlocking structures of inequality, deriving their strength from a feudal culture that takes every form of patriarchal and political authority for granted. Civilized and respectful behaviour  the fruit of what is often called discipline  is unthinkingly identified with an endorsement of these structures. Children  particularly poor, physically vulnerable or lower-caste children  become doubly the victims in such a society.

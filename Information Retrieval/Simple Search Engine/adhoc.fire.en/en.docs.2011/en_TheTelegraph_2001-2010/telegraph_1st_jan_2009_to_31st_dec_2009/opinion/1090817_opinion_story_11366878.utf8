                                                                                                                 THINK RIGHT                                                    
	As each rainless day goes by, a drought becomes so much more unavoidable. The prime minister is alert to the possibility as it turns slowly into certainty. He called the chief secretaries of state governments to a meeting and impressed upon them the importance of early action. He was stating the obvious when he said that we should not allow citizens to go hungry. When he said that the governments should not hesitate to intervene in the market, he presumably meant that they should prepare their police to raid the stocks of traders. Intelligent traders will take advance steps to make sure that the police do not raid them; the cautious ones will not stock foodgrains, and will confine themselves to cotton, oilseeds and lentils, whose prices will rise faster. Thus, by warning of draconian measures, the prime minister has ensured that they will fail.         
	So far as it concerns foodgrains, the prime minister need not have given a threat of confiscation at all. For his government is sitting on a mountain of grains. The figures available to the minister of state for food and distribution are at least two months out of date. But on June 1, he had 53.3 million tons at his disposal. That is almost a quarter of the years production, and about ten weeks national consumption. With that sort of stock, no one, including the prime minister, should be issuing threats to trade. They have the wherewithal to ensure normal trading conditions. They are all talking in a chorus because they want to reassure the people that they have nothing to worry about; the best way to reassure the public would be to ensure that foodgrain prices are stable throughout the year, that no one has an incentive to hoard foodgrains, and that shopkeepers can get foodgrains to sell whenever they want. Even 18 years after the reforms, the agricultural bureaucrats still live in a pre-reform, chase-the-trader outlook, and in their company, the prime minister, once the architect of the reforms, lapses once in a while into a Nehruvian mentality.        
	If only he were to take off his bureaucratic cloak and do some commonsense thinking, the prime minister would realize that what he has to do is very simple. All he needs to do is to tell K.V. Thomas, the concerned minister, that he must not allow the prices of wheat and rice to increase in the next ten months. If they rise in any of a handful of major markets, the Food Corporation of India must sell the grains in those markets at the predetermined prices. Mr Thomas must announce from the rooftops that he will keep prices stable, and that he has the grains to carry out his resolve. Once he carries conviction with the nation, food stocks will decline till January, when rabi rice comes in; then everyone will forget the fear of drought.

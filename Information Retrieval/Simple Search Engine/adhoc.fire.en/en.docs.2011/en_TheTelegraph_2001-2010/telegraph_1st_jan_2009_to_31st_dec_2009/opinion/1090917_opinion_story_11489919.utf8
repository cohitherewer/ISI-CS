	Backing out                  
	Sir  The Left Front governments decision to shelve the plan for an information technology township in Rajarhat will have dire consequences for West Bengal (When in doubt, dump; Govt shelves IT project, Sept 8). During the days with Jyoti Basu at the helm, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) blamed the scrapping of projects that could have taken Bengal ahead of the other states on the Centre. But Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who took over from Basu, made an impressive start with his industrialization drive, which promised to boost the prospects of development in the state. However, with Prakash Karat withdrawing support to the United Progressive Alliance government and later Mamata Banerjee becoming the Union railways minister, the CPI(M) now has no option but to go back to Basus strategy of stalling development projects. Infosys and Wipro have been denied the land that they were promised, denting Bengals prospects further.           
	The CPI (M) leaders seem to be more interested in retaining power in Bengal rather than in scouting for fresh investment for industrial projects in the state. However, if the CPI(M) decides to forego all forthcoming development projects in Bengal, it will result in the party being routed in the forthcoming assembly polls. The people of Bengal should urge the government not to cancel the proposed IT hub involving software giants such as Infosys and Wipro.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  It is surprising that the West Bengal government decided against allotting land to Infosys and Wipro in areas adjoining the controversial Vedic Village project on dubious grounds. The IT project would have created a number of job opportunities for the unemployed youth of the state. Contrastingly, Vedic Village was built for a handful of rich people and could not have created ample opportunities for employment. If suitable land cannot be found for the IT township, the government should move court to reclaim the land given to Vedic Village and allocate it for the software firms. Business houses will certainly welcome this measure because it will help create more jobs. If necessary, the government should also seek the Centres assistance on this matter. The government and the Opposition should come forward and support this move for the sake of the unemployed people in the state.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Debasish Mukherjee, Calcutta

                
	Sir  One wonders what the brouhaha over the shelving of the IT project at Rajarhat is all about. It is not the first time that the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government is going back on its word. Neither does this seem to be the last. The Left Front won a landslide victory in the assembly polls in 2006 by campaigning on the plank of development and industrialization. But it has failed miserably to keep its promise, and the electorate in Bengal will bear that in mind when the state goes to the polls. The industrial projects in the state have crumbled under the weight of their own internal contradictions rather than on account of political factors.           
	Take, for instance, the joint venture for the proposed IT hub. Apparently, the Bengal government would have received 600 acres of land free from the private investors to accommodate the IT companies. However, it is not known on what grounds the government agreed to allot 90 acres each to Infosys and Wipro. The people have a right to know whether the agreement was based on the exchange of favours.          
	However, the failure of this project must not be seen as a failure of the direct land purchase by private investors model, something that the Tatas are now trying out after their botched attempts in Singur. The model operates according to market forces, is transparent by nature, and does not violate the rights of the concerned parties. This model failed in Rajarhat because of the weaknesses in the administrative mechanism. The political leadership too looked in the other direction as it suited its plans perfectly. The economic cost of the jettisoned IT township may not be as high as is being projected in some quarters. Some people are talking about the loss of job opportunities, but how many jobs has the IT industry created in Bengal in the last two years? Perhaps the project would have done Bengal more harm than good in the long run.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Chameli Pal, Batanagar 

                
	Sir  Finally, Infosys and Wipro have called off their ambitious plans in West Bengal. This is the last nail in the coffin of industrialization in the state. The government, which had promised to bring about development, has now started to drag its feet on its earlier promise. West Bengal is probably the only state in the entire country where destructive politics still thrives and actually pays dividends. The principal Opposition party keeps harping on the mantra of Ma-Mati-Manush, and the ruling party does not seem to have the courage to go ahead with its drive for industrialization. It is amusing to note that the people of Bengal cast their votes for such leaders. Isnt it time the people introspected on the sad state of affairs?          
	Yours faithfully,      
S. Chakrabarti, London, UK

                
	Sir  The next assembly elections in Bengal are still some time away. But with the government calling off its plan to build a software hub in Rajarhat, chances are that the ruling Left Front has ruined its chances to retain power in the state. Earlier, the plan to build a highway connecting Barasat and Raichak had also been abandoned. Singur was a different matter: it was established that the Tatas had been given more land there. After the Salim Group, Infosys and Wipro too have been shown the door. The people of West Bengal, especially those aspiring to build careers in the IT industry, are now suspecting that the government has made a fool out of them. Given the present circumstances, it is clear that the people will elect a new dispensation soon. But Mamata Banerjee must take care to ensure that her party does not misuse its powers like the Left Front did during its reign.                    
	Yours faithfully,

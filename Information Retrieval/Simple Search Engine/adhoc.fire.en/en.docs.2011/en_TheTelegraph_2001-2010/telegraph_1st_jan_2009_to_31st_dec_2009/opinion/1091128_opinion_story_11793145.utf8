                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        SOMETHING MISSING                              Fauzia Marikar      MUSIC                                                
	Two musicians from South Africa, Albie van Schwalyk and Berthine van Schoor, were presented by the Calcutta School of Music on November 9 and 12. The first was particularly for children. There were works by Haydn, Mozart, and the popular Carnival of the Animals by Saint-Sans. Van Schoor also played the solo for cello by Vivek Ram called Kriya, a meditative piece, ideally suited for this instrument. The narration by Hanna van Niekerk made the Carnival, transcribed for piano and cello, a happy choice for the young audience.        
	On November 12, the musicians chose to play two concertos with the Calcutta Chamber Orchestra. This fundraiser concert at the ICCR auditorium began with Mozarts Piano Concerto in C major, KV 415. Van Schwalyks neat and competent performance was technically flawless, if not scintillating, in spite of the deviations from pitch by the CCO second violins.        
	Berthine van Schoors Concerto in C Major by Haydn was edgy, to say the least. The spasmodically energetic conductor of the CCO, Sanjib Mondal, was successful in getting everyone to start together on the right note, but they did not always stay in harmony thereafter. Following the initial shock of musical betrayal, the cellists concentration began to wear thin and as the music continued, there was a certain je ne sais quoi missing and the final movement sounded as tired and frayed as the performer.        
	One might have appreciated a few solos by the visitors after this, but for the following lollipops handed out by the CCO: Hungarian Dance No. 4, Espaa Cai (not again!) and the Gold and Silver Waltz were uneducated choices in poor taste. The addition of a percussion accompaniment on what sounded like part of a cheap jazz set was an insult to the ear.        
	This string ensemble has been nurtured by the CSM to provide needy musicians performing Western music with a livelihood. Considering the generous donations, several fundraising events, besides other schemes to improve the quality of their lives, it is also a responsibility to improve the quality of their performance. There is no excuse for a mediocre performance of Mozart and Haydn. There is a crying need for orchestral instruction and knowledge before great works are attempted for our audiences.

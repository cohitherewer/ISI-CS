	Although not technically official, the meeting of the Group of 20 next Thursday is important  not least because President Barack Obama will be attending. Besides the big names, the meeting also has a weighty agenda; ministers of the 22 countries attended a meeting in Horsham, Sussex, on March 14 to give last touches. It will be dominated by the international economic crisis. Hoary issues like climate change and development aid will be there; but it is the worlds rescue from what threatens to be the worst crisis since World War II that will dominate the discussions. There is, however, an issue of interest to India. Although Indias foreign exchange reserves have declined from their peak last April, they still exceed $200 million. Therein lies the problem. The Bush administration had pressing priorities such as clearing Iraq of Saddam Hussein and Afghanistan of the Taliban. It did not care how much it cost; and it did not have to care since the American dollar was an international currency; anything in the world could be bought with it  even countries.        
	Both the countries were freed, income taxes on the rich were cut, and the cost was paid by borrowing; the average fresh debt contracted by the Bush administration in its last four years was $1 trillion a year. It could be sold because there were willing buyers around the world. India was one, but there were others with deeper pockets. Among them were China, the worlds manufacturing powerhouse, and Russia, whose oil everyone wanted; their foreign exchange reserves exceed Indias, and so did their appetite for dollar bonds. Now both are rueing their investment since the dollar has weakened and threatens to go down further. They could take their money to another currency, but the choices are not all that attractive. The euro is about the only currency in which large reserves can be parked; and there is no guarantee that it will not go down. In fact, any country that shifts from one currency to another will push down the value of the currency it sells and push up the value of the currency it buys; both ways, it will lose.        
	Tired of financing reckless nations and losing money, Russia proposed last week an international currency to replace the dollar. There has been a stillborn one for the past 60 years  the International Monetary Funds Special Drawing Rights. They were created with precisely this aim, but never caught on; Russia would like to revive them. Soon after, Zhou Xiaochuan, governor of Chinas central bank, repeated a plea for an international reserve currency; and the American treasury secretary, Timothy Geithner, supported him. Both he and Ben Bernanke, chairman of the American Federal Reserve, backed down when questioned by Congressmen; Mr Obama also disowned them. But an international currency is an idea that has been let out of the box, and will not be easily put back in.

                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Direct speech                  
	Sir  This is in response to the well-argued editorial, Need to speak, and A talk without frills by Malvika Singh (May 8). The Congress, the grand old party of India, has turned into a laughing stock with Rahul Gandhis elevation as the new spokesman of the party. There is very little difference between Sonia Gandhis rush and that of her late mother-in-law to project their offspring as competent and reliable torchbearers of the dynastic tradition. Like Indira Gandhi before her, Sonia too has tried to hoodwink the people into believing that Rahul does not harbour any political ambition at the moment. Her flamboyant sons only interest, apparently, is to rejuvenate the party and restore it to its pristine glory. Little wonder then that she cites the example of her own abdication of prime ministership in favour of Manmohan Singh.          
	Rahul is scurrying helter-skelter and expressing his opinions on issues such as democracy and good governance in a country of Indias size and diversity. In his first formal press conference, Rahul proved his inexperience by claiming that the problem of terrorism can be solved in 15 minutes. Even a section of the Congress appeared aghast at the expressions of his naivety. His criticism of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in Calcutta and his courting of the Left in Delhi also expose his immaturity.          
	Rahul was quick to predict on the eve of the fourth phase of the elections that the Congress was slated to win power. This, again, is something that even seasoned soothsayers would not dare to foretell, considering the current complex political scenario. His courting of the Bihar chief minister, Nitish Kumar, whose party has the dubious distinction of being an ally of the communal Bharatiya Janata Party, has left voters in Bihar puzzled. His compliments to Chandrababu Naidu of the Telugu Desam Party in Andhra Pradesh can also be easily read as overtures to parties that have parted ways with the Congress on political and ideological grounds. In the same breath, he mentioned the Left as a possible future ally of the Congress. Expectedly, this comment made the Trinamul Congress chief, Mamata Banerjee, react tersely. Although post-poll alliances are not unnatural in Indian politics, Rahul should have kept his strategies to himself and waited for the results. By hurrying to win brownie points, he has cut a sorry figure for himself and has made a mockery of his partys standing.           
	The charade Rahul indulged in has only served to sharpen the divide within the Congress. The task to fight the BJP will, in all likelihood, turn out to be doubly daunting for the Congress in the most critical phase of its history.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  There is no doubt about the fact that Rahul Gandhi has shouldered a major part of the Congresss campaign: visiting 23 states and addressing a large number of election meetings all over the country. The media are eagerly waiting to hear from him about post-poll possibilities as he has emerged as the face and voice of the Congress. People like me appreciate his open admission in a press conference that the Congress is still undemocratic, and that he wanted to change the system (Rahul feelers to Left and Nitish, May 6). But one wonders if it is possible to do these.           
	The people are also shocked to see that on one hand, the Congress ally is Mamata Banerjees TMC in West Bengal, which has been fighting the atrocities of the Left for the last 32 years. On the other, the Congress is also open to an alliance with the Left. Although the Congress clarified the content of the speech subsequently, the young leaders remarks definitely damaged the Congresss poll prospects in West Bengal.           
	Rahul Gandhi also praised the Janata Dal (United) leader, Nitish Kumar, who is an ally of the National Democratic Alliance. May be it was a political ploy, but his overtures to the TDP leader, N. Chandrababu Naidu, an arch rival of the Congress in that state, raised a few eyebrows. I agree that in Indian politics, there are no permanent friends or enemies. But Rahul Gandhis attempts to win over opponents seem to be a sign of desperation to break the fledgling third front for the sake of improving the Congresss electoral chances. His press conference may have hurt the Congress in the last two phases of the elections.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad

                
	Sir  Rahul Gandhi has once again demonstrated in a media conference in Delhi that he can prove his mettle if he were given a chance to become the prime minister. He speaks his mind without taking help from the advisers who surround him or from the top bosses of the party and the government. It takes a lot of courage and magnanimity to appreciate the quality of governance in a state ruled by a party in the Opposition. It is also heartening to see Rahul Gandhi admit that governments, whether led by the Congress or the BJP, are bound to pressurize agencies, including the Central Bureau of Investigation. These qualities are likable, since they are rare among other leaders, and they show Rahul Gandhis willingness to overcome the drawbacks in the system.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  Steve Waughs efforts to clean up the Thakurpukur Canal is indeed noble. It is imperative that people lend their hands to such clean-up missions. Calcuttas celebrities are notorious for being indifferent to such causes. For the stars, getting their hands and feet dirty is less important than attending movie premieres, which help them gain wealth, as well as popularity among their fans.           
	The foreigner, who is also a well-known cricketer, has set an example as to how a celebrity can contribute to the improvement of a citys environment. Celebrities are often held up by the fear that they might not live up to expectations once they start helping protect the environment. But the truth is that they will be able to set a wonderful example by doing so.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Ahana Sen Gupta, Calcutta

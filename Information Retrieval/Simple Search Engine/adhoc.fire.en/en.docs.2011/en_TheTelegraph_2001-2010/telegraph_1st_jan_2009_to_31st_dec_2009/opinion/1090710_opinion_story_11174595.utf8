	In the Kitchen 
  By Monica Ali, 
  Doubleday, 5.99        
	Monica Alis new novel is described as a follow-up to her much acclaimed Brick Lane. If this clue to reading the novel were not there, it would have been difficult to understand what goes on in In the Kitchen. All the characters here have as much animation as that of marionettes whose strings are firmly in the authors hands. They move about jerkily and flop to the ground once they have served their purpose. For the protagonist, Gabriel Lightfoot or Gabe, Ali even arranges a literal breakdown as a way out of the plots challenges. By the time Gabe recovers, things have sorted themselves out  or rather, have been sorted out by Ali for his benefit. The novel ends on a note that was in no way warranted by what came before it.        
	If Brick Lane told a story about the immigrants bewilderment in the alien culture of London, In the Kitchen is about the dilemmas of the original inhabitants of London in a city where women in burkhas walk side by side with girls wearing tracksuits having SEXY stitched across the bum. Gabe is the executive chef of the significantly named Imperial Hotel in London. Built in 1878, the hotel retains its Victorian character in only the faade. Everything inside has been modified to suit modern tastes. The signs of a post-imperial world can be felt nowhere more strongly than in the hotels kitchen where every corner of the earth [is] represented... Hispanic, Asian, African, Baltic and most places in between. In spite of occasional tiffs with his staff, Gabe, as the lord of this domain, feels a kind of paternal love for his brigade, a United Nations task force all bent to their work. But is his consideration another word for condescension? Even more disturbingly, is his attitude only a harmless expression of the starkly exploitative stance of his countrymen towards migrant workers? Gabe begins to question his feelings towards his team and, by extension, towards all the immigrants with whom he shares his country, when one of the staff, a Ukrainian named Yuri, is found dead in the hotels underground catacombs. It seems that when the Imperial Hotel remodelled itself, it shifted the white mans burden of guilt to the catacombs beneath, from where it stirred to life again with Yuris mysterious death.        
	Ali goes out of her way to impart the warmest possible glow to the tte--ttes between the chef and his crew so that Gabe emerges from them as the unbiased liberal for whom all men, irrespective of nationally, are united in the dignity of labour. The episodes in the kitchen, with their air of sweet camaraderie that is too good to be true, would easily fit into a television soap. Alis aim in doing this is to exalt Gabe as much as possible while marking his contrast with the cardboard villain of the piece, Gleeson, the restaurant manager. It is later revealed that Gleeson runs a racket in human trafficking, selling off illegal immigrants as labourers or prostitutes. Compared to the heinousness of Gleesons crime, Gabes slip, so far as the refugees are concerned, can only appear slight. In fact, if Gabe has a fault at all, it is his bleeding heart, which would prod him to take on the guilt of the entire British race upon himself and atone for it.        
	Yuris death unhinges Gabe because it makes him realize that he had never cared to know the man who had worked for him. For him, Yuri had always been that faceless Ukrainian night porter, not the vulnerable refugee with a family left behind in a faraway land, or the multi-tasker who was possibly also an engineer. As Yuris story begins to take shape bit by bit, it reveals Lena, the washing girl of the hotel who probably had been his lover. Gabe dismisses Lena without a days notice but when he later discovers her in the street, cold and emaciated, he takes her to his flat. His ostensible reason behind taking Lena in is to give the homeless girl shelter and also to prise more information regarding Yuri out of her. But he inevitably starts sleeping with her and in the intimacy of the bed uncovers her history of being from trafficked from Belarus and sold into prostitution. The more Gabe gets entangled in her narrative comprising a few taciturn phrases, the more agitated he becomes about the plight of refugees in England until the trail starting from Yuri and Lena leads him to Gleeson. So Lena, who had been Gabes charitable cause to begin with, later becomes his salvation, his ruin or neither  simply his release.        
	Gabes growing intimacy with Lena coincides with his fathers rapid decline caused by cancer. Going back periodically to his family home in Blantwistle to visit his ailing father entails raking up the past. Gabes past, however, had kept intruding into the narrative right from the beginning, involving interminable descriptions of the times he spent reluctantly with his father in the mill where the latter worked. Gabes journeys away from the hub of London to the backwaters, where the England of yore still survives to some extent, make him confront the paranoia of the native people who are gradually being forced to accommodate more and more foreigners in their midst. The older generation revels, with some justification, in its prejudices towards coloured people, and laments the loss of the British character. But when Gabe asks his Labour MP friend, Fairweather, about Britishness, he replies that it is a neutral, value-free identity... a non-identity.... A vacuum. That, of course, is politicians talk and Gabe, quite inexplicably, later beats up Fairweather during a party in the belief that he is the British gent who assaulted Lena in bed. That grand bash effectively destroys Gabes hope of setting up his own restaurant in partnership with Fairweather and also his career at the Imperial. But by the time we come to this turn of events, the plot, along with Gabe, has collapsed and so it hardly serves its purpose as the peripeteia before Gabes catharsis.        
	There is a fine self-reflexive quality to Alis prose that induces the reader to keep on reading even when the characters fall apart in the hope that she will pull off something smart in the end. But she does not, and the ending of this novel is so banal that one almost feels cheated for having been made to go through all of its 430 pages. The greatest problem with In the Kitchen is that the author herself does not seem to believe in what she is writing. Or she ceases to believe once she has put her protagonist on the high horse of political correctness. Self-conscious artist that Ali is, she herself provides the best image for her novel while describing the steam coming out of a pot in the Imperials kitchen  [It] rose in a column and dispersed, like an idea than can find no words.

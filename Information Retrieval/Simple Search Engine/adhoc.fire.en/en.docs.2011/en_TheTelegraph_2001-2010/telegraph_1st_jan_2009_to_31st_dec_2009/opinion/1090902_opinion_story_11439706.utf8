	Q: My married daughter (Hindu by faith), employed in a multinational company, had made my wife the nominee to all her savings and investments. She did this because she was going through a rough patch in her marriage. Unfortunately, she expired 6 months back without leaving any issues. Now my son-in-law has filed for a succession certificate, claiming all her assets. Will he succeed in his claim even though her mother is her nominee?        
	Name Withheld        
	A: Since your daughter did not have any children, your son-in-law is the sole legal heir to her assets. As per Section 15 of The Hindu Succession Act, 1956, the property of a female Hindu dying intestate shall devolve firstly upon the sons and daughters and the husband, secondly, upon heirs of the husband and thirdly, upon the mother and father. Even though your wife was the nominee to her daughters assets, she cannot claim them. This is because a nominee is a mere custodian of the assets and has to distribute them to the legal heirs after the demise of the person nominating him/her.        
	Q: For the last three months I have been looking for a flat. I have finally found one that I like. The developer has given me all the relevant documents except the sanction plan which he says he has misplaced. He now wants me to pay him an advance as the booking amount. Should I strike the deal even though I have not seen the sanction plan?        
	T.K. Pal, Garia        
	A: A sanction plan is a very vital document for ascertaining the position and status of your flat. If the said flat does not feature in the sanction plan then chances are that the same will be demolished in future as per the provisions of The Calcutta Municipal Corporation Act,1980, and you will not be entitled to receive any compensation on account of the demolition.        
	Q: I am a Muslim boy and I wish to marry a Hindu girl. But my fiance does not want to change her religion. Is it possible to get married without either of us having to change our religions?         
	Name Withheld        
	A: If you marry according to Muslim customs with a social ceremony, then your fiance does need to convert to your faith. This is because as per the Shariat (Muslin Personal Law) a Muslim man cannot marry a non-Muslim woman. However, you can have a registered marriage according to The Special Marriage Act, 1954, wherein neither the bridegroom nor the bride is required to change his or her religion.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | death by water
                                                                                                                 DEATH BY WATER                                                    
	The theme of this years World Day for Water, held annually on March 22, is the need for  and, presumably, the commitment to supply  clean water and proper sanitation in urban conflict zones. More people in conflict zones die of water-borne diseases than of bullets and bombs. Is Calcutta a conflict zone? Not in any obvious way, which is why the high court is having to issue an ultimatum to the public health engineering department to file a report on the action it has taken to ensure the supply of clean water to the city. The courts instruction is actually a repetition of one seven months ago, and the ultimatum has been given in response to the departments plea for more time.         
	Conflict zone or not, the water in Calcuttas government hospitals, police and civic headquarters and other public buildings is undrinkable. And it is the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, which would normally be the prime accused in such a case, that has reportedly tested 235 samples of water from public buildings in the city and found them all contaminated. Evidently, the water the corporation supplies to the reservoirs is of a sparkling purity. But the reservoirs are never cleaned, hence the subsequent contamination. Cleaning reservoirs or ensuring that they are cleaned is the job of the PHED. The complaint against the supply of contaminated water was brought to court in 2002. Typically, the situation has remained the same in spite of the courts instructions. Very little can be done with public officials whose criminal indifference towards their responsibilities and total lack of self-respect are a condition worse than jaundice. Whether it is the PHED or the CMC, which still pretends to fight mosquitoes, the attitude is exactly the same.

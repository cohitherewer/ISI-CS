	Parachute plans                  
	Sir  The photograph, Back after six months (Feb 21), of Jyoti Basu being propped up by his party comrades is a sad commentary on the party. What makes his colleagues so desperate that they have to drag the ailing leader to their meeting? The related report, Party to tap Basu charisma, says that the party is planning to parachute 94-year old Jyoti Basu so that he can breathe life into the faction-ridden organization and woo voters. One wonders what the Communist Party of India (Marxist) would do if  not when  Basu is no more. For their own survival, would they resort to what Norman Bates did in Psycho?           
	Yours faithfully,        Rupnarayan Bose, Calcutta
        
	Lessons in assault          
	Sir  The Supreme Court has ordered educational institutions to immediately suspend those guilty of ragging (Sharp and clear, Feb 13). Ragging has existed in institutions of higher study, particularly engineering and medical colleges, since their inception. I was so afraid of it even two-and-a-half decades ago that I did not pursue technical education. Many efforts to end ragging have been made, but it continues.          
	One of the reasons for this is that college authorities try to suppress incidents of ragging to save the college from disrepute. Besides, the authorities tend to take a sympathetic view of accused students as they are likely to be expelled, and that would endanger their careers. Also, I have heard teachers in engineering colleges commenting that the kind of ragging they had encountered no longer exists. Can ragging be eradicated if such is the dominant attitude?           
	What might work is an integrated approach by a committee, comprising representatives from the college administration and the local law-enforcing authority, operating under an independent external agency that would have the power to inspect campuses, including hostels, on the basis of their own intelligence inputs. At least 10 years of this approach with zero tolerance for ragging would end the practice.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The mere setting up of an inquiry committee immediately after an incident of ragging will not put an end to this menace. Senior students who have ragged juniors should be given exemplary punishment. They should not only be expelled, but should also be barred from enrolling in any other college in the country.           
	For cases in which the victim commits suicide or is subjected to intense physical torture, the perpetrators should be put behind bars. The rise in incidents of ragging has exposed the flaws in our education system, which churns out brilliant students but fails to inculcate proper values in them. Policymakers should now lay stress on value-based, rather than career-based, education.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Kajal Chatterjee, Sodepur

                          
	Parting shot          
	Sir  Not too long ago, a ribbon of green snaked along the tram tracks from the Rashbehari Avenue crossing in two directions  towards Mudiali and towards Gariahat. But thanks to the stupidity of our urban planners, netas and administrators, that stretch has given way to the ugliness of concrete.           
	The obsession with making room for cars has crossed all limits of sanity. Lake Avenue, from Southern Avenue to Mudiali, is now being widened to accommodate more vehicular traffic. Trees are being spared because of public pressure, but there is barely any space for them. Could that be intentional? If a tree tumbles by itself nobody is blamed for felling it, but the space is cleared.           
	Yours faithfully,

                                                                                                                 DO AWAY WITH CONFUSION                                                          
	In the era of coalition politics, there is the political party and the larger formation comprising of several political parties. Three examples of the latter come readily to mind  the Left Front that has been ruling West Bengal for over 30 years, the United Progressive Alliance that is in power at the Centre and the National Democratic Alliance that held the reins of government before the UPA. With elections to the Lok Sabha to be announced any day, the future of the UPA seems to have become uncertain. At a meeting of its working committee, the Congress decided that it would not contest the elections on an UPA platform, but would make state-level seat alliances with other political parties. If the Congress abides by this decision and makes a similar declaration before the Election Commission, it would mean the dissolution of the UPA. This might appear simple enough but for a small implication that might create problems after the results are announced.        
	The convention is that the head of the State asks the single largest party in the Lok Sabha to form the government and prove its majority on the floor of the House. What happens if the Congress is the single largest party but the NDA the single largest political formation? Underlying the phrase  the single largest political formation  is the assumption that before the elections, the NDA would have declared itself as a valid entity with the EC. If the NDA does this, then for the purposes of making a bid for the government, it would be accorded the same status as a single political party. Under those circumstances, the battle or the competition will not be between the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party but between the Congress and the NDA. The EC should, before the polls, bring clarity to the matter by explaining that a pre-poll coalition of parties would be treated as a political party for the purposes of government formation. This will do away with unnecessary controversy and also horse-trading. No pre-poll alliance but adjustments at the state level  the present position of the Congress  allows for too many post-election scenarios if the Congress does not have the adequate numbers to command a majority on its own.        
	As things stand, the Constitution permits a residual discretion in the hands of the president or the head of the State in the provinces. Since the issue is to do with numbers  an arithmetical concept  there is no need to take recourse to as nebulous and as subjective an idea as the satisfaction of the president. One easy way of doing this is to say that any declared pre-poll coalition will take precedence over a post-poll one and will also be treated at par with a political party when deciding who has a majority. This will do away with the biases of presidents.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Obscure objects of desire
                                                                                                                 OBSCURE OBJECTS OF DESIRE                                  Things of everyday use, like the safety pin and the bra, unnoticed but indispensable, and with chequered histories, can tease the mind out of thought                                            
	Every morning, even before he is properly awake, my Master puts me into his mouth and moves me around violently in there. For a few seconds, I am swallowed into a vortex of flesh, bone, fluids, enamel and darkness, then briskly washed clean and put back into my tower of glass. Then follow hours of neglect until nightfall, when that intimate violence exactly repeats itself. This cycle is my being. I exist in the knowledge  does the neutral, passive and absolute acceptance of ones fate amount to knowledge?  that after a few months, when I have become worn out and wild with this daily battering, he will throw me away. Another creature, identical to me, will immediately take my place in the tower. But, for these few months, I am exclusively my Masters  his stripling slave, brought home from the market where I stood waiting with my kind, to be secreted away to an inner chamber, tiled, clean and silent like an abattoir.         
	Sometimes, I travel with him in an old pouch, like a kangaroo cub, and live in other glass towers, facing strange mirrors and unknown walls. I must tell you that I have a companion in my tower at home, who belongs to my Masters companion. (Listen, call me Red and call my companion Green, for that will make my telling easier.) Our lives are identical in every way. Only our colours are different  necessarily so. Although my Master and his companion seem to share most things, they never make a mistake about which of us belongs to whom. That is taboo.        
	Green and I never speak (we dont really need to), but stand against each other staring at the wall, indifferent to the play of light, or the lizards, on it. The lizards stare back at us when we stare at them; nothing else passes between us. Sometimes, a peculiar thing happens, and we dont quite know what to do about it. Unpredictably, our bodies, Greens and mine, swing around by themselves as they rest against the curving wall of the glass tower, and we find ourselves locked in something like a long and helpless kiss. (We kiss, but we cant embrace.) Once, my Master came in and found us like this, and I caught on his face a fleeting look of disgust. He quickly separated us and gave me, only me, a little wash. He doesnt seem to care about Green, just as Greens keeper ignores me.        
	But that wasnt the last time we kissed, Green and I. Make no mistake, there is no passion between us. Yet, stuck in this accidental intimacy, and without my Master there to do us apart, we sometimes begin to share something like a history  the oddest and most trivial of histories, no doubt, but tied up with the Care of the Self, the one, great human preoccupation that survives all changes of fashion and all wars.         
	Many centuries ago, we were created from bamboo and bristle in China. Within a few centuries, we had travelled  like the slaves, silks and spices  to England. Here, our bamboo became bone (ox thigh and buttocks), and the softer hair of horses and badgers replaced the lowly bristle of boars. Our kind spread across the world, and our silly history became part of the great stories of conquest and control. From bristle and bone, we turned into nylon and plastic when Rapunzel and Pinocchio became Barbie and Ken. Sometimes our heads spin and our bodies hum with delicate electric currents. Some of us are called, of all names, Wisdom.         
	Civilized life is unthinkable without us now, but we dont feature in Kenneth Clarks Civilization. (Not for nothing do I mention slaves twice.)        
	Indispensable, yet so easily disposable, tell me, Reader, who am I?                    AVEEK SEN

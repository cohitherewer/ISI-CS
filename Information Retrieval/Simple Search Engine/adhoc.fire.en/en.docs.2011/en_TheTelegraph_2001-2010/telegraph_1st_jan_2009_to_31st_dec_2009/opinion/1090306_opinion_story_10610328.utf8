	Incomplete picture  
	Sir  Githa Hariharans rightly began her article, Reliving the Nakba (Feb 26), by stating how we are all inescapably bound to all that happens around us, both at home and abroad, courtesy the mind-boggling information explosion brought about by the electronic media. Going through her piece, I was reminded of the work of the Swiss physician, Marcel Junod, who faithfully documented his visit to the city of Hiroshima, weeks after the atom bomb was dropped there on August 6, 1945. A sense of awe and helplessness loomed over Junod. A similar feeling is manifest in Hariharans recounting of the horrors unleashed on Gaza by Israel. The sickening pictures of devastated families, their ruined homes, dead cattle, schools and hospitals reduced to rubble, have a striking resemblance to what Junod saw in Japan. Hiroshima was reduced to a necropolis in the same way as Gaza is being systematically destroyed by Israel.          
	More than 1,300 Palestinians, about one-third of them children, were killed and some 5,000 injured in the carnage, according to estimates given by health officials and the United Nations. Israel has not only killed human beings; it has destroyed human emotions. The George W. Bush regime has blessed Israel for eight long years. Now that Barack Obama is in power, the world would look to him to resolve the deadly Middle East crisis. Obamas first televised address to the joint session of Congress has kindled hopes in the distraught and the dehumanized residents of Gaza Strip. It remains to be seen how much of his promise Obama would be able to live up to.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Githa Hariharans account of the recent attack on Gaza is not only one-sided but also blatantly anti-Israel. The account ignores the persecution of Jews from the earliest times to the present, particularly by the Muslims, both before and after the creation of Israel. The hounding of Jews was supported by the global Muslim community. Several militant groups did not stop attacking innocent Israeli citizens even after Israel had left the West Bank and Gaza to the Palestinians. The Palestinians, instead of shunning violence, allowed these rebels to operate from their land against the Israelis. Hariharan seemed to have left out of her account the fact that the principle of equitable retribution is the basic tenet of both Judaism and Islam.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Githa Hariharan has castigated Israel for killing thousands of Palestinians for 20 deaths caused by al-Qassam rockets over the last ten years. She is also angry that children and women have not been spared. But Hariharan is perhaps not aware that it is not Israel that has started the conflict. It is Palestines avowed objective to wipe Israel out of existence that has resulted in Israels retaliation. Israel, with all its might, can easily destroy Palestine instead, but has not done so till now. If, for the sake of self-defence, a more powerful Israel inflicts a heavier injury on Palestine, it is only natural. As for the killing of children and women, the author should know that Palestine uses its women and children as shields for their offensive. Naturally, women and children end up being the first target of Israeli attack. Hariharan is sorry for the huge death toll of Palestinians. War is a game of chess where each party is allowed one move: it is serious business, and the mightier nation shall obviously destroy more of the enemy. The lesser number of Israeli deaths does not justify what Palestine has done to Israel for so long.

	Water everywhere          
	Sir  It is heartening to note that the West Bengal government, the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation have been focusing their attention on filtered water supply in and around the city. This good work is being done by revamping the ancient Tallah-Palta line, through the augmentation of supplies from Garden Reach Waterworks, by having multiple booster pumping stations, and so on.           
	We do not hear, though, of any action being taken for revamping the unfiltered water supply that used to be essential for daily purposes in the city till the 1960s. The use of filtered water supply needs to be controlled not only at the thousands of roadside outlets, but also at all building premises. Even if replacement of the old, worn-out pipelines, running under the roads, lanes and by-lanes of the city, becomes an insurmountable task, laying fresh pipelines along the same routes and new routes in the added areas of the CMC and Salt Lake City should be quite feasible. Perhaps roads can then be washed again every day and fire-fighting would become a much less taxing job. Not taking advantage of the Hooghlys abundant supply of unfiltered water is unwise; it needs to be used wherever the more expensive filtered water is not essential. The Department for International Development, assisting the government on these matters, could apply its mind to this.          
	Yours faithfully,

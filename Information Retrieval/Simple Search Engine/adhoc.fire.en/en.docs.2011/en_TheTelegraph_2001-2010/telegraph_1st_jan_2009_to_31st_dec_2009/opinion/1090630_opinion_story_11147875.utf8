The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | patience WEARS thin
                                                                                                                 PATIENCE WEARS THIN                                  MALA FIDE - Malvika Singh                              
	Why is every interesting idea that has been executed successfully in other parts of the world immediately strangled and suffocated by the babus, who will always wield a foolish, colonial rule book that has ceased to apply in any modern, civil society? Initiative, endeavour, passion are all drowned in babudom. To save India from the assault of denial, the babu will have to be debriefed, reoriented, and given lessons in culture and aesthetics, in how to be civil, accessible, and be compelled to deliver in time on the mandate given to him or her. The blockages in the arteries of India are caused by the bureaucracy that has mastered the art of stalling every process. Intellectually corrupt and complacent, the majority of this breed needs to be held accountable with severity. Indias patience has run out.        
	Over the last decade, the bureaucracy, more often than not, held India to ransom, and created horrific obstacles in every course that skilled professionals would want to traverse. This insular club has overwhelmed the lives of Indians across all economic strata and has stifled the competitive spirit that is alive in hundreds of thousands of Indians who are raring to go. A massive exercise has been conducted to set out fresh parameters for the functioning and operation of the administration. The reports are there for all to absorb and debate. It is time now to ensure the implementation of the recommendations. Veerappa Moily masterminded the reform recommendations and today, Moily being the minister of law and justice, it would be appropriate to hand him the mandate to execute his work and put it into play. Those in babudom, who have lived off the faulty system, will fight the change. It will require hard-nosed political will and dedication to back the radical overhaul. Indians, outside of the exclusive club for politicians and bureaucrats only, will salute the person who breaks the nexus and delivers decisively on this count.                
	Second chance        
	Only weak and incompetent politicians and babus will oppose radical change in the delivery system because it will disrupt their lives. Those opposing need to be given premature retirement, allowed to enter the public domain and compete for jobs in the open market. We will know very soon how many have the core competence to be employed productively outside of the comfortable confines of the edifice of government with all its unnecessary perks. Is the Indian taxpayer being exploited and made to carry human dead weight that, in fact, works against them? When will government transparently dishonour its administrators who indulge in open bribery, corruption, blackmail and threats? When will politicians act for the people rather than protect a bunch of wrong-doing babus?        
	Maybe the ruling Congress-led dispensation needs a fresh promise, with a new symbol that connects the government with India and its people, and not merely with the party. The Congress ka haath, which is with the aam admi, needs to reach out, and hand in hand with the people, demand that the bureaucracy deliver on its mandate of effective, clean, inclusive governance. That can lead India into a new and far more dynamic future. The generational change in the offing needs a slate that is clean and not pockmarked with the horrors of exclusivity. A policy of face-lift-and-discard, where extensions are banned, cabals are broken, and opportunities are given to the next-in-line, identified with sharp insight and empowered to perform and be accountable, will change the course of a diluted and degraded administrative machine and put it back on track, oiled and corrected. Will the second term of Manmohan Singhs government whip this bungling animal into action? Will those secretaries on extension, stuck in their schemes and manipulations, be asked to demit office?

	Shut out                  
	Sir  Although political leaders claim that a bandh is their last resort to register protest, one wonders if such a form of protest can be beneficial to the people. It is quite appalling that the Congress high command approved of the state leaderships decision to call a bandh on July 17 which paralysed the entire state (Bandh or bust, govt waits and watches, July 18). News reports and the footage available in the electronic media made it evident that the strike was far from spontaneous. People did not go out of their homes fearing harassment and non-availability of transport. Congress leaders may have been content with the success of the bandh, but they should have been aware of the losses the state incurred as a result of the bandh.           
	The 12-hour bandh called by the Congress mirrored the earlier ones by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in that it turned into an opportunity for the party to demonstrate its muscle power. The Conduct of Congressmen on the day of the bandh resembled that of lumpen elements. It is true that the people of West Bengal are disgusted with the Left Fronts misrule and are now looking forward to put an end to it. But this does not mean that the people approve of violence perpetrated by a party in the Opposition.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Othello Mazoomdaar, Barasat 

                
	Sir  Government incompetence coupled with senseless protest by a fanatic Opposition led to another day being wasted. Following the event in Mangalkot, the CPI(M) has not only failed to bring the situation there under control, but has also allowed the tension to spill into the heart of Calcutta. The political parties, busy with pointing fingers at each other, had little time to spare for the people in plight: passengers were stranded in the airport and on railway stations, examinations were cancelled and people had trouble reaching work. This was another instance of a retrograde step by a political party in this part of the world.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Arkosnato Neogy, Kharagpur

                
	Sir  The Bangla bandh called by the Congress party raises certain pertinent questions. I am an ordinary man concerned about Bengals progress. The attack on Manas Bhuniya and his colleagues in Mangalkot must be condemned in the strongest terms. The attack was a slap on the states democratic set-up. I fail to understand how the destruction of public property and the inconvenience suffered by people can help address the issues that were raised by the Congress leaders. Vandalism is common to bandhs called by political parties in India. This is ironic considering the fact that Mahatma Gandhi had thought of ahimsa as the most effective form of protest almost a 100 years ago.           
	Gandhis conviction holds true, even today. The people of India expect their leaders to be mature, inventive and dignified. Injustice must be protested against. But it must be done in a manner that is acceptable, if the nation is to march ahead.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Anjan Kumar Roy, Calcutta

      
	Sir  The situation in Calcutta is deplorable. The anarchy that prevails does not paint political parties in a glorious light. When political parties refuse to accept the mandate of the people and fight among themselves, they undermine democracy. The citizens ought to unite against parties, which decide to bring the state to a standstill. In this context, I must admit that I found the report, Muggles wish for no-bandh wand (July 17), disappointing. On a day when hundreds of students, patients and workers lost a days education, care and earning, the report of a group of children missing a popular film because of the bandh appeared unimportant.           
	Yours faithfully,       
R. Bhattacharyya, Calcutta 

                
	 Sir  I am a student of class X, and I am worried by the frequent bandhs by various political parties. Bandhs are disrupting the schedule in schools and colleges. Absenteeism among the staff as a result of bandhs has made it difficult for the syllabus to be completed. Students are the future citizens of this country. They have a right to ask political leaders to justify their decision to involve students in their battles to settle political scores. On behalf of students, my plea to the leaders would be to spare students from bandhs for the sake of the career of pupils.   
	Yours faithfully,       
Suchayan Biswas, Durgapur 

                
	Sir  The people of Bengal were optimistic about paribartan (change) after the recent elections. But their hopes were dashed by the the unrest that took place on July 16-17. The Lok Sabha polls have clearly indicated that the CPI(M) is no longer favoured by the people of this state. At this point, there is no need for the kind of protests that one saw on those two days. The Opposition must be able to prove that they can act in a responsible manner. Only then can the people be assured of their capability after 2011.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
S. Biswas, Calcutta

                
	Money matters    
	Sir  An advertisement by a financial company shows a girl putting a coin on the railway tracks to flatten it under the weight of the approaching train. This sends out a wrong message to the young generation. Currency notes and coins are government property, and it is a crime to disfigure them. Even clerks in banks write the number of notes received on the top of the bundle. If the Reserve Bank of India wants to stop people from soiling notes, it should ask them to stop using these.          
	Yours faithfully,

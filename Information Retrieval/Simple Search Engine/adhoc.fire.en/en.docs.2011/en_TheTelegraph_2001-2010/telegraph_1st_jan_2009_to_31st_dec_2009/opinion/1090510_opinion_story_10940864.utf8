The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | to bring back the world
                                                                                                                 TO BRING BACK THE WORLD                                                          
	The entire system of pedagogy in universities in India is, for reasons of history, a product of Anglophone education, a project that was begun in the 19th century. This is a historical fact that cannot be undone today even by diehard nativists. Most of the books that students and teachers have to read to equip themselves to participate in the teaching process at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels are written in English. This is true for textbooks and for the advanced reference material that students are asked to consult. Without an adequate knowledge of English this reservoir of knowledge remains inaccessible to students who are then forced to fall back on shoddy textbooks in the vernacular, half-baked crammers and private tuition. The only way to break this stranglehold is to insist that lectures will be delivered in English and answers will have to be written in English in the examinations. Visva-Bharati, by insisting on this, has taken a step in the right direction.        
	Visva-Bharati is a Central university that aims to attract students and teachers from all over India and the world. This aim may have got lost in recent times and the institution that Rabindranath Tagore built may have become reduced in status to the university of Bolpur in Santiniketan, but this is no reason to deny the aims enshrined in the vision of the founder and of those who made it into a Central university. To actualize that vision, English must be made the mode of instruction in Visva-Bharati, and students must be made to write their answers in English. To deny this is to deny the vision embedded in the very name of the university.        
	This decision of the Visva-Bharati authorities to make English the mode of instruction and examination is bound to win the disapproval of those who run the system of education in West Bengal. This disapproval is irrelevant, since the West Bengal government has nothing to do with Visva-Bharati. The West Bengal government can disapprove, but it is in no position to do anything about this. Visva-Bharati must be run to fulfil its all India charter. It is important to remember that the Communist Party of India (Marxist), which leads the West Bengal government, has run down every university under its jurisdiction to the level of mediocrity. And one of the means through which the CPI(M) managed to do this was by allowing answers to be written in Bengali and by allowing teachers to lecture in Bengali.        
	There was a time when Visva- Bharati lived up to its name. Students and teachers from across India and the globe came there. One reason for this was the presence of Tagore. Since Tagores death, and especially after Visva-Bharati was made into a Central university, no significant steps have been taken to revive the original vision. The decision to teach in English opens up the possibility of bringing the world back to Visva-Bharati.

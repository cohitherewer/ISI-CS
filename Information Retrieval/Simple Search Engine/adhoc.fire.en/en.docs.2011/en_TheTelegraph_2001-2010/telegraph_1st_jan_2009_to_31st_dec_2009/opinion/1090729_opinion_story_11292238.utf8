The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Cautious route
                                                                                                                 CAUTIOUS ROUTE                                                    
	The Reserve Bank of India left its policy interest rates  on the basis of which banks set lending and deposit rates  unchanged in its first quarterly review of its monetary policy. Despite the signs of a turnaround in the economy, the central bank believes that the situation is still uncertain and has taken the cautious route. At the same time, both in its policy statement and summary of macroeconomic developments, the central bank provided clear signals on the outlook for growth and inflation. There are several reasons to believe that the RBIs accommodative stance will continue. It seems clear that the governments stimulus packages have run their course. Any further stimulus to sustained economic growth can only come from a global recovery, the prospects of which seem remote until the end of 2010. Economic growth in all developed countries will continue to contract, albeit at a slower pace. For India, business investment, rather than consumption, is the bigger driver of growth, and that is unlikely to pick up significantly in the absence of foreign capital inflows, which in turn depend upon a global recovery. The RBI seems less concerned with the threat of inflation, even if there is little evidence that the central banks hawkishness on inflation has abated. The emphasis of the policy stance will be on moving the economy towards sustained growth by ensuring that the governments very large borrowing programme can be completed without crowding out the private sectors access to bank credit.         
	The RBI governor is clear that inflation looms as a serious challenge, even if it is not an immediate one. The central banks policy review was silent on any exit strategy from the current policy approach. Until there are certain signs of sustained growth in the economy, there will be tightening of monetary policy. Going back to the beginning of this century, the RBIs changes in policy rates have mostly lagged those of the Fed by three or four months. This underscores the point that without a US economic recovery, there cannot be one in emerging markets, including India. But how much the RBI will be able to influence credit growth  that has declined for several months now  is less clear. Banks are still risk-averse, and the creditworthiness of most borrowers will be subject to close scrutiny. Under the circumstances, doing nothing was perhaps the best policy.

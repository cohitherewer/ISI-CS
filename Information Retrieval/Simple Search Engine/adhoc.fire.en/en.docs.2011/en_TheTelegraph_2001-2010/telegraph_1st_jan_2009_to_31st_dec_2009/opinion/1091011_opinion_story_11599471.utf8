                                                                                                               DIARY
                  
	 The Congress may be feeling jittery over the outcome of the Maharashtra assembly elections, but many of its supporters are totally mystified by the partys game plan in the state. First, there was the unexplained puzzle of choosing AK Antony, of all people, to take charge of the partys affairs in such a tricky state. Antony is not known to be an assertive man. His interaction with lower- and middle-rung leaders in Maharashtra is limited. As if this were not enough, the AICC then decided to get Chaudhary Birendra Singh to head the state screening committee. This was another bizarre appointment, given that Singh is more concerned about his fate in the upcoming Haryana assembly polls, where he takes on Om Prakash Chautala, than about the tidings in the western state. In any case, even if the Congress is in a position to form government, it would probably have to join hands with the NCP. In which case, there would be more headaches over the choice of a chief minister. Battle lines are already being drawn between Sharad Pawars daughter, Supriya Sule, and his nephew, Ajit Pawar.                
	 A mother knows her son best. No wonder, Maneka Gandhi is incensed with the BJPs decision not to make a star campaigner out of her darling boy. The shadow of the hate speech that brought Varun Gandhi instant notoriety has been lingering on the party high commands mind for far too long. Maneka is very unhappy with the leaders for failing to tap into her sons hidden talents. But no amount of persuasion cut any ice with Rajnath Singh. So Maneka promptly asked a PR company to conduct a survey to see what the janta has to say. The results were better than expected: not only is Varun more loved than Rahul (which she knew all along), he is also more popular than Narendra Modi!                            
	 Things are no longer the same between the Samajwadi Party chief, Mulayam Singh Yadav, and Amar Singh. Once inseparable from each other, the two are rarely seen together these days. The SPs debacle in Uttar Pradesh in the Lok Sabha polls had created a rift in the relationship. Mulayam had been facing increasing pressure from within his family to take control of things, and not to leave everything to Amar. Then the latter had a kidney problem and was out of active politics for months. In his absence, Ram Gopal Yadav supposedly usurped his position in Mulayams circle of trust.       
	But Amar Singh is too tough a man to take things lying down. He made it clear that he has only two friends: Amitabh Bachchan and Anil Ambani. This confession scared Mulayam stiff. So he sent along his son, Akhilesh, to be with Amar, while he recuperated in Singapore. But theres no stopping Amar now. He has expressed displeasure over the inclusion of ministers with dubious personal histories into the party. The ground beneath poor Mulayams feet seems to be melting away.                            
	 To speak or not to speak out of turn: this is the latest question that has been baffling old-timers in the Union cabinet for some time now. Pranab Mukherjee, for one, seldom opens his mouth unless the prime minister asks his opinion on a certain matter. The same goes for Montek Singh Ahluwalia, the deputy chairman of the Planning Commission, who often attends these meetings. But such restraint is not the case with the newbies. Anand Sharma, Jairam Ramesh and Kapil Sibal seem to have made it a habit to offer their views on everything under the sun. So boundless is the enthusiasm of the younger lot that the health minister, Ghulam Nabi Azad, and Information and Broadcasting minister, Ambika Soni, are said to have been considerably exercised after the last few meetings.                            
	 The UPA is in a strange fix over the fate of Wajahat Habibullah, a senior IAS official who served in Rajiv Gandhis PMO and in the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation. At present, the chief information commissioner, Habibullah is keen to return to Jammu and Kashmir, but no suitable opening has been found so far. Since Omar Abdullah is keen to have him in the state as well, Habibullah would be happy to go there as state information commissioner. But how is the transition from a Central to a state post to take place, especially of a senior bureaucrat who is already approaching 65? This is a quandary that the UPA is trying hard to solve.

	 In India, work culture works the least. Kamal Nath learnt this recently in an odd way. In the middle of a meeting, he noticed a certain fidgetiness among the bureaucrats present: shifty glances, soft coughs, quick peeks at watches.... Finally, Nath asked what the matter was. Apparently, an all-important election was underway at the Gymkhana club for key posts and the babus wished to go see the fun. So Nath told them that the only votes he is bothered about are the ones he gets from Chhindwara, his stronghold for years now. The babus grinned and nodded, but the meeting had lost its momentum. A voting break was announced, and the minister kept chewing gum until they all returned.

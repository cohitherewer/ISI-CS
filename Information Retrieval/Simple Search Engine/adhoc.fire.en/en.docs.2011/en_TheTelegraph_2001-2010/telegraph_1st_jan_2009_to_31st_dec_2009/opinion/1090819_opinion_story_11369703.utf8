                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Star power                  
	Sir  First it was the former Indian president, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, and now it is the star icon of Indian cinema, Shah Rukh Khan, who have been treated shabbily by the staff at an American airport for no fault of their own. Khan has alleged that he was detained simply because of his Muslim surname. While the president of the United States of America, Barack Hussein Obama, has been wooing the Muslim world, his countrymen still seem paranoid about Muslims. The anxiety is mutual, as the Gallup survey, which showed America has beaten India to the position of Pakistans prime enemy, proved (India dislodged by US in twin messages to Manmohan, Aug 15).          
	Yours faithfully,       
S. Balakrishnan, Jamshedpur

                
	Sir  One can understand the protests against Abdul Kalam being frisked at the US airport. But what is the point of the anger against the treatment accorded to Shah Rukh Khan, who, after all, is just an ordinary citizen? The hue and cry in the media over this incident seems unwarranted (Airport quiz no big deal, says Salman, Aug 17). There are so many Indians who go through routine detentions at airports in America everyday. Why do the media not highlight their sufferings?           
	Yours faithfully,      
Harischandra Parasuram, Mumbai

                
	Sir  The US rates security as its topmost concern. It is this attitude that has prevented any major untoward incident in the country since 9/11. There is nothing wrong in Shah Rukh Khan being questioned about the purpose of his visit to America as a part of the routine check. When there were several other Asians waiting for secondary immigration checks, why should he have objected to the officers doing their job? Checking or frisking someone does not mean disrespect towards that individual. The Indian immigration officers, like their US counterparts, should also cross-examine every visitor thoroughly. The VIP-mindset that prevails among Indians needs to be changed. That will help eliminate security risks for India.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Dilbag Rai, Chandigarh

                
	Sir  The humiliation suffered by Shah Rukh Khan in the hands of the American immigration officials is regrettable. However, one must also remember the attitude of the officials at the immigration counters of Indian airports. Are they always polite and helpful, even to Indian citizens?          
	Yours faithfully,       
Kalyan Ghosh, Singapore

                
	Controversy continues          
	Sir  Manmohan Singhs address to Parliament clarifies what he meant in the joint statement he signed with Pakistans prime minister, but does not explain the strategy ahead (PM stuns critics with peace war, July 30). No justification was provided for the controversial Baluchistan and other areas clause either. There is no denying the fact that a dialogue with the neighbouring country is the path ahead. But is it also not important to create a healthy atmosphere before India engages productively with Pakistan? Pakistan took action against the prime accused in the Mumbai attacks, Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi, but that was a result of pressure from the US. Even Hafiz Saeed is now out of jail. These issues must not be overlooked by India while trying to talk with Pakistan.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Raghu Seshadri, Chennai

                
	Sir  Pranab Mukherjees assertion in Parliament that the mention of Baluchistan in the Indo-Pak joint statement was unilateral is shocking. When two heads of States meet, it is unlikely of one to hoodwink the other into inserting a clause in the joint statement. If that was the case, then should it not appear shameful for the supporters of the Indian prime minister, Manmohan Singh, to claim that Singh was talked into signing the agreement by the Pakistan prime minister, Yousaf Raza Gilani? If Singh signed knowing full well the implications of the reference to Baluchistan, it amounts to an admission of Indian role there. But if he signed under pressure, then it gives credence to the Bharatiya Janata Partys accusation that he is a weak prime minister.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Adwiti A. Sanatan, Mumbai

                
	Parting shot           
	Sir  The practice of the Goa government of granting extensions to public officials after they attain the age of retirement is unjust towards young aspirants to those jobs. As a rule, no extensions should be given, since nobody is indispensable. The process of recruiting someone to replace the retiring officer should be done well in advance. Unemployment is a major problem in the country. Older officials should not shamelessly use their political contacts to remain in office.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Aires Rodrigues, Ribandar, Goa

	Doctors with a difference                
	REMINISCENCES OF THE CUBAN REVOLUTIONARY WAR (Harper Perennial, Rs 295) by Ernesto Che Guevara is a compelling account of the struggle that turned a young, Argentinian doctor and two rebellious brothers into legends. In 1956, an oppressive State was wreaking havoc over the lives of Cubans, when the trio, comprising Che Guevara, Fidel and Ral Castro, along with a small band of their followers rose in rebellion against the government. Over the next three years, this group of young men moved all over the country, persuading the people to join their quest for freedom. The excitement of those anxious years come alive in these pages. Written in a typically personal, yet politically-charged, voice, this volume follows in the footsteps of Ches Bolivian Diary and the more famous, The Motorcycle Diaries. As with the previous books, this one, too, is filled with fascinating characters and astonishing episodes. From the sad death of a puppy to the battle of Mar Verde, where a bullet narrowly missed Ches head, nothing escapes the guerrilla leaders relentless scrutiny.                        
	MALICIOUS MEDICINE: MY EXPERIENCE WITH FRAUD AND FALSEHOOD IN INFERTILITY CLINICS (Penguin, Rs 150) by Anitha Jayadevan has been described by Anita Nair, in the Foreword, as both a cautionary report for couples seeking ART [assisted reproductive technology] and a moving memoir of a young woman desperately seeking to be a mother. Jayadevan got married in her early twenties, but failed to conceive in the first year of her marriage. This caused her bitter heartache, which was probably aggravated by social disapproval, although she never explicitly mentions such a possibility. Finally, she decided to visit an infertility clinic, which led to endless suffering at the hands of insensitive doctors, apart from astronomical medical bills accrued over the next eight years. Jayadevan does conceive after trying for seven years, but her trials do not end. She loses the foetus soon afterwards. The final shock, when it comes, is brutal, and leaves the reader reeling. The original version, written in Malayalam, has been translated into elegant English by P.K.R. Warrier and C.S. Unni.                                  
	WHO RUNS BRITAIN? (Hodder, Rs 495) by Robert Peston comes from the author of Browns Britain, which won wide acclaim. Peston also won a prestigious award for his scoop on the mortgage giant, HBOS, being taken over, and bailed out, by Lloyds TSB. The present volume, like the previous one, is lucidly argued, and all the more rivetting for that reason. Pestons question in the title is elucidated by the subtitle, posed in the form of yet another question that must be keeping Britons awake  ... whos to blame for the economic mess were in?        
	Pestons critique of the recession is framed by his memories of growing up in the London of the 1960s and 1970s, when he expected that Britain would become a fairer place to live in as it moved towards the millennium. But too much money and too much inequality of income distribution made the economy come to a crashing halt. The distributive justice of the open market was replaced by uncontrolled greed that created deep fissures in the edifice of social equity. Peston makes a grand survey of the economic policies pursued by different governments, under Margaret Thatcher, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, to show how the foundations of the British welfare state  from healthcare to pensions  have crumbled over the decades.                        
	THE RAPE OF NEWS? (Frog, Rs 60) edited by Sunil K. Poolani is a compilation of short pieces debating The ethics (or the lack of it) of selling editorial space. The articles, though forcefully argued, focus on the sinister aspects of the India media to the exclusion of all else. Contributors include Dilip DSouza, Meena Menon and Nilanjana S. Roy.

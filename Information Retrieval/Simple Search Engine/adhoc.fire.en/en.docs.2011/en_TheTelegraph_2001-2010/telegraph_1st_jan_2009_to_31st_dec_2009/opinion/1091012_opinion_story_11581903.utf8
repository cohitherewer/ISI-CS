The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | too much pay
                                                                                                                 TOO MUCH PAY                                                    
	Although he is a politician, Salman Khurshid is intelligent; not even his regulation khadi uniform can hide it. Some say that he is the most intelligent lawyer in India. That could be an exaggeration. But even without that honour, he is undisguisedly brilliant. His new jihad for cutting the salaries of chief executive officers does not fit too well with this reputation. It must be admitted that he has chosen an exquisite adjective  vulgar  to describe high salaries. He does not indulge in cheap self-righteousness or hypocrisy. He appeals to our taste, not to our morality. But a clever adjective does not make an argument; it still falls short of the cerebral level one would expect from Mr Khurshid.         
	It may be that those who see an inconsistency here do not possess the requisite intelligence. Such a conclusion would be supported by the fact that another person of unquestionable intelligence, Montek Singh Ahluwalia, has backed Mr Khurshid up. It is Mr Ahluwalias duty to support whatever ministers say, however outlandish; but this economist, who could have earned the top salary of an international civil servant if he had stuck to his first job in the World Bank, really seems to believe that Indian executives earn too much. He has also perhaps let the cat out of the bag when he said the issue had become important because governments had pumped in $1.6 trillion to bail out the world economy from a crisis. The rest of the argument would run as follows. Of that amount, the American government pumped in $250 billion into banks in trouble. Then J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs announced record bonuses for their executives. The government of the United States of America was shocked; so these banks paid back the bailout money they had received. Then the US treasury appointed Kenneth Feinberg controller of executive salaries in bailed-out institutions. The Indian government has helped thousands of rich farmers renege on their loans from banks; but it has not spent a penny to bail out any Indian company. No matter; if the Americans can do it, so can Indians. Phony egalitarianism is a speciality of the Congress. So Messrs Ahluwalia and Khurshid are just being orthodox Congressmen; the television time and newspaper columns they get are a bonus.         
	It does not matter how much Indian CEOs earn; what matters is how little Indian villagers earn. The government has assured them of minimum work and minimum wage through its national rural employment guarantee scheme. There is ample evidence of corruption in the scheme. Instead of performing before the media, Mr Khurshid and Mr Ahluwalia should go and catch a few politicians who are milking the NREGS.

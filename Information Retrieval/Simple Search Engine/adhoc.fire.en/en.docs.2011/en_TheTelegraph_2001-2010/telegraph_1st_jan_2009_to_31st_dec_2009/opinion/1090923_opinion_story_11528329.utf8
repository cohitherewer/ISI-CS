The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | party in peril
                                                                                                                 PARTY IN PERIL                                                    
	The least that the people expect a modern State to do is ensure the security of their lives. For those living in the Maoist-infested areas of West Bengal, the State and the government have clearly ceased to exist. The result is a grim situation in which the people either die in violence triggered by Maoists or live in constant fear of violent deaths. It has been three months since the forces of the Centre and the state government started joint operations against the rebels. What is truly amazing is that neither New Delhi nor Calcutta seems to have taken any lessons from its colossal failure. This has led to a dangerous drift that sees innocent people caught in the crossfire between Maoists and the government forces. Worse, the States failure has forced the people to either surrender to the rebels or take up arms in order to defend themselves. Mondays gun battle between the Maoists and supporters of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) close to the district headquarters of West Midnapore underscores the alarming spread of the rebels area of influence. It also shows how the government has abdicated its responsibility, allowing the cadre of the ruling party to usurp the administrations role. Even if the Maoists are killing mostly CPI(M) activists, it should be the responsibility of the administration, and not of armed partymen, to tackle the rebels challenge.         
	The problem for the CPI(M)  and hence for its government  is that it has always mixed up the party and the administration. If the state police and administration are so incapable of meeting the Maoist challenge and winning the peoples confidence, it is because the party has systematically used them to serve its own agenda. The exchange of fire between the Maoists and the Marxists proves once again that guns are increasingly taking over politics in West Bengal. The CPI(M)s leaders talk of fighting the Maoists politically. That is why the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government did not act on the Centres suggestion that the Communist Party of India (Maoist) be banned in the state. Several state governments that banned the Maoist party have been more successful in fighting it. It is time the chief minister realized the cost of a confused strategy. The battle against a group engaged in guerrilla warfare may be long and hard. Arming the party cadre cannot be a winning strategy.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | out of the race
                                                                                                                 OUT OF THE RACE                                                    
	Once they lost the war in 1945, the Japanese had no use for the little petrol engines they used to power field telephones of their army. They had more immediate worries: starving, they were wandering the countryside looking for something to eat. Yuichiro Honda rigged up the engines to the back-wheels of bicycles, and turned them into primitive motorcycles. Foragers bought up all the cycles he could motorize. Having made some money, he went to Europe, where he was mortified to watch a motorcycle race. He said to himself that he would make motorcycles that would beat all. And not just motorcycles; he went on to make great cars.        
	Fifty years later, Honda has announced that it would no longer participate in the Formula One circuit. And as it quits, the Bayerische Motoren Werke, its German rival, is asking itself what is the point of staying once Honda is gone. The exit of these two is not going to threaten Formula One racing. For neither has won the race since the 1980s. The winning cars of recent years have come from the stables of Ferrari, Mercedes and Renault. But Formula One is not for every carmaker; the cars for it are specially made and serviced. An occasional tycoon with money to throw around may buy one of those low-slung monsters to show off to his girlfriend; but the market for such cars is limited to the rich, ambitious and impulsive few. Making cars for them is not a business; it is more of a passion.        
	Business can be fun; it is more often an addiction. But as profits seep out of balance sheets, passion must be replaced by cold, rational calculation; and calculation is not friendly to indulgence in luxury. So many spectacular whims will fall prey to the creeping depression; from yachts to biplanes, from geishas to masseurs, many a form of indulgence will go out of fashion. That would not be such a bad thing, if only cheapness and efficacy come back into fashion. Indians were once notorious for their stinginess; one result of their parsimony was that India was the home of low-cost goods  not always of the best quality, but they served their purpose. It would not be a tragedy if this tradition of genteel poverty returned. People may learn again to get more out of their rupee, and extract more enjoyment out of less expenditure. India may again become a low-cost destination. Tourists who care for their yens and euros may rediscover India, which may at last be able to compete with China. While India has flourished in the past decade, it has not excelled in the world market. It has a few things to learn before it can do so. If the current hardships teach these lessons to Indians, these hardships may become a blessing in disguise.

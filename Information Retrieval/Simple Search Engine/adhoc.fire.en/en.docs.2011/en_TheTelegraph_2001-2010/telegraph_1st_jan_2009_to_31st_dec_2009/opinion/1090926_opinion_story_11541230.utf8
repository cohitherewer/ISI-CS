The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Cities in a bleak light
                                                                                                                 CITIES IN A BLEAK LIGHT                              Uddalak Mukherjee      Visual Arts                                                
	Samit Das is fascinated with cities without souls. His depiction of urban space in the exhibition titled Eye Line (Galerie 88, Sept 4-24) is singularly bleak, and his choice of colours, mostly grey, black and white, is in keeping with this bleakness. There is also a disturbing shapelessness about his cityscapes: misshapen blocks jut out at impossible angles; pillars, beams and razor-sharp structures dissolve into each other or pierce the dull sky. The cumulative effect is that of a jumbled mass of indeterminate shapes, and it does not quite succeed in capturing Dass intended vision of the city as a metaphor of an inert, decaying space.        
	However, there is an experimental side to Dass work. He uses laser engravings and collages, and among the exhibits is an installation made of white cardboard containing a sleek screen that shows a series of images of discarded, crumbling local deities in clay. Human indifference to divinity, Das contends, is symbolic of a modernity that is chilling in its insensitivity. Only one image born out of this clichd idea was striking enough. A huge head of Shiva lay forsaken with a garland of dried flowers around its neck. But the garland wasnt a beautiful thing; it looked like a chain that had been used to tame the mighty god.

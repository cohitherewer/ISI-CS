	Q: I am a lecturer in a private college and I have been sexually harassed by the principal of the college. I had reported the incident to the college management and had demanded an enquiry into the matter. But nothing has been done about it for over four months. Whats more, I was not given any increment this year, probably because of my complaint against the principal. I have already filed a case with the State Commission for Women. What should be my next course of action?  
	NAME WITHHELD  
	A: Since you have already filed a case, you should pursue your case with the State Commission for Women and request them to expedite the process for taking the necessary action against the principal. As far as receiving your increment is concerned, challenging the same will depend on the contents of your appointment letter signed and accepted by you.  
	Q:I am a member of a cooperative housing society that is constructing flats for its members. I would like to know whether Id have the right to sell or let out my flat to a person of my choice. Would I require permission from the society in this regard? Does the society have the right to deny permission and if so, is there a legal remedy for that?        
	Samar Kumar Malik, Calcutta  
	A: Before letting out or selling your flat you will have to submit an application to obtain the written consent of your cooperative housing society. The society can refuse your application but it has to notify the same to you in writing. If you are denied permission, you can file your appeal to the district registrar of cooperative societies as per the provisions of the West Bengal Cooperative Societies Act, 1983.   
	Q:I had a monthly income scheme in Jadavpur post office, which matured last October. However, the last ECS amount has not been remitted to my bank account. I had lodged written complaints with the postmaster of Jadavpur post office, and subsequently with the zonal postmaster, but to no avail. Finally, I wrote to the postmaster, GPO. I have still not received any response. What should I do now?
    Subrato Bhadury, via email  
	A: You could send a legal notice through   registered post with A/D to the post office, referring to your earlier complaints and request them to remit the amount in your account. If there is no response, you could file a case before the consumer court and also claim damages for mental agony suffered due to deficiency in services on the part of the post office.

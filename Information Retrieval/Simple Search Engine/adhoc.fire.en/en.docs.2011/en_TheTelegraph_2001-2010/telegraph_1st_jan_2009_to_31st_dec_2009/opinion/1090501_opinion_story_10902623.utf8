                                                                                                                 LIGHT MEETS PAINT                                                                  
	The ironies of photographic reproduction are sometimes bottomless. The various portraits that you see here in black-and-white were originally all black-and-white photographs, which were painted over painstakingly with oils or watercolours by highly skilled artists. The photographs are now part of the Alkazi Collection of Photography and have been reproduced (in full colour), catalogued and written about by Rahaab Allana and Pramod Kumar K.G. in PAINTED PHOTOGRAPHS: COLOURED PORTRAITURE IN INDIA (Alkazi Collection, Mapin, SOAS, price not mentioned). Then, by a peculiar quirk of technological fate, this review renders these coloured black-and-white images back into black-and-white. But the lushness of the textiles, embroidery and jewellery, painted over to convey the glimmer of silk or the glitter of gold, can still be made out in the latest black-and-white versions of these chameleonic images.        
	For Allana, painted photography in India represented a break with tradition through a sophisticated encounter between regional aesthetics, technological innovation and the urban market, thus establishing a genuine basis for the rise of a popular art. Drawing upon existing traditions of illumination (like Rajasthani and Mughal miniature paintings), painted photographs created their own hybrid of scientific documentation and artistic convention. Hence, Pramod Kumar K.G.s essay uses these photographs as historical documents of vital importance to a historian of clothes, textiles and accessories. For the modern eye, the point of these images lies in the way the particularity of human presence that photography captures coexists in them with the older conventions of portrait painting. Hence, they not only document transitions in the nature of colonial or feudal experience, but also raise crucial issues of their contemporaneity and significance in the digital age. This is best captured in Allanas vignette of the life and work of Inder Prakash, a middle-aged hand-colour artist, trained in Lucknow, then employed by the pioneering Mahatta Studio in Delhi and now working in his own attic in Delhis Patel Nagar. Through Prakash, Allana raises the questions of why/when a mode of representation becomes obsolete, and whether its necessity and social function are in fact sufficiently strong reason or motive for its continued existence.        
	All, except one, of the above are silver gelatine prints painted in watercolour, mostly c.1920-40 and made by unknown photographers and artists, unless mentioned. Left is a seated lady from Udaipur. Next to her, on top, is a lady painting a portrait, photographed by S.B. Syed from Dabhol. Below her, from right to left, are an unidentified gentleman, then Maharaj Kumar Bhupal Singh of Udaipur (c.1900), and finally, a Veiled Lady, photographed in Calcuttas Harrigraph Studio.

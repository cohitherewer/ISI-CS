                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Come clean                  
	Sir  The Supreme Court judges have at last agreed to put their personal assets, along with those of their spouses and dependents, in the public domain (SC judges decide to be transparent, Aug 27). The unanimous decision taken at a conclave of judges on August 26 has also put to rest the controversy generated by the apex courts seeming reluctance to be more transparent. In this context, the editorial, All clear (Aug 28), rightly pointed out that the landmark decision is proof of the judiciarys willingness to reform itself. The SC had so far resisted the moves to publicize such classified information. The judiciary was under the impression that this kind of declaration would dilute its credibility and independence. Earlier, the present Chief Justice of India, K.G. Balakrishnan, had permitted a controversial bill to be introduced in the Upper House only on the grounds that judges would be under no compulsion to make themselves accountable to the public. This raised eyebrows even among the veteran members of the legal fraternity. Of what use would the information that a judges assets have multiplied be unless there was a provision to examine how that had happened?           
	Certain revelations about the judiciary that have come to light in the recent past make it all the more important for judges to be accountable. Both S.P. Bharucha, a former CJI, and Justice V.R. Krishna Iyer have alleged that corruption among judges is on the rise. Moreover, their immunity against any kind of scrutiny had created the impression that they were infallible. It is indeed time for the SC to keep up the momentum of self-reform in order to erase the stigma and improve its image. Who else can set better examples of transparency than the judges who are relied upon for the dispensation of justice?                    
	Yours faithfully,      
P.B. Saha, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Although Supreme Court judges have agreed to reveal their personal assets, it is hard to understand why the SC had contested suggestions of making such information public. Legislators are expected to make their assets public before they contest elections, so why should judges not do the same? Members of the judiciary should not expect to be guided by a different set of rules. If any institution in a country as corrupt as India were to demand exemption from accountability, it would obviously raise eye brows, and the judiciary cannot be an exception in this context.           
	The systemization of the procedure of declaring personal assets will surely restore the confidence of the common man in the judiciary Moreover, greater transparency and accountability will undoubtedly help the judiciary regain its sanctity. In fact, if this rule were to be extended to others holding key posts, it will reduce corruption in India.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Historic win          
	Sir  India had created history in two other sporting events when the national football team won the Nehru Cup (India retain Nehru Cup, Sep 1). First came the podium finish for Force India in the Belgian Grand Prix. This was followed by the golden success of the shuttlers, Jwala Gutta and V. Diju, at Chinese Taipei Grand Prix. As far as the Nehru Cup was concerned, everyone hoped that India will repeat their earlier triumph. The dreams came true with India beating Syria in the final. It was thrilling to see the national flag flying high in different parts of the world after a long time.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Rajarshi Ghosh, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  The Indian football team must be congratulated for winning the Nehru Cup. It was a fabulous day for the countrys soccer fans who erupted with joy after the Indian goalkeeper, Subrata Paul, leapt in the air to fist over Hamzeh Alattounis shot in the tie-breaker to secure his team a historic victory over Syria in the final. Indias team spirit helped script this momentous win, and it is remarkable that this is the second time India has won the tournament under the coach, Bob Houghton. This means that along with the former Soviet Union and Iraq, India too now has the distinction of defending its title successfully in the Nehru Cup. This is indeed a credible achievement, and both the coach and Paul deserve to be feted like heroes for their performance. The government should also reward the players and make sure that they receive as much support as the national cricketers.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  In recent months, the controversy regarding auto-emission has been hogging the headlines of newspapers and television channels. The common people are being bombarded with technical terms such as two-stroke, four-stroke, single mode, dual mode and so on. In the ensuing confusion, the people have not been able to get the real picture and are therefore unknowingly supporting different groups expressing varied opinions as to whether the polluting vehicles should be allowed to ply on the roads. The government should release authentic, technical information, explaining how different engines function, their fuel efficiency, and the dangers posed by harmful emissions to human beings.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
K.B. Goswami, Calcutta

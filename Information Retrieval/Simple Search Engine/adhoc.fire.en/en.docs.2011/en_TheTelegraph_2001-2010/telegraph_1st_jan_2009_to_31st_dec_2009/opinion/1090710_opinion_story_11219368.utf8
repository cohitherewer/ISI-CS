                                                                                                                 READING BETWEEN THE LINES                              BONA FIDE-Malvika Singh                              
	The buzz in Britain and Europe is that India and China will lead the world out of its recessionary phase and that the worst is behind us. For the first time ever, an Indian visiting another country has a certain kind of glamour that had not been there in the past. More so today than before, Indians have the buying power, as do the people from the Middle East, Far East and Japan. Top-of-the-line boutiques and smart, expensive restaurants are peopled with the Japanese, a few members of the English elite and some visiting as well as resident Indians! Getting a table is tough and needs to be done well in advance. The Harrods and Selfridges of the world are crowded with buyers of all nationalities, shopping as if there were no tomorrow. That is the truth that meets the eye despite oft-repeated contrary positions held by the intelligentsia and the media. Vienna and Salzburg are no different and are full of tourists and activity. Tickets for the music festival are impossible to get hold of at any price.        
	Back home, the monsoon eludes us in north India and the humid, suffocating heat brings home the stark reality of how the weather and the lack of infrastructure to deal with its extremes have managed to debilitate the minds of a diverse people  one of the largest human resource banks of public entrepreneurs with valuable, albeit latent and untapped, strengths, skills and expertise. Amidst all this heat and seeming chaos, the national budget brings forth a positive sense of clear purpose with its emphasis on empowering India rather than on continuing to prop up on the already-privileged, hoping for some kind of trickle down effect to take care of the poor. Reading between the lines, it seems that India will be left alone to grow and when the climate eases, disinvestment of public sector concerns will take place, the economy will be unshackled, and Bharat will be injected with all that it needs to break out of the morass it has been sinking in for decades. This appears to be a break from the predictable past, from the influence of the lobbies and pressure groups that have had their way at the cost of the majority. A fresh vision for the future seems to have prevailed over the status quo measures of the past.              
	Call the shots        
	Scanning the headlines, a feelgood factor comes across the footlights. One senses a renewed energy to overhaul and reassess what have been the comfort zones of inaction for the erstwhile rulers of India. In many areas and ministries, coalition partners contained most experiments and stifled change by endorsing the status quo. They also fought against any overhaul that would liberate institutions from the stranglehold of the babus. Declarations from the minister of human resource development have rattled the erstwhile committee-ridden, lobby-infested ministry that has held the intellectual potential of an enormous human resource to ransom with its faulty structures and closed-mindedness. Mistakes will be made and reversals of decisions may happen, but the shake-up is essential for the country to exploit the human treasure sitting out there, waiting to be included in a radically changed system of education and learning.        
	A proactive minister of enviroment and forests appears to be changing the narrative and compelling the correction of a great deal of wrong decision-making processes. Politicized bureaucrats, used to operating outside the norms, are being watched and being made to adhere, singularly, to the rules and laws. If corruption is weeded out of the ministry, it will be a salutary achievement and will protect our environment, help conserve it. Since India is a forerunner among the nations that determine the future vision of the world, we need the correctives to kick in now to enable us to legitimately start calling the shots.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Still the Shift is Sad
                                                                                                                 STILL THE SHIFT IS SAD                                  Stephen Hugh-Jones                              
	Do I seem to have got hung up on short words these past weeks? I guess I have been: Ive dealt first with but and yet, and then gone on to and. And I still am hung up on words like these. Read on, and you will find the first few lines of this piece to have been made up, till Im caught out in my own trap  all good things must come to an end  of 77 monosyllables. Count them.         
	Its short words are among the great charms of English  how different from such polysyllabically inflected languages as Latin or Sanskrit and most of their direct descendants. But shortness does not mean simplicity. Take one of those in my first paragraph, still. It has a curious history.        
	These days, we use it to say that something is continuing, often unexpectedly and maybe only for a time: Your great-grandfather is still alive then, is he? But look at the famous start of this 17th-century poem by Robert Herrick:        
	Gather ye rosebuds while ye may,/ Old Time is still a-flying...        
	What does that still mean? That time is rushing forward just as it did last year and the year before? Well, what a surprise. But no: it simply means always.        
	Or take these lines by George Herbert, a deeply moving poet of that period who gave up a potentially glittering career to become a humble parish priest. Hes describing a momentary rebellion against his faith:        
	I struck the board and cried No more/ What? Shall I ever sigh and pine?.../ Shall I be still in suit?        
	Is he asking, Am I to go on in suit [asking for something] as I was the week before? Not so. Herbert too is simply saying always  Must I always be asking for something?                
	Dead meaning        
	Its easy to see how the old usage of still slips into the modern one (which indeed is not solely modern: youll find both in the great 1611 translation of the Bible). Yet today the old meaning is entirely dead. I doubt that one educated person in a hundred is aware of it, let alone would use it  or should.        
	You can see it dying in an 18th-century hymn still widely used in English churches:        
	Jesu, lover of my soul,/ Let me to thy bosom fly,/ While the gathering waters roll,/ While the tempest still is high  or nigh in some versions.        
	Widely used and today thoroughly confusing. Is the churchgoer suggesting that the storm will soon be past, and that he just wants a bit of shelter till it is? Thats what the average hymn-singer might well think, and be deeply puzzled by it.        
	I suspect that the emendation to nigh came from some over-subtle cleric, eager to make sense of the words in the modern meaning of still  while the tempest is still nearby, but hasnt actually arrived yet. So give me shelter before it does. But high, it seems, is the original word. Maybe the hymn-writer, Charles Wesley, brother of the famous John, merely shoved in still to make his line scan.        
	By the early 19th century, this use of still for always had gone out. Witness the Americans national anthem, which rejoices that our flag was still there, in exactly the modern sense of the word, after the hammering the British had given it.         
	The shift of still to the modern sense alone is sad, maybe, but no loss: it makes understanding easier. Too bad the same hasnt happened with ever, which also used to mean always, as in those lines from George Herbert, and still does in words like everlasting or forever, yet which now almost always means exactly the opposite, even once.        
	I could still go on about that. But I promise I wont. Ever.                    THEWORDCAGEYAHOO.CO.UK

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Not the best of plans 
                                                                                                                 NOT THE BEST OF PLANS                               CHINA DIARY - NEHA SAHAY                              
	The National Peoples Congress  the equivalent of Parliament  met in Beijing this month, as it does at this time every year, to debate and pass policies. This time, among the confident announcements of overcoming the financial crisis, there were some unusual proposals that have angered people for their absurdity.        
	The proposal that has drawn the fiercest abuse on the internet is that old classical Chinese characters be reintroduced within the next decade. After liberation in 1949, Mao Zedong had introduced simplified Chinese characters in 1956, aimed at spreading literacy faster. Traditional Chinese characters, with their proliferation of strokes, had been mastered by just 25 per cent of the population who were literate then.         
	By 1964, the literacy rate had risen to 66.42 per cent. Today, it is 91 per cent. Simplified characters played no small part. Even these characters arent easy  the commonest Chinese words such as wo (I), he (and) and ni (you) have five to eight strokes. Little kids take hours completing their homework, filling pages with the same character.                 
	Poor response        
	The delegate who introduced this proposal had three arguments in support: the simplified characters had marred the aesthetics, the scientific principles and the deep meaning underlying traditional Chinese characters. Second, with the widespread use of computers, keying in traditional characters would pose no problem. Finally, it would help unify Taiwan with the mainland, as Taiwan, like Hong Kong and Macau, uses traditional Chinese.        
	The response from the education ministry and the official Language Institutes was immediate and negative. So also the response of netizens, who used the choicest epithets to describe the peoples representatives who gave priority to such irrelevant proposals. Another proposal, to introduce 1,000-yuan notes, also fell flat. The delegate who introduced it felt it would boost consumption in the current slump. It would also cut down on the use of paper and make counting easier for bank clerks.        
	The pithiest response to this was from a government employee interviewed in a newspaper survey: The best thing to boost domestic consumption would be to increase income, not the number on the banknote. The peoples delegate was surely aware that one such banknote would be more than the monthly income of 50 per cent of his countrys migrant workers, and double that of the average farmer?                
	Pretty faces        
	Normally, the man on the street cares two hoots about this annual session, except to keep away from Tiananmen Square, which is out of bounds as long as the Congress is in session. This time, however, photographs of attractive hostesses whose task it was to wait on the 3,000-plus delegates caused quite a storm.         
	The pretty young things wore a variety of dresses long, red overcoats over high boots, the traditional Chinese silk gowns slit till the thigh, three-piece suits with the skirts far above their knees, ethnic costumes and so on. Probably finding them more photogenic than the delegates, photographers took their pictures in various moods  dancing and horsing around on the vast and empty Tiananmen Square; sitting pretty, waiting for the delegates to finish their sessions; posing in front of the Great Hall of the People.         
	Apparently, this was the first time the young girls had been hired to wait on the delegates. If their job was only to serve tea, why werent middle- aged, laid-off workers or poor students hired, asked one reader? Another wondered whether peoples money should be spent on the hostesses outfits. Most looked like rural women, so it could be counted as rural development, countered a third.

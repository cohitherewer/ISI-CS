                                                                                                                 TIME TO ACT                                                    
	Time for confused rhetoric over how to tackle the Maoists is clearly running out. The rebels themselves seem to entertain no such confusions. Sympathetic sections of the civil society may attribute the Maoist violence to social and economic exploitations. But the rebels have a clearer view of their ends and means. They are sworn to a violent ideology that, they think, would help them seize State power. Their daring attack on a police station in West Midnapore district should leave no one in doubt about their intentions and strategy. It is no coincidence that the assault comes almost within hours of the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, calling for a holistic approach to what he considers the greatest threat to Indias internal security. Mr Singh would like the States response to be more nuanced than purely punitive. No one can question the wisdom of such an approach, but the Maoists may render it unworkable. Both in theory and in strategy, the rebels want a bigger confrontation with the State in order to intensify their guerrilla warfare. That is why Maoist violence has increased dramatically in recent months in different parts of the country. They are clearly baiting the State to engage with them on militaristic lines.        
	Not having a definitive policy to tackle the problem will be disastrous for the State, but no policy is good enough unless it is acted on with clarity and determination. The governments in New Delhi and the Maoist-infested states seem to suffer from the dual disadvantage of a warped policy and ill-defined strategies. West Bengals poor record in fighting the Maoists is a case in point. After all the Maoist mayhem over the past year, it is not yet clear whether Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is firm enough to do what needs to be done to stem the rot. His party, the Communist Party of India (Marxist), has been the worst victim of the Maoist violence, but it still talks of fighting the rebels politically. It seems that neither the chief minister nor his party is prepared to pay the costs of a full-blown fight. A comparison between his approach and that of the former chief minister, Siddhartha Shankar Ray, in dealing with the Naxalites in the early Seventies is unavoidable. Mr Ray left no grey areas in the fight, either political or moral, and decisively won the battle. Mr Bhattacharjee would do well to emulate Mr Rays decisiveness and firmness of purpose.

	Sangeet Natak Akademi, the apex body for performing arts, presented Nritya Sangam, a festival of dance, at Rabindra Sadan (March 25-28). This four-day dance festival was organized in association with the information and cultural affairs department and Anjika. Lecture demonstrations by the various participating dancers were also held.Thirteen dancers from different states of India participated and demonstrated the various styles of Indian classical dance in this festival.        
	The festival started with a performance by Anandi Ramachandran (picture), an Odissi dancer from Mumbai. Her first number, Patitapavana, an invocation based on excerpts from Upendra Bhanjas Vaidehi Vilasa, was neat and was characterized by nimble footwork. This was followed by a pallavi based on raga Arvi which was an average performance. Kuru Yadu Nandana, an abhinay synonymous with Kelucharan Mahapatra, failed to impress. In spite of the beautiful expressions and fluid movements, Ramachandrans performance lacked the strength and intensity that are required in an inaugural performance of a prestigious festival.        
	Andhranatyam by Kalakrishna specialized in stree vesham and was the most spectacular presentation of the entire festival. Tall and handsome, the dancer, dressed in traditional costume with a lamp in his hand, started the performance with an invocation. His next item was a padam, and it was followed by Nabajanardana, a portrayal of Satyabhama as virahokonthita nayika. The presentation was marked by a rare balance of the lasya and tandava aspects, exclusive to Andhranatyam.        
	Madhumita Roys presentation of tihais, lari, ginti, paramelu  traditional elements of Kathak  was crisp and lively. Her abhinaya, based on a thumri by Narayan Prasad, depicted Radha-Krishna chhed-chhad, an all-time favourite of Kathak exponents.         
	Meerananda Borthakur, from Guwahati, presented a colourful and enjoyable Sattriya dance. It began with an invocation to Lord Vishnu and moved on to nrityabhinay based on vatsalya rasa. Vilasini Natyam, by Anupama Kailash of Hyderabad, is the dance of the Telugu devdasis. A disciple of Swapna Sundari, Anupama, started with a prayer in praise of Lord Ganapati. This was followed by shabda pallavi, which was choreographed by her guru. The entire presentation was dramatic and gorgeous.         
	Gopika Varma from Thiruvananthapuram was the only Mohiniattam dancer in the festival. Gaudiya Nritya was performed by Mahua Mukherjee while Sailaja from Chennai gave an enjoyable Kuchipudi recital. Navtej Singh Johar was able to maintain his high standards.The last performer of the festival was Harish Gangani, a talented Kathak dancer, who enthralled the audience with a scintillating performance full of verve and vigour. N. Ajit Singh and O. Debola Devi from Manipur and Kalamandalam Shylaja were among the other participants in this festival.

	Recognition, at last                  
	Sir  It is heartening to see how far the Nobel committee has come in the last 50 years in recognizing the role of women scientists (Unlocked, chemistry of a Nobel rivalry, Oct 19). The pioneering role of Rosalind Franklin, whose X-ray photographs of DNA led her colleagues, Watson and Crick, to build the double helix DNA model was only acknowledged after her death. Contrast this with the recent times when a woman scientist, Ada Yonath, received due credit for her work, and was jointly awarded the prize in Chemistry with her male colleagues.          
	Yours faithfully,         Alok Mohan, Dubai 
        
	Paradise regained          
	Sir  I am a Bengali tourist, and I have just returned from a visit to Kashmir. I would like to respond to the report, Why your heroic holiday in Kashmir was worth it (Oct 19). I would say that Kashmir is a heavenly place and terrorism does not seem to disturb its beauty these days. During our visit to Srinagar, a grenade blast at the Lal Chowk market was reported, but the news did not create much hype or panic. We ended up visiting Lal Chowk several times to shop, even on the days just before and after the blast.           
	Our trip was more or less safe except for one frightening incident that occurred due to our decision to see the golden apples of Sopore. By the time we reached Sopore, it was getting dark. Our Tata Sumo suddenly halted near a marketplace. For the first couple of minutes, we could not understand what was happening. Then we saw smoke about 50 metres ahead of our car and also noticed people running for shelter. Our driver turned the car towards some alleys that were congested since everyone was using them to get out. The sound of firing and the sight of smoke made us nervous. After about 45 minutes, we managed to reach the Baramulla road and made our escape. The following day, a news item in Kashmir Times said that seven rounds had been fired injuring several people. Except this one incident, the rest of our trip was relatively peaceful. Along with the apples and the snow, this incident also added to the flavour of our trip. I wish to visit this paradise again.          
	Yours faithfully,         Sayari Biswas, Kestopur
      
	Low but lucrative  
	Sir  It is perhaps not appropriate to link the craze for a Group D job in government offices with the curse of unemployment that has afflicted generations (Jobless dam bursts in city, Oct 14). There are numerous attractions of a lower-ranked government job: security without accountability, assured, periodic pay hikes and the liberty to decide whether or not to work.           
	Unfortunately, I need to go to offices of both the state as well as the Central governments quite frequently. While the latter are comparatively clean and quiet, chaos rules in the former. Furniture is dumped on the landings, there are dusty files on almirahs, walls bear spit marks and are covered with posters, peons listen to loud music on their cell phones, smoke and chew paan, while the clerks chatter throughout the day.           
	The attraction of a low-rung government job is thus considerable. It is a one-way ticket to the world of prosperity, comfort and high-handedness, and is worth taking a shot at despite the fact that the chances of success are rather slim. With the mushrooming of private colleges, educational degrees have ceased to indicate the true potential of a candidate. Therefore, it is futile to highlight the tragedy of a postgraduate applying for a chaprasis post. Joblessness prevails not because we do not have enough jobs but because most men and women crave for jobs that are a few notches above their potential.          
	Yours faithfully, 
  Chameli Pal, Batanagar

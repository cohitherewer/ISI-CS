The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Weak imitation of a difficult treasure

	Some believe that dhrupad lost out to khayal because its later exponents took to prolonged bouts of layakari to draw listeners away from the then novel taan and murki-oriented khayal genre.        
	Listening to the Gundecha Brothers (Umakant and Ramakant) at their Sangeet Ashram recital (G.D. Birla Sabhagar, March 10), I was convinced that I would prefer the so-called laya tandav to the weak-in-raga-characterization, poor in both alap and dhrupad format norms, and eventually anachronistic fare, that the duo ladled out to the delight of the presumably elite audience.        
	The classic dhrupad was not preceded by a long alap. Its alap briefly introduced the raga. It was the dhrupad composition itself that displayed the raga in its full glory. I found this style in the last Rampur beenkar, Ustad Dabir Khan, and Bengal stalwarts like Shib Shankar Mukherji and the still-practicing veteran, Subodh Ranjan Dey.         
	The so-called Dagars (a title added after his own name by Riazuddin Khan) borrowed elements of the 12-part alap of the been to prolong it. The 20th century gem of the family, Nasir Moinuddin Khan died young, leaving behind his vocal back-up Nasir Aminuddin to plod along. The two were known internationally as Dagar Brothers though neither their father, the great Ustad Nasiruddin Khan, nor his father, the famed Allabande Khan, was ever known as Dagars.        
	Nasir Aminuddin and all who came after him lengthened simple phrases unnecessarily and broke up the lyrics in the manner of dhamar when singing dhrupads. But they generally did not misrepresent ragas the way the Gundechas did in their alap in raga Marwa, where they virtually laid equal stress on all the six notes, thus ruining it.        
	The long nishad was particularly deplorable. They were occasionally slightly out of tune as well. Singing the dhrupad, Anahat Naad, they indulged in jod style figures complete with a staccato version of lad-lapet. The sultal drut dhrupad was somewhat better. The Hameer aochar was developed interestingly for a change and the dhamar, Abir gulal, sounded much better than the dhrupads, although the pakhawaj player chose to play the first beat mnemonic as Dha in place of Kat. The unkindest cut was the final anachronistic aochar and composition in the Hindustani version of the Carnatic raga, Charukeshi, introduced by Pandit Ravi Shankar. Here the Gundechas not only mixed up the raga with Nat Bhairav by leaving the komal nishad out of many phrases, including the mukhra of the composition, but sang khayal-style sargams and lighter phrases in the aochar with more dexterity than they had shown in alap and dhrupad. People do not get to hear proper dhrupad nowadays, how can they be expected to like it?

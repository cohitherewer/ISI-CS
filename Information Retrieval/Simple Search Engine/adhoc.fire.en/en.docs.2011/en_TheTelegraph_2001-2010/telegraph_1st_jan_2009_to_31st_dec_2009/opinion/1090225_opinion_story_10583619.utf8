	Politicians are selectively deaf. They hear only what they want to hear. Thus it will be optimistic to expect that politicians in West Bengal heard what Amartya Sen had to say about the state and it politics in the course of a lecture on Monday. He did not say anything that was startlingly new  he has made some of the points before, and others have too. That the economic prospect of West Bengal, without any possibility of industrialization, is grim goes without saying but bears reiteration. Industrialization and thus inevitably the economy of the state have been held to ransom by a particular kind of politics. The politics of violence on the one hand and the politics of arrogance on the other have descended as a curse on West Bengal. Politicians are perpetuating this curse instead of making a united effort to remove it. The word, united, is significant. Mr Sen emphasized that approaches to the economic development of the state would have to be much more collaborative and consultative in nature. Mr Sen was asking political parties to abjure the path of narrow sectarianism and to think of the state rather than of petty political and electoral gains. Such good sense is unlikely to appeal to any political party or political leader of the state since they believe that differences can only be settled on the streets and through political muscle power.        
	The other warning note that Mr Sen sounded was on the question of bandhs, an all-too-common occurrence in West Bengal. A bandh, as Mr Sen pointed out, is an imposition of a minority on the whole of society. The imposition rides on the threat of intimidation and violence. It curtails, as Mr Sen rightly noted, the freedom of the common man. The only thing that can be added to the Nobel laureates warning is that the majority has a role in resisting the imposition of a minority. The people of West Bengal have always passively accepted bandhs called by political parties. This has provided the political parties with the excuse for claiming that bandhs have popular support. If those who live in West Bengal do see bandhs as a curtailment of their freedom, they must be prepared to stand up for their freedom and to protect it. Unfortunately, such protests in West Bengal have been absent. Hence the calumny that West Bengal is a state that loves bandhs. By raising the question of curtailment of freedom, Mr Sen has also raised the issue of responsibility. Are the people of West Bengal responsible to their freedom?

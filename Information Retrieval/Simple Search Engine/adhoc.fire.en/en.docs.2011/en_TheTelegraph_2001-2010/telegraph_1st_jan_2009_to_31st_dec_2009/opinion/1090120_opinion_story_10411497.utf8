	The National Knowledge Network is an excellent idea. This digital network, whose bandwidth is almost a million times higher than the highest available in India now, links a few premier institutes of higher scientific and technological education, but will eventually link 10,000 institutions of higher education, including schools. This not only makes knowledge-sharing easier and richer, but also offers solutions to chronic infrastructural problems like teacher shortage. Indian schools, colleges, universities and other institutes of learning will be linked with one another and with the rest of the world more efficiently. This ought to be a technological leap as well as a democratic one, bringing about a more just redistribution of pedagogic resources.        
	Yet, digital networks, however sophisticated and efficient, do not, in themselves, constitute either knowledge or the activity of imparting knowledge. The learning process remains, in spite of every kind of technological progress, a fundamentally human affair. The worthiness of technology depends entirely on how human beings use it, on how humanly run systems maintain, utilize and facilitate access to it. All institutions that are part of this network will have to think concretely about how to reorganize their resources and facilities so as to make them compatible to digitization. Consider libraries and archives, for instance. The NKN could provide unique opportunities for upgrading the contents as well as organization of both, and of being able to share each institutions resources with the others. But this will only be possible if the resources are catalogued and digitized properly, which will, in turn, mean the proper allocation and administration of funds and know-how. Moreover, just as networks connect, they can also exclude. Institutions across the rural-urban and rich-poor divides will have to think very hard through questions of access.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A matter of security
                                                                                                                 A MATTER OF SECURITY                          - A self-defeating controversy surrounds Pokhran-II        Kanwal Sibal                                                          
	It is not easily comprehensible why those who have held positions of responsibility and trust in our atomic energy and defence establishments should have been so unmindful of the national security repercussions of the public controversy they have stirred up over the status of our 1998 thermonuclear test. This is not an academic debate, a professional wrangle between scientists about the correct interpretation of complex technical data from some experiment with only in-house implications  however the conflicting arguments are settled.         
	The issue raised touches the core of Indias national security. It is so sensitive that even the initiation of the debate by scientists associated with Pokhran-II on whether the country has, in fact, the kind of nuclear deterrent it officially claims to possess has profound external ramifications. India is building a nuclear deterrent to meet real threats to its external security, not as an addition to its internal security armoury. The government has maintained for 11 years that the thermonuclear and other tests were fully successful, that no further testing is required, that India now has the wherewithal to build a broad spectrum credible minimum deterrent, and on that basis a nuclear doctrine has been enunciated. The dissenting scientific voices, by publicly disputing this official position, are sowing internal confusion and giving comfort to our adversaries.        
	They imply that senior figures of the department of atomic energy, by their unwillingness to entertain outside technical evidence of the tests failure, and by insisting on their own evaluation of diverse data based on information about weapon design, material content and so on that they alone possessed, are guilty of wrongly certifying to the countrys political leadership, and the nation, that the test was successful, whereas it was actually a fizzle.                     
	If, as is claimed, a Defence Research and Development Organisation report on the purported failure of the test was presented to the government end-1998, it is unimaginable that if it contained clinching arguments an internal review would not have been ordered, with efforts being made by the government to ascertain the factual position.         
	If the argument is that having once rejected the dissenting view, the then government was obliged to suppress the truth, then it needs to be asked whether the matter was raised afresh with the United Progressive Alliance government, in the reasonable expectation that it would appraise the issue with an open mind. If it wasnt then it must be explained why not. And if it was, and the new government reached the same substantive conclusion as before, then the evidence that the test had failed was inconclusive. It is well to remember that the tests were projected as a great national security achievement by the National Democratic Alliance government, as opposed to the pusillanimity of the previous Congress governments on the issue of testing, and therefore the UPA government would have had the incentive to nail fraudulent thermonuclear claims. And, even if for the sake of national interest, the findings could not be made public, at least the cabal of scientists responsible for hiding the truth and duping the country through technical obfuscation, could, at the very least, have been moved out.        
	If the intention in publicly raising a controversy over the issue now is that the door for testing is likely to be soon closed definitively with the Barack Obama administrations zeal to bring the comprehensive test ban treaty into force, and that India should therefore test while there still is opportunity to do so and have a reliable thermonuclear weapon in its panoply, then it must be said that such advocacy is as ill-timed as the disclosure about the failed test. Why was this revelation not made when the issue of Indias right to test was at the centre of the acrimonious debate on the nuclear deal? The debate lasted three years, and so ample opportunities were available to critically intervene in it to protect the freedom of action to test that has suddenly become so important now.         
	If the argument is that India can take the risk of scuttling the nuclear deal by unilaterally testing now, then why was not any attempt made earlier to scuttle the negotiations on the deal by divulging the failure of the thermonuclear test and generating public pressure on the government to reject the test-connected right to return provision of the negotiated accord, as mandated by United States of Americas nuclear legislation? The consequences for the nuclear deal and relations with the US apart, unilateral testing by India could threaten to unravel the global non-proliferation regime, isolate India internationally, expose it as an irresponsible power with lasting political consequences for its ambition to play a more prominent international role, invite a slew of sanctions and damage its economic prospects. The hubris of over six per cent growth at a time of global recession should not blind us to the realities of our situation.              
	The demand for a peer review of the data from the thermonuclear test may sound reasonable, but it is hardly workable in practical terms. This demand implies the rejection of government claims, reiterated recently, that several such reviews have been undertaken in the last 11 years. A proper, independent peer review is demanded, but what does it mean in effect? Would it entail sharing sensitive information with experts of high public standing in diverse test related disciplines, after they have been sworn to secrecy? Would any government concede an outside review and indirectly acknowledge it had mishandled a vital matter until now? But would such a review necessarily efface the damage already done?         
	Naturally, if the findings of any workable peer review were to uphold the governments position, they could be made public, but the sceptics could still say that the government had too much at stake not to arrange a whitewash. But would any government publicize a negative finding and open itself to accusations of compromising national security by not taking action at the right time, lying to the nation, and invite demands for fixing responsibility? Would it be wise in such a case to officially expose the gap in our nuclear deterrent and give unsolicited comfort to our enemies?        
	One might have hoped that after the initial deplorable indiscretion, wiser counsel would have prevented any further damaging debate. Regrettably, the clarifications by the national security adviser  functionally the appropriate authority to pronounce on the current controversy  have been scoffed at in personally pejorative terms. The argument that he lacks the scientific credentials to make a judgment would apply to the prime minister too. The recent briefing by Anil Kakodkar and R. Chidambaram should normally suffice to end a self-defeating debate, but when egos and rivalries are at play one cannot be sure. Unfortunately, the present controversy is symptomatic of the growing breakdown of consensus in society.

	The political class in India has lost its sense of humour. Recently, when one of its breed, a new recruit and therefore a normal person, said he was travelling cattle class in keeping with the holy cows, the Congress spokespeople got all miffed and agitated, which was even more hilarious than the statement itself. Economy class is called cattle class because airlines treat passengers flying in that part of the plane with no respect and take no real care of them. And frankly, the many holy cows of an India of the past, with all the hypocrisy that goes with those endless posturing, need to be flushed away in this new millennium.        
	The hypocrisy was so overwhelming that the past decades did little to alleviate the horrors that at least 70 per cent of Indians have to live with. Tokenism makes us, ordinary Indians, sick. We know well that this entire austerity trip is a passing phenomenon. If the Congress was truly serious about being austere, enlightened and reformist, it would convene a meeting, create a manual after discussion with the members, and adhere to a value system and style of working and living that could influence people across the board. Politicians find endless reasons to justify their extravagance. Their bureaucrats, too, lead lives funded by the tax-payer and silently stall everything that does not hold up the status quo.        
	First, the party needs to ensure with utmost rigidity that its incumbents in government do not stay in free or subsidized housing when they are no longer members of parliament or cabinet ministers. Second, all domestic travel should be by economy, and all overseas travel by business class. Third, politicians should not use the official car (only because it has a red light that clears the path) to do their personal chores, go shopping or attend private dinners. There is so much more that has made our leaders insular from the realities we face today. All the privileges enjoyed by them, including State protection, need restructuring. Austerity comes from within, and individuals must know what it is to be over the top.              
	Sharp divisions        
	More critical than all the superficial austerity is the delivery of goods and services, the alleviation of corruption and poverty, and addressing other important issues such as the freedom to worship, human rights, and transparent governance. The corruption and the commercialization of political decision making that we are witness to each time an election approaches is far more damaging than the utterance of Shashi Tharoor. Sadly, Tharoor tweeted in a language that the respondents are unfamiliar with, dont quite understand its nuances, and therefore got the wrong end of what was said. That in itself was the funniest situation of all.        
	As this farce continues with none of the critical areas of extravagance being confronted and corrected, it rapidly becomes clear that the entire episode is a result of a small cabal, seen to be powerful within the Congress, operating against new incumbents unused to devious politicking. Instead of having briefed the newcomers on what the Congress expects its leaders to live by, groups with vested interest within the party began their insidious campaign. But in the bargain they showed up the Congress factionalism sharp and distinct, loud and clear.        
	The only charitable explanation is that the party is going through the painful process of shedding a top skin as it is forced to allow the layer beneath its rightful exposure. Those who have no other professional discipline or expertise, and who are on the wrong side of 50, are tormented by the fact that their days are numbered in the power game.        
	The present state of denial of the real failures is the extravagance that has destroyed a great deal in India. The ruling party needs to ensure the austerity of transparent governance.

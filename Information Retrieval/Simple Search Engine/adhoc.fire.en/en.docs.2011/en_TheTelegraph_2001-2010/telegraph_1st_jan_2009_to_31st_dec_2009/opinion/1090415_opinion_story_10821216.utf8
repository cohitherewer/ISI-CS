	Tomorrow marks the beginning of the end of the election campaign. In many parts of the country tomorrow morning, thousands of Indians will be stepping out of their homes to cast their votes that will decide the countrys future, theoretically, for the next five years. In the areas that go to the polls on April 16, the ubiquitous microphones that mark election campaigns in India have already fallen silent; all over India, television channels can no longer show their poll surveys and forecasts. Not surprisingly, the election campaign has not presented the political class in particularly edifying terms. If Varun Gandhis hate speech in Pilibhit marked a low point in Indian electioneering, other politicians, far older and more experienced than Mr Gandhi, have not shown a great deal of maturity in the ways that they have spoken. Oratory is a part of the election campaign: politicians use rhetoric to rally the people and to win points over their rivals. All this is par for the course. Despite this, no one quite expects rhetoric without substance. Yet, this has been the hallmark of the current campaign season. Witness the exchange of words between the leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party  especially L.K. Advani and Narendra Modi  and those of the Congress  including the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, and the three members of the Gandhi family, Sonia, Rahul and Priyanka. The exchange, such as it was, was not a debate on issues, but a series of personal attacks. The first stone may have been cast by the BJP, but the Congress certainly did not lag behind.        
	From these exchanges, it would be impossible to fathom the concerned leaders contending visions of India. Personalities rather than issues have dominated proceedings. The prime minister had appealed for the use of temperate language, and to abjure the use of abuse. But this was not heeded. The campaign has been bitter and acrimonious. In this sense, this campaign has been no different from the previous one or the one before that. Things have definitely not improved in this respect over the years. They may have worsened. Will it be an exaggeration to suggest that viciousness has come to stay as a permanent fixture in election campaigns? If the answer is yes, then it will serve to take away from the sophistication, subtlety and humour that are often taken to be the birth signs of a democratic polity. Indian democracy may carry on it different signs and symbols.

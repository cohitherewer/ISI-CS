	A tale of competing tamashas is too much for the imagination. Yet it is the reality. The month-long general elections in India coincide with the second edition of the Indian Premier League which began in South Africa yesterday. Had it not been for the general elections, the IPL matches would have all been played in India instead of in another country. The government of India felt, in its wisdom, that it could not risk handling two carnivals at the same time, and not unexpectedly  and also with very good reason  decided that the elections were more important than the game of cricket, however popular. It can no longer be denied, however much this truth might annoy the purists among cricket-lovers, that Twenty20 has emerged as the most popular format of the game of cricket. Even within this format, the IPL has produced some radical changes that draw the crowds to the ground.        
	In a radical move, the IPL has taken nationalism out of international cricket. Taking a leaf out of crickets great rival, the game of soccer, the IPL is organized around separate teams that are like clubs based in a city or a state. Every team has an owner or owners and sponsors. These teams then make a bid for various players. Thus it is possible for an Aussie and an Indian to be playing for the same team. This is a remarkable innovation that many feared would not work because cricket, since it was first played at the international level, has been associated with countries. The very first IPL tournament proved the sceptics wrong. One reason for this was the fact that the IPL did not bring only cricket to the spectators, it provided a complete package of entertainment, with the presence of Bollywood stars and cheerleaders. It was not the game that was important, but the spectacle and the spirit of carnival. Excitement and entertainment were packed into a few hours. Cricket became a surrogate for going to the cinema. Purists may scoff at all this, but the IPL has successfully brought back spectator participation to the game of cricket, or at least to one version of it.        
	The success of the IPL inevitably raises questions about the future of cricket, especially that of Test cricket. The popularity of Twenty20 and of teams organized as clubs will mean that money will pour into this sector. Sponsorships, advertisements on television, viewership and so on of Test cricket will go into a declining spiral. It will perhaps be no exaggeration to suggest that this is the beginning of the end of Test cricket. The latter runs the danger of being reduced to the status similar to that enjoyed by village cricket. A few loyal followers scattered around the ground with their picnic baskets, chatting between overs about the time when Gavaskar batted through the entire day. There may be charm in such an ambience, but no future.

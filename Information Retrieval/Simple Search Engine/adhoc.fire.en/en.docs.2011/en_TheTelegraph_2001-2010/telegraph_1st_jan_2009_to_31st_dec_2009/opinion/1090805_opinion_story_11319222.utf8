The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Stuck with English
                                                                                                                 STUCK WITH ENGLISH                                  Stephen Hugh-Jones                              
	You neednt be a retired professor to talk nonsense, but I guess it helps. Witness this recent pronouncement from an emeritus professor of phonetics, no less: Esperanto, he said  an artificial language dreamed up some 125 years ago by an idealist born in then Russian-dominated Poland  is a good idea waiting for its moment. The current hegemony of English cannot last, and the moment will come when the world sees the need for Esperanto.        
	Well indeed. He may be right about English, though theres no sign of that yet. But hes quite certainly on Cloud Nine when it comes to Esperanto. Not that hes alone up there. Amid a quite persuasive, if exaggerated, forecast of Chinas coming rise to economic dominance, an enthusiast recently averred that Mandarin will become a lingua franca just like English is now.        
	I dont doubt that both these gentlemen are better informed than I am, and at least one knows more about language. Yet I dont doubt, I dont even begin to doubt, that their predictions are rubbish. What both have forgotten is human nature.        
	English has become a world language essentially because two dominant economic powers  first Britain, then the United States of America  happened to use it. Why not Mandarin? Because economic influence wasnt the only reason for the spread of English. Ours is a crazy language, full of irregularities and absurd spellings. But with hardly any oddities of gender or case endings, it is also fairly easy to learn and speak, even if you speak it badly. And it lacks two disadvantages that have kept Mandarin, for all the millennia of culture behind it, almost unspoken and unread outside China.        
	Spoken English demands no tonal inflections, as Mandarin does  and as most languages dont. And we write it in a very simple alphabet of letters, not a vast collection of ideograms, as the Chinese, Japanese and Koreans use  and nobody else does. Merely learning these ideograms takes countless hours, and, for most people, the extraordinary absorptive capacity of youth. Few adults could do it, fewer still would choose to, if there is an alternative  as there is.        
	If the Chinese wish to romanize their method of writing, fine. That can be done, and for some purposes is. But do you see a nation as ancient as China, and as sure of its own cultural superiority, cutting itself off from its past? And, even romanized, Mandarin still has to be pronounced using methods unknown to most of the globe.        
	So why not Esperanto? It has no irregularities of spelling or grammar. It is written in the Roman alphabet. And its vocabulary is easy, at least for Europeans, though much less so for others: to learn, for instance, is lerni, and Esperanto itself means hopeful. In sum, it has the disadvantages neither of English nor of Mandarin. It just has one of its own: no region, town or even village speaks it. And few but the most eccentric humans will spend their time acquiring a language that enables them to communicate with, for all practical purposes, nobody.        
	It might be thoroughly desirable for the whole world to decree that its children should learn Esperanto as their second language. But that is no likelier than a sudden worldwide outbreak of non-violence and brotherly love.        
	The world, for many decades ahead, is stuck with English. I take no national pride in that, pace the Telegraph reader who recently reproved me for gloating over the rise of my native tongue. Todays hegemony of English is simply a fact of life, just as its a fact that official New Delhi was devised by an architect called Lutyens, not by those who built the Taj Mahal, much as that reader  or indeed, I myself  might wish otherwise. A pity, maybe, but a fact.

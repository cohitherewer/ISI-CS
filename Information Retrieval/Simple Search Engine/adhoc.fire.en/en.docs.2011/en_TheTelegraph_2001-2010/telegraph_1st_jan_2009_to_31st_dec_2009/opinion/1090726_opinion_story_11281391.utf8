	 Few others can match up to Hillary Clintons grit. The US secretary of states courage seldom fails her, even when she is busy tackling tricky global problems or savouring unfamiliar cuisine. At an official dinner during her recent visit to India, the former first lady saw the Union commerce and industry minister, Anand Sharma, spicing up his meal by adding a generous helping of red chillies. The brave woman could not help asking for a bite and even though Anand egged her on, the prime minister, fearing that Clinton had taken on more than she could chew, asked her to desist. But Clinton allayed Manmohan Singhs fears by saying that she was used to spicy Mexican fare. Then, under the watchful eyes of the PM, Anand and the assembled dignitaries, she picked up a hari mirch and began to eat it. Whats more, she didnt have to reach out for a glass of water or a plateful of sweets even once. Manmohan Singh admitted that Clintons feat was impressive. For once, leaders cutting across partylines will agree with him.                
	 Ever wondered why Lalu Prasad is sporting a pair of shades these days? The former Union minister, we were told, has undergone a cataract operation recently. The other day, outside Parliament, he was heard narrating how difficult it was for him to read official papers and documents before the operation. Hearing this, someone commented that this was nothing but an attempt on Lalu Prasads part to come up with an excuse in case the charges of alleged impropriety committed during his tenure as railways minister came to pass. Such wisecracks may cause poor Lalu Prasad to think that it is a harsh world that he sees each day. All the more reason for the distraught leader to keep his shades on.                            
	 Here is some news on one of Lalu Prasads allies. Ram Vilas Paswan has recovered lost ground after being mauled in the Lok Sabha elections. Paswans Lok Janshakti Party contested seven seats in the polls to local bodies in Bihars legislative council and won three. They included Nalanda (considered to be a Kurmi bastion, and hence a strong support base for Nitish Kumar), Madhepura, the parliamentary constituency of the Janata Dal (United) president, Sharad Yadav, and Hajipur, which had rejected Paswans party months back. While Paswan soared, Lalu Prasad found his wings clipped further with his party winning three of the 17 seats. Despite the losses in Nalanda and Madhepura, the JD(U) got 11 seats while the Congress, hoping to be resurrected in Bihar along with Uttar Pradesh, drew a blank in spite of putting up candidates in 24 seats. Strangely, Iqbal Singh, the AICC man in charge of Bihar was rewarded with a gubernatorial posting to Puducherry soon after. Seeing Paswan and Singh, it seems that the world of politics does not have permanent winners or losers.                            
	 Thanks to Sharad Yadav, the Opposition isnt speaking in many voices any more. Only Yadavs voice booms from its benches as he has taken over the responsibility of being the chief spokesperson of the Opposition. So prolific has Yadav been as a speaker that he has raised six important issues during the current proceedings, including the problems of drought and child marriage. But Yadavs speeches sound far from sweet to Lalu Prasad and Mulayam Singh. Whenever the JD(U) president gets up to make a speech, they grow visibly uncomfortable, and try to attract the Speakers attention to be given a chance to have their say. However, the Bharatiya Janata Party leaders mostly remain silent during Yadavs discourses. The silence should not be mistaken for approval. The buzz is that the BJP top brass does not share Yadavs views on the two issues and prefer to stay mum.                            
	 When the AICC gen-sec, B.K. Hariprasad, reached Madhya Pradesh for a meeting with state leaders, he was surprised to find a lowly party-functionary asking him to hand over his shoes so that they could be protected. By the time the review meeting was over, Hariprasad learnt that the reason behind the extraordinary request was that the MPCC office was a favourite haunt for shoe-lifters. Hariprasads shoes were saved, but Gajender Singh Rajukhedi, the MP from Dhar, was not so lucky. He emerged barefoot from the office to buy himself new shoes. However, before he left, Hariprasad must have been relieved to hear that the BJP state office was apparently notorious for pickpockets who loved to show their skills during high-profile visits.              
	FOOTNOTE    
	 It is time we added one more item to the growing list of endangered species in India. Parliamentary wit  loved by the netas and their subjects alike  is becoming rare with every passing day. One flash of humour, however, brightened the proceedings of the Upper House a few days back. Kamal Nath, the Union minister for road transport and highways, was speaking about the pace of road construction. In the course of his speech, he happened to mention that the years under the Vajpayee regime were a great learning experience in this field. Even before the minister could finish his sentence, the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam leader, V Maitreyan, remarked loudly for everyone to hear that the next five years under Manmohan Singh were a great earning experience, referring to the controversies that took place during TR Baalus stint as the minister for road transport in the first UPA government. Everyone present loved the joke, but will Baalu see the funny side?

	Nepals Maoists cannot wait to return to power. The surest way to do so, they think, is to return to the streets. But the Maoists street-shows in Kathmandu lack the political and moral legitimacy that their electoral success gave them last year. That victory came on the crest of a popular movement against the monarchy in which Nepals democratic parties had joined the Maoists. True, the electoral victory made the former rebels a major political force in the new Himalayan republic. But if they are not part of Nepals government today, the Maoists have only themselves to blame. What they face today has happened to rebels in other countries who have laid down arms and tried to find their feet in democratic politics. Nepals Maoists thus have two basic problems  they find themselves misfits in democratic politics and they would not, therefore, do away completely with their old tactic. That is why they have not disbanded their army or other wings in accordance with the terms of the peace process. Instead, they have stalled the working of the constituent assembly, which is supposed to give Nepal a new constitution and thereafter a fresh election. Worse, the Maoists have threatened to unilaterally announce the formation of autonomous states of a federal Nepal. All this is a sure recipe for a fresh spell of anarchy.         
	The Maoists charge that India is desperate to keep them out of power is an old ploy. The anti-India card is routinely used in Kathmandu in order to settle partisan scores. Yet, not long ago, New Delhi had played a decisive role in brokering peace in Nepal and in persuading the Maoists to join mainstream politics. If the former guerrillas failed in their new role as the major partner in a coalition government, that had much more to do with their own weaknesses than with Indias interventions. In the face of fresh turmoil in Kathmandu, New Delhi should make it absolutely clear to the Maoists that it has a stake in Nepals peace and stability, and that stability in the country depends primarily on the success of multi-party democracy. If the common Nepalis rose against an unpopular monarchy, they did so in the hope of ushering in not a communist dictatorship but a democratic Nepal. The Maoists themselves now threaten to kill that promise by their demonstrations of street power. If they succeed, Nepal will see yet another revolution betrayed.

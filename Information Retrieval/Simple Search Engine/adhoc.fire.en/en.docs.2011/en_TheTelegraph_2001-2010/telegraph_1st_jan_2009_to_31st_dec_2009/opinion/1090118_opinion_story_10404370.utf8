	 The closer LK Advani feels he is to the prime ministers chair, the farther it seems to slip away. Last time, it was the vikas purush (read AB Vajpayee) who snatched the mantle from the lauh purush. This time, Advani may face a tougher time from a combo offer  vikas and lauh rolled into one in Narendra Modi. India Inc. has voiced its desire to see him as prime minister. No matter how much Modi may feign surprise and reaffirm his loyalty to Advani, the words of praise are unlikely to get a hasty burial. Advanis problem, however, is not with Modi being seen as a lambi race ki ghoda. The problem is there are too many such long-distance runners. There is Bhairon Singh Shekhawat as well as Kalyan Singh, who has come out in open support of Shekhawat after the BJPs dalliances with Ajit Singh. The partys decision to back Ashok Pradhan from Bulandshahr interferes with Kalyans plans of fielding his son from there. Small causes, big worries for Advani.                
	 Here is another reason for Renuka Chowdhury to don the battle gear. As Union minister for women and child development, she wants the apex court directive of compulsory registration of marriages to be followed. But the law ministry isnt playing along. It wants Muslims and Christians to be exempted from it. A section of the Congress and many UPA allies also feel it is conventional wisdom to allow the Muslim clergy its own time in these matters. At the last meeting of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, it had decided that marriage registration be kept a voluntary option since it may further complicate marital discords. Renukaji obviously sees the world differently.                       
	 Each to his own. Prakash Karat too. Recently, when CPI(M) leaders were travelling to Kochi, the gen-sec was found occupying a seat in the executive class of the plane. His wife was next to him. But then Brinda Karat is entitled to a first-class ticket by virtue of being a Rajya Sabha member. Incidentally, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee was also on the flight and was travelling in the economy class. In fact, all leaders from Bengal were travelling in the same class, as they always do in keeping with the tradition started by Jyoti Basu.                             
	 The chief election commissioner, N Gopalaswami, is set to retire sometime in April, with general elections round the corner. Given his seniority, Navin Chawla should take his place. But the BJP has filed a petition against Chawla in the apex court and the court has asked Gopalaswami to take action. If Gopalaswami decides to remove Chawla days before his retirement, it would create an embarrassing situation for the president. The president cannot, and will not, act without the advice of the government. But given that the ECs model code of conduct will have come into play by then, the government may be barred from speaking on the issue. Which means, irrespective of Gopalaswamis recommendation, Chawla will have to preside over the elections, and thereby become the CEC. Unless, of course, Gopalaswami decides on Chawlas fate soon enough.                
	 Ghulam Nabi Azad, the famed kingmaker in J amp;K, is bound to be brought back to Delhi in the next party reshuffle. Azad, in preparation for that eventuality, is planning to contest the Lok Sabha elections from Badarwah. If he wins, it will be his first parliamentary win from his home state. That will also wipe away the previous ignominy of having lost to one Ghulam Nabi Badarwahi, and having had his deposit forfeited in 1977. Azad has never contested from J amp;K since then. But what better time than now, when a win can assure him a secure place in the second tier of the party hierarchy?                
	 P Chidambarams induction into the home ministry, besides jeopardizing the finance ministry, has led to a few other problems. The Union agriculture minister, Sharad Pawar, is reportedly dragging his feet on convening a meeting of the crisis management group because he is unsure of the protocol that is to be followed as also of the hierarchy.       
	Earlier, the committee was headed by Pawar and it had the Union finance minister as one of its three members. But now that the finance ministry is handled by the prime minister himself, Pawar is in two minds on whether to attend the meeting as a member or wait for the prime minister to depute Chidambaram to represent both home and finance, as was the case during the winter session of the Parliament.    
	FOOTNOTE    
	 Both the State-owned media  the All India Radio and Doordarshan  feel like orphans when they are left without political bosses to cater to. Perhaps that is why they have this instinctive urge to turn all utterances of their bosses into prime-time news. So long as Priya Ranjan Das Munshi was at the helm of affairs, even a Durga Puja function or a football match in his Lok Sabha constituency was deemed fit for live coverage. Once Das Munshi fell ill, AIR and Doordarshan shifted the focus of their affection to the new man in charge.       
	The man hogging all the limelight now is the minister of state for external affairs, Anand Sharma, who has been given temporary charge of the information amp; broadcasting ministry. Expectedly, Doordarshan and AIR waste no opportunity in reporting his appearances. The other day, when Sharma was in his home state, Himachal Pradesh, he found time to drop in to the local AIR-DD station. Sure enough, his visit made it to the national news.

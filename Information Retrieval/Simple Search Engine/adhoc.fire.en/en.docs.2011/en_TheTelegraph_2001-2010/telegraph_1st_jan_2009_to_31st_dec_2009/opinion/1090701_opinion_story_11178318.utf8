                                                                                                                 TOUGH LESSON                                                    
	It may be too early to hail the Lalgarh operations as even a partial success. The incompetence of the administration in West Bengal, which created the crisis in the first place, may yet complicate it. Large areas around Lalgarh are still not free from the Maoist threat. Whatever breakthroughs have been made so far are due primarily to the decisive role played by the Central forces. But it is one thing to set up a few camps for the forces in some of the erstwhile liberated zones and quite another to restore the rule of law there. Restoring the authority of the State involves not just force, but an administration that works. Although the Maoists added a different dimension to it, the Lalgarh imbroglio typifies the collapse of the administration in West Bengal. Such is the incompetence of the states officialdom that it crumbles in the face of practically any challenge. This incompetence, as is well known, is the result of the ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist) reducing the administration to a tool for serving partisan interests. In Lalgarh, the administration receded at the first sign of a challenge. The state government now has to deliver in areas that have been reclaimed by the forces.        
	Distributing rice free to poor villagers or sending senior officials to Lalgarh on fact-finding missions may be necessary in the given context. Such steps will hopefully go some way in restoring the peoples faith in the administration. More important, however, is to send out the message that the State will no longer brook the challenge of lawlessness, either from the Maoists or from any other group. There seems to be much confusion within the CPI(M) and the government on using the Central ban on the Communist Party of India (Maoist). No anti-insurrection strategy can work if the government is indecisive about it. For the chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, the lesson from Lalgarh should be simple and clear  a government has to act and face the consequences of its action. Inaction is neither an option nor a strategy. Unfortunately, that has been the state governments record in Lalgarh for nearly nine months. The people of Lalgarh have their grievances and many of these are genuine. But if they had been lured into taking to undemocratic and violent ways, part of the reason is the administrations failure to respond and act. A government that fails to act has no business to stay in office.

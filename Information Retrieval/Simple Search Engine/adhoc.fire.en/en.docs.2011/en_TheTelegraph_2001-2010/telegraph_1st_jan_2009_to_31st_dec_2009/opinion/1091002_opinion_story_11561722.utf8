	SAMS STORY By Elmo Jayawardena, Penguin, Rs 299        
	Elmo Jayawardenas Sams Story is a tale told by an idiot. It is also an object lesson in the art, and artifices, of telling the truth. Sam is something of a village idiot. He lives with his mother and siblings in a village in Sri Lanka. They are poor. He leaves the village and goes to the city for work. He works for two families. First for the white Madam Martell, then for a Sri Lankan pilot, who dies in a blast towards the end of the novel. His wife and children  the children study abroad and visit their parents on vacations  leave home. Sam returns to his village. In between he has lost his boyhood friend, drowned in a river in spate, and both his brothers  one went to fight for his people, died, and was given a heros funeral. The other reneged, came slinking like a thief one night to the hovel, angry, and then went away, beyond the horizon of reported events. In time his mother and two sisters too become, like the Master and the Madam, and their two children, the Boy and the Girl, no more, nor less, than living memories as Sam surveys his life sitting on his mango tree.        
	There are different meanings to life, the epigraph to the novel tells its readers. This innocent-looking pre-text gives the reader pause to reflect whether to construe the statement as a platitude or a profundity  a fair warning about how the text plays its games with, and in, language. The novel, written in the first person, is at one level an exploration of the relationship of an individual with language. Such criticism of modern life as it offers is spoken in a language whose distinctive force of utterance lies in its essential difference from the cant of the customary and the commonsensical. It is the language of an individual whose relative ignorance of the normal, habitual, ways of being in the world frees him from the tunnel vision of false consciousness. He can look upon the world with the new-found wonder of a stranger or of an infant. Jayawardena deploys the familiar literary device of allowing the fool to look, and speak, awry upon the absurdity, and cruelty, of everyday life.         
	But the fool not only speaks about the world, he is also in that world, and speaks to somebody who is, presumably, no fool. The fools language is not that of a madman: it must turn the familiar inside out so as to throw its hitherto unsuspected follies into high relief, but it cannot afford to speak in a language that is so strange, and self-absorbed, as to be incoherent and incomprehensible.        
	For the novelist, this is very largely a technical, rather than metaphysical, problem, and how he solves it will determine his success or failure as storyteller. The novelist must decide at the outset what he wants his protagonist to do: does he act as mouthpiece to a moral fable? Or should he be a fully individuated character who projects his consciousness upon the world, and is in turn nursed, or knocked about, by it? The slightest indecision or inconsistency in the telling can mar a tale that is otherwise well told.         
	Sam, we might as well assume, speaks his own story. He has not written it, though. He tells us expressly that he cannot read or write. Perhaps this explains, somewhat, why the book is called Sams Story, and not My Story. It is another matter that Sam, who finds the world and its people, including himself, tarred in shades of stupidity, and doesnt like to be called names, in order to tell his story must have been willy-nilly able to name and identify himself as Sam. This assumes some importance within the narratological scheme of things given that Sams name is not really Sam, it being a shorthand of a longish original, and further, the giver of the patronymic, of conventionally acknowledged identity, the pater familias, is conspicuous by his absence from the action.         
	Teasingly, the author scrupulously records his heartfelt gratitude to Sam himself, thereby inviting the reader to interrogate the storyness of the story. I came to work at the River House not very long ago. It was a few years before the world became 2000. Two thousand is a nice-sounding number, thats why I remember it, like twenty-five. I also know the exact month when it all began. It was the mango month. That is what everybody in our village called it  mango month. The opening paragraph conceals as much as it reveals: it tells us where Sam went, from where, and for what, but not where he is now. Only at the end do we learn that Sam is sitting on his mango tree, remembering. And the reader is directly put in mind of an intractably imaginative sensibility with an impossibly personal, childlike, relationship with words and things. This is a language almost wholly free of ideologically encrusted opinion. But it has its share of prejudice to shed: the novel, while pointing to the wisdom to be gained from trying to unlearn middle-class values, makes sure that its hero, who feels his difference keenly, learns the lesson of irreducible sameness  between us and them.         
	The collocation of river and house telescopes under the overarching problem of sameness and difference the working principles of the text; the thematic question is, what does it mean to be at home? And the formal question: how to speak in idiolect without being solipsistic. Both are happily dealt with by representing the ebbs and eddies of Sams consciousness as it radiates and recedes in ripples of meaning that steer toward the other side of quotidian reason.         
	Well may Sam aver that he hates questions: the achievement of the textual-phenomenological world he inhabits lies in the many questions it raises, but the promise of the beginning proves difficult to sustain till the end as the language slips from the suggestive to the sententious. As the story nears its climax, Jayawardena becomes increasingly pontificatory and pedestrian. The best moments in the novel are those where the gently ironic naivety of Sam escapes the banality of pious sentiment. It is then that the proverbial idiot boy speaks with the sagacity of an idiot savant.                          ANIK SAMANTA

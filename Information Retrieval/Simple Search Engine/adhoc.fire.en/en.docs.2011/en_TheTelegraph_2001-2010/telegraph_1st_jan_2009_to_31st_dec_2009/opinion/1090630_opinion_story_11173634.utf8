  - How to sustain a high growth rate in the long run					 
										      MIND THE GAP                                                
	History repeats itself, at times a little more cruelly. In June 1998, Ashok Leyland had shut down its factory for the first time in 50 years to avoid overproduction. Twenty years later, in late 2008, both AL and Tata Motors stopped production twice for the same reason. In January 2009, Ravi Kant, the managing director of TM, said, What we saw was something that happened so suddenly and on such a great magnitude that it took everyone by surprise. But was it so sudden? TM blamed the lack of liquidity and high interest rate, and the government blamed the global meltdown for everything.        
	By late 2007, there were clear indications of a deep slump in the G-7 countries. India received its first signal in early January 2008, when foreign institutional investors began pulling their money out from the stock markets, and the Sensex crashed. Signs of a distinct fall in manufacturing had appeared as early as April 2008, when the monthly index of industrial production dropped sharply.         
	But neither the companies nor the government did ever mention the real factors  the high growth and the huge capacity build up in industries between 2002-03 and mid-2008. This happened due to the ambience of high expectations generated by a credit- driven growth and strengthened by a boom in the stock markets fuelled by FII hot money. A significant part of this growth was dubious, since the demand was not rooted in economic realities.         
	Second, there has been a continuous pauperization, particularly of the rural and urban lower middle class, thanks to high-food inflation, slow employment growth and scandalous neglect of agriculture. Food inflation has also hit the middle class. These are the classes that provide the stable and bulk demand for commercial vehicles.        
	The industrial growth rate began to rise sharply from 2.7 per cent in 2001-02 and touched its peak at 11.6 per cent in 2006-07. Thereafter, it fell to 8.46 per cent in 2007-08 and to 2.4 per cent in 2008-09. Since CVs carry mostly industrial goods and some passengers, their sales followed a similar pattern. Total CV sales rose from 192,282 in 2001-02 to 260,114 in 2003-04, then zoomed to 490,494 in 2007-08. This meant an addition of 2,225,315 vehicles to the national fleet over seven years. Even after allowing for normal scrapping of old CVs, this vast net addition has made this fleet far too large for the industry to keep it utilized profitably year after year. So a fall in CV sales in 2008-09 was not unexpected.         
	The important question is how effective the stimulus packages will be. These have worked, as shown by the rise in steel and cement sales. But part of it is delayed replacement sales rather than new sales. The future still looks grim, considering that the present government has inherited empty coffers, thanks to its huge borrowing in 2008-09. So there is not much left for taking up developmental work without huge divestment of the best public sector units and large-scale deficit financing. The latter will prevent the rate of interest to fall much.        
	Second, the amount allocated for direct public spending, needed badly for generating employment, comes to only 0.5 per cent of the gross domestic product, which is quite inadequate for a crisis of such magnitude. Further, lowering the excise duty by 6 per cent has reduced prices, not increased sales, for nobody would buy a CV unless he foresees a rise in demand.         
	The issue really boils down to that of sustaining a relatively high industrial growth rate over a fairly long period. Correcting the extreme inequality in the asset-income distribution of our polity is the only way to sustain a long-term high growth rate . Otherwise, the downturn may snowball into a crash. The stimulus packages lack this direction.

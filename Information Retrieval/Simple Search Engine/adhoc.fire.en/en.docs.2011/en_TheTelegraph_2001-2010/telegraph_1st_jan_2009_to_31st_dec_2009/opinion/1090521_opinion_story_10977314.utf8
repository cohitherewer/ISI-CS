The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Letters to Editor
                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Triumph of the people    
	Sir  The victory of the United Progressive Alliance led by the Congress as the single largest party is a triumph of the policies of the last government. The firmness of the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, in signing the nuclear treaty against all opposition, as well as his policies strengthened by his economic experience are the factors that have led the people to repose their faith in the Congress. The fact that the entire Western economy fell prey to the global recession while India survived with minimum damage may be another factor. The people have made an intelligent choice in the worlds largest democratic exercise.    
	Yours faithfully,       
R. Sekar, Visakhapatnam

    
	Sir  We must thank the Election Commission for ensuring a free and fair election. By defeating communal forces and limiting the bargaining power of the Left and some other regional parties, the people of India have shown again that political parties cannot take them for granted. This time they have voted for development.   
	Yours faithfully,        Bijay Kumar Singh, Hyderabad    
	Sir  The Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance concedes defeat at the hands of the UPA. People not only rejected the BJPs iron man L.K. Advani, but also his continuous propaganda that Manmohan Singh is the weakest prime minister of India. Now that Singh is shouldering the burden again, one hopes that he will look into the issues of price-hike, recession, and unemployment, and also address the Naxalite problem, the Maratha-North Indians tussle, and farmers suicides. To tackle the problem of terrorism, speedy trials and a strong legal system are required. People have given a fresh mandate to the UPA on its performance over the last five years, and hope that it will do even better than its previous term.  
	Yours faithfully,      
B.K.Chatterjee, Faridabad
        Sir  The great Indian democracy has delivered its verdict, a stunning one, yet again. In 2004, the Indian electorate had amazed all the experts and critics by its ability to see through glitzy campaigns like India Shining and Bharat Uday. Five years later, the electorate has proved that its earlier decision was no fluke, by delivering another unexpected verdict.           
	Yours faithfully,         Vasan Nair, Kerala
    
	Leaders in question    
	Sir  It is not possible to agree with the view that only a member of the Lower House should be eligible for the prime ministers office (Face the People, May 13). The framers of the Constitution of India did not deem that principle necessary, which is why today we have a prime minister of Manmohan Singhs calibre. Although he is over 70, he is a symbol of leadership for the young. One may argue that he has not won a popular election; in fact, he lost the only time he attempted one, but then good leadership is not always born out of electoral victory. Moreover, the current prime minister is an elected member of the council of states, which makes him a member of the parliament too. One must remember that in 2004, a significant chunk of public sentiment was against the popularly elected leader, Sonia Gandhi, which led to Singhs appointment in the first place.           
	The observations on the prevailing autocracy in the Communist Party of India (Marxist)s leadership are more to the point, because communism has always steered clear of democracy. That Prakash Karat ousted a senior member of the party like Somnath Chatterjee emphasizes the formers autocratic attitude. Chatterjee should realize his folly in having associated himself with a party that could not respect his contribution to it. People like Chatterjee, as well as Singh, will remain leaders, irrespective of their membership of any particular political party or house of the parliament.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Sourav Sengupta, Calcutta

  Sir  The editorial, Face the people, rightly says that mass leaders should contest the elections and get a mandate before taking the highest chair within their parties. The Constitution of India advocates democracy, and the political parties, as institutions functioning under this democracy, should nourish it within themselves. In fact, most of the party leaders in India have been elected by the people to either the assembly or the parliament. The CPI(M) and the Shiv Sena are the only exceptions. Bal Thackeray and Prakash Karat are at the helm of their parties without the peoples mandate, and the elected party members are obliged to abide by their dictates. The CPI(M) should think over this issue and democratize its party structure.            
	Yours faithfully,        Subrata Pal, Nadia
      
	Parting shot    
	Sir  The event of the general elections in the worlds largest democracy makes me proud as an Indian citizen. However, the impact it leaves on the common man is something that turns my pride into utter shame the very next day. The reports in The Telegraph about the sorry state of the schools or any other institution that had been a part of the polls are alarming.           
	Even if promises are made to clear the sites, why is it that every time the failure to keep those promises has to be reported in the media, and someone has to explicitly take over this responsibility? Why can it not be done as a normal exercise, as a part of the whole election process?           
	Every single piece of property utilized for the polls needs to be taken care of while in use and the consequent mess routinely cleared up. Should this not be done with as much discipline as is exercised in the polls themselves?          
	Yours faithfully,        Sthiti Raha, Calcutta

	From Barracuda to Embarracuda is a bizarre journey. Yet, in spite of the change of fortune implied by this change in nicknames, it is difficult to believe that one has seen the last of Sarah Palin. Her going was as baffling as her coming. The former American vice-presidential candidate has resigned as governor of Alaska 18 months before the end of her term. But in her farewell speech at an annual picnic, she vowed to protect Alaskas interests as the grizzly guards her cubs. Similes apart, between the eldest and the youngest of Ms Palins five cubs, the whole range of her politics has been on incessant display. The eldest, Track, joined the army and is now in Iraq. The youngest, Trig, was pre-natally diagnosed with Down syndrome, and Ms Palin has movingly described how, before his birth, she had had a moment of doubt about bringing him into the world  then better sense prevailed. Between Track and Trig, came Tripp, Ms Palins grandchild, born to a daughter whose extreme youth caused public outrage and ill-timed embarrassment. Teen abstinence was thus added to the gubernatorial aversion to abortion, same-sex marriage and Big-Oil corruption. The right-wing, Christian, Republican profile, for which John McCain had chosen her, was perfected.        
	So when this spectacular rise  from small-town beauty queen to mayor to first female (and youngest) Alaskan governor to first female vice-presidential nominee of the Republican Party  ends with quitting office and a sharp drop in popularity, is it time to ask what went wrong? Or is anything wrong at all, and might Ms Palin be expected back, purged and purified, on a higher calling in 2012? With legal bills for fighting ethics probes running up to $500,000, and her way of raising these funds being questioned as well, Ms Palins ethical credentials have taken some serious battering. Winking her way through public debates, and having nothing to show by way of a foreign policy or climate-and-energy plan  Ms Palins hallmark combination of astonishing ignorance and equally astonishing self-regard  could not have been of much help either. But ethical and political substance is not the only criterion by which the world judges a figure like Ms Palin. In Barbara Walters list of Ten Most Fascinating People of 2008, Ms Palin came third  just two places below Barack Obama and two places above Thomas Beatie, the pregnant man.

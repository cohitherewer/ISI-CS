	Streetcar not desired                  
	 Sir  In the article, City in a state of ruin (June 26 ), Malvika Singh focuses mainly on the shortcomings of the municipality in Delhi. But Calcutta too would do well to note the points she makes. When I was in Calcutta this April, I saw piled-up garbage vats all over the city. I also saw a new tramcar, something like the panorama coach of Eurail, although I am not sure if such trams are suitable for the Calcutta weather. I look forward to a clean and beautiful Calcutta that would make us proud.          
	Yours faithfully,        A. Choudhury, Georgia, US
                  
	Main message          
	Sir  The Central forces and the state police have jointly launched a major offensive in the Lalgarh forest blocks. They are hardly drawing a line between the violence-led Maoists and the peace-loving masses. Recently, a few writers, artistes and journalists from this city went to Lalgarh to understand the situation on their own. They did this with public knowledge and, seeing what they could, made an instant appeal to all concerned to lay down arms and resolve the problems by negotiation.           
	Now the police have filed a criminal case against them at the Belpahari police station of West Midnapore for the violation of Section 144. This smacks of state vengeance. Those citizen friends of ours had not gone to Lalgarh in secret against police surveillance. The state authorities had full knowledge of where and to which extent they had gone. Why has this case then to be filed after two days of their return?           
	Perhaps in the context of the larger issue of neglect in the development of tribal areas, this is not a big question. Yet the trend showing state high-handedness cannot be overlooked. Maoist violence must certainly be curbed. But the state oppression of helpless masses in the name of curbing Maoist violence, and the Maoist oppression of the same peaceful masses in the name of their crusade against the state  are both condemnable. And this surely was the main message of those citizens who had gone to Lalgarh. We appeal that the states repressive measures against them and all alike be immediately withdrawn.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Sukumari Bhattacharji, Asok Sen, Sankha Ghosh, Alokeranjan Dasgupta, Nabaneeta Dev Sen, Samik Banerjee, Sourin Bhattacharya, Amiya Dev, Swapan Majumdar, Samar Bagchi, Partha Ghose, Abhra Ghosh, Sutapa Bhattacharya, Amiya Dhar, Ajay Chattopadhyay, Pranab Biswas and Rusati Sen, Calcutta

                          
	Crime control          
	Sir  The Union home minister, P. Chidambaram, must integrate the home departments of all states with the Centre so that there is uniformity in the laws throughout the nation. This is a must, given the fact that criminals cross state borders quite easily and frequently.           
	Moreover, arresting people is becoming increasingly difficult owing to the interference by state governments and local politicians. Also, the communication between the state police and the Central crime control agencies is weak, of which the criminals take advantage. Reforms in this direction will yield excellent results and the tracking, tracing and tackling of criminals will become very easy if the crime control network is made more effective, efficient and hassle-free.           
	Currently external affairs, railways and defence are under exclusive Central control. Henceforth, law and order too must be added to this list. Ideas are the need of the hour, not ideologies.           
	Yours faithfully,

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | soundly uncivil
                                                                                                                 SOUNDLY UNCIVIL                                                    
	Festivals in Calcutta seem to foster sheer indifference rather than a heartwarming inclusiveness that is supposed to bring sweetness and light to the lives of the people. The frenzied celebration of Kali Puja and Diwali over the weekend makes it evident that festivals, for scores of Calcuttans, are purely selfish pursuits, to be observed according to personal norms, without any consideration for the law or for other human beings. There is a 90-decibel cap on bursting noisy firecrackers, and then there is the police, as helpless and clueless as ever. In between the law and its keepers are the outlaws, also known as the revellers, whose idea of fun leaves the rest of the city, including the chief minister of the state, seething with fury. It does not matter if newborn babies and grievously ill children at the neo-natal ward of a hospital are startled by thunderous explosions, elderly people are kept awake all night, or ordinary citizens, who prefer to enjoy their festivals in peace, are distressed to no end: the show must go on.        
	Could the police have done things any differently to ensure a more amiable closure to the festive season? Probably. Instead of procrastinating for weeks, the police should have organized public awareness campaigns early enough to spread the word about the ban and the consequences of flouting it. Whatever little the police or state ministers did to urge people to behave themselves was done in Bengali, a language that eludes many inhabitants of a cosmopolitan city like Calcutta. Moreover, it is an open, if guilty, secret with the police that loud firecrackers are smuggled into West Bengal from states that do not have an embargo on sound pollution. This illegal traffic begins months before Kali Puja or Diwali. By the time the police decide to act, the black markets are teeming with forbidden firecrackers and the nexus between the nefarious traders and their equally reprehensible clientele has deepened irredeemably. It is easy to point fingers at the police every time civil society is at its uncivil best, but difficult, if not inconceivable, to face facts for what they are worth. The law and its custodians would continue to be puppets in the hands of wayward citizens unless the latter stop behaving like truant schoolchildren. The issue at stake here does not pertain to a silly game of hide-and-seek with the police, but concerns the well-being of the entire city.

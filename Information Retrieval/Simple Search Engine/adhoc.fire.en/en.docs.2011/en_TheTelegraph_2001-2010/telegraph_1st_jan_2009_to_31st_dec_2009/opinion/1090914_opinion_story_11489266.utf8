	It is enormously reassuring when the police show better sense than ordinary mortals. The proposed programme for gender sensitization sessions within the police force seems to be based on an understanding of the inadequate social training that is the source of much of the discomfiture that women experience in their workplaces. Because of the inequality of attitude towards girls and boys as they grow up, men may not always be aware of the distress they are causing their women colleagues, or may think it is macho to do so. The programme promises to address this, with women personnel sharing the issues they have with their male colleagues. If instituted with seriousness, such a healthy approach should reap long-term benefits. The first of these would be a work environment free of gender bias or, at least, alert to it.        
	Gender sensitization may be the first step towards an acknowledgment of the subtle and devastating ways in which sexual harassment works; it can also complement training on the legal and managerial aspects of sexual harassment. Sexual harassment springs from the abuse of power, but gender bias, too, hinges on the social power with which men are invested. The line between the two is hardly discernible: one may shade into the other. A workplace that aspires to be free of gender bias is also that much quicker to home in on instances of sexual harassment. Besides, the fact that the police are thinking of gender sensitization is reassuring for the people. Police do not always treat complaints of sexual crimes fairly. But with the suggested training, this, too, may change. Politicization of the police plays a large part in their lack of cooperation. But an increased sensitiveness to gender and sexual issues may help neutralize this to some extent. All this is said in hope: the reality remains to be seen.

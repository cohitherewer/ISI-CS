	It is like throwing tantrums for the golden egg after having killed the goose. The simile may seem in rather bad taste when talking about young Haryanvi men demanding brides of their politicians when they come asking for votes for the October 13 assembly elections. Haryana has managed to reduce the number of women to 861 against a thousand men mainly by unchecked female foeticide. A generation has grown up to find no anxious brides fathers queueing up with competing dowries, but a matrimonial wasteland in which unemployment has added to the lack of brides to turn marriage into an elusive dream. The situation has its roots not in mere bad taste, then, but in a crime, in brainless sex preference and a drive for gender domination. But it is too much to expect that this society has learnt a lesson. That the people of Haryana are asking politicians to get their young men brides in exchange for votes shows their inability to think of women as anything other than reproductive and slaving machines to be bought in one way or another.        
	Brides do not grow on trees, although those who kill female foetuses may not be educated enough to know that. The politicians are evidently expected to produce trainloads of bashful maidens, possibly from other states, to fill up the vacuum that Haryana has created by killing female foetuses. Now that the states attitude to women is so clear, new brides may not feel particularly welcome, and may be terrified of producing any children at all, in case they turned out to be female. The only good thing about the demand for brides is that it is aboveboard. Girls from poor families in other states are regularly being sold off and transported to states where the sex ratio is poorest. The crime of female foeticide has given the crime of trafficking a real boost. Promising politicians votes in exchange for brides is perhaps the funnier side of the cruel darkness at the heart of Indian society. Only the humour is bitter and black.

	Making excuses is an art. There comes a point when one begins to believe passionately in the fictions one has created to ones advantage. So, the various reasons given by employees at the Writers Buildings for regularly coming to work late or leaving work early sound like deeply held convictions. It becomes difficult to see them as what they are  lame, wretched excuses for being unwilling to work. Arriving late or leaving early on the very day of freshly enforced punctuality regulations, most employees spoke to journalists with an admirable clarity of motive and purpose. For some, the reasons are existential: claustrophobia in the Metro, having to buy fish, traffic jams. For others, political: a sense of justice in defying employers who are sitting on arrears, promotions and benefits, or who themselves come late in spite of their office cars. And some happen to be naturally nonchalant, full of the bravado of defiance. They are free spirits resisting the mechanization of their lives, like the hero of Modern Times. This spirit of freedom remains unvanquished in history. Once a decade or so, there is a punctuality drive, but it always comes to nothing: time loses, traditions wins. This is the great tradition of radicalism and intransigence, of the human spirit holding out against the brute and levelling power of professionalism. It has given to the culture and politics of eastern India a unique and cherished character. Some call it Bengaliness.        
	Faced with this gloriously entrenched and enduring quality, Bengals talking heads seem to be in a stupor of helplessness. The finance minister, supposed to be in charge of the new enforcements, hides behind the present continuous and future tenses. He is focusing on the gaps in the system; they are thinking about preparing directives. Only time, according to him, can sort out this problem of time. The thing to do is to watch for a week, to mull and see how it all goes. In the upper strata of the Writers Buildings, this is called monitoring attendance. But who will monitor the monitors? the babus below promptly ask. The timelessness of this languor has greatly enriched Bengali fiction, cinema, photography, and the dying art of adda (for which Unesco must urgently do something). Yet, it has had a devastating effect on the politics and economics of the state. But ruins and devastation are nobler than politics and economics. And the ship sails on.

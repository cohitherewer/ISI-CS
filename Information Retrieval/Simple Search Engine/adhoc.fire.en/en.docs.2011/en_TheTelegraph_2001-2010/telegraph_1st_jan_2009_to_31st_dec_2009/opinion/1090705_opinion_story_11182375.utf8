                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Talk, but with care                  
	 Sir  A recent advertisement by a certain cell phone company promotes the slogan: Walk when you talk. Not so very long back, a make-up artist was walking on railway tracks close to Calcutta while talking on his cell phone. He could not even hear the sound of the train approaching behind him. He was hit by the train and died on the spot. Such accidents are bound to happen because people lose concentration when talking on the phone. Hence, it is best not to advocate this practice .                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  It would be absolutely immoral on the part of the Indian government to bail out Air India with public funds. Air India itself is to blame for the situation it is facing at present (Govt sets terms for AI bailout, June 25). According to a recent BBC report, Air India pays huge salaries to its employees. Pilots in the international sector are paid up to $15,000 every month. Air India engineers with 15 years of experience earn more than Rs 200,000 per month. Air India has 210 employees per aircraft, which is nearly double the global norm. Air India employees, who are union representatives for the cabin crew and the ground staff, are officially exempt from doing work. The public has every right to ask the government why it is planning to use its money to bail out these highly pampered babus. If the government wants to help Air India at all, it should sell its stake in the company and use the proceeds to bail it out.                    
	Yours faithfully,        Abhijit Guha,Toronto, Canada              
	Sir  That Air India is now unable to pay its employees their salaries is utterly disgraceful. The rot had started at the beginning of the 1990s, and nothing concrete has been done till date to stem it. It had all begun when V.P. Singh, the former prime minister, grounded all A-320 airbuses after an air crash, even though these aircraft continue to be the backbone of the airlines even today.           
	Then Rajan Jetley, the former managing director of Air India, decided to repaint all aircraft with a new logo. But this project was abandoned midstream, wasting crores. The most imprudent scheme after that was the productivity linked incentive scheme, in which employees were to be paid hefty incentives for ensuring that planes took off and landed on time. Why, then, were the employees being paid salaries in the first place?          
	The final nail in the coffin was hammered in recently when Praful Patel, the minister of state for civil aviation, decided to rename Indian Airlines Indian just before the merger of Air India and Indian Airlines. The scheme had to be abandoned midway because the merger resulted in a loss of billions. Thanks to these grand schemes, the national air carrier is now truly grounded.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  It seems that Bengalis are getting worried about the high prices of vegetables. Potatoes cost around Rs 16 a kilogram, while spinach is Rs 20. Perhaps vegetable prices in the United States of America could provide some consolation, although it is true that the average income of US citizens is substantially higher than that in India. Even so, a cauliflower would cost around Rs 130 in the US, potatoes Rs 65 a kg, and tomatoes Rs 100 a kg.          
	If the higher prices in India help improve the farmers and vendors standard of living, it will not be a bad thing. Most middle-class salaries are not decided by the free market. But the poor farmer and vegetable vendor are not protected from the open market like their customers.                    
	Yours faithfully,

                                                                                                                 DESTINYS CHILD                                  M.S. Ananth                              
	The story of a mentally challenged person being raped can leave you shaken; but the story of how she managed to keep her ensuing pregnancy leaves you stirred. The merits of the decision of the Supreme Court to stay the order of the Punjab and Haryana High Court, as well as the merits of the decision taken by the latter, would be debated for a long time.         
	The appellant before the SC was under the care of a government organization, which tended to abandoned and mentally ill people. The fact of her rape was detected only after she had complained of nausea and related problems. After ascertaining the details, the Chandigarh administration petitioned the HC, seeking permission to terminate the pregnancy.         
	The administration was armed with a medical boards recommendation that the pregnancy be terminated in view of the mental health of the lady. It also relied on the progressive law, The Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971, which provides for the termination of pregnancy, where there is grave injury to the pregnant woman, anguish due to rape being statutorily recognized as grave injury. The act further provides that the pregnancy may be terminated within 20 weeks, unless the life of the woman is in danger, in which case, the time limit would not apply. The issue was who would give consent, as under the act, consent for a mentally ill person could only be given by a guardian.        
	The HC was acutely aware of the paucity of time, but in view of the gravity of the case, tread cautiously and constituted an independent committee to look into 14 specific questions relating to the mental faculties of the pregnant woman. The findings were against her, although the committee reported that the lady had expressed interest in the child.                 
	Not at fault        
	The counsel for the lady sought to differentiate between mentally ill and mentally retarded persons under law. Strong reliance was placed on The National Trust for Welfare of Persons with Autism, Cerebral Palsy, Mental Retardation and Multiple Disabilities Act, 1999, and on medical literature. The HC, in a balanced judgment, guided by the act, deferred to expert opinion and rejected the expression of interest in the child by the lady.         
	In its anxiety to avail itself of the beneficial provisions of the act, the government unfortunately passed on the baton of executioner to the HC. The HC displayed exemplary courage in allowing the petition. This judgment deserves praise for its pragmatic approach, empathy towards the lady and also for its fine sense of appreciation of the law. The HC did stretch the limit when it ruled that it had inherent or plenary jurisdiction to pass an order directing that the pregnancy be terminated. It may seem deplorable that the HC of a state passed such an order; however, in the circumstances, and in view of the law enabling such an option, the HC boldly did what the government ought to have done. If one were to find fault with the judgment, it would be on grounds that are debatable and vexing to the most competent legal minds.        
	When the case reached the SC, 19 weeks had passed. The SC had to decide the viability of the right of the lady to keep the pregnancy. Surprisingly, though the administration had relied on medical literature and legal submissions, its arguments before the SC were based more on practical difficulties than anything else. The point was made that the issue was flirting with the line between law and morality. The SC was aware of the findings of the committees and the mental condition of the lady. The court was guided by that ambivalent expression of interest evinced by her, and perhaps by the moving dissent of Justice H.R. Khanna in the habeas corpus case  that her appeal was to the court of last resort and to the spirit of the law and humanity. It was also aware of the advanced stage of pregnancy. Two constitutional courts came to two opposing conclusions, yet neither could be faulted.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        FLYING INTO HOPE                          - The Indian military needs the healing touch of the president					 					      Brijesh D. Jayal                                                      
	By the time this article is published, the president of India and supreme commander of the armed forces will have bestowed a singular honour on the armed forces by having flown in a Sukhoi combat aircraft. To anyone other than jet fighter pilots just the preparation for such a flight is forbidding, quite apart from the flight itself. The flying gear, the anti-gravitation suit, the survival kit, the heavy crash helmet and the stifling oxygen mask are but some of the tedious add-ons. To then get strapped into an ejector seat and be firmly locked into a cramped cockpit with little freedom to move leaves the uninitiated flustered. That the president did all this must surely display a determination on her part, not just to be known as the supreme commander of the armed forces of India, but to be seen as one. To mingle at the operational end of her command and expose herself to the accompanying risks will, therefore, be perceived by every soldier, sailor, airman and veteran as a great symbol of hope for the future of the institution of the armed forces of India. A future that in recent times has looked progressively fragile.        
	Ceremonially, the president is adequately exposed to the armed forces of which she is the supreme commander. She must regularly see the Presidents Bodyguard at Rashtrapati Bhavan, an elite unit of the Indian army tasked with her security and ceremonial duties. Her military secretariat consists of a three-star rank military secretary, carefully chosen, as also three aides de camp from each of the three wings of the armed forces. Also, the three chiefs and a select few seniormost commanders from each service are honoured to be designated as honorary ADCs to the president. This entitles them to add the suffix, ADC, proudly to their decorations.              
	At one level, the immaculate turn-out, the glittering medals and crisp demeanour of the military that she sees around her must assure her that she commands the best that the nation has to offer. At another, she will have seen, perhaps for the first time, the operational end of a force and been suitably impressed that the nation remains secure in such hands. When she chooses to sail a ship of the Indian navy or visit our army colleagues defending some of the cruellest terrains in the country, her confidence will be only further enhanced.        
	Upon return to the heady air of the Rashtrapati Bhavan and buoyed by the experience of her day in the field, she may be tempted to call in her military secretary and wonder at the deeper significance of medals adorning his chest. She will be pleasantly surprised to learn that these pieces of metal and ribbon that look merely decorative represent a deep emotional attachment in the wearer. Each signifies service rendered through sweat and blood. Those for distinguished service and gallantry are conferred by the president herself and each has a story to tell. Stories that are passed on and etched in institutional memory of operational units such that they inspire successive generations of men and women to draw sustenance from them and not be found wanting were the moment of reckoning ever to come.        
	The military secretary may be emboldened to delve deeper and explain that the design of each medal has significance, as have the colours of the accompanying ribbons. Red, the colour of blood and fire, stands for courage and bravery. Saffron for self-effacement and dedicated service. White for faith, glory and purity. Blue for devotion to duty and sacrifice, and so on. Above all, each medal has etched on its rim the rank, name and number of the individual on whom it is conferred. A medal, therefore, to a soldier is far more than the service and sacrifice that he or she has rendered through thick and thin; it is a personal recognition of this sacrifice by the nation. This makes it an invaluable part of a soldiers life in and out of uniform.        
	Recognizing that the constitutional role of the supreme commander is a ceremonial one, the president may well ask her military secretary what the ordinary soldier would expect from their supreme commander. The secretary could explain that the credo of the armed forces is: The safety, honour and welfare of your country comes first, always and every time; the honour, welfare and comfort of the men you command come next; your own ease comfort and safety come last, always and every time. It is this code by which the armed forces conduct themselves and judge their success or failure. It is also the one by which they judge higher national leaderships.        
	Having got thus far and finding the president in a mood to learn more about the strange ethos of a body of men and women, of whom she is the supreme commander, the military secretary may be emboldened to reveal to her that at that very moment there are stored in some obscure corner of the Rashtrapati Bhavan hundreds of such medals that have been neatly labelled and packed by their proud recipients, but returned as a symbol of solemn and dignified protest at being perceived to have been let down by the very nation that had bestowed the honour on them. More such medals keep coming at regular intervals.        
	He may explain this unfortunate chapter as having its roots in the anomalies of the sixth pay commission and the denial of the frequently promised one rank one pension principle. Since knocking on various doors evoked no response, many veterans held silent gatherings at various memorials across the cities and towns. These gatherings were in tribute to their fallen colleagues and also intended to convey their pain and anguish at the neglect and apathy in addressing various issues concerning the welfare of veterans. The surrendering of medals was the next step in this inglorious first in the annals of free Indias military history and one that a sensitive leadership should have made every effort to nip in the bud, but chose to ignore instead. As indeed it continues to do.        
	While the veteran community was one with the cause, the above means of redressal followed by some succeeded in dividing the veteran community itself, pitching senior and distinguished veterans, including commanders, on either side of the divide. Clearly, here was another dubious first, this time in the history of veteran solidarity.        
	He may even explain that when the unprecedented step of surrendering their valued medals to their supreme commander was contemplated, rather than facilitate an audience with the president to assuage hurt sentiments and show due courtesy to senior veterans, some lower functionary in the presidents secretariat received their valued medals. Clearly the dignity which steered these veterans through their years of sacrifice was missing at the doors of their erstwhile supreme commander. A wound that could have been healed by an audience with the president had callously been allowed to deepen, as more and more medals were sought to be returned.              
	The military secretary may venture to suggest that since todays forces are tomorrows veterans, this state of affairs is deeply distressing to the entire institution of the armed forces and needs the supreme commanders healing touch. He may add that this is the first time in the history of the Indian republic that the supreme commander is actually being called upon to exercise her authority in furtherance of her welfare responsibilities.        
	Even as the president mulls over this burdensome background, she may begin to wonder why, as supreme commander, she was not expected to lay a wreath at the Amar Jawan Jyoti on the occasion of the annual Republic Day military parade. Further, she may wonder why Amar Jawan Jyoti, which symbolizes an eternal Indian soldier in whose memory the flame burns, was the shadow of India Gate, which is a fitting memorial that the British built in memory of our soldiers who died fighting their wars  not ours. Where indeed was the national war memorial commemorating all those who have laid down their lives fighting Indias wars and the proposal regarding which has been shuttling up and down the corridors of national governance for decades? These disturbing questions would now weigh heavily on her presidential responsibilities.        
	If the symbolic gesture of stepping into the cockpit of a combat aircraft and getting a feel of what the defence forces are doing to keep this nation secure generates some of the emotions and welfare concerns that afflict the institution of our defence forces and their veterans, then the hope generated by this symbolic event may well translate into reality  that of a more active role of the supreme commander in the realm of welfare of the men and women she commands.         
	The president has the distinction of being the first woman to hold this exalted position. Let her choose to be the first to exercise her obligations towards the welfare of those under her supreme command.

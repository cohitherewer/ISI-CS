The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Tragic drama
                                                                                                                 TRAGIC DRAMA                              Soumitra Das      VISUAL ARTS                                                 
	Akar Prakar is celebrating Shyamal Dutta Rays 75th birth anniversary (June 1-June 10) by exhibiting a private collection of his water colours, oils and prints along with the watercolours of Sandip Roy and Subir Dey, two young recipients of the award instituted in memory of this pioneering watercolourist. Some of Dutta Rays works such as the broken bowl and the throne going to pieces have become iconic images of contemporary Indian art but this exhibition reveals his strength as a draughtsman and graphic artist as well. His mixed media works such as the one of the headless, shadowy army confronting a similar decapitated troop, and of the soldier in red engaged in a duel with his double in black (picture) have all the trappings of a tragic drama in which the vision of the protagonists is obscured.         
	In another painting, the crumbling throne is under attack from an army of flies. Like his lonesome, isolated kings, freedom fighter, monkey and rickshaw puller, this fly-blown symbol of power and authority has turned into an object of pity. One of his most arresting paintings is that of a cur tied to what was once the gate of a stately home. From the starving dog to the battered cast iron gateway and the derelict arches, everything is gnarled, creating the perfect visual metaphor for our beleaguered a city.         
	Two of Dutta Rays etchings  The Magician and The Monument  are outstanding for the way he has accentuated the structure of the images. The crowned magician turns into a monochrome scarecrow, its facial features barely visible, while the monument is a contrast between an oval and upright form, the former resembling an urn, while the latter is the cross-section of a staircase leading nowhere. This creates a sense of ambiguity as it does not represent anything in particular. Yet it is clearly an experiment with forms, something that Dutta Ray never tried out either in his paintings or in his drawings.        
	Young and skilled as they are, the works of both Sandip Roy and Subir Dey are nothing to write home about. Sandip Roy is a competent landscape artist and some of his best works are inspired by the craggy terrains of the Bihar plateau. His waterbody with the boat drifting among clumps of vegetation is a competent evocation of isolation. However, his Varanasi looks puzzling. Without the familiar ghats and the steps, the river bank looks more like Venice than the holiest of Hindu cities. Subir Deys compositions are elaborate to the point of being overdone. The urchins peeking into the bioscope, the telephone set that resembles a tortoise and glimpses of the Mahabharat are kitsch parading as serious art.

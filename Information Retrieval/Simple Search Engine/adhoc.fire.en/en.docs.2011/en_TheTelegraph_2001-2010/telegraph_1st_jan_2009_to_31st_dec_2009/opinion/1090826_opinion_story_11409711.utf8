                                                                                                                 IN SICKNESS AND HEALTH                                  A proposed law to deal with epidemics such as swine flu has been gathering dust. Saheli Mitra on why the government needs to enact it forthwith                          FLU guard: Many schools have asked students to use masks to check the spread of swine flu                                   
	As the number of H1N1 cases rises across India and the death rate climbs, one state after another is invoking the 112-year-old Epidemic Diseases Act in an attempt to control the pandemic. But a look at the ancient Act reveals that it is sorely inadequate to fight a pandemic such as swine flu.        
	The Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, empowers the central government to prescribe regulations like detaining any person suspected of having symptoms of the disease in times of an epidemic. It also empowers the government to put the person in a hospital  forcibly, if required. Anyone disobeying a regulation or order made under this Act is punishable under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code.        
	However, experts point out that the Act is way behind times as it does not even mention many of the modern day communicable diseases. Diseases like H1N1, against which the Act has been invoked, is not even included in the law. Todays communicable diseases like SARS and HIV find no place in the law either. Isnt it funny that such an ancient Act is being invoked without any changes, asks Calcutta-based lawyer Rajesh Ganguly.        
	The irony is that a new draft law to fight modern day epidemics has been gathering dust since last year. In line with the recommendations of the Law Commission, the Union health ministry had in September 2008 finalised the draft of a new Bill to replace the Epidemics Act. Called the Public Health Prevention, Control and Management of Epidemics, Bio-terrorism and Disasters Bill, it is intended to be better able to deal with modern day disease control. But little has progressed since then and to date the Bill has not been tabled in Parliament.        
	Law Commission chairman Justice A.R. Lakshmanan says, The Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, is inadequate to deal with pandemics like H1N1 influenza. It was enacted during the British Raj and requires complete overhauling and refurbishing to deal with situations like the one that has arisen.        
	Adds city-based pathologist Dr Papia Mazumdar, A new public health law is imperative today. It should not only incorporate newer diseases and viruses but also take into consideration the dimensions of a global epidemic. Measures like quarantining and strict monitoring of suspects must be provided under the Act.        
	Says a health ministry official on condition of anonymity, The new Bill formulated in consultation with the National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD), Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the director general of health specifies 32 diseases and 34 bio-terrorism agents. The diseases specified include avian influenza, HIV-AIDS, cholera, vector-borne diseases like malaria and dengue, rabies, small pox, polio, enteric fevers, SARS, plague, tuberculosis, typhus, yellow fever and measles.        
	It also includes 15 bacteria, two fungi and 16 viruses that can be used as potential bio-terrorism threats. The Bill will probably be tabled in the upcoming Parliament session, says the official.        
	The new Bill gives the central government powers to isolate, quarantine, disinfect and inspect people and premises. It can also ban the sale, distribution, stocking and black marketing of medicines. However, states can still take measures like social distancing, closure of schools and markets without consulting the Centre.        
	While lauding the fact that a new law to tackle communicable diseases is in the offing, the medical fraternity cautions that it will defeat its purpose unless it takes into account the fact that every disease is different and needs to be fought differently.               
	Says Dr G.B. Nair, director, National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases, Calcutta, Effective legislative control depends largely on the nature of the disease. Each disease is unique, its routes of transmission is different and hence it should be tackled in different ways. For example, H1N1 has an aerial route of transmission and can jump from one country to another with ease. So a uniform and collective approach among all countries is needed to tackle it. For diseases like cholera, on the other hand, the focus should be on local transmission and containment.        
	Many also feel that the Bill should impose responsibilities related to public health on both private and public organisations. If the Bill involves the private sector in times of an epidemic, the problem can be tackled faster, feels Dr Mazumdar.        
	The Bill tries to plug some loopholes of the Epidemics Act. The current Act has no provision to address issues like negligence by doctors, as alleged by the family of 14-year-old Reeda Shaikh, who was the first to die of swine flu in India. Under the new law the government can punish those who have intentionally allowed diseases of epidemic proportions to spread or overlooked the presence of harmful bacteria, viruses and toxins, says Ganguly.        
	The Bill stipulates imprisonment of two to seven years and the imposition of a penalty of Rs 2 lakh to Rs 10 lakh on anyone who allows viruses such as the H1N1 to spread or is negligent about detecting a disease that can reach epidemic proportions. Besides, whereas the Epidemics Act said all offences under the law were non-compoundable (meaning that only the courts could punish offenders), the new Bill makes offences compoundable (government authorities can directly punish the culprits).        
	Experts point out that the new law has other positives. Under it the Centre can prescribe temporary regulations to prevent the outbreak of a disease even at the state level. At present, the Union health ministry can only issue guidelines and notifications to states on how to handle pandemics but cannot force them to act, says Ganguly.        
	But in times of epidemics it is imperative that the administration acts fast. As Pune resident Aparna Shastri says, At first the public reacted adversely to the government embargo on movement under the Epidemic Act. But the measure has helped in bringing down the number of cases. If the central government can directly enforce embargos or quarantines, the process becomes faster and more efficient, she adds.        
	With new communicable diseases such as swine flu, avian flu or SARS cropping up with sickening regularity, and with the public going into a state of panic over their spread, it is perhaps time the government passed the new law on disease control to tackle the problem effectively.

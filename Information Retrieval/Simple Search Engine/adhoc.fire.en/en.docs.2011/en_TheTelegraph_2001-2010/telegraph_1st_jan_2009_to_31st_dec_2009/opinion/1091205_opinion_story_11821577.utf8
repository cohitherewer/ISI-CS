The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | When work is also fun
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        WHEN WORK IS ALSO FUN                                  Visual Arts - Soumitra Das                                                  
	Satish Gujrals paintings and sculptures look lush and lustrous  covered with gold leaf and in bright shades of vermilion, green and ochre or jet black  on the walls of Aakriti Art Gallery where his one-man show, Times Whirlwind, is being held (ending today). Gujral is as much a celebrity as he is an artist, his elder brother being a former prime minister. It is also well known that he lost his hearing at an early age following a severe illness.        
	Equally celebrated is his sojourn in Mexico where he was apprenticed with Diego Rivera and Sequeira. This resulted in Gujrals agonized works in which he gave vent to the torment of the Partition. The artist, originally trained at the school of art in Lahore and subsequently at the Sir J.J. School of Art in Mumbai, created dark and portentous works reflecting the mood of despair that prevailed among the refugees from Punjab. His palette, too, was dark in keeping with his distress.        
	But at 84, Gujrals world view has undergone a sea change. He seems to have left his troubles behind and is having a whale of a time. One is undeniably impressed by the sheer number of works, which includes quite a few sculptures, he is exhibiting. Gujral may be in a playful mood now, but he still has not forgotten his socialist realism days. However, the glorified workers in Gujrals paintings are not overpoweringly dour like the sculptures of the Soviet Republic. They are picturesque. They work in tandem with the machines they handle, and there is excellent chemistry between the animate and the inanimate.         
	The machines are, anyway, strange contrivances with the head of a bull or a horse and are strapped with belts. The humans are like robots, with mask-like faces betraying no signs of emotion. Colourful kites bobbing in the breeze are tied to the machines, as are flocks of birds that are either toys or robots. The winged creatures also fly out of these mechanical contraptions as if they were being churned out. It seems to be a utopian vision of work generating fun. Perhaps that is why the decorative element is so strong in them.        
	Gujral creates two-dimensional images, depending heavily on lines and contrasting shades. His sculptures are monochromatic, and are extensions of his drawings.         
	He has done a series of bull and horse heads in bronze in shades of gold and black, rich with patina. Some of them have ribbon-like appendages growing out of them. His charging bulls are deeply influenced by their Minoan predecessors, and one of them, in brilliant green and black, could be a Tyeb Mehta in bronze. Only Gujral is too pretty by far.

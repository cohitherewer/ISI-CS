                                                                                                                 DESIGNED TO BE DIFFERENT                              Soumitra Das      Visual Arts                                                
	While the excellence and superlative quality of our traditional designs are undeniable, design cannot be said to have a large role to play in our everyday lives today. Being conservative by nature, we do not seem to care much for the aesthetics of contemporary design  too bleak and spare for our questionable tastes moulded largely by Bollywood and kitsch, and often bordering on the bizarre. When the rich build houses, they prefer the excesses of neo-classical architecture to the luxury of less is more. For, the grand or what is perceived as grand is regarded as a symbol of power meant to impress and perhaps even intimidate.        
	So the exhibition, Somewhat Different: Contemporary Design and the Power of Convention (Birla Academy of Art and Culture, till October 16), organized by the Institute for Foreign Cultural Affairs in Germany and Goethe-Institut/Max Mueller Bhavan, can surprise us by the way perfectly ordinary objects of everyday use has been given little twists that have radically changed their looks, their functions, and the ways in which they are handled. This exhibition needs a permanent guide as the differences between conventional design and the one that is meant to challenge it (displayed here) need to be pointed out to the uninitiated.        
	Although the idea behind the production of each exhibit is quite novel and clever (and they look great in the catalogue), at the venue, some of them, particularly the ones made of cloth, appear a little shop-soiled. Not their fault really  they have been circulating for quite some time now all over the world. Moreover, instead of labels, all the captions are scribbled with chalk. Even the local galleries avoid such a tacky look. And the heat and dust of our city can get the better of even the most exquisitely-designed objects.        
	Anyway, these objects are not meant to be just pretty. The exhibits stress divergences from design standards set by habit and convention. The works of 47 individual designers and studios based in Germany along with 20 works of designers based in other European countries were originally displayed, but here only a part of the exhibition is being shown for lack of space.        
	And as Volker Albus, who teaches at the HFG Karlsruhe University of Arts and Design in Frankfurt and has also curated this exhibition, writes in his catalogue essay: For it is the different construction, configuration or materials that are frequently not informed by the wish to create a different design, but an unconventional interpretation of what interaction means, by another reading of rituals, or by a fundamentally different understanding of elements which form the backdrop of domestic life.        
	For example, a wicker bag for different utensils resembles the cup of a brassiere produced for a giantess. An Oriental carpet reproduces the advertisement of such a commodity on its body instead of the usual exotic patterns. A rocking chair, instead of being a high chair, is a low chair with its seat on the floor. In a classic example, a bookshelf wobbles, instead of being stable, although its function remains the same. Grcic (one of the participants) interprets the connections between vertical support and horizontal shelf not as the usual rigid cross-joint, but as a flexible articulation, writes Albus. There is a constant striving towards breaking out of moulds, and creating designs  often leavened with wit  that question the mental pictures we have of certain pieces of furniture.        
	Thus, a hallstand comes with the backrests of chairs  the logic being that we instinctively hang our jackets on them. Instead of the prototype of the flat cushion, in this arm chair, the foam rubber cube is so thick and deep that it is at the same level as the arm and headrests. Colourful hexagons when conjoined turn into a rug, but instead of presenting a complete picture there are gaps in between. What looks like a ping-pong table is actually meant for holding meetings (picture). If overtaken by boredom, it can double as a table for playing the game itself, or for laying out dinner.        
	Some of the exhibits, particularly the ones in which brushes have been used, are quite preposterous. Whether by design or by accident, they look like they were inspired by surrealism. What else can one say about coat-hangers that could have sprouted a set of teeth made entirely of bristles? The hairy chair may not have much practical use but it is surely a direct descendent of Tristan Tzaras movement. No place here for standardized design solutions.

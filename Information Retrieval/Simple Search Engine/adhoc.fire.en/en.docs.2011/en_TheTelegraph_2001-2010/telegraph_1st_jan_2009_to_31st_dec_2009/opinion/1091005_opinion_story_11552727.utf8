The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | To make more managers 
                                                                                                                 TO MAKE MORE MANAGERS                           - Management education needs to be better planned					 					      Commentarao      S.L. Rao                                                              
	Kapil Sibal might well deal aggressively with the reform of management education, still being regulated by the All India Council for Technical Education. Indian institutes of management are only the froth on top of a large wasteland (with a few oases) in management education. It also attracts some of the brightest young people. Business education is almost a guarantee for well-paid jobs and prospects for rapid increases in remunerations. Indian students of management in business schools here and abroad were around 200,000 in 2007, a very small number in relation to the needs.        
	Management education was an artificial graft on to our educational system. It has not had the integrated thinking and planning that, for example, went into Indian institutes of technology or the five-year law programme at the National Law School of India University. The regulatory framework of the AICTE is highly inefficient, overly centralized and corrupt. The National Knowledge Commission and the Yash Pal committee want the AICTE disbanded and individual schools to decide on fees, curricula and other matters. This will not improve the many bad schools that should be dealt with firmly.         
	Self-regulation by many bad business schools cannot do any better than the AICTE. Many schools are promoted by seedy entrepreneurs including politicians, out to make large bucks. Until we can weed out the shady schools and introduce high standards of self-governance by law, there must be a mechanism to monitor, inspect and award quick punishment for violators. There must be a mechanism to close the inefficient and corrupt ones.               
	AICTE norms for recognition included square footage, library, faculty strength, and so on. But AICTE constantly overlooked norms in granting recognition. There was casual and sporadic monitoring and inspection. Cheating was not uncommon and AICTE did not take action. Few were penalized for violation. Many of these recognized schools are scandalously under-equipped in libraries, computers and even qualified faculty. It is a comment on the high quality of students, the shortage of trained managers, and the herd instinct of Indian industry that almost all get good jobs on graduation.         
	Post-graduate management education must be integrated to build on knowledge imparted in a related undergraduate programme. The student should have had a broad exposure to the social sciences as well as the natural sciences. Values, ethics and societal needs must reflect themselves in management education.         
	Management education has failed to meet the vast need for managers in Indian business and non-business organizations. The unintended consequence of the hurried reservation for other backward classes is that IIMs, after years of foot dragging, have been compelled to increase the numbers admitted. But IIMs alone cannot meet the huge need for managers in India. We need a more root-and-branch reform of all management education.         
	There is a severe shortage of competent faculty. They are poorly integrated into management education. Most have little practical experience of management. Many come from different disciplines and there is no system to give them orientation towards management. At least the better management schools must offer the doctorate degree and run faculty development programmes. A massive effort to train faculty from other disciplines to teach in management courses needs to be initiated.        
	There is no way for students and recruiters today to establish the capability of different schools. Ratings could enable assessment of their relative merit. But hardly 15 per cent of recognized management schools allow themselves to be rated. They all make substantial surpluses both above and below the table. Most schools have modest libraries, few computers and poor faculty. We need a single national rating agency that would publish results annually, and compel all schools to pay for annual ratings.         
	There are over 22,500 listed and unlisted companies in India. Then there are private companies, partnerships, proprietary companies, service companies, innumerable small and medium manufacturing, trading and financial enterprises, and many non-governmental organizations in health, education and other fields that also need trained managers. The numbers of around 100,000 domestic MBAs (or equivalent) and such of the foreign-trained who return are not sufficient to meet the needs of most of these current and potential users. Most organizations actually recruit experienced people or those freshly out of school and college and train them for their needs. Commerce and economics graduates and others with professional qualifications in accounting, auditing, secretarial practice, engineering and so on form the bulk of the managerial population.         
	The present standalone MBA post-graduate programme must be integrated with undergraduate education. Students must be able to seamlessly move into an MBA class without having to newly learn the social sciences, statistics, economic history and so on. Many undergraduate courses do not give exposure to a lot of these subjects. The present undergraduate programme is the BBA, a money-making course designed in haste to cash in on the demand for people with a business education. Teaching business management, as is done now, for a BBA degree to 16-year olds is misguided, since management studies demand some more exposure to other subjects and preferably work experience. Instead, a new five-year integrated management programme, with a two-year gap for work experience, must be like the five-year law programme at the national law schools.         
	We must also pay a lot more attention to the content and teaching in our BCom and MCom courses. The V.K.R.V. Rao committee report on commerce education of 1961 had proposed that management education be at the apex of a pyramid of which the base consists of diploma and degree-holders in commerce who learn the essentials to start as foot-soldiers in commerce and industry. Above them would be the BCom starting as a lower level executive, sales officer, supervisor of accounts and so on. The MCom would have specialized in one industry or another, like banking, transport, railways, even NGOs, arts management and so on, and enter those areas. The management education post-graduate would be fit to join as manager at the entry level anywhere. He would be well-rounded because of his undergraduate work, have had exposure to aspects of management, and would be even more useful if he had spent two years at work. If we create a structure like this, we will produce many more trained personnel to staff a variety of industries and levels of jobs. The present mad rush for management graduates for all types of jobs might decline.              
	Exploitation of students by charging capitation fees or excessive fees, offering poor facilities and relatively untrained faculty is rampant in many business schools and must be stopped ruthlessly. Every management education institution, whether run by a university or a trust, should be made to follow the same corporate governance rules prescribed for listed companies by the Securities and Exchange Board of India.        
	The small number of management graduates in relation to the total need makes many of the young and bright entrants act superior and arrogant. They complete management education in their early twenties and have multiple highly paid job offers. Management thinkers fault this practice and attribute the decline of values in many industrial and finance companies to it.        
	The government must not interfere with educational institutions on matters of faculty remuneration, differential salaries according to qualifications of faculty members, or remuneration based on performance. If the institution depends on government grants it must be free to set remuneration within an overall budget.         
	Sibal must understand that IIMs do not represent management education in India. There are hundreds of other institutions, many quite unsuited for the job, but making money. After the aging senior politicians who for the last decade handled the human resource development ministry, Sibal is a fresh mind and can transform management education.

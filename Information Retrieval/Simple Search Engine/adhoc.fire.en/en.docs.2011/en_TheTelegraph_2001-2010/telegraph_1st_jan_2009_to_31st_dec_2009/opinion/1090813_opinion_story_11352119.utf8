The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | An august month for thought
                                                                                                                 AN AUGUST MONTH FOR THOUGHT                                  Independence Day celebrations would make little sense until a pan-Indian identity is fostered among the people, writes Arabinda Ray                          Many in one                                  
	The Calcutta centre of the All India Radio has a Bengali programme early every morning, when selected letters from listeners are read out. The theme is set for each fortnight. I often listen to it because it also gives the news, followed by Rabindrasangeet. For the first week of August this year, the theme was August in the light of history. Not unexpectedly, most letters were euphoric about what happened 62 years ago on the 15th of this month, about the immense efforts and sacrifices made by Indians in general and the leaders in particular that lead up to that day. Almost all the letters spoke about the intolerable cruelty, racism, deceit and hauteur that the people of this country had to face for 200 years from their white rulers.        
	Presumably, the generation and the kind of listeners who write in have gone through school textbooks and folklore, which have founded their beliefs; the persons they interact with have the same perceptions, which give them the conviction to write as they do and feel a warmth of pride as their names and addresses are read out after each letter. I have no quarrel with that, although without being an Anglophile or a supporter of the raj, I wonder if these literate persons are aware of the permanent contributions made by generations of those demons who came out to do lifelong service in this country and left behind monuments of their travails, which still guide our nation. Amongst all those beautiful speeches made in the night that dawned on August 15, no one recalls the one Sarojini Naidu made in her inimitable style to partly acknowledge this fact.              
	After all, though culturally we had a pan-Indian sensibility for thousands of years, we were not politically one country. For one hundred years, by trickery, bravery and diplomacy, the British put all the different states under one umbrella, consolidated it for the next hundred years (suffering, and overcoming, an early hiccup in 1857), and gave the country a foreign name  India  not to be found in any of the languages later enshrined in the Constitution. This is the name for our country which we still use and the administration is carried out in the only language that is understood by the educated in every part of the country, namely English. Sixty two years later, this language is, if anything, more firmly established.        
	There is no gainsaying the fact that for the last 50 years of British rule, the masses in far-flung areas of India, with vastly different languages and cultures, were welded together under a leadership unparalleled in the worlds history. This leadership created the nation and made it struggle through hardships, sacrifices, toil and tears to ultimately seize power from an exhausted British government. A new nation-state was born in the constituent assembly.         
	The momentum carried us smoothly through the framing of a unique Constitution to govern the republic. The stage was so completely set that over 500 so-called native states, which could have fought to stay away, integrated into this newborn country. When two  Junagadh and Hyderabad  resisted, they were taken over by force and there was practically no resentment in world opinion. Through bad handling, we created a persisting problem in Kashmir. Goa was a little different. The more than 400 years of Portuguese rule there had no intention of shifting. When 14 years after Indian independence military action had to be taken, the scenario was different, but assisted by the notoriety of Salazar the dictator, world opinion soon died down. India as we know it today was complete.        
	In 1861, a similar event took place in world history when all the separate independent kingdoms, republics and principalities merged to form Italy as one country. At the opening of that parliament, Massimo dAzeglio, a Piedmontese painter, politician and patriot, observed, Now that we have created Italy, we must start creating Italians. It is a pity that on that memorable night of August 14, among the many brilliant and euphoric speeches, this particular thought was absent. Perhaps, sensing the mood of the countrymen at large, the thought of such a necessity did not arise. We thought we had paid the full price of the demand for a multiplicity of nations by agreeing to the Partition. But cracks began to appear as Congress was hoisted by its own petard of the pre-Independence promise of linguistic states. Potti Sriramulu, by fasting to death, created Andhra Pradesh. Within a few years, Maharashtra and Gujarat had separated, Haryana had been carved out of Punjab, and the States Reorganization Committee had in several states added or subtracted districts on grounds of ethnicity. The process continues. Now goons in states thrash candidates who come to sit for recruitment in all-India bodies; there have to be dangerous protests if the statue of a revered Tamil poet is sought to be established in Karnataka; persons from the Northeast are treated as foreigners even in the nations capital.              
	At our premier institutes teaching management, engineering or law, the concept of being Indian is dominant. Our national sports teams may bear grudges of favouritism in selection, but perform and elicit unsullied mass support. The employment and promotion policies of corporate bodies do not generally suffer from sectoral partialities. There are many such examples to work upon, but the Centre has to take the initiative of constantly urging the states to eschew narrow-mindedness and to give priority to Indianism after ensuring that justice has been done in all other matters. Such an idea has particular relevance at the grassroot levels, where state governments, guided by a uniform Central policy, is sine qua non. Otherwise, for all practical purposes, we will become a conglomeration of many nation states. Germany, Italy, and even the United Kingdom have strong regional loyalties, but work as one nation.        
	One sees no direct effort to promote the concept of being Indian. It is of high priority. Now that we have a government at the Centre not shadowed by the fear of being overthrown, it is imperative that the concept of being Indian is consciously advocated in all spheres of activity. It is entirely appropriate that we should celebrate freedom at midnight because that night a vast population emerged from the shadows of thralldom to freedom. But the concomitant task remains unattended and, if anything, is getting more difficult as the days pass by. Now, in the 62nd year of Independence, let us consciously go all out to create Indians.

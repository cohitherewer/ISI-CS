                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        IN THE WRONG DIRECTION                                  Malvika Singh                              
	The dignity and grace with which the outgoing governor of West Bengal, Gopal Krishna Gandhi, left the Raj Bhavan and the state on the day his term ended made for the most appropriate, yet rare, manner of demitting office. No one, but no one, in a position of power has done this in the recent past. Ministers hang on to government accommodation, hoping for a sinecure and hence another free home, and a handful of retired government babus and former members of parliament continue to live on in official residences. Gopal Krishna Gandhi should be held up as an example of what this nation deserves from its leaders.        
	One is getting increasingly ashamed of some of those who lead us. They have, over the last couple of decades, corrupted the public space, polluted the larger domain by breaking the laws of this land for their personal gain, diluted the discourse by using abusive and unacceptable language in Parliament and on public platforms. They have employed the official machinery for their personal needs, and have used State protection for free. This shameless charade, played out over decades, has evoked disgust in the minds of Indians. Sadly, no single leader has addressed the problem and initiated a radical corrective. If the party in power can issue endless whips in Parliament to make sure members attend sessions that are mandatory constitutionally or to make them vote in a particular way, why not have a whip to follow the spirit of the law?                
	Enemy inside        
	With Parliament in session for these last few weeks, some new Congress MPs, particularly those from Uttar Pradesh, have been enjoying a sense of power, whether real or imagined, in the sterile corridors and in the waiting rooms. Some first-timers, with heavyweight backing, are incessantly talking about their closeness to the powers-that-be, in an effort to impress wide-eyed colleagues about their imaginary importance. Needless to say, this lot has begun to manipulate members of the press, the secretaries at Akbar Road as well as other functionaries by suggesting their closeness and accessibility. Others, perhaps not as adept at such self-deception, claim that they spend many minutes with the top boss when, in fact, they sit in the ante-room! God knows who swallows these imaginative stories, but the antics of these lightweight madonnas and adonises continue unabated. Will the gen-next remain vulnerable to such superficial manoeuvrings by its elected representatives?        
	Some of these players are so persistent that, ironically, they end up operating from the same ante-room in which they once sat waiting for the appointment. The shunned outsider becomes a burrowing mole, inside. That mole then begins his or her payback to the mentor, the tacit supporter who stood by when the going was tough and elections had to be fought and won, when social and developmental works had to be funded. Such stage performers have been showing their knickers for decades to voyeurs, watching two generations of political Delhi with eager interest. The actresses and actors have changed, and so have the names on billboards, the faces, make-ups, fabric of saris and footwear, the cabals and the scales, but the modus operandi of devious infiltration remains consistent.        
	The possibility of serious, lively, energetic conversation with these entities is nearly non-existent. These people do not make one feel confident that India is in intelligent hands. They are simplistic, unread and clearly unlettered in the broadest sense of the word. But this does not mean that some of them do not have elaborate degrees. It only means that, alas, their degrees have put them into a straitjacket which makes them one dimensional, predictable and hugely ineffective in a plural, complex and diverse nation state.

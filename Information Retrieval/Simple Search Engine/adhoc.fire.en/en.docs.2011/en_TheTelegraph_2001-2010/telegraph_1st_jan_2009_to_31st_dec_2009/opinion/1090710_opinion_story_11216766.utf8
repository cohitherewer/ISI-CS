The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | In poor health
                                                                                                                 IN POOR HEALTH                                                    
	All politicians know the value of propaganda. But those who believe in their own propaganda are doomed to fail. Surjya Kanta Mishra, West Bengals minister for health and rural development, has obviously fallen into the trap. It is difficult otherwise to explain how he deludes himself into thinking that the common people flock to government hospitals because of their good service. Mr Mishra is not just one of the senior members of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees cabinet, but he is also one of the leading lights of the West Bengal unit of the Communist Party of India (Marxist). That such a man can be so deluded should explain why both the public health services and the party are in such a sorry state. It also points to the level of insensitivity that can afflict parties and leaders wielding power for too long. The worst thing about Mr Mishras certificate to the government hospitals is that it shows how insensitive he is to the sufferings of those who have no option but to go there for treatment. It is simply unbelievable that he does not know the reality of these hospitals. The poor condition of services in State-run hospitals is public knowledge. Patients lying on the floor or several of them occupying one bed is more than a grotesque spectacle. It is symbolic of all that is wrong with the states public healthcare system.         
	However, Mr Mishra is only the latest in a long line of health ministers in West Bengal who have presided over a collapsing system. True, the limited facilities in the existing hospitals are grossly inadequate to cope with the rising population. But no one should know it better than Mr Mishra that the shortage of capacity is only a small part of the problem. Two things  the absence of a workable official policy and the lack of work culture  combined to ruin the public healthcare system in the state. The trade unions of hospital employees, especially those enjoying the patronage of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions, control the health sector the way they operate in factories. The result is a total breakdown of administration. Like his predecessors, Mr Mishra has been caught in the web of a vicious cycle which, ironically, is a product of his own partys ruinous politics. The poor cannot afford private healthcare. But that is no reason why they should suffer such indignities. The ministers remark can only add to their pain and to the problems in the system.

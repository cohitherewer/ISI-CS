                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Test of popularity                  
	Sir  The editorial, The Upper House (May 24), compared the Indian Council of States to its American equivalent, the United States of America Senate, members of which are held in greater esteem in the US compared to the members of the House of Representatives. Although that is not the case in India, where Rajya Sabha members are today looked upon as politicians who have failed the test of popularity, and the council itself as a backdoor to the parliament.          
	The senators in the US are directly elected by the people, even though the founding fathers of America had conceived otherwise. Popular election to the Senate was standardized by a constitutional amendment way back in 1913, by which time most state legislatures had independently adopted a popular referendum-based system of electing senators. One of the main reasons for this change was the widespread public disapproval of senators elected by state legislatures. These senators were often corrupt and driven by personal interests as they were not directly answerable to the people. Moreover, the American print media, under the leadership of journalists like David Graham Phillips, helped galvanize the popular demand for reform that prompted the Congress ultimately to pass the seventeenth amendment in 1913.          
	Another reason for the elevated status enjoyed by the senators is the composition of the Senate, wherein each state is represented by just two members regardless of population. This makes the senators status equivalent to that of the governor of the state he is representing. In the case of the Rajya Sabha, however, the founding fathers opted for a proportional system of representation, which is arguably more democratic, and more so in a country like India whose political map is not geometrically divided into equal parts as in the US. The flaw, however, lies in the fourth schedule, which allocates a staggering 233 members to represent just 30 states, thereby diluting the select nature of the Upper House.          
	The founding fathers had exhibited great wisdom in the provision of a bicameral parliament. But 60 years since Independence have revealed that a certain degree of reform is necessary, if only to fulfil the original intentions. Two key changes may be propounded. The first would be to reduce the strength of the Upper House while maintaining the principle of proportional representation. The second and more debatable change would be to open the Rajya Sabha elections to the public. This would also justify granting greater powers to the house in legislative as well as executive matters.          
	These measures would not only strengthen the federal polity, but would also restore to the Council of States the stature of a select group of seasoned politicians which engages in serious policy debates and guides the House of the People in making laws that affect the nations citizens.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Sourav Sengupta, Calcutta 

                
	 Sir  It would be an understatement to say that the Rajya Sabhas efficacy has died away. In reality, it has seldom fulfilled the expectations of the Constitution since its inception, except that it has provided the ruling party with the unjust power to offer handouts and even ministerial berths to some members who could not get elected by popular vote. The editorial has rightly pointed out that its role and function today makes a mockery of not only the original purpose and justification of the Council of States but also of the conventions of democracy.          
	Similar establishments, like the Bidhan Parishads, have been abolished by the majority of states in India, as they were considered redundant. Enormous expenses are incurred by the government on account of the Rajya Sabha. The luxury of maintaining such a dispensable legacy of the British empire is hardly justifiable. Instead of further burdening the people with taxes, the newly elected government should dissolve and abolish this house. The savings could be used to help the backward sections of society.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Asit Kumar Mitra, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  The Rajya Sabha, which is but a platform for backdoor entry into the Lok Sabha for the chosen few, should be scrapped altogether as it has defeated the very purpose for which it was created.          
	India remains at the bottom of both the corruption index and the human development index.The Indian netas lives are full of splendour, while the aam admi suffers from starvation and lack of healthcare. Even the prime minister got it wrong when he said that the Maoists are the biggest threat to India. Surely he is aware that thriving corruption provides the catalyst to ease their spread?          
	Yours faithfully,       
Jayanta Dutt, Calcutta

                
	Erratum          
	In the Letters to the Editor section on May 28, a letter written by Tapas Biswas appeared under the name of Mookhi Amir Ali. The error is regretted.          
	 The Editor

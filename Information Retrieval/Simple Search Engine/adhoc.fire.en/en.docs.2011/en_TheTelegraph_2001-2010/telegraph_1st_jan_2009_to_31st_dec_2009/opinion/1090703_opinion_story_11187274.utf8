	After the Mumbai carnage on 26/11, the prime minister in his speech to the nation emphasized that police reforms are absolutely necessary for addressing threats to national integrity. The country needs a professional police force that is not misused for partisan purposes and can ensure the basic security of the citizens.         
	Demand for meaningful police reforms is an old one. Various groups of experts and committees from the 1960s onwards have made a slew of recommendations. But the most practical and precise recommendations for structural police reforms were made by the national police commission in 1979. These recommendations are relevant even today. Subsequent committees, and most recently the Soli Sorabjee committee, have endorsed these recommendations. The Supreme Court, in a landmark judgment on September 2, 2006, had given clear directives to the Centre and the state governments to implement the core reforms recommended by the national police commission with a view to insulating the police from extraneous pressures and influence. By passing these directives the apex court tried to combat the deep-seated problems of the politicization of the police force, lack of accountability mechanisms and the systemic weaknesses that result in poor-quality investigation. The apex court had fixed December 31, 2006 as the deadline for the states to report compliance.         
	Despite these unambiguous orders to the states by the Supreme Court, implementation of police reform has proved to be an uphill task. The state governments are unwilling to lose their stranglehold over the police. They filed petitions before the Supreme Court either seeking a review of some of the directives or asking for some more time to implement them. On January 11, 2007, the Supreme Court took note of the objections but ordered firmly that the process of police reforms must commence immediately. Unfortunately, even more than two years after the Supreme Court judgment, the process of implementation of the police reforms is still not visible in most of the states.                
	Urgent need        
	States like Gujarat, Nagaland, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka have questioned the need for the state security commission. They have brazenly stated that no unwarranted influence has been exercised over the police. Most of the states have also not complied with the very important directive of the Supreme Court regarding the establishment of independent Police Complaints Authorities at the state and district levels to look into public complaints against police misconduct. The stand of the state governments is that the establishment of the PCAs will demoralize the police personnel and adversely affect the working of the police.         
	West Bengal has only partially complied with the Supreme Court directives. Though the state government stated that a drafting committee has been set up and the new police legislation will be finalized by March 2007, till today no draft has been introduced in the legislative assembly or posted in the public domain. It has also not furnished any information regarding the creation of the state security commission.        
	The Central government also seems to be dragging its feet. It created a police act drafting committee under the chairmanship of Soli Sorabjee. The committee submitted its model police bill to the government in 2006. But even after two years, the government has not introduced the draft bill in the legislative assembly.         
	In such a situation, civil society has to play an important role. It is unfortunate that our political masters want the old order to continue. Police reforms did not figure in the election manifestos of the political parties. But the reforms brook no delay. The country needs an apolitical and efficient police force to take on the forces of disruption and destabilization.

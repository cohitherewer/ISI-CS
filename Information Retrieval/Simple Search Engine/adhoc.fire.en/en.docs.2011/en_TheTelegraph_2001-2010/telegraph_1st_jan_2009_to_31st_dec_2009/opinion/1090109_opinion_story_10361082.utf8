                                                                                                                 TASK UNDEFINED                                                    
	Promoters who cheat are normally expert enough to hide their frauds. Frauds that escape from protective walls of obfuscation take long to emerge as they make their way through Indias labyrinthine investigative and judicial systems. It is not often that a dishonest promoter takes an honest look at his misdoings and confesses in public. Ramalinga Raju deserves some thanks for having made a clean breast of it. One reason for doing so may be a desire to save Satyam from the disastrous consequences of his financial engineering. But the path chosen to save it does not look promising enough. The company has appointed a task force headed by someone whose only claim to fame is his long association with Satyam. He has chosen men of his own kind to help him. On appointment, he made a statement that sounds more like a clarion call to battle than a promise to learn from defeat. His SWAT team does not even look capable of swatting a fly.        
	This swatters team is designed to keep the business running until the storm blows over, not to address the serious governance issues Mr Rajus mea culpa has raised. Those can be addressed in one of three ways. One, Satyam could go into liquidation and its assets realized to let shareholders leave with no further regrets. Two, it could be sold as a functioning business. Three, a credible committee could be appointed to investigate Satyams finances and see how it can be rescued. The first does not sound promising. Mr Raju has clearly contracted enormous debts, and software businesses are usually light on assets, though Satyams real estate may be worth something if the Rajus penchant for it is any indication. The second looks better; but interest in buying Satyam may be limited by its parochial quality. Despite its global presence, it retains a strong Telugu accent.        
	That leaves the third option  an investigating committee that is seen to be genuinely independent. It cannot be constructed from within; it needs real outsiders to be credible, including accountants and lawyers of known integrity. But it cannot be appointed except by the management  which means the current board. It will probably be meeting this weekend. Its first task would be to set up this committee of experts who would have the respect of investors, and to give it a broad mandate. It should look for all shortcomings, and not confine itself to the disclosed ones; and it must be asked to work out a new management structure, and not leave it to the present fractured management to carry out what it may. Ram Mynampati has his task cut out. He must go beyond the 53,000 employees of Satyam, and reassure the broader community of Satyams investors, clients and the public on whom the livelihood of those employees depends.

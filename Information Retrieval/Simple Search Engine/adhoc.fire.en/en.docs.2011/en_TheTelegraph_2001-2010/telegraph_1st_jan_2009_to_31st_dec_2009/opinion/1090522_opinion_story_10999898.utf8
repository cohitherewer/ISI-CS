The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Bound in familiar chains
                                                                                                                 BOUND IN FAMILIAR CHAINS                                                    
	CHAINS By Laurie Halse Anderson, Bloomsbury, Rs 399        
	This novel is a good read. Crisp, short sentences and vivid images complement the narrative, while raw and direct words grip attention. It has all the qualities of a typical bestseller. The plot flows well, weaving the central story into the milieu with a professional smartness. It evokes basic emotions in the reader and keeps him keen, rather than challenging his intellect or offering a scope to move beyond the narrative.         
	Much like Slumdog Millionaire, this is a rags-to-riches story, or, to be more precise, a slavery-to-freedom story. Isabel, the protagonist, is a teenage girl, as in most of Andersons other works. What makes the character unique is her identity of an African slave in 18th century America. She suffers the wrath of her cruel masters and tries to hold on to the only remnant of her own family, her sister. The American War of Independence provides an apt backdrop to her struggle. Predictably, the novel presents a happy ending when the sufferer turns into the heroine of the piece, freeing herself from the chains of slavery.        
	Chains is authentic and interesting in its portrayals. What it lacks is contextuality. The author depicts slavery and freedom  the two conflicting themes that make the basis of the novel  from a perspective that may not hold good in 2009. Isabels chains symbolize physical bondage, a tangible obstacle. Her freedom, when it comes to her at last, is also a concrete accomplishment, in the form of a boat crossing a river. Her struggle may make for an appealing story, but is no more than a distant page in history. Freedom and slavery today have become more complex, relative, and less tangible. Chains are invisible and hard to envisage. Slavery in the 21st century is more a psychological phenomenon, and the struggle to be freed from the bonds that enslave our minds may not be as straightforward as Isabels escape from her masters. Today Isabel would have had her past, her ancestors and their ghosts, from which she draws her Spartacus-like zeal, held hostage by Shylock, who would invade and enslave her soul (Shylocker Banijyo Bistaar, by Shahjad Firdaus).        
	However, the novel has an interesting angle when it brings an individuals and a nations fight for freedom face to face. When Isabel turns into a spy in order to buy her own freedom, the narrative points towards how the concept of political freedom is built upon the sacrifice of individual freedom, and how the so-called liberators turn into slave-mongers. The author makes an attempt to expose an inherent hypocrisy that plagued Americas battle for liberty. But the story moves too fast for deeper reflections. Perhaps a slower narration could have given the reader a bit more time to think.                    ADHEESHA SARKAR

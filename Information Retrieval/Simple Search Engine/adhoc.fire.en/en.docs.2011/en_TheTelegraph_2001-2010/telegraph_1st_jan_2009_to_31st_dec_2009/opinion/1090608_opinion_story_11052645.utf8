                                                                                                                 HAUNTED BY THE PAST                                  GWYNNE DYER                              
	It would be childs play to take out North Koreas nuclear facilities in a single coordinated strike. So why dont the countries that worry about North Koreas nuclear weapons skip the endless haggling with a regime that does not bargain in good faith, and just use their superior weapons to strike the nuclear card from North Koreas hand? Surely they arent afraid of a conventional land invasion of the South by the North.        
	The North Korean army is large, but without air cover it would be torn to shreds in a matter of days, or even hours. This is the 21st century, and an army that cannot protect itself from air attack is just a bunch of dead men walking. There must be some further consideration that keeps the option of a preventive attack on North Korea off the table.        
	There is. It is called China.        
	It is a long time since Mao Zedong declared that China and North Korea were as close as lips and teeth. Todays Beijing has little sympathy for a fellow communist regime in Pyongyang that is not only brutally repressive but also an abject economic failure. North Korea has even reverted to dynastic rule, and other medieval phenomena like famine have become chronic there.        
	North Korea is an embarrassment to the communist system that the Chinese regime uses to justify its own monopoly of power. Nevertheless, Beijing cannot run the risk of letting Kim Jong-ils moth-eaten regime simply collapse, which would be the probable result of a successful disarming strike against Pyongyangs nuclear weapons. Regime collapse in Pyongyang would send a flood of destitute North Korean refugees across the frontier into China, and they might carry the infection with them. What China worries about is regime collapse in Beijing.        
	It is 20 years since the pro-democracy movement in China was crushed when troops and tanks swept onto Tienanmen Square and massacred hundreds of students. The regime officially dismisses the protesters, who camped peacefully on the square for weeks, as hooligans, but it is still haunted by the fear that the Chinese people might some day demand their country back.              
	Smart calculations        
	Even in good times, the Chinese government is acutely aware that it is among the last surviving communist regimes in the world, and that the ideology on which it bases its right to rule is essentially dead in the eyes of the people it rules. It could face a potentially fatal challenge very fast if things went wrong, and it knows it. Thats what happened in 1989.        
	Right-thinking liberals insist that the regime over-reacted in 1989: if it had agreed to talk to the students instead of killing them, everything would have been all right. Zhao Ziyang, then general secretary of the communist party, who was dismissed and put under house arrest for the rest of his life, believed that to the day he died.        
	Maybe that is what most people wanted in Tienanmen Square in 1989, but if the regime had started to make concessions it would have been gone by the end of the year. That was what happened in Poland, East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Romania, eventually even in the Soviet Union itself.         
	The lesson that the Chinese communist party has learned from 1989 is that there must be no more examples of collapsing communist regimes, especially on Chinas borders. The danger of infection, however remote, is too great to be tolerated, so North Koreas regime must survive, though Beijing is resolutely opposed to North Koreas nuclear test.        
	So no disarming strike against North Korea is possible, and the next stage in the crisis is likely to happen at sea when some North Korean ship suspected of carrying nuclear contraband is stopped.        
	Or there could just be a nasty incident among fishing fleets jostling for the best positions near the disputed sea border between North and South Korea.

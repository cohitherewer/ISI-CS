	Soon after Mamata Banerjee presented the rail budget for 2009-10, The Telegraph noted that her budget, though aimed at pleasing the people, lacked vision. It was especially alarming that Ms Banerjee had left the issues of safety and maintenance unaddressed. Quite expectedly, neither Ms Banerjees threat to produce a white paper on her predecessor nor her slew of sops could save the Indian Railways from going down the tracks. In the last six weeks, around 30 passengers have been killed and close to 100 injured in five major accidents across the country. The latest involves the Delhi-bound Mandore Express that got derailed near Jaipur, killing at least seven and leaving many hurt. As usual, the blame has been squarely put on the ground staff. The tracks in the area were fractured, a seasonal phenomenon caused by the contraction and expansion of metal because of temperature change. A common occurrence like this should not have escaped the notice of the maintenance staff. The driver has been faulted for applying the brakes too hard, and perhaps not minding the speed limits as well.        
	It is always convenient to point fingers at those on the lowest rung of the pecking order whenever something goes horribly wrong. Railways ministers in India have made a habit of this strategy. While it is indisputable that tragedies are mostly caused by technical incompetence, it is impossible to deny that the Indian Railways has not moved with the times when it comes to passenger safety. Advanced signalling systems, regular surveillance of tracks and automated safety controls are yet to be implemented across the railway network. If the ground staff, who are often barely literate and unaware of accountability, are not performing up to the mark, senior officials must ensure that they do so  by making surprise on-the-spot inspections and punishing laggards. It is equally important that the railways minister spends less time wooing voters in her home state, and pays closer attention to what is ailing her own ministry. It is not for nothing that the prime minister himself has forwarded her a note  based on findings by the Planning Commission  on possible ways to improve the Indian Railways.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Never fear a woman scorned
                                                                                                                 NEVER FEAR A WOMAN SCORNED                                  This Above All - Khushwant Singh                          Holy mess                                        
	Much has been written and said about the Bharatiya Janata Partys poor performance in the recent general elections. Its think-tank comprising Jaswant Singh, Yashwant Sinha, Arun Shourie and Sudheendra Kulkarni have spoken of their disenchantment with the choice of L.K. Advani as their candidate for the prime minister and the unmerited positions given to Arun Jaitley and Sushma Swaraj. I have my own views on the downfall of the BJP.        
	I think that the rot set in the party not now but much earlier  from the time of the destruction of the Babri Masjid in December 1992. It was a dastardly thing to do: the principal architect of the sacrilege was Advani. Far from being censured for it, he became the hero of the party and its choice as the prime minister. Even Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who privately expressed anguish over it, never came out openly to condemn it. I recall the evening when dining with Arun Shouries parents, Arun said loudly to Kuldip Nayar and me, Who says it was a mosque? I was taken aback. What else could a monument with three domes and a wall facing Mecca be but a mosque! I was sorely disappointed. It soured our close friendship of many years.        
	Did any BJP leader condemn Bal Thackeray when he boasted that it were his Sainiks who brought down the mosque? Did any of them condemn the Sainiks for vandalizing the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute in Pune? Did any of them condemn the hoodlums of the Bajrang Dal or the Ram Sena for wrecking shops selling Valentines Day cards? Did they condemn Raj Thackeray for letting loose his goons on non-Maharashtrians and forcing thousands to leave the state? No. They made feeble noises of protest but refrained from outright condemnation because they did not want to lose their vote bank. In the process, the BJP also projected Narendra Modi as the stand-in prime ministerial candidate. He may have seduced Ratan Tata to manufacture Nanos in Gujarat but he is yet to clear his name of the massacre of thousands of Muslims in 2002. None of this was lost on the aam aadmi, particularly of the younger generation voting for the first time.        
	While analysing the reasons for the drubbing the BJP got, it occurred to me that Varun Gandhi deserves special mention for his wild utterances which neither Advani nor Rajnath Singh thought bad enough to get him expelled him from the party. It is now upto his cousin, Rahul Gandhi, to honour him by bestowing on him the Vashist Sewa gold medal for ensuring the victory of the Congress.                
	The show continues                
	So Chander Mohan Bishnoi alias Chand Mohammad is back in the arms of Anuradha Bali alias Fiza Mohammad. It reminded me of Carolyn Wells (1862-1942) saying, He who loves and runs away may live to love another day. How true it is of this couple: Chander Mohan ditched his wife and family because he fell for Anuradha whom he saw briefly one morning in a fruit-juice parlour. Though he had been in love with other people before, it was love at first sight and the couples tryst with destiny. Truly had Mirza Ghalib spoken:        
	Ishq par zor nahin, hai yeh voh
  aatish Ghalib 
  Jo laagae na lagey aur bujhai na baney        
	There is no power stronger than love
  It is a raging fire
  Which ignited refuses to ignite
  When you try to dowse it,
  It refuses to go out.        
	So they threw all cautions to the wind and decided to tie the knot. Since Hindu law did not permit bigamy, they converted to Islam, which did. It is not likely that he got himself circumcized, as the healing would have delayed the consummation of the nikah. Then Chand Mohammad got cold feet. He returned to his first wife and family; then ditched both wives and fled to London. First he said that he had divorced Fiza by saying talaq three times on a long-distance phone call.         
	Then he changed his mind and said he had done no such thing and returned to her. Meanwhile, Fiza had taken her errant husband to court on charges of rape. It was the fury of a woman scorned. Now they are together again. What about bigamy? Nothing very wrong about it. Fiza is worth crimes worse than bigamy. If Karunanidhi, Jethmalani, Dharmendra and Raja Reddy can have two wives living under the same roof, why not Chander Mohan alias Chand Mohammad? Bless him and Anuradha alias Fiza for providing fodder for gossip-mongers in the deadly, dull, green town called Chandigarh.        
	Being in the limelight can be addictive. Oscar Wilde was right in saying, The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about. Mr and Mrs Chand Mohammed now must devise new ways and means to stay in the news. I suggest they make a film based on their affair titled The Path of True Love Never Ran Smooth.

	Ghanta asked his grandfather Natha Singh: Dadaji, what are you reading?        
	Natha: History.        
	Ghanta: But it is full of sexy poems.        
	Natha: For me it is history.

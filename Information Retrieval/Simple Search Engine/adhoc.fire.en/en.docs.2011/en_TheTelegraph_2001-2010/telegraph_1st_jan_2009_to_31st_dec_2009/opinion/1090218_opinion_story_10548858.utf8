                                                                                                                 NO DANGER                                                    
	The left-leaning political parties predictably condemned the changes in foreign direct investment norms and guidelines announced by the government last week. The concern appears to be over two things: a rule change that suggests that any firm with an Indian running it will be deemed to be domestic even if the majority of the beneficial ownership is foreign, and that almost all sectoral caps on FDI, even those in sensitive sectors, have been lifted. As the nation gets ready to move into election campaign mode soon, nationalist tendencies can often spill over dangerously into economics and business. Despite several changes in the last four or five years, FDI opponents do not appear to have noticed that the nature and dynamics of FDI inflows into India are changing. Most of the FDI today is vertical  where the investments are part of a global value chain, and where output here could be exported to another country as an input  and in services, rather than horizontal  where output is consumed mostly in the country of production  as in extractive industries and natural resources.         
	It is worth saying out loud: attracting foreign capital is necessary. Out of four sources, portfolio investment is not likely to come in, given global market conditions. Invisibles  mainly remittances by Indians working overseas  have been coming down, as Indians have also been affected by job losses in the United States of America, Europe and the Middle East. There has been a fall in services exports  especially software and related services  in the last three quarters. That leaves FDI. For those wary of FDI, let them not forget that once the investment has actually been made, the balance of bargaining power shifts to the host nation government. So India is not surrendering its sovereignty in any way. Those looking to invest in India are assured by Indias membership of the World Trade Organization and preferential trade agreements. Indias participation in these would bring any changes made in trade and investment policy to their review. If anything, Indias very signing on to these agreements is the commitment to more open and liberal trade and investment policies. The agreements also have mechanisms for companies that have invested in India to go to the WTO if India cannot justify going back on any policy changes. Foreign direct investment is stable investment. Even in the short-run dynamics of electoral campaigns, politicians should take the long view.

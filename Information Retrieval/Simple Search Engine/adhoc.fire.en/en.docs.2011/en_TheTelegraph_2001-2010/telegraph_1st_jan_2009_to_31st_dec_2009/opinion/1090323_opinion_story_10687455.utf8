The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Put an end to the war
                                                                                                                 PUT AN END TO THE WAR                              FIFTH COLUMN - GWYNNE DYER                                    
	The dancing on the streets in Pakistan after the latest political crisis ended may have been overdone, but the relief was genuine. Americans should be dancing on the streets too, because what has happened in Pakistan will probably force the United States of America to abandon its foolish anti-Pashtun war in Afghanistan. But since the Obama administration doesnt yet realize that it should stop that war, there were no celebrations in Washington.        
	It was pressure from Washington, as well as from the Pakistan army, that forced the president, Asif Ali Zardari, to back down. Washington did that to save Zardari from his own folly, for it still wants his loyal support in its war in Afghanistan, but he hasnt been saved for long. Zardaris reputation for corruption is unparallelled, and his political skills are minimal. These aspects of his character featured prominently in the recent crisis, which centred on his refusal to re-appoint the former chief justice, Iftikhar Chaudhry, who was dismissed by Pervez Musharraf.        
	Chaudhrys determination to enforce the law despite the Musharraf regimes corruption and contempt for the constitution became a rallying point for civilians demanding a return to democracy. His return to the supreme court was one of the founding principles of the coalition between Zardaris Pakistan Peoples Party and Nawaz Sharifs Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) but it didnt happen.        
	Zardari couldnt bring himself to do it. He was afraid that once Chaudhry was back at the supreme court, he would cancel the amnesty that had let Benazir Bhutto and him return from exile. He may have been right, since the amnesty was part of a deal in which the US tried to prop up Musharraf with a pro-American civilian government led by Benazir.                
	Bigger game        
	The protests got bigger, the army and the US told him to back down, and eventually he did. Chaudhry is back as the head of the supreme court, and the reins of government will probably pass to Nawaz Sharif within a year. So what?        
	Its good that Pakistanis have chosen democracy and the rule of law, even knowing how badly they have been deceived and disappointed by their politicians in the past. But there is something bigger going on here. A conservative, nationalist consensus is emerging that promises to transform Pakistani politics and to reject the countrys role as Americas obedient ally in the war on terror.        
	Almost nobody in Washington understands that the US is at war with the Pashtun ethnic group in Afghanistan. The Taliban are an almost exclusively Pashtun organization, and all the Pashtun-majority provinces in Afghanistan are in revolt against the foreign occupation, while all of the Tajik, Uzbek and Hazara-majority provinces are at peace. The US allied itself with the other minorities in order to drive the Taliban from power, but that meant driving the Pashtuns from power, and they are fighting to regain their share.        
	Every Pakistani understands this, because most of the worlds Pashtuns live on the Pakistani side of the border. Pakistans Pashtuns have been radicalized by the war in Afghanistan to the point where Taliban values now dominate in the western fifth of Pakistan as well. Taliban-style terrorist attacks in the rest of Pakistan are now an almost daily event, and lurking somewhere just below the horizon is the possibility of a unified, Islamist-ruled Pashtun state that would destroy the unity of both Pakistan and Afghanistan. Pakistanis will not let that happen, so the countrys acquiescence in the US war on terror, which has even extended to tacit permission for American drones to kill people in the Pashtun parts of Pakistan. Without Pakistans support, the Western war in Afghanistan will have to stop, and it is high time, too.

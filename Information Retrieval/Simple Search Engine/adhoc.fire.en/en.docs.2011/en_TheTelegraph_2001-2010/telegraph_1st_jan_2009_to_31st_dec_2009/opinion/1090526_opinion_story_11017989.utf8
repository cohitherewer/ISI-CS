	The rise of a national party was inevitable. Over the last decade in particular, having reared their heads on the political stage in 1977 to create a coalition of anti-Congress forces post-Emergency, regional parties tasted blood in the capital and spent the next few decades jockeying for bits of power, regardless of political positions or truly useful affiliations. Clamouring unabashedly for the perks of office at the Centre, some men and women forgot their base, ignored the reality of Bharat, allowed civil society norms to disintegrate, and lived in denial. Congress leaders too, post the Sitaram Kesri era, behaved in a similar manner, and thereby diluted the vote share of the party in many states. Senior leaders and general secretaries eagerly leapt into the new profession of political dalali laced with blackmail that became the methodology of what we called coalition politics. It was utterly debilitating for one billion energetic, skilled and entrepreneurial people across rural and urban India.        
	The recent behaviour of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, as they greedily jockeyed for cabinet berths in the government in the Centre, was a shameful instance of corrupt politics. Times are changing, so are the players and their aspirations. The kind of posturing indulged in by regional parties with marginal numbers wanting a share of the pie by misusing coalition demands through subtle, and sometimes blatant, blackmail, will soon come a cropper. Indians are sick and tired of such insults on their inherent sense of integrity and purpose. Indians want to be proud of their national leadership, and will protect themselves from this kind of crass opportunism. The more regional parties play personalized, non-national games, the faster they will be reduced to minority status. Thereafter, if they do not regroup and reinvent their fundamentals, they will enter the out-tray, and go into the bin of history.                
	Future resolutions        
	In contrast, the Congress stood firm on the issue of portfolio allocations, wanted the infrastructure and development ministries for themselves, and asserted their dominant role as by far the largest constituent, holding 206 seats, in the government. These have given them an edge in terms of credibility and respect. Regional satraps need to mature both intellectually and politically to prepare a blueprint for how they will deal with the Centre on their own terms, and for the good of their state, without bucking the partnership. Using numbers to arm-twist the government for self-aggrandizement is no longer appropriate or advisable, and very soon this will become unacceptable. The delivery of goods and services will soon begin to be ruthlessly assessed by voters, and players on the political stage will be made accountable. Fooling the populace, by using caste, community and faith, will not deliver votes any more. India has moved on from being a difficult adolescent to a young adult with firm aspirations.        
	The portfolios are interesting. There is a sense of continuity, which shows serious intent to deliver on the unfinished agendas. Critical ministries that deal with concerns of the poorer sections of the society remain with the lead party, the Congress, so that the various projects are accelerated and the results become apparent within this five-year term in office. No doubt, a working agenda, combined with the mood on the ground, will garner more support for the party and prepare a solid base for Elections 2012. During this period, the Youth Congress is bound to ensure a nationwide membership drive with a fresh band of foot soldiers to get a complete mandate for governance from Delhi. Coalitions at the Centre will hopefully ebb away as national parties replace those formations. Regional parties will continue to grow in the states, but national parties will compete for that space as well.

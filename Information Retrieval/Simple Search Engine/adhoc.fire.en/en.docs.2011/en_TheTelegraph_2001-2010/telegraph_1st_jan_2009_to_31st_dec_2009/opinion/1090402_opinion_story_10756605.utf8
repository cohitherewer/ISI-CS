The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | back from the dead
                                                                                                                 BACK FROM THE DEAD                                  NEHA SAHAY                              
	On Saturday last, Lhasa saw a grand celebration to mark Serfs Emancipation Day, a new national holiday instituted this year to mark the anniversary of the Chinese Communist Partys takeover of Tibet, or, if you like, the day when Tibets serfs were liberated. Sunday onwards, Lhasa will once again be open to foreigners. Reception work was suspended in March for the sake of travellers safety, the head of Tibets tourism said, adding, Tibet is harmonious and safe now,  well prepared for tourists. The current harmonious and safe Tibet is practically coming out of our ears. Last week, State-owned newspapers across the country carried an article titled, Treasuring the fruits of democratic reform: celebrating the 50th anniversary of the liberation of millions of Tibetan serfs. Ordinary Tibetans talked about their youth spent as serfs to senior lamas, the incessant drudgery and beatings, a time of darkness and ignorance. I considered myself dead then, one 83-year-old said.        
	Of course, all that changed when the Peoples Liberation Army descended on Tibet, bringing with it education, jobs, distributing houses and cattle. I had nothing before the Democratic Reform And then the good years began, said the old man. I feel my life is fulfilled. Another former serf had come all the way to Beijing to participate in a seminar on Serfs Emancipation Day, where the State-supported 19-year-old Panchen Lama was the chief speaker. My mother told me that as serfs, all that belonged to us were our shadows and footprints, said the 74-year-old  the same age as the Dalai Lama . The rest belonged to the lords. Wed just have to wait for a good fate in our next life. She hadnt accounted for the Communist Party. This is what I call a good life Beijing, the State leaders, Panchen. And a beautiful house back in Lhasa. Im happy. We all should be.                
	True picture        
	Its not as if the worlds view on Tibet finds no reflection in the official media. The few foreigners who have visited Tibet hold three impressions  one, it is beautiful; two, it is occupied by China; and three, Han Chinese culture has assimilated Tibetan culture. This wasnt a radical talking, but a senior foreign affairs official. Other than the first impression, the remaining two are false notions, he concluded, adding that the media must present the true picture. This official, incidentally, is also dean of the journalism school at the prestigious Renmin University.         
	Despite the surfeit of true pictures in the media, there are enough Chinese netizens drawing their own conclusions. While not buying the extreme Western views, what riles them is the suppression of Tibetan culture and religion by the Communist Party, which, says one scholar, is a betrayal of the promise made to the Tibetan government in 1951. Amid all these views, the one authentic voice is that of a Tibetan girl describing her experiences on the mainland. Introducing herself as a Tibetan who cannot speak the Tibetan language, she recalls being asked by a prospective employer whether Tibetans only washed twice in their lives. When her father died, her relatives who came from Tibet to mourn were told they couldnt light the customary butter lamps : We cant have that kind of feudal superstition here. Her sisters visit to a Tibetan temple had to be kept a secret, else her salary would have been deducted. This girl avoided wearing Tibetan clothes on the mainland; but, she revealed, so did her villagers back home. Forced to migrate to Lhasa, thanks to the deforestation wrought in Tibets countryside by mainlanders, they didnt want the Han Chinese who now dominated Lhasa to look down on them. What saddened her most was the lack of facilities on the mainland to learn Tibetan.

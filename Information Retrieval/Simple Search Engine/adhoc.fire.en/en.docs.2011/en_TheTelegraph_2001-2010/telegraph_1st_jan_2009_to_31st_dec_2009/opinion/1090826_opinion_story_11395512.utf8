	All the other passengers have gone, passed through immigration and customs without incident, but two US customs officers have taken the young South Asian man to one side. They make him open his suitcase, they make him take everything out and they spread it across the inspection table like entrails from a dead patient. As they feel through the mans possessions they grill him, one officer passing the ball to the other, interrupting each other sometimes, interrupting the passenger often, changing tack, moving through different gears of aggression and insult. The young man is nervous, eager to go out and meet his girlfriend who he has no doubt is now waiting for him with growing anxiety. At some point one of the officers asks the man what he does and he replies that he is a freelance journalist. The officer picks up a new diary the man has bought in London, during his stop-over. Journalist, hunh?, Yes, freelance. The Boston Irishman fingers the obviously fresh diary. So, is this for your thoughts? Can I read through this? The fact that the dairy has only one paragraph of very personal writing jotted during the flight from London makes the Asian man go cold. But then the sneer loading the word thoughts makes the mans blood boil. Sure. He shrugs. Whatever. The customs guys dont like this change of tone and they ignore the diary and ask the man to come to a separate room.         
	Inside the room, one of the officers lights up a cigarette and the man is grilled again, asked repeatedly whether he has any connection to the smuggling of drugs, whether he has any sort of illicit connections in the US at all. On the table in the interrogation room there is an unopened pack of surgical gloves; throughout the questioning there is a clear threat of an anal examination. Unsaid, but clearly stated is this: Not only will you answer our questions but you will be polite to the point of servility unless you want to provoke us further. Genetically unwise, the brown man stays with his seething anger but somehow keeps his English clean and crisp. Later, he will realize that his Indian accent had a double function: that of provoking the hard-wired ire of working-class American Irish against anything remotely English and posh, while simultaneously saving him from a search with extreme prejudice. The officers make the man take off his sneakers, one of them desultorily kicks the shoes over with his boot to see if they are loaded with contraband, but they stop at that. Clearly this passenger is less than slim pickings but theyve met their quota of people examined. Their afternoon coffee-break beckoning, the Uniforms ask the man to pack his bag and be on his way. As the Asian guy stumbles off with his suitcase, he feels like a stick of sugar-cane thats been put through the wringer. From behind him, one of the officers jovially calls out: Welcome to the United States!         
	Nearly twenty years later, this time Im at Chicago airport, again flying in from London. It is now three years after 9/11 and the immigration area is crawling with flak-jacketed soldiers with sub-machineguns. In the queue, Im just behind an old Sikh lady and a younger woman whos escorting her. I have a clear view of the treatment the old lady receives from the Uniform behind the desk. There is a finger-print scanner on the counter and the maa-ji is having a hard time figuring it out  instead of placing her palm flat she thinks she has to push a button and she jabs at the scanner with a finger. The escort tries to explain but shes not getting through, and the immigration man is losing his temper Tell her to place her hand on the scanner! She has to place her hand and fingers flat on the scanner! He snaps. Something, Im not clear what, is stopping the escort from taking the old ladys hand and placing it for her. The longer it takes the more shaken the old lady gets, and it continues. Finally, after seven or eight minutes of this, the quivering palm finds enough purchase on the glass to satisfy the thug stamping the passports.         
	I love being in America; I love my American friends; I am, once again, eager to get out and smell the gasoline clouds around the airport, to put my arms around the person waiting for me, but when my turn comes to face the officer I nearly give him a tongue-lashing. Luckily for him (and me) he has no questions and he processes me with minimum fuss. Collecting my suitcase, Im already humming dated rock nroll about summertime, open-top Mustangs and blondes, but my fun is waiting for me in the shape of a young dotard in customs uniform.         
	Is this your only item of baggage, srrr?         
	Yes.         
	Step this way please. Id like to ask you some questions.         
	I step that way and stand across a counter from the man. He starts asking me questions: the reasons for my visit, my profession, where Im planning to travel inside the country, etc etc. I answer as clearly and neutrally as possible. At some point he asks about my visa and I reach down to my pocket to pull out my passport.         
	Keep your hands on the counter where I can see them, srrr! Its not a good idea at all, srrr, to remove your hands from my sight!         
	As I comply, I look around me. I keep quiet but what I feel like saying is: You automaton. Here you are, armed with your lightweight, high-calibre handgun, here you are, surrounded by dozens of trigger-happy soldiers and their weaponry, here I am arriving from London which has some of the best security in the world, here I am, having passed through that security, having taken a transatlantic flight without incident. Now, what exactly do you think Im going to produce from my pocket when my hand goes out of your sight?         
	The question is irrelevant. The whole thing is, as always, about establishing control on the subject and maintaining humiliation. The man continues to question me, going through his formula of asking the same question in six different ways to see if my replies are inconsistent. At some point, I almost begin to enjoy the game, I feel like pointing out other, more clever, ways in which he could have phrased a particular question, but Im not being paid by the US government to train their frontline welcome-troops. The man goes through my suitcase till he comes across a copy of my novel. He is startled. Did you write this? He splutters. By this point Ive only told him four times, from four different angles, but each time in simple, easy-to-understand words that I am a novelist (and, yes, a freelance journalist) who writes books of stories. Clearly the man needed empirical evidence to release me and this he does with alacrity, especially once I match my face to the photograph on the back flap of my book. Youre good to go, srrr! Welcome to the Uniddstates!               
	If I was to look for signs of progress within US customs personnel, I could argue that the contempt that used to be attached to a man having a notebook for his thoughts has changed to some kind of (possibly quite misplaced) awe towards a person who has actually written a book, but Im not sure. The fact is, having written several fine books didnt protect Rohinton Mistry from harassment at US airports after 9/11 (beard); nor did being a former President of India protect Kalam from a vigorous frisking on his own soil (Abdul); nor did being world-famous protect our Khan One from the recent extended autograph session at Newark (that name, plus too chikna, so clearly recently clean-shaven, equal to extremely suspicious). Unlike, say, the airport authorities in the UK or Germany, the American border-buddies continue to be trained to defecate on anyone who they can possibly defecate upon. It doesnt matter who the president is, Reagan, Bush, Obama, it doesnt matter what the purported US foreign policy happens to be at the moment, it doesnt matter if the US mint has brought out stamps to honour Woody Guthrie or Muddy Waters, some things about the land of the free and the home of the brave dont change: if youre South Asian, if you have a beard, if your name contains an Islamic element, your first encounter with the United States of America is likely to come in the shape of an armed and uniformed man who is scared, illiterate, robotic, a man who is trained to be blinkered and trapped in extreme parochial boorishness.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A country ramble
                                                                                                                 A COUNTRY RAMBLE                          - Enclosure shapes what we know of nature in Britain today        TELLING TALES -   AMIT CHAUDHURI                                                        
	At Hay-on-Wye to play at the Brecon Jazz Festival, I found myself at the Rhydspence, where my wife and I had stayed on one of our visits to Hay  probably 15 years ago. The Rhydspence dates back to the 14th century, with characteristically uneven white and black walls; and Brecons only about 20 miles away. Id arrived a day early; the Jazz Festival would begin the following day. The inn was, for the moment  except for proprietor and staff  empty; and the day, wet to begin with, had turned into one of those afternoons that give much pleasure downtown, but which, in semi-rural Britain (I was now in Wales), emphasize a hinterland of quiet, a watchful stillness.        
	Summer time, stretching the day from June to September with an unfulfillable leisureliness, brings back, without the melancholy of the original observation, Wordsworths memorable phrase: earths diurnal course. So, when I decided to go out for a walk at half past six, to confront the stillness, it was unnaturally bright. It was about 30 hours since Id been in Calcutta; both nothing and a great deal seemed to have happened in the meanwhile; I felt no fatigue. I called my wife on my mobile; given that large swathes of the beautiful landscape around Hay offer no signal, I knew it would probably be our last conversation for now. It was close to her bedtime; she was watching television, about to fall asleep. I went up a narrow road that rose up a hill almost bang opposite the Rhydspence; at some point, the five small gradations of the signal disappeared consecutively, and the mobile became a dead weight in my palm. But Id already said Good night before silence and the day reasserted themselves around me.        
	The silence actually had a low undertone. On my right and left, Id passed two or three pert, nostalgically cocooned houses on the hillside, with a view, for the occupants on the right, of the hills, horizon, and panoramic fields. But the relationship between inner and outer worlds kept changing on that narrow road, so that at one point I was passing through a mournful avenue of trees, with light a photographic glare in the distance; and then I was out where there was a field on the left, and, on my right, no view, but dark undergrowth falling below, fenced in with frail wires, hinting, through the sound of a constant laundry-like drainage, at the movement of water.        
	The walk was making me feel despondent; it was starting to gather the lugubrious symbolism that country excursions have for me in England (and now, it seemed, in Wales). As usual, I felt shut out, and guided by an invisible but firm hand. Did it have to do with what Naipaul once called, in The Enigma of Arrival, his meditation on the Wiltshire countryside, the colonials raw nerves? That, if I remembered correctly, was a consequence of the glances of people on buses, on streets; but here, it was the landscape  not because of its wildness; there are few wild places left in Britain outside the inner city  with its reprimanding gaze. The strong guiding hand that had designed this  not Gods  was evident; it made me adhere to my path. Walter Benjamin said that getting lost in a city one knew was a skill  but, here, the countryside seemed not so much inhospitable to the wayfarer as to the idea of accidentally losing ones way.        
	I paused next to the open plot of tilled land on my left, undulating upward into the sky; I climbed towards its edge, where the hay had been twisted and rolled into a great confection, and from where expanses of green, carpet-brushed, rose up the incline. A few cows, like idols, stood in the distance; I checked the signal strength on my mobile. Nothing. It was now that I sensed a presence in the silence around me, something I was on the border of beholding, the sweating, buzzing stillness of summer like a declaration, and the heavy vacancy of the sky. Again  because everything was so composed  its not a making contact with the natural Im speaking of; it was like entering an old mansion, and becoming aware of a ghostly interloper in the drawing room  an intuition that makes you forget, momentarily, that its you who are the interloper. The intruder or guest will not go away, although theyve outlived their meaning and original function; theyre now simply waiting, again, to be discovered. The light on the field was unlike the light in India, where you hardly notice it; it was like a silvery pall on the earth.        
	This was not a moment I could have experienced in company; because my default mode, in the English countryside, is philistinism. In company in the midst of the English rural, you feel like a spectator in an art gallery, always being called upon to attend, by middle-class convention, to accredited wonders. For me, though, nature is not perfection, but disorder and the unexpected  and to find the natural in Britain in that sense one must go to the downtown areas of Newcastle and Edinburgh, and, in London, to districts like Camden Town, Angel, Hackney and Southall. There, the natural flourishes uncontainably, inextricable from the manufactured. Nature itself, in Britain, is too orderly; it is, often, manufactured.        
	That manufactured quality is both echoed and captured by Thomas Gainsborough; his landscapes, even when hes recording a disappearing rural England, have an artful composure. In this, hes different from his successor, John Constable, whom we unfailingly invoke when confronting an actual English landscape. And yet, beyond the pastel-like similarities of reality and representation, theres a slight mismatch between our experience of the landscape and our memory of Constable. Hes a connoisseur of the accidental detail, of the act of noticing itself; his paintings, spacious though they are, are all about secrecy  the eye providing the vantage-point is itself, you feel, hidden. Working in the heart of the imperialist age, Constables response to the world  and to imperialism  is almost a forerunner of modernism; it involves a new sort of regionalism, which, in the midst of colonialisms epic journeys, makes the familiar foreign, and the local appear undiscovered and distant. This view of the regional is crucial to modernisms way of assigning meaning; it informs the works of writers and artists in the American South, in Ireland, in Bengal; it suffuses Eudora Welty, Joyce, and Jibanananda Das. Constable, strikingly, is exploring that particular regional sensibility early on, through nature and, extraordinarily, through England  the impulse is very different, say, in George Eliot or the late Turner or even Wordsworth.        
	But the walk in Brecon didnt reveal Constables world to me. Instead, its taken me again to Gainsborough (picture), who was working from roughly the middle to the second half of the 18th century. And, in both his well-known capacities  as landscape painter and a painter of portraits  his response to the gathering energies of imperialism is surely palpable. His landscapes, even when they show obscure villages, have a premeditated calm; its as if England were already becoming iconic. But its his great portrait, Mr and Mrs Andrews, which must count as a prescient study of colonial power. The couple pose beneath a tree, flanked by their dog, Mr Andrews, his eyes unappeasable, with his hunting rifle. To the right are obedient bales of hay, behind, sunlight, clouds, and the gorgeous landscape that comprises the Andrews property. Gainsborough, here, has brought his refulgent gifts as a landscape painter to the bounded, mastered nature of the open. Long before the project of colonialism, the enclosure laws, from the 13th century onwards, became instrumental in segregating landscape into private property in England and Wales, becoming punitive around and after the time of this painting. Enclosure shapes what we know of nature in Britain today  what Tom Paulin calls that artificially natural world of thick hedges and rectangles which our ordinary experience tells us has been there, eternally.              
	That Gainsboroughs exploration of landscapes relationship to its human owners has a colonial bearing is brought to light in a later painting, Johann Zoffanys Warren Hastings and his wife. Zoffany, a contemporary of Gainsboroughs, was German, but spent decades in England as a portrait painter; and then found a market in India. Hastings and his wife (in possession of the Victoria Memorial) is a portrait of the couple under a tree, in their Belvedere estate, days before Mrs Hastings departure, the spaces of Alipore in the background. Its an undeniable reworking of the Gainsborough; a continuity is established between Englands enclosed landscape and the domain of India; only the dog (I know this sounds crass) is replaced by an Indian maid. I dont necessarily believe, following Edward Said, in, say, uncovering concealed West Indian plantations in the fiction of Jane Austen. But that there is a historical anteriority to what Paulin calls the glumness and suffocation we feel in much of the English countryside, theres no doubt. India, however, with its vague aleatoriness, its deceptive light, was, as the colonial watercolourists discovered, always going to be hard to enclose.

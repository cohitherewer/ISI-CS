	Another role        
	 A landowner filed a case against a builder at the State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission, Jharkhand. The commission directed the builder to pay Rs 11,03,737 to the landowner. When the builder appealed to the National Commission (established for the redressal of consumer disputes) against the order, the commission favoured the builder, stating that the owner was not a consumer and hence the case did not come within the ambit of the Consumer Protection Act. The owner then appealed in the Supreme Court. Allowing the appeal, the court held that since the agreement was not for a joint venture but for the construction of a residential building, and since the landowner was entitled to a certain percentage of the total area, he was a consumer and the builder was a service provider. The court remanded the matter to the National Commission for a fresh hearing. (Sujit Kumar Banerjee vs M/S Rameswaran amp; others)                          
	Rapist condemned        
	 In a case of rape, the trial court convicted the accused persons. In the appeal before the High Court of Uttarakhand, one of the accused persons said that the victims plea should not be accepted. He claimed that he had been falsely implicated, arguing that his name was not mentioned in the FIR. The high court dismissed the appeal. The Supreme Court held that the victims evidence was clear and cogent. She had categorically mentioned that a truck driver had raped her and had correctly identified him in the identification parade. The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction. (Mohan Chand vs State of Uttarakhand)                    
	Brother, so what?        
	 When the accused persons in a murder case were convicted, they raised the plea that the eyewitnesss evidence should not be accepted as he was the brother of the deceased. The Supreme Court held that the mere fact that the witness was a relative of the deceased did not establish that the accused persons were being falsely implicated. Nor did it mean that the charges against the accused persons were being fabricated. The court maintained that the evidence should be judged on its own merit, irrespective of who the witness was.

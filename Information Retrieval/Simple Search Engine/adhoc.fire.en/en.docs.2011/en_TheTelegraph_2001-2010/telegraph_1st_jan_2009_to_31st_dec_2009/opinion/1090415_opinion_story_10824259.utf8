The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | There is an   inspector   in my email
                                                                                                                 There is an   inspector   in my email
          The IT Amendment Act gives sweeping powers to the government and these affect the civil rights of ordinary citizens. Manjula Sen reports                          Total control: The new law allows the State to monitor all on-line activities of its citizens                                              
	In some quarters, it is being called the Indian version of Americas Patriot Act. Like the infamous act, it gives the government overarching powers to rummage around its citizens telephone, email and all other modes of technological communications.        
	The American law was enacted in the wake of the September 11 attacks in the US. Less than a month after the terrorist attacks in Mumbai last November, the Indian Parliament passed the Information Technology (Amendment) Bill 2008, giving the State the authority to go into peoples homes to watch, monitor and intercept all electronic and technological communication. With the Presidents assent in February this year, the IT Amendment Act 2008 passed into the statute books. The act covers massive ground, ranging from cyber terrorism, Internet censorship and child pornography to e-commerce, e-governance and data theft.        
	Although the law was rushed on the back of the Mumbai attacks, where the terrorists showed a propensity to use computers and the Internet, and a perceived rise in cyber terrorism, the catch-all act empowers the State to use its new surveillance and interception powers for any offence, which would include non-cognisable ones. Non-cognisable offences are non-criminal transgressions which require a court directive to investigate or arrest.        
	The net effect of this will be that almost all digital communication that people use in India would be amenable to interception and monitoring, irrespective of whether they are targetted or whether they are potentially involved in any criminal activities, says Pavan Duggal, chairman of the Associated Chambers of Commerce amp; Industrys Cyberlaw Committee.        
	What is striking is that the two year-old pending amendment bill to the original IT Act, 2000, was passed with 45 new sweeping amendments without any debate in Parliament. Members were busy working up a din over Central minister A.R. Antulays controversial remarks about the circumstances in which Maharashtra ATS chief Hemant Karkare was killed. The clauses of the bill were read out and the two houses passed the bill at the end of it.        
	Under the new act, the State through any government official or police can now eavesdrop on your emails, smses, phone conversations and all online activity. Unlike in the past, they will not even require a warrant to do so. And that is not all.        
	Earlier, only a deputy superintendent of police (or senior) could raid a home to search and seize. Now an inspector can raid and haul off a computer user for questioning  and without a warrant.        
	Lack of independent oversight makes these intercepting powers liable to misuse. Perhaps the most alarming aspect of the act is its failure to put in place a safeguard mechanism that would stop the State from misusing it.         
	Right now, neither is an ombudsman nor a law nor any other safety mechanism in place for redress. The act says checks and balances will flow from safeguards such as may be prescribed.        
	Says Yogesh Kamdar, vice-president of Peoples Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL), This act which vests a huge chunk of power without corresponding responsibility to record justification in writing has tremendous potential for abuse.        
	He says that spying on a person or group cannot be permanent. Issues such as whether mails or smses of the targets family members would be scanned, the context of the order and a review have not been addressed. Should the monitoring continue if nothing suspicious is found after several months?        
	Until the passage of the amended IT Act, Clause 5(2) of the Indian Telegraph Act of 1885 allowed phone tapping on grounds of public emergency, or for public safety. In December 1996, the Supreme Court reiterated this position in a petition filed by the Peoples Union for Civil Liberties.        
	Section 69 of the amended IT Act drops all references to public emergency or public safety. Combined with the absence of clearly defined checks against misinterpretation of the law, the new law effectively gives the government a carte blanche to check a citizens use of communication tools.        
	Moreover, the IT Act, 2000, was restricted to decryption of messages. Section 69 of the new act includes interception and monitoring.              
	Some also question its effectiveness. Ajai Sahni, executive director of the Delhi-based Institute for Conflict Management, doesnt knock the new act but argues that a law depends upon the mechanisms that are effectively put in place to implement it. At this moment, I dont see this capacity in the State to execute it. Where, for instance, are the technical personnel? The act provides powers for immediate post-event investigation like checking cyber cafes, or tracing an online message. But this is only a small tool.        
	To be truly effective, counter-terrorism measures need to be anticipatory. He continues, There is no preventive value that arises from this act with regard to cyber terrorism. Who, for instance, will monitor a large quantum of correspondence between several groups of people? Secondly, cyber forensics, or examining digital evidence, is still weak in our country. Until these capacities are developed, the act is of limited value.        
	In its expansiveness, the act impacts technological communication and utility, businesses such as call centres and the software industry, civil liberties such as the right to privacy and freedom of expression, and censorship. The new act also empowers the government to block any website on the grounds of national interest, which some argue could result in censorship.        
	It has provided enhanced e-surveillance power to the State without adequate safeguards to citizens. The language of various sections is lax and uncertain and would give rise to a lot of dispute, says cyber law expert and advocate Praveen Dalal.        
	Two new provisions in the amended act deal with sexually overt images. Section 67A covers a sexually explicit act and 67B child explicit act or conduct (child pornography). The fine and imprisonment for those engaging in pornography is between five and seven years, with a fine of up to Rs 10 lakh.        
	Critics welcome the clampdown on child pornography but fear that the wording of 67A and 67B will result in treating suppliers of porn and recipients as equally at fault. The act says whoever publishes or transmits or causes to be published or transmitted in the electronic form any material which contains a sexually explicit act or conduct shall be punished.        
	Other sections of the act mention that the government should formulate precautions to be taken for preventing the improper interception or disclosure of messages. There has been no move yet to initiate such safeguards.        
	Such huge powers of interception without any checks and balances are likely to have a detrimental impact upon the preservation of civil liberties of Indians after the passing of the IT Amendment Act, warns Duggal.        
	Caveat emptor.

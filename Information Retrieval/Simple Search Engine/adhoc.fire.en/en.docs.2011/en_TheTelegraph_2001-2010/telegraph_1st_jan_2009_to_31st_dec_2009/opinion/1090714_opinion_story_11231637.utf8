	The corrupt shall inherit the party. That is the message the Communist Party of India (Marxist) seems to have sent out to its leaders, especially those of the Kerala unit. That perhaps explains why the party found nothing wrong against the state unit secretary, Pinarayi Vijayan, while it dropped the chief minister, V.S. Achuthanandan, from the politburo. The feud between the two has been long and bitter, plunging the Kerala unit into vicious and open factional fights. The damage it has caused the party, however, remained its internal matter until the Central Bureau of Investigation was given the sanction to probe a major corruption charge against Mr Vijayan. True, the charge is yet to be proven and Mr Vijayan must be judged innocent unless proven guilty. But the CBI inquiry pushes the case from the CPI(M)s factional politics into the public domain. After all, the charge relates to the abuse of public funds and official power while Mr Vijayan was the states power minister. The least that the CPI(M) leadership should have done was remove him from the party post until he was cleared of the charge. That it did not do so shows the partys disregard for probity in public office. The partys judgment also reflects poorly on the judges.         
	By contrast, the punishment given to the chief minister smacks of closet politics. What is worse is that a veteran leader who has been punished for breaching party discipline has been allowed to carry on as chief minister. Double standards can hardly be more bizarre. It is easy, however, to see why the party leadership behaved in such an absurd manner. In simple terms, it is all about party games. As secretary of the Kerala unit of the CPI(M), Mr Vijayan controls the party organization. He is the typical boss of a Stalinist party and his will is law for the party. Punishing him could have been even more costly for the already demoralized party in Kerala. Mr Achuthanandan is more of a mass leader who, however, does not run the party machine. The CPI(M) leaderships uneven justice exposes once again the undemocratic nature of its organization, in which party apparatchiki lord it over elected representatives of the people. The action against the chief minister is aimed at tackling factionalism in the partys Kerala unit. It may end up doing exactly the opposite. But its worst fallout could be the public perception that party interests stand above public morality in the CPI(M)s scheme of things.

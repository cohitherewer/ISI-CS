                                                                                                                 GREEN BLOCK                                                    
	This is probably the best time for the chief minister of West Bengal to make oracular statements about the environment. While laying the foundation stone for a water-treatment plant in Dhapa, the chief minister has frowned upon the mushrooming of NGOs that are holding up the great work of urban development in the state with their litigious concern for the environment. (The mayor of Calcutta has echoed his indignation). The chief minister was probably unaware of the black irony of his timing. To hold himself up as rescuing development from the stranglehold of green litigation when he has just managed to pull off the poisoning of Calcuttas air on a rather grand scale is surely some sort of a masterstroke  although what exactly it is a masterstroke of remains to be seen. Not only in the repeated disregard of court orders on illegal autorickshaws, but also in several other spheres of civic life, the mix of indifference, cluelessness and populism that characterizes the governments attitude to matters environmental has made itself amply evident. Every kind of pollution, together with a consistently callous attitude to the citys greens, has made itself part of the traditional image of the city. More importantly, this has become inextricable from the brand of politics that the Left Front government has come to embody over the decades. As Greater Calcutta is burgeoning at an unprecedented rate, there is little indication that the chief minister has matched this growth with any sustained thinking through of the crucial relationships between development and the preservation of the environment. Of course, the dangerous levels of air pollution in Calcutta are evidence of indifference not only to the environment but also to human life.        
	What is particularly offensive about the chief ministers statement is the cavalier dismissal of NGOs and other voluntary organizations as hindrances to development-oriented governance. When the governments homes for mentally challenged children become places where children die of malnourishment, it is precisely these organizations that manage to infuse a modicum of humanity into these havens of state-sponsored inhumanity. And this is just one example. The chief minister can start his favourite activity of wooing investors only after he has worked out how his own people can live and breathe healthily.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Looking away from the throne
                                                                                                                 LOOKING AWAY FROM THE THRONE                                  GENERAL STRATEGY      Despite Pakistans coup-infested history, the chances of the army taking over power are slim                                                  
	Traditionally, the Pakistan army has never taken kindly to any civilian interference into issues such as perks, protocol, postings, promotion, command, control, recruitment and deployment. Thus, no civilian president or prime minister of Pakistan could ever come to grips with the army unless the chief was amenable to a subservient role vis--vis the civilian masters.        
	Seen in this context, the present army chiefs apparent subordinate role, despite the deteriorating political situation, appears refreshingly different. General Ashfaq Parvez Kayanis reticence has also forced the media to speculate whether the president, Asif Ali Zardari, is attempting a coup on army. The question is whether this can be considered feasible as a possibility. Moreover, what could be the outcome of such a development?        
	In the past, both Ayub and Yahya Khans appointments as army chief came on expected lines. The real drama began with the out-of-turn appointment of Zia-ul-Haq as the specially chosen army chief by Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto in 1976. In 1998, Nawaz Sharif made the same mistake by appointing Pervez Musharraf as the army chief, bypassing four senior officers in the process. Both Bhutto and Sharif would regret their personal choice later: Zia sent Bhutto to the gallows and Musharraf deported Sharif to Saudi Arabia.         
	Can Zardari then make a personal choice in 2009? To answer this question, one needs to appreciate the present ground reality. Today, Pakistans army finds itself overstretched for the first time in its history. But traditionally, the non-military head of state in Pakistan has invariably felt shaky in the presence of the garrison commander of Islamabad for the latters inherent ability to smash what successive army chiefs perceived as civilian incompetence and folly.        
	However, when Zardari was warned to pull up his socks by Kayani, it not only made for sensational news but also amounted to crass insubordination on the part of a serving army chief. It also exposed the presidents inability to keep a subordinate under control, thereby fuelling rumours about an impending coup.        
	However, the possibility of Kayani emerging as a coup-master in the future appears remote. Pakistan is in a severe crisis, and is facing flak from all corners for its inability to manage its economy, polity and security. From all accounts, Kayani, so far, appears to be a thinking man, which makes him fundamentally different from the impulsive Musharraf.        
	Military history shows that men in uniform, with impish and rebellious streaks in them, are unlikely to choose successors with similar traits. Far from it, they want stable, cold and calculating professionals who would take into account the various pros and cons before jumping into the fray.         
	There may be another reason behind Kayanis apparent reluctance to brazenly challenge the existing civilian establishment. Kayani hails from a humble background. His father was a junior commissioned officer from the cantonment town of Rawalpindi. Kayanis predecessors are also well respected for their fierce loyalty and their ability to defend the nation against foreign incursions.        
	A man with such a back ground would not like to overstretch the armys logistics, operations and capacities to a point of no return. As things stand today, the Pakistan army is still a Punjabi army, and, so far, Punjab has been the most stable, peaceful and prosperous of all the regions in the country. But with Nawaz Sharifs war cry, the political situation has deteriorated, raising fears that the army will take charge, albeit temporarily. But this seems unlikely. Kayani knows very well that modern Pakistan has become a hydra-headed monster, and that he would find it difficult to contain the rancour and violence with a disciplined force of only 550,000 men.        
	Critics may point to Pakistans coup-infested history to prove a point, but Kayani is unlikely to take over power. Kayanis priorities are India, maintaining the discipline and morale of the army, avoiding killing the Muslim fraternity of the Taliban and al Qaida, and monitoring the chaotic internal polity of the nation. It certainly would be a different matter if a coup dethrones Kayani from the post of army chief, or someone more powerful than him does the job that Kayani has failed to do so far. The unfolding of an extraordinary situation cannot be ruled out in Pakistan today.                          ABHIJIT BHATTACHARYYA

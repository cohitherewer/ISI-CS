                                                                                                                 BEATEN AGAIN                                                    
	Some extraordinary cruelties leave Indians peculiarly indifferent. Beating up, starving, or otherwise wounding minor domestic help is somehow part of Indian culture, even if it sometimes kills them or drives them to suicide. Without a self-indulgent complicity between administrative institutions and social opinion, especially of the respectable middle classes, the prohibition against employing minors in the domestic sector would not have failed so miserably. West Bengal is particularly good at such respectability. So the neighbours of the deputy inspector general of police (planning and welfare) had a hard time getting a complaint registered against the police boss when the little girl he had employed as domestic help was found weeping with wounds to her head. The policeman has denied the charge that he beat the child with a stick, and has claimed that her head was bleeding because she fell down when she was scolded. Predictably, he laid stress on the poverty of the childs family, as if asking her to stay in his house was an act of mercy. Almost every household employing minors would be sympathetic to this. For middle-class West Bengal, employing minors is a form of social work that should make physical, verbal and sexual abuse irrelevant.        
	It may be mildly shocking that a policeman has been allegedly caught out. But cases of violence against minor domestic workers have a very poor record of legal redress. Few get to court, for families are threatened or bribed into silence even if the victim is dead, and those which reach the court seem to linger for ever. Nobody gets around to the question  whether or not the employers are guilty of abuse  why they had employed a child at all. They are at least guilty of that. Central government employees are considered specially liable if they employ children. But where policemen ignore the law, there is little hope.

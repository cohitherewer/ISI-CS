                                                                                                                 IN A VIOLENT STATE                                  Abhijit Bhattacharyya                              
	The Maoist prime minister of Nepal, Pushpa Kumar Dahal or Prachanda, resigned from his post over differences with the president regarding the sacking of the army chief, Rookmangud Katawal. Although Prachandas attempt to dismiss Katawal from his post was aborted, his tiff with the president nevertheless forces one to focus on the turmoil brewing in Nepal that is affecting both the military and the Maoists.        
	From all accounts, the military has never been looked upon favourably by the Maoist ex-rulers of Nepal owing to the persistent civil war-like situation in the country during the past decade. The situation got more complicated with the attempts of the Maoist leadership to integrate its Peoples Liberation Army with the national army. It is a unique situation, hardly faced by any other south Asian country.        
	It is important here to analyse the psyche of the Maoists, who were till recently the rulers of Nepal. Like some of the Indian comrades, the ultra-Left leaders of Nepals Maoist party seem to be enchanted by the 20th-century Chinese communist movement, with its twin tactics of capturing the countryside to block access to the cities and using violence against the allegedly corrupt organs of the State run by the monarchy, which lords it over the poor people.        
	Understandably, therefore, the monarchy and its army were high on the agenda of operation dismantle of Nepals Maoists, who spread their tentacles slowly but steadily following comrade Mao Zedongs famous saying  All political power comes from the barrel of a gun. The situation became suddenly more complicated with the resignation of Prachanda, and as the president restored the rank and status of the sacked army chief. The situation in Nepal seems to bear an uncanny resemblance to that in Pakistan.                 
	Turbulent days        
	In Nepal, however, unlike in Pakistan, the army chief still is in the background and maintains a low profile in the midst of a complicated power struggle for supremacy among various political parties. To be fair to the Nepalese Maoists, one has to remember that they have, over the years, emulated the Chinese way of political movement, capturing the rural belt to subjugate the perceived landed gentry, the military and the urban middle-class.        
	The class divide between the Nepali Maoists on one hand, and the monarch and his military on the other, was all too visible. And so was the inherent hostility between the two. Since Nepal is a landlocked country with limited space for its people, the antagonism between the military and the Maoists greatly affected the rural catchment areas from where the soldiers of the state army are recruited. So much so, that perceptive observers of the Nepalese polity clearly discerned the class division between the superior and the subordinates in the military. In 2005, an ex-foreign minister of Nepal, C.P. Bastola, remarked, the upper echelons of the Royal Nepal Army consist of the traditional nobility  the Ranas, the Shahs, the Pandeys, the Basnets and the Thapas. The real fighting forces comprise the have-nots and they want peace.        
	The present-day Maoists of Nepal appear to have a pathological hatred towards both its national army and those Nepali soldiers, also known as Gurkhas, who fight for the British and the Indian army far away from their own borders. Little wonder then that the Maoist leader, Baburam Bhattarai, thundered thus in April 2008 when his party assumed power, Such obnoxious practices  as your citizens joining foreign armies as mercenaries  this will be stopped. It seems that the turbulent days for the Maoists, the military and the Gurkhas in foreign military-mercenary service are far from over.

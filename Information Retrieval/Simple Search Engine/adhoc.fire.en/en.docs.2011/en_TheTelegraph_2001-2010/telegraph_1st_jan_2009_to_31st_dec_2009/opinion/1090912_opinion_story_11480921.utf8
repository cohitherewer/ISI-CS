The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Fact into fiction
                                                                                                                 FACT INTO FICTION                              Ananda Lal      Theatre                President Obama rsquo;s accession should erase hard times for American artists, who stood by his candidacy en masse. Unluckily for them, though, the recession bit into the American pie, with the result that arts funding has not changed greatly since the old regime. How does this affect Calcutta rsquo;s culture vultures? We still hope for American budgets as in the good old days which permit the India tours of a full-scale stage production or a top-notch jazz combo. Until the Gandhi-inspired president okays that, however, we in Gandhi rsquo;s poverty-stricken land must remain content with one-man shows and the occasional third-string band.
  This doesn rsquo;t mean that Josh Kornbluth rsquo;s solo act at American Center was inferior, just that American theatre has a huge range to offer, of which the monologue forms one small portion. Quixotic Project rsquo;s Citizen Josh presented a novel variation, the autobiographical monologue, recounting Kornbluth rsquo;s attempts to complete his BA thesis at Princeton University, due since 1980. He suffered a mental block that prevented him from carrying it through to the finish, and his performance traced the multifarious aspects of his life during the last three decades as he alternately evaded and confronted the thesis. Apparently portraying an ordinary man rsquo;s journey, it turned into an elegantly crafted work that touched important concerns from family to education, civil rights to environment, ultimately becoming a tribute to participatory democracy mdash; Kornbluth rsquo;s thesis topic.
  Unobtrusively, he accumulated the evidence for the power of positive persuasion. His months-premature younger brother, written off by doctors, surviving because his father believed in the force of human touch. His supervisor (the famous political scientist, Sheldon Wolin) and the Dean of Princeton, both of whom had the large-heartedness to encourage, not penalize him. The illustrative example of Elizabeth Eckford, the black girl who went to school despite heckling by her own white townspeople in 1957. The ability to rationally convince a neighbourhood committee of the need for a children rsquo;s playground, which it had initially opposed, disapproving of the ldquo;loud noise rdquo; that kids make.
  All this Kornbluth achieved with a John Doe personality and conversational humour that made us wonder if we could sift fiction from fact. This simplicity of storytelling, no doubt fine-tuned by director David Dower, was matched by the near absence of props and only a few slide projections of locales, notably the rusted-metal jungle gym (picture, background) that Kornbluth learns was constructed by Berkeley students to begin the Free Speech movement of the 1960s. The image, and the production, vindicate nonviolent radical activism.

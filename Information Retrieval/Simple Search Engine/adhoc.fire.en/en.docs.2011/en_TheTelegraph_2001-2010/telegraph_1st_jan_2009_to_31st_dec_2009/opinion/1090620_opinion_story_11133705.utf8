The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | too late, too slow
                                                                                                                 TOO LATE, TOO SLOW                                                          
	There may be some irony in a government that proudly upholds the red flag sending a police force to suppress a rebellion in a place called Lalgarh or red fort. That expedition, from all accounts, is not meeting with any remarkable success. After nearly 24 hours, not a single area is free of insurgents. Clearly, the situation is quite outside the control of the state government. The latter has only itself to blame for its present sorry plight. Insurgency in Lalgarh has had a prolonged gestation. With all the intelligence at its disposal, the government of West Bengal, by design or otherwise, did nothing to abort the growth or to address the issues that have allowed so-called Maoists to strike roots in the most deprived parts of the state of West Bengal. The chief minister of West Bengal, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, like Nero of old, has sat back and has allowed Lalgarh to burn.        
	It is impossible to comprehend this inactivity on the part of a chief minister who belongs to the Communist Party of India (Marxist). Mr Bhattacharjees loyalty to his party and to communism is above question. It would not be unfair to him and to the CPI(M) to suggest that his role models are those who occupy a hallowed place in the pantheon of international communism  Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, Josef Stalin and Mao Zedong. The records of these heroes in suppressing rebellion should be instructive reading for Mr Bhattacharjee  not that he is unaware of this history. To cite a few instances. Lenin had no hesitation in ordering the troops in 1921 to attack the rebellious Kronstadt sailors who at one time had been the most steadfast supporters of the Bolsheviks. Stalin, during the great terror of 1937-38, liquidated some two million people; he also had Leon Trotsky, his great rival and critic, pursued across continents to have him eliminated in Mexico. Maos use of violence during the Cultural Revolution in China and at other times has become part of revolutionary lore. Mr Bhattacharjee is a claimant to a rich legacy. That he hesitates and procrastinates has more to do with lack of courage and political will than with pangs of conscience. Even his predecessor in West Bengal did not hesitate to kill thousands in Marichjhampi. Mr Bhattacharjee rather enjoys the mantle of governance but without the attendant responsibilities. Hence the bizarre paradox of a communist leader behaving like a bleeding-heart liberal.        
	The problem is that not even a liberal head of government can afford to dawdle in the face of an insurgency. It is imperative on the part of a government to establish its authority over the territory under its jurisdiction. The quicker it does so, the more effective is its authority. The government has allowed the situation to grow into alarming proportions instead of curbing it when it was small. Having begun the counter-attack, belatedly, it should not drag its feet. If necessary it should take the help of the army.

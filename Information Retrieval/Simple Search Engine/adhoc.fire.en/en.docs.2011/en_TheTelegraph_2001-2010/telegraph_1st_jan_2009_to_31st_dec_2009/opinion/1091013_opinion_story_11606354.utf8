                                                                                                                 TOO CLOSE                                                    
	The three closely-paced terror attacks in Pakistan  targeting a United Nations office in Islamabad, a Peshawar marketplace, and then the army headquarters in Rawalpindi  point to an established truth. There is a syndicate of terror at work that cuts across national boundaries and even national interests. The last is what the daredevilry in Rawalpindi proved most emphatically. The militants who stormed the general headquarters of the army drew their resources from terror groups that Pakistan has so long either patronized or tolerated. Unfortunately, this is not a truth Pakistan is unfamiliar with. Earlier attacks on the headquarters of the Inter-Services Intelligence and on a paramilitary training centre near Lahore have made this clear. If Pakistan has ignored this knowledge repeatedly, it is because of its warped notions of how to maintain a regional balance of power. It has used the Afghan Taliban to retain strategic depth in Afghanistan and to minimize Indias influence in that country. The two bombings of the Indian embassy in Afghanistan bear this out as much as Pakistans refusal to flush out militants from its borders with Afghanistan. Within its own borders, it has supported terror groups to promote jihad in Kashmir and keep its borders with India perpetually in a flux.         
	The mounting violence that Pakistan has been witnessing is the pitfall of this policy. Terror groups have gradually reached out to one another and established networks, strengthened as much by ethnic and religious bonds as by adversity. Pakistans pogrom for the decimation of selective groups of militants (targeting only those menacingly anti-national) is one such circumstance. The greater the success of this operation, the greater the backlash from militant ranks. The present spate of violence is the Talibans answer to the Pakistan armys intensive operation on the north-western borders that killed the Taliban leader, Baitullah Mehsud. His successor, Hakimullah Mehsud, eager to claim leadership in the face of severe contest from his rivals, has stepped up the offensive to leave a mark of his daring.         
	Given the preoccupations of the newly emerging leadership of the Pakistan Taliban, the militants cannot conceptualize how unceremoniously they are forcing the hand of the Pakistan authorities. The Pakistan interior ministry has already indicated that the Rawalpindi operation leaves no option for the administration but to go where it had so long been unwilling. Pakistan will now have to carry its war not only into South Waziristan (and Quetta and Muridke as stipulated by the Kerry-Lugar bill), but also perhaps into Punjab, where the Taliban links have spread. That might entail a different kind of war between the army, which cultivates anti-India linkages here, and the civilian leadership, which is forced to prioritize welfare over war by its international donors.

                                                                                                                 LONDON BRIDGE                                                           
	Congregations generate confidence. The latter emotion is crucially lacking today across the globe, and this aggravates the recession by perpetuating pessimism. In this context, the G20 meeting, where the leaders of the worlds most important and powerful nations came together, is not without significance. The claim of Gordon Brown, the British premier, that it was the day the world came together may have been slightly exaggerated, but that could be pardoned under the circumstances. The enormity of the crisis facing the world cannot be denied; what is equally undeniable is that the crisis is not merely an economic one. It has political, social and even psychological dimensions. The facts that world leaders came together to cogitate and then decided to put a plan of joint action on the table are reassuring developments in an ambience in which people have had very little to feel secure and confident about. It would be silly to take the cynics view that summits like this one are useless and irrelevant.        
	The G20 meeting had the initial advantage of low expectations, which by itself was a reflection of the pervasive mood of pessimism. The most important problem that engaged the leaders was quite obviously that of rejuvenating the global economy and thus instil a modicum of faith among investors and bankers. But this should not overshadow other matters that occupied some of the leaders. The most important of these was probably the dialogue between the Americans and the Russians about reducing their nuclear weapons stockpiles. The G20 nations are also committed to arriving at an agreement at the United Nations climate change conference in Copenhagen in December. These are no mean achievements. What, however, is of nodal importance is the unanimous admission in the G20 that the crisis can only be met and resolved jointly and through collective action. Mr Brown deserves the credit for the initiatives he took to make this meeting possible and successful. This is not to suggest that there are no differences and divisions. European countries, especially Germany, remain suspicious of too much deficit spending as the engine to drive a global recovery. There was a common understanding, however, to break the vicious cycle of what the economist, A.C. Pigou, called the errors of undue pessimism. The world is now paying the price of the errors of undue optimism (another Pigou phrase); it should not veer to its exact opposite.        
	One factor in relieving the suffocating gloom of pessimism could be the style and personality of the American president, Barack Obama. After the bullying tactics of his immediate predecessor, the diplomacy and the disarming honesty of Mr Obama mark a welcome change. The London conference was Mr Obamas international debut. It could also mark the beginning of an era of change.

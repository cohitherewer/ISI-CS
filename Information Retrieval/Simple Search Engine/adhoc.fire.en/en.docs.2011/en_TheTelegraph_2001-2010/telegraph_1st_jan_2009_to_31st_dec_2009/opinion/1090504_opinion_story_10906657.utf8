                                                                                                                 PROFIT OVER PEOPLE                                  Fifth Column - Gwynne Dyer                              
	At the time of writing, almost a week after we all learned that a lethal new strain of influenza had appeared in Mexico, every single death attributed to swine flu has been Mexican, and all but one of those deaths happened in Mexico itself. (The one exception was a Mexican toddler visiting Texas with his family.)        
	Our elders and betters assure us that a travel ban would not help. The World Health Organizations assistant director-general, Keiji Fukuda, tells us that trying to contain the virus by enforcing travel restrictions is not a feasible option. Besides, he says, the virus has already spread to several other countries. The Texas governor, Rick Perry, says that closing the American border with Mexico, crossed by tens of thousands each day, would be a little premature.        
	Am I alone in experiencing a desire to strangle these people? To begin with, Rick, you either close the border now, or you dont bother. Closing it a week from now would be completely pointless. If human-to-human transmission of the virus has not already taken root in the United States of America, it will certainly have done so once another few hundred thousand people have crossed the border.        
	It may be too late to stop the spread of the virus by banning non-emergency travel to and from Mexico, but nobody knows that for sure. The virus has already appeared in a dozen other countries, but at this point almost all the victims are still people who were recently in Mexico. If the flow of further people from Mexico dwindled rapidly as the remaining tourists and business travellers came home, there would still be a chance of containing the virus. If this swine flu really is like the Spanish influenza virus that killed tens of millions of young adults in 1918-19, then we should be doing everything possible to hold it at bay. And even if the virus is bound to get out of Mexico in the end, its worth winning some time before it does.                
	Open disaster        
	It is spring across the northern hemisphere and flu typically goes into retreat in the spring and summer. Even if it comes back in the northern autumn  and pandemic flu often comes in several waves some months apart  by then we might have a vaccine ready. The process of designing and mass-producing the vaccine takes four to six months, which is exactly what immediate and severe restrictions on travel to Mexico now might win us.        
	So why do government bureaucrats everywhere assure us in massed chorus that travel bans are futile? Because they work for governments whose economies could be severely damaged by those bans. Governments do accept a certain responsibility for protecting their citizens, but even in the developed world they interpret that responsibility quite differently: Britain and France have stock-piled antiviral medicines for 50 per cent of their citizens, Japan, Australia and New Zealand are over 40 per cent, but the US only has 25 per cent cover and Canada 17 per cent.        
	The biggest difference is between the vague, general responsibility that governments feel for the lives of their citizens and the acute, real-time responsibility they feel for the health of their economies. They are inundated daily by demands from commercial and industrial organizations to keep the borders open and commerce flowing. So they yield to the pressure, as governments generally do. And they lie routinely about the usefulness of stopping travel from infected countries, because to do so would gum up international commerce, and damage economies.        
	The less reflective ones may not even realize that they are lying, because within WHO and the various governments it has become an article of faith that you cant contain pandemics once they move beyond the first few villages. But that is quite obviously nonsense that could kill your kids.

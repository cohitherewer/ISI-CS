          VISUAL ARTS: Somak Ghoshal                                                        
	It is easy to confuse any of Bageshree Duttas works with those of Ramananda Bandapadhyay, so steeped she is in her mentors signature style. Duttas recently concluded solo exhibition at Galerie Karma (December 14-20) displayed coy women, frolicking deities, lascivious babus, familiar village scenes and dim landscapes that recalled not only Bandapadhyay but also the crme de la crme of the Bengal school.         
	The interplay of light and shade in Rabindranath, Abanindranaths feel for composition and the spindly-eyed beauties of Jamini Roy are all-pervasive in Duttas pristine vision of rustic and urban lives. Her technique is accomplished, and it is evident that she has internalized the visual language of a bygone era with great deliberation. In a brief note to the exhibition, Ramananda Bandapadhyay warmly praises Duttas true understanding, and skilful adaptation, of the traditional patachitra.        
	However, Duttas self-conscious attempt to perpetuate a particular tradition may restrict the ambit of her creativity. After all, traditions are meant to be explored, departed from and even overturned. To do full justice to her own talents, Dutta should step beyond the line that she has chosen not to cross so far.

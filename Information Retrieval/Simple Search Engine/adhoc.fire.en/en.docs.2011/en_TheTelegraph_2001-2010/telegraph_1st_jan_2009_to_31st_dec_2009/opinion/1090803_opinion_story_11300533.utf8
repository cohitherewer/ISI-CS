	It was a triumph of democracy. On July 25, in a free election, Iraqs Kurds finally elected a real opposition party to their regional parliament. According to preliminary results, the Change Party won 25 of the 111 seats in the parliament, breaking the monopoly of the autocratic traditional parties. But this suggests that Iraqs Kurds are going to lose again. Lose, that is, in terms of their maximum ambitions as defined by their leaders over the past 20 years. Those ambitions included an independent Kurdish State in what is now northern Iraq, or at least a region so autonomous and self-sufficient that it would be independent for all practical purposes. And for the government of that region to be self-sufficient economically, it had to control the oil-producing area around the city of Kirkuk.        
	Achieving these ambitions required unshakeable unity, for the Kurds are only six million of Iraqs 30 million people, and neither the Arabs of Iraq nor their other neighbours, the Turks and the Iranians, like the idea of a Kurdish State. The outcome of this months election shows that that extraordinary unity among the Kurds is now fading fast.        
	It is fading partly because younger Kurds are fed up with the corrupt and oppressive rule of their traditional leaders, who have dominated Kurdish affairs for more than a generation. So long as independence, or something very like it, was the long-term goal, the traditional leaders could demand and get the obedience of most Kurds: unity came before everything else. But now that a measure of stability is returning to Arab Iraq, the prospect of independence is getting less and less likely  and there is even the dawning suspicion that the Kurdish Democratic Party-Patriotic Union of Kurdistan alliance has left it too late to take control of Kirkuk. In that case, whats the point of leaving them in charge of everything?                
	Fair share        
	The Change Party came out of a split in the PUK, and it won almost half the votes in Sulaymaniya, the home province of Jalal Talabani, founder-leader of the PUK. Dissatisfaction with the current system is just as great in the rest of Kurdistan, and the KDP-PUK alliance could have lost the whole election had there been a similar revolt within the KDP.        
	In due course, there probably will be such a revolt, because Kurdistan is going to spend the next several years as part of Iraq. That is the reality that Kurdish politics is gradually adjusting to, and one striking sign of the change is the fact that the July 25 election was not accompanied by a referendum on a new Kurdish constitution, which declares oil-rich Kirkuk and a number of other disputed areas to be historically and geographically part of the Kurdish homeland. Baghdad said no and the outgoing Kurdish parliament meekly accepted the decision, voting to postpone the referendum indefinitely. That is the new reality in Iraq.        
	In retrospect, its clear that the only time when the Kurds might have achieved their maximum ambitions was just after the American invasion of 2003. But fearing a clash with America, they did not seize Kirkuk and ensure an overwhelming Kurdish majority there when they had the military power to do so. Fearing a Turkish invasion, they did not dare declare independence. Now they cant do either, for Iraq has a functioning army again and Kurdistans whole budget depends on oil revenues sent north by the government in Baghdad.        
	This is not necessarily a tragedy. A prosperous, democratic, secular Kurdistan, using its own language and running its own institutions, within a rather less democratic and more theocratic Arab-majority Iraq that hands over a fair share of oil revenues and leaves the Kurdish minority alone, would be an outcome beyond the wildest dreams of the previous generations of Kurds. It is still within reach, if the bitter question of Kirkuk can be finessed  and it doesnt need powerful Kurdish leaders at all.

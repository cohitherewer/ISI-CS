The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A puppet dancing to the tune of democracy
                                                                                                                 A PUPPET DANCING TO THE TUNE OF DEMOCRACY                                  Six days before the elections in Maharashtra, Uddalak Mukherjee spoke to Kalawati Bandurkar in an attempt to fill the gaps left in the many reports about her change of mind                                            
	Six days before October 13, the day of elections in Maharashtra, I travelled to a village in Yavatmal, in the east-central part of the state, to meet Kalawati Bandurkar. On the three-hour journey from Nagpur to Jalka  the village that is home to this widow from Vidarbha  I reflected on what I knew of Kalawati. My knowledge was entirely based on what had appeared in the media ever since Kalawati had decided to file, and then withdraw, her nomination papers from Wani.         
	This is what I knew of Kalawati till then. Rahul Gandhi had visited Kalawati in June 2008, three years after her husband, Parshuram Bandurkar, committed suicide. The crop had failed, leaving him and his family in heavy debt. Later, in a trust-motion speech in Parliament, Rahul Gandhi had pledged his support for the Indo-US nuclear deal by stating that the agreement would improve the lives of women like Kalawati. The rousing speech catapulted Kalawati into the national consciousness. Bindeshwar Pathak, the founder of Sulabh International, announced that the non-governmental organization would provide Kalawati with a fixed deposit of Rs 30 lakh. The sum would help Kalawati earn a monthly interest of Rs 25,000 for 20 years.         
	This year, in the month of September, it was reported that Kalawati had agreed to contest the state elections. She was given a ticket by the Swatantra Bharat Party, and the Vidarbha Janandolan Samiti, led by Kishore Tiwari, supported her candidacy. However, Kalawati fell ill and withdrew from the fray soon after. Apparently, her son-in-law had threatened to commit suicide if she decided to fight the polls. It was also reported that Kalawatis withdrawal may have been brought about by intense pressure exerted by her political opponents as well as by her benefactor.        
	The media seldom reveal the entire truth. Facts are often published selectively, and questions are left unanswered. For instance, it has been reported that Kalawati is a puppet who is only too willing to dance to a tune set by others. And that she is selfish, for she has refused to share the money given by Sulabh with the 15 other widows of Jalka. Hours later, as I chatted with Kalawati in a bare room dominated by a single cot, my mind grappled with queries that had gone unanswered in the official reports. Kalawati may have been a puppet indeed, but do we know enough about the circumstances that led to her transformation? Can privileged city-dwellers, including journalists and members of the political class, imagine what an assured monthly income of twenty-five thousand rupees means to a widow mired in debt and struggling to bring up a large family? Moreover, do they have a right to comment on what this woman chose to do with her legitimate wealth? Or for that matter, are they aware that unexpected prosperity can change the aspirations of people who have suffered years of hunger and deprivation? All afternoon, Kalawati and I sat weaving together bits and pieces of her life. Soon I could glimpse the patterns of an old story unfolding differently. This then is Kalawatis story, as she wants the world to know it.         
	Kalawati was born in Bhallar, under the Wani block, to a family of farmers. After her marriage, she shifted to Sonegaon in the Chandrapur district, but returned to Jalka after her family lost their meagre plot in a series of litigations. In 2005, her husband died, after which she led a life that was similar to that of the other widows in the region. Having no land of their own, these women raised crops on rented tracts. Known as batai in Marathi, this system of labour involved raising loans from local moneylenders at exorbitant rates.         
	But Kalawatis life did change one June morning. She had a visitor, a fair-skinned young man, who introduced himself as Rahul Gandhi. When she continued to stare at him, unable to comprehend the significance of those words, he told her that he was Sonia Gandhis son. This was when Kalawati realized that he was no ordinary visitor. Rahul asked Kalawati about her problems, listened to her patiently, refused to step inside the hut or drink the water that was offered, and left after assuring her that he would see what could be done. Soon after, Kalawati received the news of Pathaks generous offer.               
	During our conversation, Kalawati repeatedly said that she was indebted to Rahul Gandhi. Yet it was evident that she knew how lucky she had been. Had the Congress leader walked past her house, the first that one sees while entering Jalka, she would have remained unknown and in penury.        
	After the polls were announced, Kishore Tiwari of VJAS called her one night and asked her to contest. Kalawati refused his offer, but on a visit to a local market in Pandharkawada, she discovered to her horror that Tiwari had announced her name as a candidate from Wani. After a local newspaper reported her unwillingness, she was bundled to Nagpur and made to tell the eager media that she was contesting voluntarily.         
	What had happened on that day in Nagpur, I asked, and why had she lied? Kalawati answered that all she remembered of that day were the sound of flashbulbs, and the difficult questions that she was made to answer. She could not tell the truth, not at that point of time, because she had found it difficult to defy Tiwary publicly. She was (and still is) a member of VJAS, and Tiwari is a powerful figure. Tiwari had also offered Kalawatis son-in-law one lakh rupees to get her approval. When he failed, the terrified man told Kalawati that he would have to choose death over life. This fact was later tweaked by Tiwari, who cited it as the reason behind Kalawatis withdrawal.         
	September 25 was the last day for filing nomination papers. The night before, Tiwari and his supporters got Kalawati admitted to a hospital in Yavatmal against her wishes. She was administered saline, although she knew that she was not seriously ill. The following day, instead of taking her back to Jalka as promised, she found herself in Wani where she was asked to file her nomination. Only then was she allowed to return to Jalka.         
	While Tiwari cajoled and threatened to get her to run for the election, Kalawati was also under pressure to refrain from a contest that would pitch her against the Congress on a turf that was once considered the partys bastion. In a letter dated September 19, a copy of which I was shown by Kalawati, Bindeshwar Pathak asked her to stay away from politics. I scribbled a few lines from that letter on a pad, and they go like this: Because God cannot descend down on earth in physical form, he incarnates [sic] in form of a human being to mitigate the sufferings of mankind. For you Rahul Gandhiji is just like God. The letter may be couched in entreaties, but there is no missing its real intent. Kalawati did not miss the not-so-subtle hint either. She announced that she will not fight the elections on September 29, the last day for the withdrawal of nominations, fearing that the financial support will be withdrawn.              
	Kalawatis retelling of her own story may not differ radically from the media reports. But it certainly fills some crucial gaps: none of the reports I had read mentioned Pathaks letter or its content. Tiwaris coercive tactic  getting Kalawati admitted to hospital without informing her family, for instance  and his offer of money to her son-in-law had also gone unreported.         
	Kalawatis version, however, needed to be corroborated, and I decided to cross-check the information with two others. One of them, Abhay Moghe, who works for the Gramin Samassya Mukti Trust in Jalka, has no stake in this chain of events. He said that Kalawati was speaking the truth. The other person was Kishore Tiwari, and I caught up with him after tailing his milky-white campaign vehicle for a while near Pandharkawada. Tiwari made me sit in his vehicle that had this slogan embossed on it: Deva ne dhadla garivcha manus (God has sent me to help the poor). He admitted that Kalawati had never been interested in elections. I reminded him of his repeated assurances that she was contesting out of her own free will, but he seemed not to hear me, although the blaring loudspeakers were some distance away. He blamed his opponents  the Congress, the Shiv Sena and the Bharatiya Janata Party  for engineering Kalawatis pull-out. I had just enough time to ask him whether he considered himself responsible for changing Kalawatis life unalterably. With a dismissive wave, he said that in politics, the end justified the means. After stepping out of the vehicle, I saw something that was as remarkable as his words. Babytai Bais, the woman who had replaced Kalawati in Wani, stood greeting some people by a roadside tea stall. The men responded by shouting slogans in Tiwaris name.         
	Kalawatis story, real or abridged, is important because it exposes three critical failings in Indias democratic structure. First, our democracy arguably entails free elections, but it seldom safeguards the free will of the poor who may find themselves saddled with great responsibilities. Second, the attempts to portray Kalawati or Babytai as knowledgeable representatives of the agrarian crisis can only be considered cynical and illegitimate.         
	Earlier, I had spoken to Sanjay Deshmukh, the collector of Yavatmal, the worst-affected district in Vidarbha, and he told me that 1,674 suicides have taken place among farming families in the last nine years. Of these 1,043 deaths were found to be unrelated to issues such as loan or crop failure. This year, the suicide figure stands over 70, but all of them cannot be labelled farmer suicide. These are official figures, and the possibility of the actual figure of suicides being higher cannot be discounted. With her limited education and awareness, Kalawati expectedly demonstrated little knowledge of, or the ability to resolve, the crisis which, according to some activists, is symptomatic of the impact of liberalization on Indias agriculture. So, finally, there is also the question of introducing checks and measures in the political process to identify and penalize the people responsible for exploiting Kalawatis credulity.               
	I was scheduled to leave Jalka in the afternoon. Kalawati, I was told, would be leaving as well, sometime in the evening. No one quite knew where she was headed, but she had decided to return after the elections. Kalawati conceded that her brief experience of the democratic process had left her bitter and disempowered. These days, she often wonders what had stopped her from going her husbands way during that difficult time marked by campaigns, press conferences and flashbulbs. But then, when she looks at her new home, and the children who no longer go hungry, she knows why.

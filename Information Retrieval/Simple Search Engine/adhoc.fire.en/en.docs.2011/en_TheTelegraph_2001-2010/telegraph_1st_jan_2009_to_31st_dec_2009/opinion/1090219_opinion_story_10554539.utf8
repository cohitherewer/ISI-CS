The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Its easy, its so easy
                                                                                                                 ITS EASY, ITS SO EASY                                                                  
	I remember reading Kate Millets Sexual Politics for the first time at university, in the mid-Eighties, as a confused and un-self-aware young person. I found her exciting as well as disappointing. The passion with which she lived the Personal as Political was inspiring (although I could use that inspiration only much later). But that very passion left little room for play, for those baffling grey tones, when it came to her reading of literature. Uncovering patriarchy in fiction and poetry seemed to make it all rather uniformly grim and predictable.        
	This uneasy-making mix of the rousing and the levelling has remained part of my personal experience of the political to this day, especially when lived out in public spaces and fora. Almost ten years ago, when I started writing about sexuality in these pages, it would fill me with uncertainty and nervousness, but with exhilaration too. It felt like doing something new, involving risks that were well worth taking. Since then, public discourse on sexuality has moved on, in India, from HIV/AIDS to 377, and I find myself being oddly more careful today with what and how I write.        
	Now that there is a public discourse on sexuality  in the media, in literature, in academia  it has become so much easier to write against the grain, to strike a cheeky-camp note and ruffle hetero-normative feathers, to wax pink-lyrical, to churn out rainbow-hued gush or red-ribboned sentimentality. All these are now established modes of being subversive that one can do without much effort. They have their own clichs and stereotypes, their own unshockingly-shocking ways of grabbing public attention. Gay pride marches are significant new forms of public visibility in Indian cities. But think of how they are invariably reported, visually and verbally, in newspapers and on TV: the same pictures of flamboyantly dressed and made-up people, making it impossible to figure out whether you are looking at Mumbai, San Francisco or Rio. It is wonderful to have a globalized community to belong to, with its own globalized language of free expression. But, if what is at stake here is a politics of identity, then is not this reassuring process of global community-forming itself a new problem, levelling identities down to mechanically reproducible images? Surely, queerness cannot look, sound and smell the same all over the world, and still be queer!        
	The problem with the language of protest  or with any ritualized form of dissent  is that the global semiotic system absorbs the shock of it too quickly through its networks of instant communication, rendering it respectable, and therefore innocuous, in no time. You feel thrilled lighting candles against the brutalization of love, and you realize that everybody is making the same set of gestures (candles, signatures, Bob Dylan songs) all over the world for all sorts of reason. And the whole thing starts looking insidiously scripted, and therefore robbed of the power to defamiliarize and disrupt.         
	I suppose I am a hopeless romantic in believing still that the politics of being different should somehow, at some irreducible level, be disruptive (if not quite revolutionary), and therefore difficult  for the protester as well as the protestee. It is a tricky balance to strike in the post-modern, post-ideological and largely post-political world. The urban liberal, with his heart in the right place, stops his car and lights a candle on Park Street (or its global equivalent), signs an internet petition, or joins a community with a click of the mouse. As the Pet Shop Boys drone on in Rent, Its easy, its so easy                    AVEEK SEN

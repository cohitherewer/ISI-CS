	With 390 new institutes of higher education to be established in the next few years, Indian publishers and distributors have their task cut out to make a killing with new books and reprints. Assuming that the new institutions would be able to find qualified teachers, the question is whether Indian publishers and distributors would be able to deliver their share in the breakthrough in higher education. With generous funding, money wouldnt be a problem as is often made out to be; availability of books and the capacity to process publishing proposals and service orders would be the nub of the problem  these are areas in which Indian publishers have always been found wanting, if track record is anything to go by.        
	The core demand would be for standard textbooks in English. Although classroom teaching is often done in a mix of regional language and English, private study is done through English textbooks simply because there are virtually no regional language books in the subject. This is especially true for all professional courses (STM, management, accountancy, architecture, and so on.) Even in the social sciences, Indian publishers have failed to build up core texts in any subject. What we have are either reprints of British and American textbooks or else monographs on highly specialized areas on the one hand, and cheap, pass-notes that cater to the lowest common denominator of students on the other. Model institutes do not stock such titles at all.        
	Standard textbooks, except those that have been reprinted time and again and have become part of the core-reading list of the syllabus for the course, are not often available from ready stock. They have to be ordered: if it is an imported title or a reprinted one, it means that the lead-time for availability has to be four to six weeks. So teachers and librarians have to act fast if libraries have to be stocked with the necessary books. Indian publishers are not entirely to blame for the lacuna; teachers need to take the rap because they are the main decision-makers in ensuring that standard texts are made available. Publishers and librarians are merely the service providers in our university system.        
	Outside the core textbooks, the field for supplementary reading is vast, especially in STM and information technology, where every month sees a flood of new books which render earlier books outdated. There is no ready availability here: the field is just too vast, and the risk of stocking titles without a clearly identifiable market too great. Teachers and librarians would have to work through catalogues and technical publications, which advertise forthcoming books instead of leaving the job to distributors. If they do, they would be dumped with irrelevant titles that would rarely be accessed by students and teachers.        
	Do publishers and distributors have the resources to publish or order books which do not have a clearly defined market? No. There is always a cash crunch largely because libraries  the main customers  do not pay on time, quite apart from the fact that the margins on institutional sales are low. Indian publishers would have to mop up the resources from somewhere if they are to take full advantage of the educational bonanza on its way.

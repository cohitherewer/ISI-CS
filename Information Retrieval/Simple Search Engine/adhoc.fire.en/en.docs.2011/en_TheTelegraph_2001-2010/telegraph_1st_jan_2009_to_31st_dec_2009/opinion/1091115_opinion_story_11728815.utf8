	Difficult rules                   
	Sir  I was surprised to read about Ian Jacks experiences in Londons clubs (A taste of other summers, Nov 1). In my opinion, club rules in London are far more relaxed than those in Calcutta. The Garrick and the Athenaeum  two popular clubs in London  are far easier to get into than some of Calcuttas institutions that are bound by archaic rules. The Garrick does not even insist on a tie. Some of Calcuttas clubs have tawdry rules, and ape a pompous English culture that does not exist today.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Wrong signal          
	Sir  The Centre is sending out very confusing signals when it comes to dealing with the Maoist threat (Delhi warms talks recipe, Nov 9). The prime minister has acknowledged that Maoists are the biggest threat to Indias internal security. However, the Union home secretary, G.K. Pillai, has said that while the Centre does not expect the Maoists to lay down their arms, it hoped that the guerrillas would abjure violence. This implies that Maoist insurgents will be allowed to keep their illegal weapons as long as they dont use them. Whether the Maoists continue with their violent agenda will also depend on the success of the proposed talks. The governments position will, in fact, help legitimize the possession of illegal weapons and send out wrong signals to other insurgent outfits.          
	Pillai also suggested that a ceasefire would be enough to begin the talks. But the question of a ceasefire can only arise between two sovereign nations at war. There can be no ceasefire or talks when a government is tackling rebels such as the Maoists. Criminals may talk of a revolution, but they are criminals nonetheless. Unless firmer steps are taken against the Maoists, the citizens of India will be threatened with greater violence. It is imperative that the government succeeds in checking the Maoist menace before it is too late.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Keep it down          
	Sir  I believe that noise pollution, along with water-logging and vehicular congestion, is one of the foremost problems of Calcutta. Very little thought went into checking the noise pollution that has accompanied the Metro railway extension between Tollygunge and Garia. The residents of the houses adjacent to the railway tracks now face acute problems due to the noise emitted by the passing trains. The noise is well above the permissible limit.           
	This problem could have been solved if the Metro authorities had replaced the low wall with a sound barrier on both sides of the tracks. Are the concerned authorities aware that the violation of rules set by the Pollution Control Board is an offence?          
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  Corruption is the biggest problem that India faces. Indias rank is 85th in the global corruption index. The country has various mechanisms to deal with corruption  stringent laws, heavy penalties as well as the Central Vigilance Commission  but they have not been able to check corruption. A public auditing system, like the one that is in place in Europe, may offer a solution. Additionally, extensive advertisement campaigns against corruption should be conducted with the help of the media, and a better system set up for people to lodge complaints. There will always be the possibility of a few false complaints, but it will definitely put the fear of god in the minds of the corrupt.                    
	Yours faithfully,

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | deep in the mire
                                                                                                                 DEEP IN THE MIRE                                  Malvika Singh                              
	When one thinks about the idea of India and its very special civilization, which has some of the finest material culture, human resources and complex philosophies intrinsic to its soul and being, one is alarmed by the horrific fact that independent India has not been able to provide water and electricity to its citizens across the board. If there is one major failure of governance, it is this: the inability to deliver the necessities that allow for a dignified human existence. Even leftist governments have failed to achieve this, despite their dictatorial, overriding politburo, which could have made this the partys first priority. This is, in fact, a scam far more humongous in scale than Satyam.        
	Successive governments and the many bureaucracies have diddled India. This has become the character trait that dominates all others. Governments and bureaucracies showed the way and private players followed suit. If the Securities and Exchange Board of India means business, it will examine, with a tooth comb, all the spectacular growth stories of companies in real estate, information technology, and suchlike to check their quality of corporate governance as well as their inflated valuations. Many will crumble and go the Satyam way, and will require urgent attention from the few old-timers who ran clean operations and were happy to grow steadily, even slowly.         
	It is time to check the overriding greed that we have witnessed in the last decade of the last century, and ensure that companies become compassionate, intelligent and responsible. Sadly, there are elements in the private sector that are as corrupt as government institutions. They need to be trained differently.                
	Dirty game        
	Honest and committed politicians need to grab the reins from those who are responsible for institutionalizing corruption at the cost of positive and inclusive growth in the economic and social spheres. Because it is impossible to do legitimate business in this country, as one has to deal with corrupt officialdom to get clearances, permissions, no-objection certificates and so on, private operators and businessmen, ranging from small companies to large conglomerates, have all been forced, without exception, against their wishes to find ways and means of satiating the greed of babus in order to get their permission, and function smoothly.         
	Two professionals make up our failed governance  the neta and the babu  and they have to lead the way in radically cleaning the entire system to destroy the killer germ they have nurtured.        
	The best of our government-owned institutions are in a quagmire. The All India Institute of Medical Sciences, a place where some of the best doctors in the country train and work, has been destroyed as a result of abject mismanagement of the great institution by those in charge in the government. The AIIMS remains dirty. Electric wires hang loose, water seeps through the walls, fans are mired in grime and monkeys enter rooms and sit on the beds of the patients, even as stray dogs scavenge for food. VIPs use the free service provided by the hospital but give nothing in return. This description fits almost every government-owned institution, from museums and archives to hotels and circuit houses, government office blocks to grand official residences.        
	Are we just a dirty and careless lot? Is this inability to reject filth and wrong practices, corruption and dishonesty, a congenital disorder? Why can we not respect the best and the brightest, conserve and protect our fine public institutions? Why does the babu cringe in front of the master, but has to be bribed to fulfil their responsibilities? When will the babu and the neta stop taking dirty lucre as their brand of prasad?

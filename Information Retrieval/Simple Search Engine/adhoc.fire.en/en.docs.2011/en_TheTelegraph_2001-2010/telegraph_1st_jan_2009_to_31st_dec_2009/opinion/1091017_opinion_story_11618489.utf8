The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Poised on a seesaw
                                                                                                                 POISED ON A SEESAW                          - Helping Afghanistan stabilize would be good for Indias future					 					      Sunanda K.

	While all the other employees excitedly discussed the impending regime change in a company I knew, an elderly Karnataka Brahmin asked philosophically, What difference does it make whether Ram rules or Ravana rules? Afghanistans prolonged trauma is a bit like that. While Pakistan and China stand to gain no matter who controls that landlocked expanse of mountain and valley, Indias position may resemble that of the resigned Brahmin unless it takes a more proactive stand.        
	Yet, too obvious involvement can be counter-productive. Zia ul-Haq gloated that Kunwar Natwar Singhs advocacy for the exiled Zahir Shah was the kiss of death for a proposal to restore the exiled monarch as head of an all-party coalition. Without sharing Zias malice, Stanley A. McChrystal, commander of the America-led Western forces in Afghanistan, may have been stating the bald truth when he warned that Indias $1.5 billion programme of building schools, hospitals, roads and other civil infrastructure was likely to exacerbate regional tensions and encourage Pakistani counter-measures in Afghanistan or India.         
	Indias imprint marked the Gandhara School and the Kushan Empire centuries before the imperial government in Calcutta was said to be mervous because Tsarist Russia had occupied Merv between Herat and Khiva. That was a move in the Great Game that Pakistans insecurities and ambitions have revived. But theres a difference. Rudyard Kiplings Great Game concerned external danger  Russia creeping towards the warm waters of the Arabian Sea and threatening British rule in cahoots with a hostile Persia. This time, the peril is a festering sore that must be lanced to save Afghanistan, India and  if only they knew it  Pakistan.         
	Blaming jihadi fundamentalism for every kind of violence is rather like Monaco cabling France at the end of World War II to send some communists as the principality would not otherwise qualify for Marshall Aid. Whatever contacts the brutal and fanatical Taliban later developed with Osama bin Laden, the indigenous movement grew out of the mujahideen created to expel the Soviets from Afghanistan. That creation was as much the handiwork of the American Central Intelligence Agency as of Pakistans Inter-Services Intelligence department.        
	The reason for mentioning this is to advance the unfashionable view that there are more things in heaven and earth than were dreamt of in George W. Bushs simplistic creed. A joint front against terror is nonsensical because the same bunch of criminals is not attacking India and Pakistan for the same reasons. Even an accommodating Pakistan (Pervez Musharrafs government was one of only three to recognize the Taliban regime) can be under fire for any number of social, tribal, political, personal, factional and  yes  also religious rivalries. Pakistans civil and military authorities are engaged in a deadly contest.         
	If Pakistan sponsored the Mumbai and Kabul attacks, as all Indians and many Afghans believe, it was for the same reasons that have provoked three subcontinental wars. Shah Mahmood Qureshis outrage at Indias level of engagement and large presence in Afghanistan is born of the fear that Afghanistan might join Kashmir and Bangladesh as another gain for India and setback for Pakistan. Qureshis expectation of a monopoly over Afghanistan is not unexpected since Zia was cast in the role of saviour of freedom and democracy.         
	Despite their participation (under compulsion) in Operation Enduring Freedom, Pakistans rulers will gain a signal victory if McChrystals gloomy assessment  the insurgents currently have the initiative and the overall situation is deteriorating  comes true for whatever reason, including Barack Obamas apparent reluctance to accede to McChrystals request for additional support in full. Not many Pakistanis will stop to consider the damage that the triumphant return to Kabul of the Talibans one-eyed emir, Mullah Muhammad Omar, would do in the long term to their countrys fragile stability and hope of nursing a liberal democracy. Instead, most would regard it as cause for jubilation, not only because official connivance has already Talibanized parts of Pakistan but because an Afghanistan without American strings would again be seen as providing strategic weightage against India.        
	On the other hand, a Taliban defeat would enable Asif Ali Zardari to boast that the American forces would not have won the war without Pakistans political support and physical facilities. Not only will Pakistan expect (and probably get) reimbursement of the $35 billion to $50 billion it claims to have spent on the so-called war on terror, but it will also demand as reward a say in Afghanistans future governance and restoration of the privileged position Pakistan has traditionally occupied in American policy-making in the subcontinent. As for the secretary of States certification of reasonable progress in preventing al Qaida, the Taliban and associated terrorist groups, such as Lashkar-e-Toiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad from operating in the territory of Pakistan for the Kerry-Lugar Acts $7.5 billion grant, we know how readily successive American presidents ignored the evidence even of American agencies to certify year after year that Pakistan was not making the bomb.        
	If it looks like a heads I win, tails you lose situation for Pakistan, it is no less so for China, which backs Pakistan as part of its strategy of isolating and upstaging India. A Taliban defeat would reduce Afghanistans role as a base for moral and military support for secessionist Muslim Uighurs in Xingjian. A Taliban victory would compound Indias discomfiture though it would also enable jihadis worldwide to claim the scalps of both superpowers.        
	Geopolitics apart, China is eyeing the untapped deposits of copper, iron, gold, uranium and precious gems that comprise Afghanistans mineral wealth. A Chinese State-owned company is already active in the Aynak copper reserves, worth tens of billions of dollars, in Logar province south of Kabul. Moreover, China sees Afghanistan as a secure conduit for roads and energy pipelines to transport natural resources from the Indian Ocean and elsewhere. These can also be negotiated with a Taliban regime. Bill Clinton was initially well-disposed towards the Taliban, seeing it as a check on Iran (Ronald Reagan backed Saddam Hussein for the same reason), and the 12th largest American oil company, Unocal, began discussing a Central Asian oil pipeline with the Taliban. The State department blessed the negotiations until other geopolitical factors intervened.        
	So, while Pakistan and China can both look to some dividends no matter who wins, India must view with dismay any prospect other than the Talibans total liquidation. For, with the Taliban controlling Afghanistan and militant Islam stretching deep into central Asia, Pakistan would feel emboldened to make more bids to get its own back not only for Kashmir and Bangladesh but also for a long string of grievances against India including water sharing, division of military assets, Junagadh, Hyderabad and just the fact that India is bigger, richer and more powerful. The consequent disruption of Indias communal harmony and diversion of resources from the economy would not displease China.              
	No wonder India is Afghanistans fifth largest donor country. No wonder, too, that Pakistan resents this interaction and is pressuring the United States of America to end it. But the Afghans welcome Indian help, especially installations like the 202-kilometre electrical transmission line to Kabul and the 218-km highway to the Persian Gulf port of Chahbahar which broke Pakistans monopoly on Afghanistans access to the outside world. But goodwill is not enough. Afghanistan needs political stability and the military capability to defend it. India, the worlds largest democracy with one of the worlds biggest (1.35 million) militaries, is better equipped than any other regional country to help in both respects. Sending fighting troops would deplete Indias defence, incite domestic controversy and invite international complications. But the Indian Military Training Team in Bhutan has offered an example of unobtrusive effectiveness for about 50 years.        
	It is essential for Indias future to rescue Afghanistan from the uncertainties of the battle between Ram and Ravana. Ironically, and in the long term, that would also benefit Pakistan.       sunandadryahoo.co.in

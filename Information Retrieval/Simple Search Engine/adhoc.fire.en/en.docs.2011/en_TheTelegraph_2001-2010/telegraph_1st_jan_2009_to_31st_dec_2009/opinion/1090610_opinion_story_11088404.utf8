	A security guard working in a dairy was injured while counting milk cans in a vehicle. He availed the benefit of obtaining treatment in an Employees State Insurance (ESI) Hospital. The security guard applied for compensation under the Motor Vehicles Act as well. It was debated at the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal whether he was entitled to such compensation under the Motor Vehicles Act when he had already availed benefits under the ESI Act. Losing the case at the tribunal, the employee filed a writ petition. The Karnataka High Court held that the ESI Act prohibited an injured employee under its protection from receiving or recovering any compensation or damages under the Workmans Compensation Act or any other existing law.

	 A family court in Hyderabad passed a decree for the restitution of conjugal rights in favour of a man. His wife challenged the order in the high court. The Andhra Pradesh High Court observed that the wife had endured eight years of torture and humiliation before leaving home and afterwards ran her household on her own income. Under the circumstances, the court held that the husband was not entitled to a decree of restitution of conjugal rights. It rejected the husbands plea that the wife could not cite specific instances of cruelty. The court further held that since both parties were above the age of 50 and there were no chances of reconciliation, the divorce should be allowed. (N. Chandra Shobha vs N. Vimala Prasad)                    
	Owners right        
	 A bank attached an agricultural land, given as collateral security, when the borrower defaulted in paying back his loan. Thereafter, water supply to the land was discontinued. A writ petition was filed challenging the aforesaid order, as the discontinuance was made in mid-crop season disrupting cultivation. Setting aside the order, the Rajasthan High Court held that the attachment of property did not mean that the owner or occupier lost all rights and interest in the property. The land could not be denuded of any rights or facilities that the occupier could use in paying back his loans. (Jeet Ram and another vs State and others)

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        ONLY APPEAL                                                    
	Even an obvious statement can acquire a salience if it is uttered on a special occasion. That political parties in West Bengal, as well as other organizations, should abjure violence and vendetta is not a new point to make. But it acquired a special significance when Gopalkrishna Gandhi made it part of his departing message on Sunday afternoon. Other eminent persons, including Amartya Sen, have made the point with as much force and poignance as Mr Gandhi. The Telegraph too, in these columns, has repeatedly condemned the propensity to take to violence and to the politics of disruption that has become almost the signature of the state. What West Bengal desperately needs is an agreement on an agenda for economic development. Such an agreement will never be possible so long as political parties remain wedded to scoring points by spreading mayhem on the streets and in the countryside. By definition, a democracy calls forth differences of views and opinions, but democracy also provides fora where views can be debated and discussed. In a democracy, protests should not transgress the norms of parliamentary behaviour and the rule of law. In West Bengal, this principle has been honoured more in its breach.        
	The conjuncture at which this message is being given to all who care about the state gives to it an urgency. West Bengal is poised to fall into a descending spiral of lawlessness and violence. Large tracts in western Midnapore seem to be in the control of a political formation that does not believe in democracy and the rule of law. They are committed to bringing about socio-economic change through violence. In the hills of West Bengal, there is a strong separatist movement that can be neglected only at the peril of the entire state. In the rest of West Bengal, two powerful political parties, one in power and another waiting to come to power, are locked in a fight whose only code is the ancient one of an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. Add to this the occasional bandh and rally that disrupt work and daily routine, and what emerges is a dismal picture from which there does not seem to be any immediate escape. A cri de cur is the only recourse of sensible people who want to see light at the end of a long and dark tunnel. The cry might go unheard  and it probably will  but not to articulate it would be an act of irresponsibility. West Bengal expects.

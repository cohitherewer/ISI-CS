The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | too darn hot
                                                                                                                 TOO DARN HOT                                                    
	It is no longer possible to think that human beings can do nothing about bad weather. It is not nice to be told about global warming while Calcutta, together with other parts of West Bengal, is barely managing to cope with temperatures that have risen to this level after almost three decades. But this years temperature rise is in keeping with global trends. Given that this hot spell is because of the lack of cloud cover in this area (owing to a dearth of moisture in the troposphere), there may be a larger warning here to human beings about the long-term effects of their abuse of the planet. But the acute distress caused by the heat also raises more immediate questions of responsibility. In Calcutta, and other affected areas in Bengal, the problem is not only a question of weather but also of power supply. Sunday was a prolonged nightmare in the city because the heat was matched by what the Calcutta Electric Supply Corporation has called a major system breakdown in which four of its power-generating units remained dysfunctional for a very long time. The fact that the CESC used this phrase in a public apology shows that, unlike the weather, this was quite avoidable. Since Sunday, there has been talk of enquiry committees and necessary corrective action, but nobody seems to have got to the bottom of what exactly had gone wrong and what can be done so that this does not happen again. Meanwhile, both CESC and the state units have proved unable to cope with the rising demands for power, for reasons that combine poor maintenance of equipment, the quality of coal, scarcity of water and possibly inefficient coordination and crisis management. The chief minister and the power minister have had several conversations, but things remain more or less shrouded in mystery.        
	Most of Bengals aspirations depend on electricity. From industry to Twenty20 to cutting-edge biological research, being able to maintain an uninterrupted supply of power is crucial, and it is clear that this is what the state is still unable to sustain. At a mundane level too  the level at which hospitals, blood banks, schools, colleges and universities operate, or people need to have basic water-supply  this combination of unusual weather, infrastructural failure and the States refusal to admit to its inadequacies has proven Calcutta a difficult city to live in since Sunday. But looking helplessly up at the sky is not enough.

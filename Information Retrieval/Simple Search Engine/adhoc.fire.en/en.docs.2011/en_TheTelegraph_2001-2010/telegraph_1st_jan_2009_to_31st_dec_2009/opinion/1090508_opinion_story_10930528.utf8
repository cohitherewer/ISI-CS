	In politics, the more articulate the individual, the better his chances of success. The art of rhetoric is essential to the art of politics. This obscures the fact that there are moments when silence is a winner in politics, when discretion is the better part of political tactics. Rahul Gandhi, Congresss Sir Galahad in a white kurta and pyjama, has not yet learnt this truth. It is one thing to be forthright and candid, quite another to embarrass potential allies. Mr Gandhi may have done just that by his somewhat indiscreet remarks at a press conference. It is obvious that when the results of the general elections are announced, no single party will be in a position to form the government. A coalition will have to be cobbled together to secure a majority in the new Lok Sabha. That process could possibly lead to new alliances, over and above the existing ones. Mr Gandhi wanted to show, perhaps, that the Congress had not shut its doors on some parties that are currently ranged against it. He thus chose to praise Nitish Kumar, the chief minister of Bihar, whose party, the Janata Dal (United), has an understanding with the Bharatiya Janata Party, and is thus seen to be part of the National Democratic Alliance. Mr Gandhi complimented Mr Kumar on his performance as the chief minister. He meted out similar praise to N. Chandrababu Naidu of the Telugu Desam Party, another adversary of the Congress. It would not be unfair to read these recognitions of performance as overtures. Mr Gandhi did not stop there, he even spoke of the Left as a possible future ally of the Congress.        
	The problem arises from the impact of these so-called overtures. In West Bengal, the Congress is in alliance with the Trinamul Congress whose leader, Mamata Banerjee, is virulently opposed to the Left. She was quick to react very adversely to Mr Gandhis praise of the Left. In Bihar, the pro-Congress Rashtriya Janata Dal, which is opposed to the JD(U), did not take kindly to the praise of Mr Kumar. Mr Gandhis remarks, whatever be their intention, did rock a few boats at a very critical time. Even if Mr Gandhi is contemplating opening up post-poll negotiations with political formations that are now opposed to the Congress, he would have been well-advised to keep his political tactics to himself.        
	It is difficult to comprehend why in the middle of the hustings season Mr Gandhi had to address a press conference. If the intention was to project himself, the press conference was redundant since Mr Gandhi has already emerged as the most important public figure of the Congress, second only to his mother. If he wanted the world to know that he was a great tactician, he has made a hash of things since he had the opposite impact. Mr Gandhi can learn the value of discretion from his own sister. Politics needs many arts: one them is the art of need to know.

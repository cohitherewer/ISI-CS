	Heal the self, and the world                
	 Socialist Register 2009: Violence Today (LeftWord, Rs 350) edited by Leo Panitch and Colin Leys compiles various articles on actually existing barbarism by such acclaimed writers as Henry Bernstein, Philip Green or Achin Vanaik. Engels had foreseen long ago the potential for barbarism that lies ingrained in capitalism. The present condition of the world gives credence to his belief. Countries compete with one another to increase their stock of nuclear weapons, prisoners of war are brutalized in jails, people are killed in repeated backlashes against immigrant communities all over the world while closer home in India, religious riots continue to claim the lives of thousands with frightening regularity. In separate articles, this book considers the implications of the war on terror, the attendant suicide bombings and torture, and the persistent violence against women. Although the titles of the essays  State talk, state silence: work and violence in the UK or Indias paradigmatic communal violence might sound intimidating to the common reader, the essays in themselves are thankfully free of the clutter of academic jargon. An additional attraction of the volume is an extract titled Human Shield from John Bergers forthcoming novel, From A to X. Although the contributors analyses of barbarism are sharp enough, they start sounding a bit simplistic when they offer socialism as the only solution to all the ills.                                
	In the Country of Gold-Digging Ants: Two Thousand Years of Travel in India (Puffin, Rs 225) by Anu Kumar takes the readers to that magical age when travelling meant more than advance booking and the mobile and the Internet. Perhaps it is difficult now to imagine a time when the map of the world was just being created, and people walked for miles on foot over hazardous terrains to discover hitherto unknown territories. This delightful book follows the travels of explorers like Megasthenes, Marco Polo or Ralph Fitch, who documented the wonders of the land called India. Standing out among these men are women like Alexandra David-Nel, who made it to Lhasa in 1923, or Halide Edib, the Turkish nationalist, novelist and womens activist who wrote Inside India in the 1930s. The army of beggars in the Kalighat temple of Calcutta had reminded Edib of the noisy gamblers of the stock exchange, for the crowd in both cases played on human credulity, on its desire to feel rich...without any struggle of a moral kind. Well, at least some things have remained the same.                                    
	Seeing Stars: Spectacle, Society and Celebrity culture (Sage, Rs 295) by Pramod K. Nayar attempts to deromanticize stardom by showing how celebrities are packaged and sold for the delectation of the audience. Todays celebrities include not only filmstars or sportsmen but also authors like Salman Rushdie. While Salman Khan sells his machismo, a writer like J.K. Rowling uses her rags-to-riches story or her status as a single mother to grab as much attention as her creation. This is a valuable book, and would be of interest to scholars and lay readers alike.   
	 Go Beyond Stress: Twelve Self-Hypnotic Stress-Buster Sessions (Sterling, Rs 250) by Gary Edward Haymes is your Physical and emotional time out to attain a permanent mental comfort zone. Before you start worrying about the meaning of the quoted line, you should remember that the author is a registered certified hypnotherapist, and he is here to help you tackle anything ranging from panic attacks, career dissatisfaction to marital discord. You just have to imagine yourself as a sponge, absorbing the gaiety of the world, and floating in a sea of light. So forget such sentences as Serenity is to calm be like an immense oak tree (sic) and get ready to embark on the mystic journey.

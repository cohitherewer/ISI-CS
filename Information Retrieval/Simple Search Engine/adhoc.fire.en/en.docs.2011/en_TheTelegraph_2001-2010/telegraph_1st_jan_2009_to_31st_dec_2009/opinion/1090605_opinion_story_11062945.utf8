                                                                                                                 NEW LIGHT ON GROWTH                                                                  
	Money, finance, political economy: getting it right By Deena Khatkhate, Academic Foundation, Rs 995        
	Two economists, on either side of the idea spectrum, enlivened the pages of the Economic and Political Weekly. Their columns dealt with the economy, but also offered a ringside view of a changing India. The two were Ashok Mitra, the Marxist economist, and Deena Khatkhate, an economist unafraid to take his own path.         
	Khatkhates first collection of essays  Ruminations of a Gadfly  appeared in 2007. It was engaging, sarcastic, even cheeky, and lighter in tone. This book, also a collection of essays, is more serious and reflective in nature. It is a book by an economist on economics, politics and the latters influence on the former. A couple of sections also delve on Khatkhates own development as an economist.         
	The author continues to be a gadfly and iconoclast, and is not afraid to strike out against accepted tenets of standard economic thinking. So he willingly takes credit for being among the first to write about the vital need for change in the functioning of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, changes that would see them work more to help the poorer nations of North and West Africa. He is also courageous enough to admit that he was a trifle optimistic about the usefulness of a fiscal deficit in stimulating development, especially when this is constrained by unemployment and excess production capacity; inflationary pressures, however, told their own story. Khatkhate also argues that studying the economy as an independent system makes little sense unless politics is taken into account.         
	The edifice of the Indian bureaucracy is the subject of one of the essays in this volume: a piece that dates to Nehrus time and reflects his thinking on the civil services. Among the other pieces on political economy is one that enquires why the intellectual has been virtually absent from the Indian public discourse. Khatkhate argues that since the post-Independence years, intellectuals have allowed themselves to be subsumed by the system.         
	The more detailed essays are on monetary and fiscal issues which are useful for they offer a perspective on the nature of economic development in India. In a detailed discussion on Indias fiscal policy, Khatkhate states that while micromanaging is an onerous task, it is essential for the government to look at the entire gamut of expenditure and income. Only this would make it possible for the State to provide viable social services.         
	In an illuminating essay on economic growth, Khatkhate argues that the paralysis of economic policy formulation and its wayward course are due to the inner workings of the political system. Economic policy is based at the same time on punishment and incentives, but without any sanction for enforcing penalty or a system that offers rewards. This explains the erratic nature of economic policy in India. The reason for these sudden shifts lies in the concentration of political power at the Centre. The situation can be changed only by reforming the political process, which would ensure the decentralization of power between states and even district units. It also calls for a total restructuring of the bureaucracy, already an impregnable fortress, that prevents the reform process from gathering speed.         
	To return to EPW again, from where this review began. Ashok Mitra, in his many articles, had called for greater decentralization in economic decision-making and, consequently, in the political system. Khatkhate, too, argues for the same, which reveals the similarities that lie under the differences in economic thought.

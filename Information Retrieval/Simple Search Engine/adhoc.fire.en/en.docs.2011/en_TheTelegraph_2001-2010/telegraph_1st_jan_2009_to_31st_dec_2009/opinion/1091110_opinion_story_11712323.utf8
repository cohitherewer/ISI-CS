	Reform with reason                  
	Sir  In his article, From enclave to empire (Nov 5), Sukanta Chaudhuri has analysed the present state of higher education in the country with insight. The merit of the piece lies not so much in the way Chaudhuri has questioned the rationale of the Union human resource ministers experiments, but in the way he has put Kapil Sibals all-too-frequent reforms under intense scrutiny. Read in conjunction with Bhaskar Duttas piece, A road not yet travelled (Oct 13), Chaudhuris comments would be enlightening for those interested in the fate of Indian higher education.          
	There are no two opinions about Chaudhuris contention that despite a huge homegrown potential, higher education in India is yet to measure up to international standards. Both Chaudhuri and Dutta concur that the HRD ministers formulations have not yielded the dividends he had expected. Chaudhuris reference to the outbreak of a regime of bypass surgery is apposite. I went to the United States of America last year to visit my son and daughter-in-law, who were working on their doctoral dissertations there. I had then the opportunity to talk to some university faculty members. They were quite lavish in praising the merit of Indian students. They claimed that Indian students contribute the most in the field of research. Once these young scholars secure a job abroad, the lure of the lucre, coupled with the fear of not finding suitable opportunities back home, persuades them to remain there. So, the theory that brain gain is being mauled by brain drain holds good.          
	There is need for introspection on what exactly has gone wrong with Indian higher education. Education in a country as big as India is not expected to stay exclusively focused on quality. The fact cannot be ignored that education has to percolate down to the economically disadvantaged masses. At the same time, it is not always possible to reach quality higher education to one and all. However, if the right approach is followed, then neither is impossible. Chaudhuris prescription in this respect seems well in order. Who can deny the appallingly low literacy level of the country more than 60 years after Independence? Aiming at elitist education, irrespective of economic and demographic trends, is going to prove counterproductive. Indian institutes of technologies and managements apart, the possibilities of setting up new centres of learning  that would benefit large sections of society not equipped to pursue higher education  must be explored.          
	Lack of infrastructure is a constraint in the field of education. True reform in education has to encompass a wide segment of the population according to need-based priorities. Education in this country has also been hampered by other key factors. Vile campus politics has marred the ambience of many prestigious institutions. Teachers, too, are divided along political lines. The responsibility of persuading students to shun violent politics lies with the teachers. The government must get tough with errant teachers encouraging students to take recourse to divisive ways to vitiate the environment in the campus. The gulf between the high and the low in higher education has to be bridged by initiatives informed by compulsions and imponderables. Individual moves shorn of wisdom and collectivism will turn out to be a bane rather than a boon. The sooner Sibal realizes this, the better.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Fatal delay          
	Sir  The death of a critically-ill kidney patient, Sumit Verma, who was not allowed to enter a medical institute due to security restrictions for the prime ministers visit, is deeply shocking. The prime minister has expressed sadness, but such expressions of regret are heard whenever ordinary people have to suffer on account of security arrangements meant to protect VVIPs (PM regrets to widow, Nov 5). VVIP visits result in chaos on roads. Traffic is halted, and daily life is brought to a standstill. To add insult to injury, policemen on duty are often rude to people as if that too is part of the deal. Instead of seeking an apology, the prime minister should ensure that such unfortunate incidents do not happen in future.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Dilbag Rai, Chandigarh

                
	Sir  The prime minister reportedly wrote to the family of the man who died outside a Chandigarh hospital for want of timely treatment. It was an avoidable tragedy. Using security concerns as excuse, politicians often end up harassing citizens. Why do VVIPs not take less-congested routes to their destination? Why can police convoys not help the sick reach hospitals by ferrying them?          
	Yours faithfully,      
N.R. Ramachandran, Ooty

      
	Sir  Manmohan Singh deserves praise for personally writing to Sumit Vermas wife. But the compensation money of two lakh rupees is too little for a young widow with two small children. The Centre gives out relief-cheques of up to ten lakh rupees for tragic deaths for which no government agency may be responsible. In addition to more money, Vermas wife should be given a government job.          
	There should be stern directives on the use of red-lights and sirens on cars. Such privileges should be extended to only a chosen few, and withdrawn from the cars of all other dignitaries. Lights and sirens not only cause unnecessary disturbance to people but also single out the important personalities, making them vulnerable to threats.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

                
	Sir  The prime minister has not only written to the widow of Sumit Verma regretting the mishap, but has also advised the security staff to be more humane. Such letters are of no value as security personnel act according to the manuals drafted by the government. It would make better sense if security cavalcade is reduced to a maximum of three vehicles. The prime minister should be the first one to curtail the security entourage attending on him, and other ministers should follow suit.           
	Yours faithfully,

                                                                                                                 LESSONS NOT LEARNT                                  Bona Fide - Malvika Singh                              
	Kapil Sibal has stepped out of the box and thank the Lord for that. Experts, educationists and specialists are cautioning him and putting doubts in the minds of the uninitiated schools that would prefer the stagnation and status quo because they are comfortable and because those at the helm of these institutions of learning are intellectually lazy. In the last 60 years, the academic community should have got its act together and endorsed a system of learning rather than one that encourages rote without thinking. This has created a large mass of students who can read and write, but are unthinking and unable to structure an essay, argument or analysis on any subject.        
	Bright, lively, curious and impatient minds have no place in the education system that operates in India today. The excitement of learning and exploring ideas from the past, debating those of the present and thinking about the future is something that an entire generation has been denied by the curricula and the methodologies, which are intended to create robots instead of geniuses. The dumbing down has been responsible for the lack of self- esteem which, in turn, has generated deep-seated insecurities. The personality disorders that confront our society stem from this faulty learning system that prevents the creative use of the mind and forces an alarming homogeneity.        
	Educationists and experts have let us down by spending more time on committee-baazi, recommendations, and by delaying endlessly the implementation of ideas that could have brought the change years ago. The argument that nothing as important as this should be rushed through does not make sense anymore. It is better to break out of such restrictive confines and fine-tune the changes as we go along. Rigid, turgid and boring texts, one-dimensional arguments, a flat rendering of history sans the layered nuances, which make the subject more interesting, have made school a chore rather than a wonderful space to explore and question.                
	Break free        
	Parents infuse in their children values, ethics and social truths. Similarly, teachers in schools need to embrace the minds of students even if the numbers in class are large and unwieldy. As a young student, I was extremely happy in school, loved contradicting my teachers who always debated with me and gave me much confidence in myself. When I failed in an examination, I was never put down nor accused of being a failure. The subjects that I did well in were emphasized, and I was encouraged to read more in those particular areas. I was an average student, but I had a voracious appetite for books and I had taught myself well beyond the prescribed kunjis, developed new interests and was always pushed along in the direction I had opted for. That was a different system, and it was not the sausage machine that our children are put through.        
	There are many innovative exercises that can be experimented with to make learning exciting, even when there is a shortage of teachers with the required skills. With new-age information technology and a wide variety of disciplines to choose from, extra-curricular courses, workshops and suchlike could assist in identifying special interests and latent potential in students. These additions make for wholesome learning and open the mind to a very important ingredient  general knowledge. It should be made mandatory for both science and arts students. Choices should be based on interest and aptitude. Teaching design, photography, theatre, music, art, environment studies, to name a few subjects, should be part of the curriculum. We need to think out of the box as we structure our education process and adjust to a changing world to equip a new generation with skills that can get them work in a changed market.

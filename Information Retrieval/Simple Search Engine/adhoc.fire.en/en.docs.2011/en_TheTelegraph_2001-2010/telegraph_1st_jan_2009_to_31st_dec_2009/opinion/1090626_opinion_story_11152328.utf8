	The Austrian economist, Joseph Schumpeter, used the phrase, creative destruction, to describe the process by which new technologies disrupted traditional technologies in the economy. Widespread computerization of the techniques of print and design in the past decade has clearly affected the way we publish our books.         
	Why obsess about the content when the average reader is more concerned with how well a book is produced and designed than with its content? Besides, with rapid advances in technology, the future reader would soon be offered a choice between the printed edition and the electronic edition of a book. With freer modes of communication like postings on the internet  more and more research papers are being posted on the internet, which has become an indispensable research tool now  what is the future of scholarly books that are difficult to sell? Has creative destruction spelt the end of serious literature?        
	As it is, scholarly books, which are extensions of research monographs, have few takers now. The reasons for this are obvious in a market-driven industry: their print-runs are small, which means high prices, and slow returns as a result. They are not worth the time and money spent on them, at least for private publishers. Most scholarly publishing is therefore confined to American university presses that have endowment funds to publish highly specialized books for a narrow audience.        
	Technological advances have worsened the situation as far as the published book is concerned. While production processes have become easier and faster, and more and more books are being churned out, sales have not increased because there is a limit to how much the market (libraries and the individual) can buy. More books need not mean more sales; quite often it means greater loss. That is why there has been a severe cut on scholarly publishing  it does not bring in the money.         
	Hence the question: is scholarly publishing at all possible without substantial subsidies? And is the publication of books that contain hard ideas no longer required? Let it be said loud and clear: very few scholarly books will get published without subsidy or sponsorship  which could either be a straight publishing grant or a guarantee of buying back a minimum number of copies that would cover the publishers production costs. This trend has already been established not just with small publishers but also with major houses with international outlets. With the slump in book trade, you can bet that subsidies/sponsorships will become the norm for publication. Perhaps the only exception would be made for authors who are really big shots and whose names would be enough to launch a 1,000 copies.        
	For research scholars it will be tougher to get published on the merits of the works alone. They will have to to finance the publication or alternatively, filter out the core findings and post them on the internet from where they could be picked up by peers. They will have to learn the ways to harness new technologies to get themselves heard. There is no other way.

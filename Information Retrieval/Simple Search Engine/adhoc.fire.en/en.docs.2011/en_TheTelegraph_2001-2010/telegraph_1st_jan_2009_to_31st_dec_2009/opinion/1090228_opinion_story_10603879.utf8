	Ganges Art Gallerys current exhibition, Young Blood (till tomorrow), features young artists from Santiniketan. That is quite obvious from the work of Sabir Ali whose large man in a jacket is definitely a cruder version of the politicians that one of the best-known teachers from Kala Bhavan painted early in his career. Even the floral motifs are lifted from you know where. Mrinal Deys paintings are just an excuse for depicting pretty, Westernized fashion models. However, Manisha Deys tropical plants, particularly the one with long leaves like serpents, are better conceived. She seems to have a good sense of design and she often uses bright shades to emphasize the sculpturesque quality of the plants she paints. Sanjay Senguptas paintings based on industry and workers could mystify viewers but for the wrong reasons. They could even mistake these paintings for caricatures, for the machines actually resemble the workers rendered with stippled brushwork. Bhaskar Goswami is quite different from the rest. So different, in fact, that viewers may wonder why he was included. Goswamis watercolours of the head of an androgynous person involved in activity that could be interpreted as sexual with fruits and a hornbill are actually quite fascinating. They are full of suggestions of stories untold.

	Body horror        
	Body horror pervades the works of Anindita Dutta showing at Galerie 88 (The Exit, till tomorrow). The walls, painted blood red, suitably evoke the visceral ambience of Duttas world. Bones, especially of the pelvic region, recur as motifs, with contorted faces or deformed bodies hanging upside down from them. This morbidly fascinating inscape provides a template for Dutta to produce a cluster of images and a few installations in mixed media. The watercolours are striking though a tad repetitive, to the extent of being a bit laboured. The larger-than-life installation of a vertebral structure, using fibreglass and stitched canvas, looks somewhat podgy rather than grotesque. The video installations succeed better in stirring the curiosity of the viewers. A sequence of family photographs, repeated in a loop, is framed by pelvic bones  possibly turning these into originary images, memories with which life begins. The grand finale is the ambitious installation, using debris, broken dolls and video footage. But the video alone was good enough to conjure this vision of the Last Things.

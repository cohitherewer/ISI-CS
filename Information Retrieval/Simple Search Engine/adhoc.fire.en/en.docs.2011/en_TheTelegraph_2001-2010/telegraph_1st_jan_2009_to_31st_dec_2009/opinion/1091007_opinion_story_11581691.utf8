                                                                                                                 SAY SORRY                                                    
	Getting past the Thackerays is a crucial test of creative cunning for film-makers in Mumbai. Karan Johar, together with the lead actor in his latest release, has now proved himself clever at it. Mumbai can only be called by that name, and to refer to the city as Bombay several times in a film is an offence. Wake Up Sid has committed that offence, so its maker must apologize to those who oversee such things in the city. And this is what Mr Johar did on a sort of politic reflex. But what kind of precedent does this set, and what kind of endorsement does this give to Raj Thackeray and his Maharashtra Navnirman Sena? The thing to do, as Mr Johar has shown, is to be quick, abject and public in ones apologies to the man and his men. Since Mr Johar was dealing more with muscle than with a mind, he also had to mouth some platitude about realism, and then hope for the best. But not a word, in all this, about freedom of expression, a phrase that begins to have a quaintly archaic ring to it in all this cutting-edge pragmatism. Such freedoms are not what are at stake here. The real disaster averted by Mr Johars prompt apology is a purely commercial one. A high proportion of the films revenue comes from the Mumbai area, and not being allowed to show it there would have cost its producer several crore of rupees. So, never mind if the film-maker looks cut down to size, the politician triumphant and the Indian democracy a bit dented  it is enough that the film is being shown unchanged. And the free radicals of India should think twice before scrambling up their high horses. Is it not supposed to be the most important thing for the artist to be allowed to show his work, no matter what the means are to that end?        
	But what happens to Mumbai, and to Maharashtra, in the process? For Mr Thackeray and the MNS are speaking on behalf of all Maharashtrians, however that may be defined. Other visitors from north India, Bihar or any other state have been made to understand repeatedly, and often violently, that they have no business to tarnish the purity of the Maharashtrian economy by exercising their constitutionally guaranteed freedom to live and work anywhere in the country. The state government and its law-and-order machinery make sure, with their pragmatic passivity, that the MNS and its leader get away with this sort of thing every time.

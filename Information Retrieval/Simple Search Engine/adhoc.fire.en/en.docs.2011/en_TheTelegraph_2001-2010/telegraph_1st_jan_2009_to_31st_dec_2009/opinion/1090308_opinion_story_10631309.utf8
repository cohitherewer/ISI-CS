	Time to wake up                  
	Sir  The report, Beating code by a whisker (March 4), says that the Rashtriya Madhyamik Siksha Abhiyan scheme was on the anvil since 2007 and received cabinet approval last month. Why did it lie waiting till Arjun Singh awoke from his Rip-Van-Winkle-like slumber minutes before the poll dates were announced? True, the code of conduct was not violated, but why did it take two long years for the scheme to be passed? Doesnt the human resource development ministry owe the nation an explanation?           
	Yours faithfully,       
Basudeb Bhattacharya, Calcutta 

                
	Personal things          
	Sir  The news of Vijay Mallya buying Mahatma Gandhis personal belongings at a whopping $1.8 million at the auction in New York is reason for India to be proud (Hic! Rs 9 crore for Gandhi heritage, March 7). Not long ago, the liquor baron had bought Tipu Sultans sword in a similar auction at a high price too. What is shameful is that those who swear by the sacrifices of our freedom fighters and pay lip service to the treasures of our rich cultural past remained mute spectators. Neither did families and kin nor our heritage-conscious business tycoons care about bringing back the assets. It is one thing to gift millions of dollars worth of gifts to ones kith and kin on their birthdays and quite another to respect the priceless symbols of Indias rich past.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Safiuddin Khan, New Delhi 

                
	Sir It was painful to learn that articles used by Mahatma Gandhi were being auctioned in New York. More painful was the lack of a serious response from the Indian elite. Wealthy politicians and businessmen in this country have launched their careers from the platform provided by a modern nation that Gandhi had created. Should they not have formed a consortium and presented themselves as bidders? Indian business houses especially should have given serious thought to ways to retrieve the articles the Mahatma used.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
R. Sekar, Visakhapatnam

                
	Sir  Why this fuss over Mahatma Gandhis belongings being auctioned? India was not bothered about getting them back from James Otis before, so is this an election gimmick? Indians were not embarrassed before the auction was announced; why are they feeling so now?                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Sumon Kar, London 

                          
	Different histories          
	Sir  It appears that some states, particularly those ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party, are using school textbooks to spread hatred against minority communities (Studies in hate, March 4). According to legal experts, this is a violation of Article 28 of the Constitution which states that no religious instruction shall be provided in any educational institution wholly maintained out of State funds. This implies that Article 28 does not cover private educational institutions run by minorities, although they receive liberal government aid.          
	To deter government-funded educational institutions from misusing text books, the human resource development ministry is reportedly about to set up the national textbook council to oversee contents of textbooks. This may prevent young minds from being indoctrinated into any particular ideology inimical to the concept of secularism. But this action would be ineffective if government-aided institutions are not brought under its purview. Schools, and not only those in Rajasthan, often teach students a distorted view of history. Such distortions need to be corrected.          
	Yours faithfully,

                                                                                                                 ORDER BY LAW                                                    
	It has been only a year, and Pakistan has already encountered far too many roadblocks in its journey on the path to real democracy. The controversial supreme court ruling, which disqualifies both the Sharif brothers from holding public office, is bound to be one of the most intransigent yet as it contains within it the potential of negating everything that the country has achieved for itself in this one year. For one, it tears asunder the possibility of any reconciliation between the two parties  the Pakistan Peoples Party and the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz)  that share the popular mandate. The spectre of prolonged instability it promises may take the country back to a past it is desperate to bury. Two, the fallout of this political confrontation may permanently impair Pakistans ability to take on the challenge against terrorism, which is now its topmost priority.         
	All said and done, it must be admitted that the supreme court, in awarding its respective verdicts on Nawaz Sharif and Shahbaz Sharif, has gone strictly by the law. Mr Nawaz Sharif had been convicted of hijacking the plane on which the then army chief was travelling, and Mr Shahbaz Sharif still has a case of loan default against him. However, as the National Reconciliation Ordinance of 2007  which overturned graft rulings against Benazir Bhutto and her husband  has shown, convictions do not hold when occasions so demand. The fact that the president, Asif Ali Zardari, allowed the law to take its course has been held up by the Sharif brothers as evidence of his ploy to politically finish them off. There might be a grain of truth in that allegation. Repeated petitions have been filed against earlier orders of the court and election commission that allowed the Sharifs to contest the general elections and the bypoll. More important, governors rule has been imposed in Punjab, where any PML(N) leader other than the disqualified Mr Shahbaz Sharif could have become chief minister. These provoke suspicions of a larger gameplan. Mr Nawaz Sharifs personal attacks against the president and the alacrity with which the PPP is trying to marginalize the PML(N) by forging an alliance with the Pakistan Muslim League (Quaid) show that the popular leaders lack both decorum and sagacity. As the lawyers march  behind which the Sharifs have thrown their political weight  unfolds in the next few days, the absence of these attributes may have a telling consequence on the polity.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Let the buds grow
                                                                                                                 LET THE BUDS GROW                                  Malvika Singh                              
	Two days away from the first phase of voting for the new Lok Sabha, there is frenetic activity as political leaders criss-cross the countryside, trying desperately to reach out to their constituents. Alas, most of them have nothing much to say or anything different to offer. Most of them are shrieking abuse at their opponents, hurling accusations that stem from past actions. There is no mention at all of the present and of what the future could hold for a new generation raring to compete and get on with their lives sans the stale rhetoric of caste and hate. It is clear that the most definite and strong divide in India is that between the generations. The previous generation inherited the mantle of leadership post Independence and betrayed this nation by exclusive, divisive and exploitative politics misusing weaknesses, polarizing the diverse communities to strengthen their personal agendas in an effort to survive, but not deliver.        
	The younger leaders, the Omar Abdullahs, the Rahul and Priyanka Gandhis, the Sachin Pilots, the Jyotiraditya Scindias and suchlike, with the exception of Feroze Varun Gandhi, who has joined the chorus of hate and divisiveness, all speak a new and sane language, which is committed to undoing the mess that was thrust upon them. They are starting once again from the scratch, from the grassroots, and this will take time, much energy and disciplined hard work. Political jamborees, partnerships based on mere numbers and not ideas, exploitation of caste and class, hate and abuse, self-aggrandizement and fickle relationships based on time-bound, personal political gain, need to be purged for the buds to reappear and grow again. The greedy politicians who have ruled us for the last few decades and who continue to fight elections, unable to let go their lucrative profession, have left behind a diseased, disabled legacy.                
	Better late        
	It is a delight to hear new voices from the north, south, east and west representing another agenda for an India that is positive and unified. They speak with a vitality that has been missing from the political scene for years. For them, divisive politics is an anathema, a waste of valuable working time in a short span of life. They want to fulfil their dreams for a better India, and get a meaningful life for themselves and their progeny. Both are intertwined and therefore inseparable. For this lively generation that has witnessed the energy of their generation beyond the borders on television and is determined not to be left in the lurch by a selfish and corrupt political class, elections 2009 may be a semi-final. But it will ensure the beginning of the end of a political trajectory that set India back morally, culturally, economically and therefore, physically.        
	Back to our television screens  to see Sonia Gandhi as an ex tempore orator speaking with passion juxtaposed with Mayavati reading from a piece of paper is a visual commentary on our times. The press that went on and on about the fact that Sonia would read her speeches never mentions the truth while talking about Mayavati. Double standards at their best! Then there is Priyanka  candid, confident, smiling, gentle yet socking it to them without arrogance or irritation. A defensive Narendra Modi reacting with hate and anger becomes a weak counterpoint. Priyankas opponents would do well to learn some lessons in dignified electioneering. Four fronts are fighting to bag bunches of numbers so that they could align for selfish reasons to grab personal power at the Centre regardless of ideology, India and Bharat. In this pathetic scenario, Rahul Gandhi stands apart as he tries to build the base of the Congress from the ground upwards, starting from drawing in new memberships. The renewal will have to come from the base, and better late than never!

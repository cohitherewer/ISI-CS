	Dear Herr Doctor:        
	You are already 10 months behind the manuscript of Das Kapital which you have agreed to write for us. If we do not receive the manuscript within six months, we shall be obliged to commission another to do this work.        
	 Letter to Karl Marx from his Leipzig publisher              
	Many authors believe that because a book is very different from a journalistic piece of writing, delivery schedules can be pushed back without great cost either to themselves or the publishers. This may have been true over 100 years ago in Marxs time but no longer in the highly competitive world of publishing where every title has to jostle for space and attention to be sold. With computerization of the production process, schedules are drawn up at least six months in advance and along with them pre-publication orders that offer retailers the most lucrative trade terms: delays mean loss in sales which is often irrecoverable because there are so many new books chasing overcrowded markets. Since publishing is a collaborative effort between the author and the publisher, who is to blame for delays?        
	Take the author, the originator of the work. According to the publishers contract, the author has to fulfil two conditions. First, he must deliver the work, either in typescript format or as an electronic file on a CD or floppy, complete in all respects within the specified time, plus or minus a few months, extendable only if the publisher agrees to do so. Second, the author must agree to a deadline of turning in the proofs, instead of sitting on them, as publishers put it. Also, attached to this clause is the injunction that the author will not make any substantive changes to the original copy that would require resetting sections of the work.         
	Both these clauses are often violated by authors. Complete in all respects indicates the things that go into the making of the finished book: language, style, subject matter, illustrations and all the niggardly details that distinguish one book from another.         
	Under the contract, the author has to provide these details. Language and style are editorial questions that cant be defined or described and are usually left to the discretion of the author, unless they are ungrammatical and clumsy; but checking the subject matter for facts is the publishers job who is responsible for errors in the book. Quite often, dates, spellings of names and changes in place names have to be corrected because the author has glossed over them. No publisher can send the copy he receives from the author straight to the press without going over it carefully.        
	Proofing has always been troublesome. Most authors cannot be trusted to read proofs like professionals do. Proofs arent read but looked at without necessarily making sense of what the words add up to. Authors leave the most obvious mistakes uncorrected. Publishers have to rectify them. This takes time, especially if the book is technical in nature with illustrations, diagrams and mathematical tables.Very rarely (at least in India) does the author produce a near-perfect copy; loose ends have to be tied up at the publishers end. This ought to have been done by the author.

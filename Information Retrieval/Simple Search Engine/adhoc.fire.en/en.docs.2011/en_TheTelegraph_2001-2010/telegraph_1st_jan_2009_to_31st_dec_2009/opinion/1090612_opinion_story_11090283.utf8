	Colonialism, Modernity and Religious Identities: Religious Reform Movements in South Asia Edited by Gwilym Beckerlegge, Oxford, Rs 650        
	Religion has always played a key role in human societies even before the Renaissance. Down the ages, scholars of different schools of thoughts have tried to assess its importance. It was only under the socialists that religious scholarship met with a speed-breaker. However, with the collapse of the Socialist regime, the study of religion gained momentum once again.         
	Historical scholarship has never before been so busy with the study of religious resurgence. In South Asia, both Islam and Hinduism are being given their due importance. If the former is receiving attention after 9/11, the latter is generating interest as the Indian diaspora imparts a new meaning to the Hindu religion. It may sound paradoxical that with the arrival of modern times, religious groups in South Asia are trying to assert their identities in ways that may not be progressive. But that is how religious movements evolve. They do not happen according to the wishes of theorists or thinkers. The silver lining is that today scholars are taking a keen interest in all religions. They are following every movement, even its aberrations, with minute scrutiny. This book is one such attempt to study the religious reform movements in South Asia since the colonial period vis--vis what is termed by scholars as modernity.        
	There are ten essays, together with an introduction by Gwilym Beckerlegge, that sets the tone of the book. These pieces are spread over two parts. The first explores the formation of religious identities in relation to India. The second charts how diverse religious movements respond to the colonial concept of modernity. Although several models of modernity are in vogue, no attempt has been made to fit the essays accordingly.         
	In the first section, three essays deal with Islam, while two others discuss Hindu religious identity. Ian Coplands Evolving Muslim Loyalties in Princely North India and Diego Abenantes Canal Colonies and Muslim Revivalism in Multan approach Islamism from unusual angles. Much has been written on the Tablighi Jamaat, but Dietrich Reetz, in The Faith Bureaucracy of the Tablighi Jamaat, explores the secret of the organization which makes it the largest living Islamic movement in the world. Similarly, two essays focus on the reform movements in Hinduism in the 19th century.        
	The second section of the book takes up both Islam and Hinduism and tests them according to concepts of modernity. Beckerlegge gives equal weightage to both the religions. There is an interesting study of the Ahl-i Hadis movement in the late-19th and 20th century by Martin Riexinger. Daniela Bredi writes on womens role in Indo-Muslim society as seen through the female members of the Tyabji family. Two pieces in this part are on new religious movements and on the topic of Orientalism, which also looks at problems of historiography in India.         
	This book mainly confines itself to Islamic and Hindu movements in different parts of India. Movements like Buddhism and Jainism do not come within its ambit. The essays explore the significant movements of these major religions in different periods of time as well as go into the interpretations of their texts wherever possible. Even the question of gender and the importance of art are not left unexplored. And yet it seems as if the scholars have avoided a few delicate questions: for instance, why some religious organizations, or the political parties patronizing them, have reverted to extreme ways that have caused so much of harm to Indian society?         
	However, the book has taken up some key topics that relate different religious movements not only with the past but also with the present and the future. It will interest scholars and ordinary readers interested in religious reforms in India.

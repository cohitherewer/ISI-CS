	Mission unsuccessful                  
	Sir  It is unfortunate that Indias maiden lunar mission involving Chandrayaan-1 had to be called off a year earlier than the scheduled end (Isros private lunar eclipse, Aug 31). The problems that led to the mission being called off allegedly began as early as April. Even before the missions successful completion, Isro chairman, G. Madhavan Nair, was awarded the Padma Vibhushan. Nair should now own up to his responsibility in the missions failure and return the national award.          
	Yours faithfully,

	True visionary          
	Sir  An era in American politics came to an end with the death of Edward M. Kennedy (Family surprises, Sept 2). The senator, who died at the age of 77 after a long battle with brain cancer, was the only one among the four Kennedy brothers who died a natural death. Two of the brothers, John and Robert, were murdered, and the eldest brother, Joseph Kennedy Jr, died in World War II.           
	Kennedy had been a senator for more than 47 years. During his political career, he successfully engineered legislations that have had a direct impact on the lives of Americans. Unfortunately, his lifelong goal of universal healthcare reforms still remains unrealized. Barack Obama, one hopes, will bring this issue up as he goes ahead with an overhaul of the American healthcare system.           
	Kennedy had been in the Senate for as long as many Indian politicians remain in Parliament. But unlike him, Indian politicians often fail to do justice to their post, and remain apathetic towards the people. India needs politicians like Edward Kennedy who would set an example by working across the party line to build a stronger nation. But will Indian leaders take note and follow in his steps?          
	Yours faithfully,      
B.K. Chatterjee, Faridabad 

      
	Sir  Contrary to praises from liberal pundits, Edward Kennedy will be remembered as a staunch promoter of nihilistic causes such as abortion, embryonic stem cell research and gay marriage. His support of anti-life, anti-family issues was constant a source of embarrassment for the Catholic community in the US.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Paul Kokoski, Ontario, Canada

      
	Sir  The era of John F. Kennedys presidency (1960-63) was significant for its impact not only on the United States of America but also on the rest of the world (Teddy who saw the tide of Bangla misery, Aug 27). Edward, like his brother John, was an undisputed champion of peace and equal rights for the working class. There are very few people around the world who have not heard about the Kennedy family or have not mourned the deaths of the Kennedy brothers. Edward, a liberal Democrat and a towering personality, will be remembered for a long time to come.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot  
	Sir  Even before the dust over Shah Rukh Khans harassment in an American airport could settle, Ruchir Joshis article, This land is my land (Aug 26), revealed yet another story of a South Asian mans humiliation at the hands of US airport officials. These chronicles make it evident that US officials are prejudiced against South Asians and treat them condescendingly. America must ensure that the laws are equal for everyone. Indians never treat American tourists in the same manner. It may be because our culture teaches us to treat guests with respect. But that does not mean Indians should suffer this kind of injustice in silence.          
	Yours faithfully,         S.M. Borbora,Tezpur, Assam

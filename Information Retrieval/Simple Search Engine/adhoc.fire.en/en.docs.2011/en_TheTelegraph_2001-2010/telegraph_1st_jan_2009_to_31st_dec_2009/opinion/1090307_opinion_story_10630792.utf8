	First port of call                  
	Sir  Bid to hasten Kulpi Port (March 5) was amusing for the old-timers of the Calcutta port. The views of the promoter of the proposed Kulpi port and those of the state chief secretary are disturbingly similar. The Calcutta port is right in asking the former to share certain costs. The Calcutta port and port commissioners have, for ages, nurtured the shipping activities from the shore side in the eastern region. No agency, other than the Calcutta Port Trust, has been created as yet by the Centre or state government for maintaining navigation on the Hooghly.           
	Yours faithfully,         Nirmal Kumar Jha, Calcutta
        
	Fear rules          
	Sir  Ashok V. Desai perpetuates some of the cherished colonial assumptions of the 19th century when he writes about the thugs who used to waylay travellers on trunk roads, kill them and rob them till the 1870s (The Speir Dynasty, Feb 24). The British perception of thugsas a national fraternity of murderers was a colonial construction. There was a small core of families that had been murderers for generations. These people recruited bands from their local areas towards the end of the 18th century and after the British defeat of the Marathas in 1803. The crusading tone of the British Indian administration of the 1830s had played up these small, local marauding groups, calling them thugs, who were seen as embodying the typically Indian national character. For W.H. Sleeman, the thugs were an ubiquitous and immutable feature of Indian life. Even for a 20th-century historian like Percival Spear, whom young IAS aspirants still read, thugs were a special type of landless or uprooted men looking for a leader and reckless from despair. But none of this is true.           
	The development of the idea of the criminal tribe was the merging of two traditions. First, there were the Brahmin subordinates of the new British rulers. The fear of these Brahmins was that of the cultivators of those who hunt and gather, the higher castes fear of the casteless, the Hindus fear of non-Hindus, and bureaucrats fear of an uncontrollable population.          
	The British, on the other hand, had long associated migration with vagabondage, forests with outlawry, in their laws. To this mix were added the more recent ideas of criminals as a race apart, and in line with 19th-century notions of progress, the idea of redeemability. This entire heritage was institutionalized in the criminal laws of 19th-century India. All of this suggests that one of the most significant changes the 19th-century colonizers undertook was to close off military entrepreneurship, the trading of services for rights to agricultural produce and to develop land.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Help them survive          
	Sir  Asias largest remaining population of wild elephants is found in the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve. These creatures are threatened by a variety of factors. The chief, and also the easiest to remedy, is the proposed relocation of four governmental check-posts on the inter-state highway linking Bangalore with Calicut near Muthanga. If implemented, this would prevent the annual migration of the wild elephants between Tamil Nadu and Kerala that is necessary for their survival.           
	We request the Kerala government to move these check-posts outside the forest corridor, and to take a few other measures to ensure the well-being of these magnificent animals. These include making sure that trenches do not block the elephants access to the Nulpuzha river within this corridor. The movement of vehicles on the Bangalore-Calicut highway between 11 pm and 4 am should also be prohibited.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Change indeed                  
	Sir  The nasty act of a teacher-cum-councillor at the office of the district inspector of schools in Siliguri deserves to be condemned by one and all (A spitting image of what ails Bengals education June 8). When a teacher spits on the face of the school inspector, what lessons do the students, whose minds are being shaped by the teachers, learn? The offender, Ranjan Sil Sharma, is also the secretary of the Trinamul Congress-backed Bengal Primary School Teachers Association. He has surely been emboldened by the recent success of the political party he belongs to. But he should remember that such acts as his would not be tolerated by the same electorate that has voted overwhelmingly for the TMC. After all, the majority of the people are as interested in good governance as in the good image of teachers. Sil Sharma should have been dignified, humble but firm in dealing with the school inspector. His misdemeanour and the subsequent denial of his filthy action (that too in the presence of the media) will definitely not be tolerated by his peers. Let us see how his party decides to deal with him.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Ranesh Ch. Dey, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Welcome to the circus! Welcome to Change! Can a person like Ranjan Sil Sharma be called a teacher? If he has to teach, he should be entrusted with the responsibility of educating animals rather than human beings. It is traumatic to see the people we have just voted for behave in a beastly manner. We tremble to think what will happen if the party he belongs to gets to rule West Bengal one day. If the TMC thinks that its supporters can get away with such misconduct, then it is mistaken. If this how they are going to behave, then people would not hand over power to the party in the future. The public does not want leaders who are not fit to be at the helm of affairs.          
	Can the people of Bengal expect some corrective gesture from Mamata Bannerjee in relation to Sil Sharmas conduct? She should take some action if she is serious about her partys future.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Way to go          
	Sir  I am a resident of the Bondel Gate area since November 2007. I would like to draw the attention of the railway minister to a few problems we are facing. Vast tracts of land adjacent to the railway tracks from Ballygunge station to Park Circus are occupied by unauthorized persons. They have constructed permanent structures on the encroached land and are engaged in many illegal activities, including the buying and selling of illicit liquor, drug peddling and such like. There are illegal occupants and hawkers not only on the railway lands but also on the roads connecting the Bondel Gate flyover. They also need to be evicted and the roads broadened to facilitate smooth traffic.          
	There is no footbridge at Bondel Gate. As a result, all pedestrians, including children and the elderly, have no option but to walk across the potholed railway tracks with their luggage on a daily basis. This causes frequent accidents on the tracks. The railway authorities need to conduct a survey to assess the situation and initiate corrective action on its basis.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Ranjan Mukherjee, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Recently, my daughter and I went to Howrah from Nagpur and then back to Nagpur by the extended Bilaspur-Rajdhani Express. In the journey from Nagpur to Howrah, the quality of the food served was deplorable. And on the way back to Nagpur, the train travelled before time till Kalamna, and then was kept waiting in a filthy stretch for quite some time. As a result, it entered the platform at Nagpur behind schedule. I must say here that my journeys on the Howrah or Sealdah Rajdhani are usually memorable experiences, which give me no reason to complain. I hope that the Indian Railways would attach due importance to the Bilaspur-Rajdhani Express in so far as its running and the food provided on board are concerned.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Arindam Ghosh, Nagpur

                
	Sir  I went to Puri on June 4 by the Howrah-Puri Garib Rath and came back on June 8 by the down train. On both these occasions, I took a set of bedrolls for Rs 25. In each case, when I asked for receipts, the attendants were reluctant and said that the train ticket examiners would issue them. But this did not happen ultimately. Moreover, during the journey on June 4, soiled bedrolls were supplied. I am sure that the attendants are manipulating the number of bedrolls issued to passengers and, in the process, causing the railways to lose a huge amount of money.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Himansu Kumar Kundu, Barrackpur 

                
	Shuttlecock          
	Sir  I live near Ruby Hospital, and work in Salt Lake. On my way to office, I have to take a bus from the Ruby Hospital stop. Till a few months back, the bus stop was right at the Ruby crossing. Then it was shifted 30-40 metres to the south, towards Park Circus. I know that bus stops are usually located a few yards away from crossings to prevent traffic commotion. But following this practice at the Ruby crossing has resulted in chaos.           
	Whether a bus would stop at the crossing or at the relocated bus stop now depends entirely on the traffic sergeant who may or may not be at his kiosk. As long as the sergeant remains present, all buses stop in their proper place. But if he is absent, the entire 30-40 metres stretch becomes a bus stop. During office hours, we become shuttlecocks under the scorching sunshine, running between one bus and the other. I have tried standing at the proper bus stop when there is no sergeant, but in the end, I had to break the rule and come to the Ruby crossing to take a bus.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Supriya Das, Calcutta

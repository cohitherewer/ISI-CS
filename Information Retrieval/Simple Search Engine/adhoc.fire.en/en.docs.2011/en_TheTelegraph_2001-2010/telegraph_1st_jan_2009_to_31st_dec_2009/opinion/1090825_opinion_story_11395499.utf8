	Jobs for the boys is a flourishing industry under the present government. The board of trade is an utterly superfluous body. It had not met for a long time, and no one had noticed its absence. Many of its members had gone on to other things. But having pleased the prime minister in the first term, Anand Sharma has been rewarded with the commerce ministry. Being a man of diligence, he asked his commerce secretary what was waiting to be done. He was rewarded with a pile of files. He picked up the first one to discover the somnolent state of the board of trade. He found new members, called a meeting, and dealt out almonds and tea. The members of the board of trade know their business; it is to ask for more. They wailed about the catastrophic fall in exports, which were 30 per cent down in April-June vis--vis last year. That gave him something to worry about. He opened the next file, and found that no trade policy had been issued for 500 days. He asked his bureaucrats to produce one immediately; it is scheduled to be inaugurated in front of flashing camera bulbs on September 1.         
	Amongst other things, the policy is expected to give export incentives  a polite name for subsidies  to labour-intensive export industries like textiles and gem-cutting. This would be a mistake. For one thing, a new trade policy is not necessary at all. The policy was scheduled for last April. But since the government was absorbed in winning a general election, it had no time for a trade policy. And no one even noticed the lapse. The trade policy has been turned into doing favours to the governments favourite industries. These are only a few; the rest of industry never gives the trade policy a thought.         
	To his credit, Mr Sharma is not obsessed with the trade policy. He has promised to reduce transaction costs. There he faces his most formidable enemy, for the foremost producer of transaction costs is customs, with its insensitive, labour-intensive procedures. Knowing how difficult it is to move customs to do anything, Mr Sharma has thought of an interministerial committee. He is wasting his time. There have been interministerial committees before; the customs department has ignored them, and continued to do its worst. No finance minister, not even Manmohan Singh or P. Chidambaram, had the courage to take it on. Pranab Mukherjee is perhaps different. He has done everything, seen everything, and has no further expectations; he may be prepared to take the risk. If he is persuaded, he could set up an entirely internal mechanism to bring customs into the 21st century, and to convert them to functioning as customs departments in industrial countries do  entirely in the background, relying on software. Converting the finance minister to customs reform is the biggest service the commerce minister can render.

                                                                                                                 TOWARDS AN IDEAL WORLD                                  BONA FIDE - Malvika Singh                              
	While all magazines and newspapers speculate and then dissect the cabinet formation and repeat their rather superficial reasons for and against individuals and parties, India looks forward to a stable, inclusive government that will continue to deliver on the agenda it had set for itself in 2004. This time, with Nitish Kumar and Naveen Patnaik leading their states with a full mandate, and Mamata Banerjee looking forward to the assembly elections due in Bengal two years from now, the United Progressive Alliance has three states where it can establish and achieve productive Centre-state processes, which will enhance federal functioning.         
	This realization and commitment could take Indian democracy to another level of maturity, and revive poorer states that have extraordinary and finely-tuned cultural roots with the much needed inputs and collective strengths that will raise them to an economic level, which spells dignity and development.        
	In an ideal world, one which is not polarized with traditional likes and dislikes, Patnaik and Kumar should reach out to a Congress-led government at the Centre that has drawn a large mandate bucking anti-incumbency expectations. They should forge independent working arrangements with the Centre for the betterment of their respective states, without having to join the dispensation in Delhi and fight over cabinet berths. Support, after debate and dialogue on issues raised and tabled in Parliament, conducted in an intelligent, constructive and democratic manner, could set a trend for the future. This would lead India away from the murky, self-serving politics of the past and help build a vibrant, functioning, federal polity encompassing and respecting the diversity and plurality of the subcontinent.                
	Changed order        
	To begin with, Parliament must be allowed to function and any disruption of working sessions should carry a severe penalty. If the elected representatives cannot argue, discuss and debate like civilized individuals, they do not deserve to be where they are. This time, the people of India have suggested that they find the divisive politics of blackmail, dalali and deal-making repulsive and unpalatable. They stand united on national issues, and are sensitive enough to appreciate the nuanced differences in state, local and national concerns. They have been exploited by immature, and divisive, coalition politics. They have been victims of the degeneration of the political space, orchestrated by self-serving leaders, and want no more of it despite the chorus from the intelligentsia that coalitions are here to stay.        
	The days of leaders without a clear vision, accompanied by relentless, high-pitched rhetoric, is waning. Rahul Gandhi, whether one likes it or not, has begun to change the narrative and shift focus. His press conferences have been serious and thoughtful. The press, unused to serious deliberations, is at sea. False assumptions, such as the one suggesting that Digvijay Singh is his chief mentor, are doing the rounds. Why cant the media give Rahul Gandhi his due for leading the charge of the youth brigade? Had senior leaders done what he is doing, the Congress would not have descended into abject decline.         
	When Rahul Gandhi entered the fray, he drew up his blueprint, put together his team and began to work at it, infusing the Youth Congress with a new energy. He sensibly ignored the press that ridiculed and mocked him. When the results hit the screen, the press was caught unawares and shamelessly turned turtle showering unadulterated praise. Having published carefully calibrated plants handed over by senior Congressmen who wanted to discredit Rahul Gandhi, these newsmen now stand discredited. India is in transition.

	Language lessons                  
	Sir  During his inaugural address, the president of Afghanistan, Hamid Karzai, spoke in his mother tongue. This should be a lesson for Indians, who are increasingly forsaking their native languages for English. Our IT industry is proud that its existence depends on its knowledge of English that enables it to perform the jobs that the West does not want. In colonial times, Indians were shipped as coolies to the West Indies and Southeast Asia to work in the sugar and rubber plantations. Now, those working in the Indian IT industry have become cyber-coolies.          
	Yours faithfully,      
S. Kamat, Bardez, Goa

      
	Think anew          
	Sir Tapan Raychaudhuris article argues that Indias education system is better off without interference from the political and business classes (A question of status , Nov 24). Many of the recent proposals of the human resource development ministry, including those for creating world-class universities, relate to Indias aspirations of gaining a reputation in the international educational arena. However, such an aim does not improve the quality of higher education imparted to students. The degrees awarded to students seem to be mere pieces of paper which do not signal any real achievement.          
	As Raychaudhuri says, a maturer step would be to upgrade the existing universities and colleges. This will automatically book a spot for Indian universities among the worlds top educational institutions. Students would be served better if instead of attempting tie-ups with MIT or Harvard, the glory of Jawaharlal Nehru University or Calcutta University is revived.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Abhirup Bhunia, Calcutta

      
	Sir  One has to agree with the contention of Tapan Raychaudhuri that by multiplying the number of universities, we are doing no good to our system of education. Education in West Bengal is largely run on oligarchic principles. Setting up colleges in the name of enlightenment is a sure way to ensure more votes for the politicians. In the last 30 years or so, a good number of wayside, nondescript colleges, mostly affiliated to the monolithic Calcutta University, have mushroomed in Bengal.           
	The university has to set questions for the screening tests keeping the dullest students in mind, as a high pass percentage among applicants will make the government, under whose guidelines the university has been set up, popular.           
	Presidency College, for example, works within the straitjacket of the archaic CU rules. Freeing Presidency from the clutches of CU will produce excellent results. With able teachers, hardworking students, and the autonomy to fix its own curricula and academic calendar, the college will be able to regain its reputation, even if the people running these institutions...continue to do so still.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Tapan Pal, Batanagar 

                          
	Back on track          
	Sir  It is heartening to know that Sushma Swaraj will be the leader of the Opposition once L.K. Advani decides to quit (Sushma buzz in BJP, Nov 21). A lady of grace, dignity and exemplary oratory skills, Swaraj has served the Bharatiya Janata Party with dedication over the years.           
	While other politicians in the party were busy bickering with one another and vying for important positions within the party, she had quietly and diligently been carrying on with her parliamentary duties. She had played an instrumental role in the general elections of 1999 that brought the National Democratic Alliance to power. She is the right person to bring the derailed BJP back on its tracks.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Arindam Das, Calcutta

	Calcuttas social and political history inspires two new Bengali plays, both of which dont lose the opportunity to take well-deserved swipes at corruption and anarchy in government machinery. Swapna-sandhanis Darjiparar Marjinara (picture) takes the form of a docudrama about Sonagachhi, in which the writer, Bratya Basu, rejects its usual depiction in Bengali art and literature in favour of thinly-linked scenes closer to the exploitative ground reality. So, as a drunk intellectual takes a young scribe on a history lesson through the by-lanes, we see the prostitutes, pimps, customers and tea-vendors in an attempt at slice-of-life verisimilitude. Horrifying snippets of innocent girls forced into the trade jostle with parodies of location shoots by film crews. Basu successfully indicts the State, including ministers, for doing nothing, because the huge illegal revenue generated by this industry keeps thousands, from constables to the highest authorities, happy. However, his intended attack on globalization (we prostitute ourselves as commodities) appears somewhat far-fetched in this context.        
	Koushik Sen directs an ensemble performance in appropriately garish colours, and wisely does not impose any stylistic gimmick as he sometimes has in the past. He handles with care Basus poetic language  deliberately ironic for such a subject  which extends to quotes from Rabindranath and Jibanananda to Kabir Suman. He gives one of his more realistic portrayals as an impotent rich businessman, complemented by the prostitute he visits, played with perfect cynicism by Ditipriya Sarkar. The lasting impression remains one of awe at the denizens ability to survive in this human miasma.        
	Naxalism continues to draw romanticized attention in Bengali artistic circles, though for one who has lived through those violent times, I wonder what fascination lies in the doctrine of killing class enemies. Luckily, Natyarghas Jatiya Sampatti does not wax as nostalgic about it as many misled others have, but swivels the spotlight on to present-day human-rights issues sparked off by an encounter in the 1970s.        
	In Ashesh Senguptas dramatization of Souren Basus story, a householder runs into big trouble after labourers hand over to him a casket they have dug up. Opening it, he finds evidently Naxal relics, which intrigue him. Word of the discovery spreads, and the police arrive to claim it, but our hero refuses. What happens as a result is for viewers to get to know. Suffice it to say here that Jatiya Sampatti embarrasses the state police no end  in case recent events and photographs of dozing cops havent done enough already. Debojit Banerjees direction is basic, allowing the chilling tale to speak for itself, and he ably acts the main role as the voice of individual freedom against the vicious oppressors.

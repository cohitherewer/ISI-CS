	The Election Commission will surely not disagree that it exists to ensure that the elections end up being a civilized affair. Anything contributing to that end cannot be against the larger interest of democracy (as the EC likes to put it). So it is alarming to see the EC taking for granted its legal right to set up shop in Calcuttas National Library, assuming that the larger interests of democracy would naturally prevail, in this case, over the readers entitlement to conditions allowing undisrupted study. The process of taking over is unilateral, heralded by a brief note from the EC, followed by an inspection. And the library has learnt from experience that the aftermath is not painless either. After the 2006 assembly elections, it took the library nearly a week to clear up the mess, and the damage, that the EC left in its wake, apart from the din of loudspeakers and vehicles while its officials were around. It is not just the EC that has ridden roughshod over the library, but institutions as diverse as the Calcutta police and the Confederation of Indian Industry have treated the place like a venue for public events. The library has the dubious distinction of having been apologized to by none less than the prime minister, who had said that he would not have attended a meeting held in the library had he known that the readers had been inconvenienced by the meeting.        
	Legally, it is within the ECs rights to requisition any public place for poll-related activities. But, unlike the electronic voting machines, which are prized for their non-human (and therefore unbiased) functioning, the EC is made up of members who are expected to be able to infuse the letter of the law with the spirit of human discrimination. It would surely think more than twice before exercising its right to take over, say, the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library in Delhi. It should also be possible for the EC to civilize the taking-over process, doing so in proper consultation with the users of the premises, and cleaning the place up before leaving. Otherwise, the EC would only be perpetuating the ethos of unthinking disruptiveness that characterizes the political machinery of the Indian State, as if nothing deserves to be spared the levelling spirit of the democratic carnival. The ECs role is to temper this attitude with discretion, instead of giving in to the general tendency of inconsiderately suspending normal life in the name of democracy.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Paperback Pickings
                                                                                                               Paperback Pickings
                
	A caged voice is set free                
	More salt than pepper: Dropping anchor with Karan Thapar (HarperCollins, Rs 399) is a selection of this gifted journalists witty columns penned for a daily for 12 long years. These incisive but warmly written pieces lay bare the mellower side of a man who is perhaps more renowned as an acerbic, unrelenting television journalist. There are plenty of delectable tidbits that are funny as well as perceptive: Indira Gandhi reflecting on how much easier it is for men to relieve themselves in public (All they have to do is pop behind a tree), Morarji Desais deliberate snub to the rituals of a public school, a young Thapars stockings rolling down to reveal hairy legs in the middle of a performance of Arms and the Man. Personal in tone and delightfully anecdotal, the book offers insights into the lives and times of India and many of its eminent citizens.                         
	The blue note book (Weidenfeld amp; Nicolson, Rs 250) by James A. Levine is, in many ways, much more than a simple tale about the triumph of the human spirit in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds. The blue note book is a metaphorical register of the voice of Batuk, a child prostitute who is no more than 15. Batuk, sold into the flesh trade by her father, lives in a cage on sleazy Common Street, and her diary records her observations about a murky world and its inhabitants. The language employed by Batuk in the journal is cleverly deceptive: although lyrical, it has none of the trappings of a juvenile fantasy. It is, in fact, a cold and savage account of Batuks struggle to transform the horror of her existence into something touching and beautiful. Batuks notes are poignant, but Levines occasional attempts at making Batuk sound poetic and philosophical are not as impressive.        
	26:11  Operation Mumbai (Krish International, Rs 200) by Atul Kulkarni confirms the fear that the tragedy in Mumbai now feeds an entire industry of literary projects that claims to provide meticulous and authentic accounts of that terrible time. Kulkarni, a journalist of some repute, enters the fray with his own version of a day-to-day account of the mayhem, but most of what Kulkarni writes is already in the domain of public knowledge. Shoddy editing (the absence of punctuation marks, for instance) and Uday Bopshettys insipid translation kill the hopes of salvaging Kulkarnis text.                                  
	Do you suppose its the east wind? Stories from Pakistan (Penguin, Rs 299) has been ably translated from Urdu by Muhammad Umar Memon, and brings together an eclectic collection of short stories from across the border. A book that counts among its contributors Saadat Hasan Manto and Altaf Fatima is unlikely to disappoint, and this holds true for this volume as well. Manto weaves his magic in For Freedoms Sake, in which a promising Congress politician sacrifices his love for the sake of Independence and, later, realizes the folly of such a choice. Fatima is as engaging in the title story that chronicles the pain of separation experienced by two people who profess different faiths at the time of Partition. Ghulam Abbass The Lure of Music, however, is the surprise offering, depicting in detail the inner transformation of a man who chooses the kotha culture over a secure, respectable middle class existence for the love of music.                        
	Googly: Branding on Indian turf (Icfai, $23.50) by Ramanujam Sridhar compiles the authors insightful analysis of issues such as branding and consumer behaviour. Sridhar, a cricket and advertising buff, has a disarming style that will impress experts in this field, and some of the case studies that he refers to will attract even laymen who know next to nothing about cricket or branding.

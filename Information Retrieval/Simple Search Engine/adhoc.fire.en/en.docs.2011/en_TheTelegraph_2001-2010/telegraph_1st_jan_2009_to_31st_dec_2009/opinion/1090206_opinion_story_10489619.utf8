	Tales kept in the closet                 
	Whistling in the dark: twenty-one queer interviews (Sage, Rs 375) compiles the narratives of a clutch of characters from different social strata to explore the queer experience in India. The editors, R. Raj Rao and Dibyajyoti Sarma, interview academics, gay-rights activists, students, autorickshaw-drivers and even undertrials to explore themes ranging from sexual identity and masculinity to heteronormativity and gay bashing. What comes out in the course of these disarming, yet perceptive, conversations are fragments of individual lives and the myriad social spaces they inhabit. Hoshang Merchant, who edited Yaraana, Indias first anthology of gay writing, holds forth on Foucault and homosexuality; Sushil Patil, a married small-town lecturer, recounts his double life, while Manish Pawar provides a graphic account of promiscuity in a taluka. The chronicles in the collection reveal the tragedies and minor triumphs of a people who are the inhabitants of a cruelly unequal world.                         
	Ghaffar Khan: Nonviolent Badshah of the Pakhtuns (Penguin, Rs 250) by Rajmohan Gandhi looks at the life and accomplishments of an extraordinary man: Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, born in the Pakhtun heartland, was a committed proponent of peace. So much so, he worked hard, and succeeded in changing the violent ways of his people  the fierce Pathans  in their struggle for a separate homeland. Later, heeding to the Mahatmas call of nonviolent resistance, he raised the Khudai Khidmatgars, an army of commoners devoted to mankinds service. Rajmohan Gandhi lucidly analyses Khans legacy to underline its contemporary relevance to these troubled times.                                   
	Sick Planet: The impact of Corporate Food and Medicine (HarperLitmus, Rs 295) by Stan Cox traces the present ecological turmoil to the critical spheres of healthcare and food. To undo the damage, Cox argues in favour of radical policies that are more comprehensive than the dilute quartermeasures outlined by the global powers that be. Cox also unearths disturbing links in a globalized world, such as the one between the burgeoning American healthcare industry and the high disease incidence from pharmaceutical pollution in India. The way out, Cox argues, revolves around scaling down consumption and a more equitable share of responsibility on the part of the developed world. Only these can save the fast-degrading environment.

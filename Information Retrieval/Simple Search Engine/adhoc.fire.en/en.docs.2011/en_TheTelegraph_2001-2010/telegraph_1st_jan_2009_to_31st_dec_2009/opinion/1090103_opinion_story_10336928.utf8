                                                                                                               Seasons songs
                            
	Artists of Kshanika presented a collection of Tagores songs of the seasons at Sisir Mancha on December 7. Choral songs like Aj bari jhare jharo jharo and E ki maya lukao kaya were quite accomplished, while some others like Enechho oi shireesh bakul (false start) and Taper taaper bandhon katuk (some jarringly loud voices) were not so. Of the individual singers, Sraboni Nag (Prakhar tapan taape), Chhanda Mukhopadhyay (Amal-dhabal paale legechhe) and Lopamudra Mukhopadhyay (Neel akasher kone kone) were impressive, both in terms of vocal quality and gayaki. Kakali Bhowmiks Charanrekha tabo and Anjana Gangulys Aj akasher moner katha scored on expression. Anuradha Dey sounded promising, but her voice was perhaps not in the best of health. The second half of the evening was given over to Ashis Bhattacharjee, who chose nine songs from the Puja and Prem sections of the Gitabitan. Songs like Pushpabane pushpa naahi, Dekhate pari ne keno praan, Ki ragini bajale and Swapane donhe chhinu ki mohe were rendered true to their letter and spirit in his well known, inward-looking, serene style.

	Glowing tribute        
	Gouriprasanna Smriti Samsad paid tribute to lyricist Gouriprasanna Mazumdar and composer Neeta Sen on December 5 at Madhusudan Mancha, where awards were also given for best lyricist (Nachiketa Chakraborty) and best composer (Debjit). Nachiketa sang a few lines of his own composition, Je bhabei tumi shokaal dekho, while Debjit sang two songs penned by Mazumdar. Emon of Indian Idol fame was quite disappointing, but Ruprekha Chatterjee, another Indian Idol product, gave a creditable performance. Two veteran artists, Banasree Sengupta and Nirmala Mishra, left a mark of their vintage. So did Parimal Bhattacharya, in Neeta Sens devotional composition, Ashtadhatur murti gorey. Shampa Kundus rendition of Jokhon tomar gaaner sargam came with the right kind of expressions. Sreeradha Bandyopadhyay sang three songs that were written by Mazumdar and composed by Shyamal Mitra and Neeta Sen. The soothing quality of the singers voice suited the songs very well. The playful numbers by Rajasree Bandyopadhyay were well executed, but the same cannot be said of Chhanda Deys Jhanak jhanak kanak kankan baaje.

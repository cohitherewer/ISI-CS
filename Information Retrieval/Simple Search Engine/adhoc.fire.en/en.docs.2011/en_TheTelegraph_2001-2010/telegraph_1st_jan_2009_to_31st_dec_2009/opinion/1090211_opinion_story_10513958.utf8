	Is the Indian democracy coming of age? There seems to be a possibility now that adult content will be allowed back on television in India. It appears to be dawning on the Centre that a liberal image may not only be more strategic but also less work (of a particularly futile kind) for the information and broadcasting ministry. A committee set up to review the existing laws and regulations concerning censorship in TV and cinema could have sparked off such a practical and ideological rethink. Nothing could be better for the health and maturity of a modern democracy, and for the image of a polity. The internet in a globalized world makes any attempts at centralized control of viewership appear ridiculously regressive. Only the paranoid authoritarianism of something like the Chinese State (which perceives Google as threatening) would muster up the resources to sustain absolute censorship. In the Indian case, the change is expected to happen primarily at the moral level, and that too is reassuring, to begin with. The information and broadcasting ministry, both in the Congress-led and the Bharatiya Janata Party-led regimes, has shown an unsavoury interest in controlling content on moralistic grounds. Sex and nudity, more than violence, have been on its mind, and the ministry seems to think that every adult viewer is potentially corruptible. So adult content has been banned on TV since 2006, and only U-certified programmes can be shown for unrestricted public exhibition. Where that leaves notions of adulthood, choice and freedom is another question.         
	Some of this attitude will linger in spite of the rethink. There is an anxiety over keeping the definitions of adult content and pornography distinct. And adult programmes can only be shown between 11 pm and 4 am. Television sets can be switched off, and childrens viewing habits can be monitored, but the State need not have anything to do with these rudimentary acts of parental control. Censorship ends up infantilizing the entire adult population of a nation, wasting energy on useless and bigoted debate over the meanings of public morality, good taste and the denigration of women, the interpretation of which cannot be fixed by the State or any particular ideologically driven lobby. A modern democracy should be secure enough to allow such openness.

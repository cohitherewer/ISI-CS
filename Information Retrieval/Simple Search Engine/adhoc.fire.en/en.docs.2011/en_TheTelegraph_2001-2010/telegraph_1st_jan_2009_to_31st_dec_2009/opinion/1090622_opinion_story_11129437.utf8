	Lords of misrule                  
	Sir  Rudrangshu Mukherjee in Comrades never learn (June 09) has analysed the Communist Party of India (Marxist)s reactions to its election debacle as well as the peoples rejection of the party. The partys arrogance is manifest in the free run enjoyed by the Centre of Indian Trade Unions-controlled autorickshaws, which violate traffic rules at will while the police look the other way.           
	Contempt for the rule of law has marked this party. Lala Bangla chhere pala (Lala get out of Bengal) was a slogan directed at a judge with encouragement from the partys top leadership. Tasteless comments by party leaders against the governor did not go down well with the states people and the intelligentsia.           
	Thirty two years of Left rule have rendered the state backward in most areas of administration. While the state is unable to create surplus wealth, its resources are being drained as thousands seek higher education in other states and many more go elsewhere for better opportunities. The culture of Bangla bandhs has made things worse.          
	The state that stood at the forefront of the country till the 1950s and the early 1960s is now bracketed with the most backward states. Mediocrity is being preferred to excellence as a matter of policy in recruitment to key areas of administration in an attempt to perpetuate the partys sway over the people. The effects have been disastrous. Administration has collapsed for lack of direction and eminent educational institutions have become battlefields of mindless political rivalry and hooliganism. The party could not even field a good orator during the parliamentary debates.          
	While development took a backseat, the party and its men flourished with flows of money from invisible sources. The narcissistic leadership insulated itself from the people and fostered nepotism. The party leaders have lost interest in introspection as they are aware that their guiding philosophy has lost its relevance.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Manoj Kumar Majumdar, Calcutta              
	Sir  Does the present government of West Bengal deserve to remain in power? There has been almost no development. All roads except the Delhi and the Bombay roads are single-lane and in very bad condition. There has been no progress in industrialization and the power situation remains poor. Government hospitals are so bad that one would feel lucky to come out of them alive. The state of education does not bear mention. It has been a long time since anyone from West Bengal has been in the top-50 list of the Indian Administrative Services. Per capita income in rural and suburban Bengal is very low, leaving the people with little purchasing power. Aid coming from the Centre is not utilized owing to incapable officials and party interference.          
	As a result of economic pressure, common people have become impatient. The CPI(M) seems to want such a situation to continue. Lalgarh is a case in point. It is an eruption of popular impatience. The question there is not of Maoist presence. Ultimately, it is the backlash of the deprived and the poor who are in the mood to take revenge for underdevelopment and misappropriation of public money by the ruling party. In such a situation the governor should intervene and call for assembly elections.                     
	Yours faithfully,         Krishna Kamal Chakraborty,Gurgaon, Haryana                    
	Trouble in the hills          
	Sir  This refers to the ongoing crisis in the North Cachar Hills and the recent press release by the Janjati Faith and Culture Protection Forum about the complicity of some church organizations in sowing seeds of discord between the Dimasas and the Zeme Nagas.          
	As a resident of Haflong, I have an inkling as to the root cause of the current ethnic turmoil. It is reportedly being engineered by extremists riding on the issue of religious conversion. Tension has been simmering among the Zeme Nagas since some of their tribesfolk are Hindus and others Christian. The intrusion of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (Isak-Muivah) and the NSCN (Khaplang) only helped to skew the balance in favour of the latter by using sheer domination.           
	Meanwhile, the activities of the Dima Halam Daogah (Jewel) group could have been a reason for the alienation of other tribes (including the Zeme Nagas) from the Dimasas. But the Dimasas in general were never known to have sinister intentions against other tribes. However, the killing of two Naga youths at Mahur by suspected members of the DHD(J) group acted as the immediate cause of trouble, which was exploited by external forces to give the incident an ethnic overtone. The situation must be seen in the backdrop of the violence associated with the NSCN (I-M) and the NSCN(K) in other districts of Assam.          
	The prime minister and the home minister can no longer ignore this issue. A ministry of development of the north-eastern region is not enough. There must be a ministry of strategic affairs for the Northeast to be able to appreciate and solve the longstanding problems of the region, without which we will only witness a cycle of violence and frustration.           
	Does the United Progressive Alliance government want the Northeast to limp perpetually and remain dismembered from the political mainstream?          
	Yours faithfully,      
B. Phonglo,Haflong, Assam

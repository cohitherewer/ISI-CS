                                                                                                                 NEW CROP                                                    
	Believers in change from the grassroots have reason for hope. Women from landowning farmers households in Rae Bareilly are demanding recognition as independent farmers. Nothing could be more grassroot than that. The women work in the fields alongside their men; their labour is indispensable for the success of each crop. Yet at the end of the day they have nothing to their name, they are unpaid labourers on their husbands or father-in-laws land. With recognition and land rights would come the right to bank loans for seeds, as well as other advantages. But the women have not stopped short at just articulating the demand; they have made it a condition of their electoral support. The party that promises them this recognition will get their vote, they have said. The claiming of a right has been given a forceful political dimension, so that leaders have to contend with a sophisticated demand for social and economic self-sufficiency instead of a plea for benefits and advantages in the name of caste or class.        
	Change does not happen of a sudden. Giving women rights over the land they help to till had been proposed in a bill in 2006, but nothing had been done about it since. Meanwhile, a movement has taken shape, with the women uniting with a single  but not simple  aim, helped by non-governmental organizations and by the thrust from self-help groups which have tasted economic betterment in return for hard work. Although a resistance to gender discrimination is at the basis of the demand, it has acquired wider resonance by linking land ownership to labour input. The peculiarly touching justice of what the women want goes beyond mere legality. They are not claiming land by inheritance, something for which the court would be readily on their side. They are talking of a right acquired by merit, by work: a demand in tune with the era of market values.

	One of the unwritten rules of democracy is that being minister places a person above the pettiness of party politics. A minister owes responsibility to the office he occupies, the chair on which he sits. He has to rise, when the occasion so demands, above his personal prejudices or even the biases of the political party of which he is a member. Mukul Roy, the Union minister of state for shipping, violated this simple convention on Tuesday. It has been reported that he walked out of a meeting of the Bengal National Chamber of Commerce to which he had been invited as chief guest. The ostensible reason for Mr Roys exit was that he found he had to share the dais with two ministers of the West Bengal government, Nirupam Sen and Asok Bhattacharya, who belong to the Communist Party of India (Marxist). Trinamul Congress, the political party to which Mr Roy owes allegiance, has taken a decision not to share any platform with CPI(M) ministers and leaders at any private event. The quotation marks around the word, private, are deliberately put and are significant. It is difficult to define what is private for a person who is in public and political life. Mr Roy was not attending a dinner or a function at an individuals house. It is difficult to describe a meeting of a chamber of commerce as a private event. What is of importance is that neither Mr Sen nor Mr Bhattacharya was present at the meeting in their individual capacity but because they hold ministerial office. Mr Roy and his political party are welcome to harbour any grievance they want against any political party, but he cannot display prejudice against ministerial office.        
	Mr Roys behaviour underlines a feature of political life in India, which is a cause for concern for all those who value democracy and the ethics associated with it. This is the failure to distinguish between an individual and the office he holds. The dignity of public office, irrespective of the person who holds it, is critical for the proper functioning of democratic institutions. There is something called peer-group protocol that demands that ministers show respect for their counterparts even when political and ideological differences divide them. Mr Roy refused to recognize this protocol and thus made a spectacle of himself. There are others, like Mr Roy, who are new to public office. They must learn propriety.

                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Simplicity sells                  
	Sir  Sunanda K. Datta-Rays article, Put your china away (Sept 19), offered an insightful analysis of the current debate on politicians practising austerity. Datta-Ray has rightly pointed out that no single party can be held responsible for making all this fuss about being austere since Indians are obsessed about leaders practising austerity to show that they are dedicated to the welfare of the countrymen. Indians tend to lay importance on outward displays of virtue, but often fail to redress the hollowness of these gestures. This is why politicians who have done nothing constructive during their tenures can still hope to get re-elected easily if only they can drum up mass sentiment at the right time.          
	The purpose behind this sudden austerity drive is to woo voters. Most of them are poor, and are likely to vote for a candidate whose simple lifestyle strikes a familiar chord with them. People must realize that those who join politics are sure to harbour a desire for power and perks that come with it. In this, they are no different from those in other professions. Selfless service, sacrifice and putting the nation above everything else are ideas that seldom find real-life practitioners, although preachers abound.           
	Shashi Tharoor, having spent much of his career in a sophisticated professional environment abroad, failed to tap into the politics of managing mass sentiment that is the characteristic feature of Indian democracy. His usage of phrases such as cattle class and holy cows, which earned the wrath of his partymen, reflects his ignorance of the ground realities of Indian politics. All the noise about politicians travelling economy class on flights is unlikely to achieve much for the nation. It is the common people who will have to foot the extra bills for making security arrangements for the VIPs and their numerous aides. If affluent politicians part with a share of their fortune to create a cash pool that can be used to help the poor, it would be a better way to show that they are one with the people. Preaching austerity while stashing away millions in secret hardly makes any sense.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Alokananda Bhattacharyya, Guwahati               
	Sir  Sunanda K. Datta-Ray writes sarcastically about the recent austerity drive adopted by ministers. He points out, Egalitarian affectation at the top will not stop us from creating our own titled elite of lok matas, gurujis, shaheeds, deshaprans, deshabandhus and deshapriyas. Indians love to idolize famous personages: we call our favourite cricketer maharaja, our favourite film star mahanayak, the poet laureate gurudev, and so on. Austerity has been conceived by Indian politicians as ostentatious frugality. It serves a political purpose, and is not an economic proposition. It would be wrong to think that the country will be able to bolster its economy by practising austerity, as the amount of money thus saved would be paltry. However, the symbolic value of austere living by those holding high offices cannot be denied. The governors recent gesture of switching off power for two hours in the Raj Bhavan was not meant to improve power supply in Calcutta, but to give out a message of solidarity to the people  that the governor shared their concerns.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta

                
	A clarification          
	Sir  This is with reference to the news report titled, Chopper ride? Ministers skip Shillong meet (Sept 12). The report is full of errors and seeks to distort the facts. The correct facts are as follows: the press information bureau organizes an annual and not biannual conference on social and infrastructure issues in the Northeast to which editors/senior writers are invited from all over India. The conference was planned for September 18 and 19, and six ministers, including the Union minister for information and broadcasting, Ambika Soni, and B.K. Handique, Union minister of development of the north-eastern region and mines, had confirmed their attendance. All the ministers were scheduled to reach Shillong by road from Guwahati. There were no arrangements or plans for any helicopter travel.           
	The conference has been postponed due to logistic reasons by the PIB. There was no question of any minister backing out after giving their confirmation. We would like The Telegraph to publish this clarification to dispel the impression that Union ministers are reluctant to travel to the Northeast.                     
	Yours faithfully,         Neelam Kapur,        Principal Director General (Media and Communication),     Press Information Bureau,     Government of India,  New Delhi           
	Our correspondent replies: My report was not about Union ministers reluctance to travel to the Northeast but was on their hesitation to take a chopper ride from Guwahati to Shillong following the death of the Andhra Pradesh chief minister in a tragic crash. I had a firm tip-off, later confirmed by officials of both rural development and information and broadcasting ministries, who provided the details of the schedule.   
	I had cross-checked these facts with officials at Shillongs Barapani airport, and they had confirmed the cancellation of helicopter trips ministers were meant to take to and from Guwahati.

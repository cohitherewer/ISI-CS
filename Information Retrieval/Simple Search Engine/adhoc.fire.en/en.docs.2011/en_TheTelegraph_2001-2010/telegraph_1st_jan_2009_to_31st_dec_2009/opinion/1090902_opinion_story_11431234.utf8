The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Letters to Editor
                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Troubled times                  
	Sir  The editorial, Deepening Saffron (Aug 30), rightly states that with Atal Bihari Vajpayee indisposed and L.K. Advani under attack, the Bharatiya Janata Party has been left without a credible leader even as it grapples with the worst crisis in its history. Inner strife seems to be tearing the party apart. Even after the chintan baithak in Simla, the BJP remains directionless and confused. If the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief, Mohan Rao Bhagwat, had his way, he would have liked to put an end to the political, ideological and organizational problems that have come to plague the party. Bhagwat attempted a course correction in Simla, but he could not take it to its logical conclusion.          
	The chintan baithak revolved around Jaswant Singhs new book, which resulted in his expulsion from the party. There is no harm in a politician writing a book, but he must leave the business of interpreting history to historians. The partition of India was the handiwork of the British. They sold their idea to Mohammad Ali Jinnah who played along merrily. It may be an unpopular contention, but one must admit that the Partition proved to be a blessing for India. The country is merrily chugging along with its diverse faiths and people, unlike its neighbour, Pakistan, which is now in a mess. Those who lament the division of India do not understand that had this not been done, things would have turned out worse. The BJP must contemplate as to whether it is ready to take up the challenge of representing the whole, and not a part, of India. The present crisis is, in fact, an opportunity to change the partys views. If the BJP loses this opportunity, it might be too late to undo the damage.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Dilbag Rai, Chandigarh

      
	Sir  The real reason for the BJPs downfall is the contradiction that lies between ideology and pragmatism. It is a common experience in politics that a party cannot win elections in India without the help of the Muslim vote. L.K. Advani and Sudheendra Kulkarni tried to lure Muslims by praising Jinnah during their trip to Pakistan. The RSS raised a hue and cry about it without understanding that the party would not be able to win back power unless it stopped alienating Muslims. Knowledgeable leaders such as Kulkarni are an asset to any political outfit. He should find a place in the party, and not Rajnath Singh who is hell-bent on destroying the BJP.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
B.K. Bose, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  The BJP is the victim of its own failures. In spite of the much-hyped India shining campaign, a complacent BJP lost the elections in 2004. In 2009, the BJP lost again as the voters decided to elect a secular and stable government. Since then, partymen have been behaving in an unacceptable manner with senior leaders venting their anger against others or airing views that are contrary to the party ideology. Jaswant Singh was expelled for reasons that were too weak to be justified; Arun Shourie publicly described the BJP as a runaway kite (kati patang), while Vasundhara Raje initially refused to resign as leader of the Opposition in Rajasthan. This is perhaps the beginning of a great fall that the BJP is likely to experience sooner than later.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Md Ziyaullah Khan, Delhi

                
	Sir  The present crisis in the BJP reflects poorly on the leaders who seem to be clueless about who will succeed L.K. Advani. The growing dissidence among party members and the recent expulsion of a senior leader seem to indicate that a change in leadership is imminent. But, unfortunately for the BJP, it is yet to find a successor for Advani. The party has dug its own grave by following its Hindutva agenda and has been crippled by the want of an able leader to guide its squabbling members. Getting rid of senior leaders on flimsy grounds will not help the BJP at this crucial hour, and members need to stay united to prevent the party from falling apart.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Ashok Jayaram, Bangalore

                
	Sir  The turf war in the BJP is between Rajnath Singh who is not a mass leader and an ageing L.K. Advani who wants to stick to his post and control the party. The rising tide of rebellion in the party may lead to a clutch of leaders leaving the party, resulting in the depletion of its think-tank. The BJP will then be left with mediocre, inexperienced netas. The prevailing situation in the BJP is a classic example of a weak and ineffective leadership trying to wriggle its way out of trouble. One does not know why Advani, who was thwarted in his ambitions of becoming the prime minister after the last elections, has decided against bowing out gracefully. His position has been further compromised after his bluff on the Kandahar episode got exposed. It is inconceivable that a dreaded terrorist could have been released in exchange of abducted air passengers without the knowledge of the then home minister. Advani is under fire because he has yielded ground that can be exploited by his detractors. He has frittered away the gains of a long and rewarding career in politics because of this one act of indiscretion.           
	Yours faithfully,      
S. Kamat, Bardez, Goa

                
	Parting shot          
	Sir  If the Congress-NCP alliance wins a record third consecutive term in the forthcoming polls in Maharashtra (State polls on October 13, Sep 1) it should thank a disunited Opposition and the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena for the success.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Vineet Phadtare, Mumbai

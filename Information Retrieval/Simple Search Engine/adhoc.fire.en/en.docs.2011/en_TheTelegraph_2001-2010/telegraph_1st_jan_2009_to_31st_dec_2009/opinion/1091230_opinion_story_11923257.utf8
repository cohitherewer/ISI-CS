	Q:I am a 75-year-old widow. I have a property in my name. I have three daughters and one son. One daughter had a failed marriage. She has been living with me for the past 28 years and paying the property taxes and supporting me financially. My son is a central government employee and earns a good salary. Though he does not support me financially, he tortures my dependent daughter and me mentally and physically. I have lodged an F.I.R. against him. Can I transfer half of my property to my dependent daughter and the other half to my three granddaughters  my sons daughters  by gift or will ?        
	Shipra Sarkar, North 24 Parganas              
	A: Yes, you can transfer your property to your daughter and your granddaughters by registering a gift deed during your lifetime or by will, which will take effect after your demise. But since your son tortures you I would advise you not to take any hasty decision about transferring the other half of your property to your granddaughters. You could wait and watch before taking a decision in this regard.              
	Q:The rent controller had passed an eviction order in June, 2004. The tenants appealed in the high court but lost in February, 2005. I could not apply for the execution order under Rule 11 of the W.B.P.T. Rules, 1956, because the court of the rent controller was closed from August, 2004, to September, 2007. I applied in October, 2007, complied with all the formalities and prayed for the date of delivery of possession. However, the rent controller has not issued the execution order as yet. What can I do now ?        
	Rita Bakshi, Calcutta              
	A: Since the matter is sub-judice before the rent controller, it would not be right on your part to jump procedures. So you have no choice but to wait for the execution order which alone should serve your purpose.              
	Q:My late grandfather left his house to my brother and me through a registered gift deed when we were minors. Now we are non-resident Indians (NRI). Our parents are staying in that house, which has not been mutated in our names. Is there any time limit for mutation? Are there any special formalities for NRIs regarding mutation?        
	Rupak Das, via e-mail              
	A: As far as mutation for NRIs is concerned, there are no special formalities nor any specific time limit prescribed in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation Act, 1980. However, the earlier this is done, the better it is. Both of you could execute a notarised power of attorney in favour of your parents to carry out the formalities required for obtaining mutation.

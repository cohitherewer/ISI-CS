                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Pursuit of excellence                  
	Sir  The article, Unheard of in history (Jan 4), by Sukanta Chaudhuri was well-written and instructive. Chaudhuri, who is an academic of high standing with considerable experience in teaching, has been able to probe deep into the malaise that plagues our education system. He has rightly called into question the wisdom of the Union governments announcement to set up 14 world-class universities at one go in India. The plan, if implemented, would be tantamount to putting the cart before the horse, as Chaudhuri indicates. It is good to aim at excellence in education. But to ignore the lacunae in the existing structure in the process would be ludicrous, if not inexcusable.          
	Unlike the business schools suddenly mushrooming all over the country, a world-class university cannot be built in haste. The new B-schools tempt students with promises of assured placement after completing the course. Going by my experience as a private tutor, most of the inducements on offer are little more than a hoax for which, however, students burn a hole in their parents pockets. But then, for most students, joining these B-schools is a desperate step necessitated by the current condition of the job market. No one likes the prospect of remaining unemployed after tenaciously building up a fairly sound academic career. Hence, students go for courses that would at least entitle them to a job.           
	A world-class university is not something that can be experimented with. It demands a sound infrastructure and a congenial environment for the dissemination of education, which would be tailored to the needs of the students. Or else, the funds spent by the government for setting it up would mostly be wasted. A poor country like India can hardly afford such a misuse. Besides, for a world-class university to become a reality, India first needs to do away with bureaucratic control and ensure para-academic support, as Chaudhuri observes. In this country, men and women seldom get the job they deserve. This results in an inevitable mismatch between intent and achievement in the careers of academics, and this, in turn, worsens the standard of education. We are all aware of the sorry state the Indian educational system is in. This is not to imply that there are no top-class educational institutions with world-class academics here. But it is simply to acknowledge the fact that because of the conditions prevailing in the Indian academic scene, most of our prized academics have a tendency to flee their country in search of better opportunities elsewhere.           
	More and more private universities with government affiliation are coming up in India. By allowing these universities to be built, the government is undoubtedly trying to expand the prospects of higher education for those who cannot make it to the top-class universities. But doesnt this way of tackling matters defeat the very purpose behind creating world-class universities  to achieve excellence? After all, quality, not quantity, is what constitutes excellence.          
	The funding system followed by the University Grants Commission with regard to state universities is lamentably discriminatory. Such a policy runs counter to the principle of uniformity that should ideally be followed in a federal polity. The only effective way to make sure that deserving candidates get their due is to change this lop-sided approach. There should be no discrepancies in the endorsement of aptitude, and this process has to start right from the school level. A rewarding educational system must encourage all factors that promote excellence.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Lawless state          
	Sir  Of late, I find court judgements being violated by all and sundry with impunity, and various political parties supporting, even endorsing, the act. Take the cases of the prohibitive orders on the use of Maidan grounds for rallies, ban on bandhs, on processions, on polluting industries like tanneries, and on smoke-belching automobiles like autorickshaws (Law vs louts, Jan 5). In each of these cases, the ruling party or the Opposition has openly ignored the court directives. This is a very dangerous trend, which can eventually lead to anarchy. Since elected governments are under oath to act in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, of which law is an integral part, they must necessarily abide by court orders. But the state government of West Bengal seems to be indifferent towards one of its foremost duties. In such a state, the common man has no option but to pin all his hopes on the judiciary. It is only the judiciary that can help protect peoples interests when the government and the police fail them.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Sampath K. Iyengar, Calcutta

                
	Sir  It is heartbreaking to acknowledge the fact that two-stroke autos still remain the auto-matic choice of Calcutta. No one thinks of the interests of the people here because we do not have a union to support us. If the state transport minister had spent even half the amount he wasted on Maradona in helping the auto drivers start using liquefied petroleum gas, we would have been living under better conditions by now.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Arijit Mukherjee, Calcutta

                
	Parting shot          
	Sir  The report, Poonch fight continues (Jan 8), says that armymen have shot dead a person who was scaling the wall of the residence of the chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir, Omar Abdullah. There are some inaccuracies in the report. The person killed in the encounter was neither scaling the wall of Abdullahs house nor running towards his residence, as reported by The Telegraph.           
	The scene of the incident is about a kilometre away from the chief ministers residence. The confrontation took place outside the residence of the armys 31-Sub-Area Commander, and the site is actually near the home of a former chief minister. The army has ordered an inquiry into the incident, and Abdullah is closely monitoring the probe. He has assured that those found guilty by the probe would be dealt with according to the law.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Khalid Basheer, Information Officer, Government of Jammu and Kashmir

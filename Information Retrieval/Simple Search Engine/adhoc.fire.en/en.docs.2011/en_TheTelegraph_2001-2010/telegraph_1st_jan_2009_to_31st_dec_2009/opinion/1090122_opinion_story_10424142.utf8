                                                                                                                 PRIVATE UNIVERSE                                                                  
	I trust Pheluda completely. Even as I write this, the irony of trusting someone who belongs to the world of fiction doesnt really strike me as odd. And this isnt only about my conviction that Pheluda will always solve crimes and triumph against his adversaries.        
	Trust isnt easy, it has to be earned. I first came across Pheluda in Lucknow in Badshahi Angti. He was 27, loved the art of detection, cricket and mihidana (this bit came to me later from a different story), knew a hundred-odd indoor games as well as a bit of hypnotism, and possessed a razor-sharp memory. There was nothing contrived about his relationship with his cousin, Topshe, the chronicler of these tales. Having an older brother myself, I could relate to Topshes misery when he got knuckled by Pheluda occasionally, or his feeling of security, even in mortal peril, in his presence. This happened many times, most memorably in Bombaiyer Bombete when the two were trapped in a hurtling train compartment by the villainous Gore and his gun-toting henchman.        
	Trust can also be rewarding. I have travelled with Pheluda to different worlds out of my reach, and savoured their sights and smells. Lucknows clean, wide roads with their cross-cultural names (Kaiserbagh), Benaras with its river and by-lanes, Kathmandus natural beauty or even Hong Kongs neon shine suddenly appeared familiar. An unknown Calcutta, with quaint nooks and corners filled with myriad histories, shops and people, became illuminated too. Had it not been for Pheluda, I wouldnt have known that Perigal Repeater was a watch (and not a revolver), that the violin made its appearance in the modern form in northern Italy in the Amati family, and that even spit falls in a geometric curve.        
	But trusting Pheluda, the reality of P.C. Mitter, was difficult at times. For instance, when I revisited him as an adolescent, and later, as an adult, I often found his disinterest in romancing women (or men) strange. Thus, when a pretty air hostess asks him to follow her during the flight to Kathmandu, Pheluda does just that, and nothing more. His companions emulate him in this aspect. Topshes narratives are singularly colourless when it comes to women or sex. The only hint that we get of his own approaching adulthood is when he mentions in one of the stories, I forget which, that his voice had started to crack which made him sound different on the phone. Lalmohanbabu, even in his quintessential Bengaliness, is single. That Pheluda was ageless never bothered me. But the absence of a lover or a woman character central to the plot did, for I knew that Rays literature or politics wasnt prejudiced.        
	A fictional character, as well as our imagined world around it, seldom dies. Even though I know that there would be no more Pheluda stories, (although there seems to be no letting up on shoddy films on the super sleuth), I continue to believe in him and in everything that he stood for. In Baksho Rahashya, there is an attempt by Naresh Pakrashi to bribe Pheluda, who first refuses Pakrashis offer and then rebukes him for his overtures. This spontaneous act on Pheludas part, apart from his many gifts and virtues, is what makes him endearing. He remains unsullied by the grimy world that both he and lesser mortals inhabit.                    UDDALAK MUKHERJEE

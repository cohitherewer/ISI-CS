The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Letters to Editor
                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Grow up                  
	Sir  We are conscious of the fact that on July 19, The Telegraph reported on its front page that womens organizations and readers had protested against its visual depicting male administrators in saris (Protests against Telegraph visuals). Your insistence, however, that the visual depicts paralysis of government draped in humour and that Bengal should laugh over it, insults the intelligence of your readers. It is embarrassing to see the awkward and inept attempts of a leading daily struggling to defend the indefensible. We feel it is time that the ever growing Telegraph outgrows sexism and has the confidence to acknowledge its mistakes.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Supriya Chaudhuri, Nirmala Bannerji, Brinda Bose, Ruchir Joshi, Rajat Shubhra Ghose, Raja Menon, Kuhu Das, Roop Sen, Naveen Kishore, Rukmini Sen, Janaki Nair, Ratnabali Roy, Paromita Chowdhury, Swati Ganguly, Sudeshna Banerjee and 85 others 

                
	Sir  The picture splashed across the front page (Do it to dont do it, July 18) was astounding. How inept administrators could be equated with administrators clad in saris by a leading daily is a question that is extremely baffling. We dont feel the need to list the innumerable instances that prove how ineptitude and womens garb, far from being synonymous, are quite antithetical. But it seems that there are certain things which we had presumed to be well-established facts that now need re-assertion. Women are proactive in participation in all strata of the bureaucracy and the government today, and that is so because of their administrative capabilities. The media play a pivotal role in value-building and it is shocking to see them not just passively endorsing but actively functioning as part of the patriarchal framework that undermines women and womens abilities through acts such as these. The apology adds insult to injury, because the only reason that The Telegraph thinks the picture may hurt womens sensibilities is that the elegance of the sari would be wasted on our not-so-elegant administrators.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The display of bad taste in Do it to dont do it is shocking. The picture not only insults the persons concerned, it also drags the newspaper down. Moreover, it betrays a male chauvinistic attitude by projecting women as the so- called weaker sex.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Subhasish Ghosh, Calcutta

                
	Sir  There is a terrible sense of disappointment when a much-loved friend suddenly erupts in an act of bigotry that is totally out of character. Thats how I felt when I saw Do it to dont do it. A paper whose liberal, modern, egalitarian outlook one had long admired suddenly showed a medieval, patriarchal world view. Is this what The Telegraph believes, subliminally? We think we live in a world where womens equality and abilities are established facts. Such optimism is shattered when a major newspaper uses such archaic anti-woman imagery. I know The Telegraph well, and this is not The Telegraph I know. Please do be careful the next time clever imagery threatens to overcome basic principles.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  On July 18, when I opened my Facebook account I was stunned to see the status message of most of my friends. One message read, What The Telegraph has published in the front page today goes completely against women. We are gathering in front of TT to protest against this. Join us. I went online to check. I laughed first when I saw the visual and then went through the article. I gathered that it was an attempt to render visually the frequently-used Indian phrase, Aap kya churiya pahenke baithe ho?(Are you sitting wearing bangles, or what?) I didnt react to this because I dont have a fragile ego. A joke about a garment does not make or break a woman. For us, modern women, the sari comes out of the wardrobe only on certain occasions. So it feels strange when it suddenly becomes the emblem of womanhood. Its time we stop clutching on to the sari as the last resort for self-respect. What made the protesters angry were the sari- clad men on the front page and not the fact that the article was written against men who sat there and watched as women struggled to go back home because they could not find transport, because they were caught up in the hooliganism that had taken over the city. I wonder how safe women will feel when they step out of home now that Calcutta is no longer what it used to be. Sadly, no woman had written about this on Facebook.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  In this day and age, when most media houses strive to maintain political correctness, it is stunning to see an article from The Telegraph that summarily dispenses with such calculations and openly harks back to feudal times. The explanation provided the next day makes an appeal to our sense of humour. It is difficult see the point of this reference to humour. A more straightforward way of explaining this explanation is to read it as the masking of an unintelligent idea by a bit of wordplay here and there. The article ends with the words of the 19th-century poet, Ishwar Gupta, and the assertion, Bengal still enjoys a good laugh. This is forced camaraderie. We are not laughing. We who are in Bengal or from Bengal have missed your joke by a couple of centuries.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  I would like to raise a simple question. Is daring to associate weakness with women your version of the freedom of the press that you seek to protect so vehemently?           
	Yours faithfully,      
Chilka Ghosh, Calcutta

                                                                                                                 DARK LADY OF INDIA                                                          
	In India myths endure. So it is not surprising that many myths surround the persona of Indira Gandhi who was assassinated today 25 years ago. The way she died has added to the myths. One myth should be dispelled straight away. She is often described, by critic and admirer alike, as a deft politician who knew how to deal with her rivals. Yet the fact of the matter is that in 1971 she was re-elected as prime minister with a huge majority in the Lok Sabha in the wake of the liberation of Bangladesh and the Indo-Pak war; within a couple of years, Indira Gandhis rule was under attack from within and without the Congress party. The only way she knew to deal with this opposition was by declaring the Emergency and thus undermining Indian democracy. This is not quite the way that a deft practitioner of the art of politicking would have dealt with challenges to her power. She never appeared to be in full control after her return to the top job in 1980.        
	Indira Gandhis great period was a brief one  lasting from 1969 to 1971, between the break with the Syndicate and the liberation of Bangladesh. But this was also when she wore her radical mask and utilized the ideology of socialism to consolidate her own power. She had none of the idealism of her father and certainly did not believe in the institutions of democracy and civil society. Under her, the cabinet system of government became a mere extension of the prime ministers office. She eroded the independence of the judiciary and the bureaucracy. She packed leading educational institutions, academic bodies and other civil society establishments with her cronies. In all this she broke, with disastrous consequences, from the tradition established by Jawaharlal Nehru. The Emergency was the culmination of a process of centralization of power that Indira Gandhi initiated. It is not unfair to suggest that she had little faith in democratic practices and institutions.        
	In foreign policy, she brought about a pronounced pro-Soviet tilt which led her to support the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. She shackled Indias economic growth and private investment and entrepreneurship by institutionalizing red tape and a permit and licence raj. This opened up opportunities for venality and corruption. She used the latter with devastating effect on the polity to fund the Congress party and elections.        
	It is thus difficult to be dispassionate about Indira Gandhi and her era. Historians of subsequent generations could describe the period that bears her indelible stamp as a very dark period for India. What cannot be denied, however, is that in her time she was immensely popular. But she made scant use of that support to take India forward. Prime ministers with far less support  to wit P.V. Narasimha Rao and Manmohan Singh  have achieved much more, especially in the fields of economic reform and foreign policy. A large majority might well be an Indian prime ministers worst curse.

	In an environment where people are looking for direction, expectations from an Economic Survey of India usually disappoint, and this years version is true to that. There are three ways of looking at the survey for 2008-09: as forecast, as a plan for policy  called a roadmap this time  and an evaluation of certain long-run features of the Indian economy. The forecast is limited mainly to economic growth, and to certain broad indicators like inflation. The government forecasts a growth range between 6.25 to 7.75 per cent, subject to a normal monsoon. Food price inflation in particular  and inflation in general  is anticipated to be a concern, something that is already known. Besides, if there is a rollback of excise duty cuts announced in several sectors, product prices are expected to go up too. The plan part of the survey  ambitiously called a roadmap  reads as if it has been cut and pasted from surveys of past years, but fleshed out better: hiking caps on foreign investment in sectors like retail and defence-related industries to name two, decontrolling prices of fertilizers, drugs and sugar, the passage of long-pending legislations on pensions and insurance, a push to disinvest several government undertakings and the creation of regulatory structures and frameworks for important areas such as environment and roads. The assessment and prospects section of the survey highlights economic performance against the backdrop of current global conditions  particularly those in the United States of America  which are likely to stay that way for the rest of this year, and perhaps for part of the next.        
	Over the years, the Economic Survey is relied on less as a source of data; data dissemination has become more frequent and qualitatively better. The prospects for a growth rate of 7.5 per cent plus look a tad optimistic; most economists  and the assessments of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank  place it closer to 6.6 per cent. The survey is a professional economists version of an economic agenda, not necessarily a politically feasible one. Economic performance in 2008-09, unlike in previous years, has been consistent with changes in global conditions and the current financial crisis. As the survey points out, Indias growth in the prior four years has been similarly consistent with global growth. So forget decoupling for good: if the US sneezes, India will catch the flu.

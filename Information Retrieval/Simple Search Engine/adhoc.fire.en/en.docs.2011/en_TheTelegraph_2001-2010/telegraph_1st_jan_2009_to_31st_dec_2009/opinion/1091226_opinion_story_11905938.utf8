                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        THE LINE OF BEAUTY                                  Visual Arts - Somak Ghoshal                                                        
	It is now standard practice with many Calcutta galleries to retrieve iconic masterpieces from their cold storage in order to put up an exhibition-cum-sale. These shows usually have little rhyme or reason, and looking for curatorial principles behind them, one is left feeling vaguely foolish. So, it was with a feeling of jadedness that I visited Modern Continuous at Gallerie 88 (ending today), only to be pleasantly surprised. Not only did the show turn out to be well mounted, but due seriousness seemed to have been given to the pictures, judging from the nicely designed catalogue, although the concept note proved to be not as impressive.        
	The curator, for one, quite wrongly states that the nine artists selected here were all born before 1930. Apart from Somnath Hore, Paritosh Sen and Meera Mukherjee, all the others were born in the late Thirties and Forties. It is also not clear if there is any thematic unity among the works selected  except for the obvious fact that they had been produced by starkly different sensibilities who happened to be exact contemporaries of one another, and are considered to be the pioneers of Modern Art in Bengal. Perhaps it would have made better sense to study the ways in which some of them influenced one anothers styles. It is quite obvious, for instance, that there were affinities between Lalu Prasad Shaw and Dharmanarayan Dasgupta. Both of them are strongly indebted to the Early Bengal School  the dainty ladies, in full regalia, depicted by them, look like close echoes of one another. A recent tempera by Shaw shows an impassive face staring up at an apple suspended in space. It could well have been mistaken for one of Dharmanarayans surreal compositions. Dasgupta, however, was a more eccentric visionary than Shaw, the chief charms of whose art are grace and equanimity.        
	There are some rare pieces, such as an early Bikash Bhattacharjee going back to the Sixties, which looks strikingly different from the neo-realism that became his signature style. Executed in mixed media on paper, it looks like a pastiche of Mondrian, Kandinsky and Klimt. With his recent ink-and-pastel works, Jogen Chowdhury seems to have shifted to forceful brushwork, leaving behind the fine lines and decorative elegance of an earlier period. Ganesh Pynes works in tempera, especially from the Seventies to the Nineties, have remained unforgettable. Be it the solitary lady standing on the balcony or playing the flute (picture), or Jesus wearing his crown of thorns, Pyne is yet to surpass the distinction he brought into his work of these earlier decades. Like the timeless bronze sculptures of Meera Mukherjee and Somnath Hore, Pynes eyeless people, caught in the dusky dreaminess of their existence, attain a mythical grandeur.

	Right evidence  
	 On the testimony of certain witnesses, a man was convicted for an assault on a person on the street. The witnesses happened to include the victims father. The accused was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment. Upon appeal, the Patna High Court upheld the conviction. The accused went to the Supreme Court, contending that although the incident had occurred in a public place, no independent witness had been cross-examined. The Supreme Court held that the absence of a public witness proved nothing. The court added that public witnesses often hesitated to depose in a criminal case. Since it was certain that there hadnt been any animosity between the injured and the accused parties earlier, there was no reason to disbelieve the witnesses even if they were related.

	Fair deal        
	 Thirty-seven Ayurvedic doctors were appointed in 2001 on contract by the Delhi municipality. In 2004 the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) issued an advertisement for the appointment of 45 Ayurvedic doctors. An age limit of 35 years was set, which could be relaxed by five years in the case of those who were already in government service. The 37 contractual employees filed a writ petition, pleading that they should also be considered as government employees, and hence the age limit in their case should also be relaxed. The UPSC appealed to the Supreme Court, but the latter dismissed the appeal, holding that since the term employee had not been defined either in the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act or in the advertisement, the appointments applied to all categories of employees.

	Record isnt all        
	 A mini truck purchased on a hire purchase scheme met with an accident, resulting in a death. The legal representatives of the victim claimed compensation. As the registration book had the name of the financier, there was a dispute as to who the owner was. The Supreme Court held that the person who was in possession of the vehicle had to pay damages. The court also said that the person who holds the registration is presumed to be the owner only in the absence of other circumstances.

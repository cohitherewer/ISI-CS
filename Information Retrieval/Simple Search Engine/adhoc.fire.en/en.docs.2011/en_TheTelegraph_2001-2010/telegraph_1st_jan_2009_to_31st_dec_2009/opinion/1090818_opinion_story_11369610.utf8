	If I were Nitish Kumar, what would I take comfort from? The fact that it is the public stripping of one young woman on Patnas busy Exhibition Road that is making headlines throughout the nation, not the regular stripping or raping of underprivileged women in every other nook and cranny of Bihar. The chief minister acted fast, perhaps partly in response to the protests from civic and womens organizations and the vociferous criticism of the Opposition. He needed to be perceived as doing something, penalizing those directly and indirectly responsible, ensuring arrests and an inquiry. He has done the best he can, but he must know that the matter is not that simple. Nothing about the buying and selling of sex is ever simple, and the issue of a womans humiliation is the most complicated issue of all. The media reports make obvious that the facts surrounding the incident remain elusive. The one fact no one can have any doubt about is that a woman was stripped, probably by more than one man, in public, and that the police may have been spectators for a while. And the law can act only on visible violations  on the evidence that a hotel was allowing soliciting and prostitution, that a woman had complained that a man who promised her a job was forcing her to have sex with other people, that she ran away with his mobile after a fight and that he, and maybe others, stripped her on the street.        
	In many ways, the violent humiliation suffered by the young woman on Exhibition Road is crucial in understanding the way a State imposes order. The nation reacted to a private act rendered public, in a space where the State, the law and civic morality could take a stand. But the womans private history remains private. Her unforgettable moment of shame may have been the culmination of painful choices she had made earlier, or of an unthinking innocence brutally destroyed. By erupting on to the surface of shared daylight existence, this culmination opened up a dark peephole into deprivations and injustices that persist beneath the veneer of a society apparently on the way to rejuvenation. The stripping itself has an added dimension. It is one of the most violent manifestations of a cultural attitude towards women in India that no law has yet been able to change.         
	The imposition of penalties in this kind of a situation is a form of damage limitation for a damage that is old and persistent. To follow the girls private history is to ask what this event will have done to her, and what it will do to her future. In this painful collision among the personal, the suppressed, and the public, the question that must be asked is, can the State intervene in her life now to change it, without hurting her selfhood further? Can it go beyond legal and administrative formulae to address the causes that set such events in motion? If I were Nitish Kumar, I would also know how little comfort there is.       BHASWATI CHAKRAVORTY

                                                                                                                 NO TIME FOR PEACE                                  Fifth Column -Gwynne Dyer                              
	Israel is not going to show restraint, foreign minister Tzipi Livni told The Washington Post after the United States of America abstained from the UN security councils resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. All last week, the speculation grew that Washington was going to defy its Israeli ally and vote for the resolution, but literally, as the delegates sat down in the council chamber, the phone call came from President Bush ordering secretary of state Condoleezza Rice to abstain.        
	So nothing will stop Israel from hammering the Gaza Strip as hard as it likes  and the situation is unlikely to change with the inauguration of Barack Obama later this month because he has no intention of squandering his political capital on a quixotic attempt to bring peace to the Middle East. He will spend it, instead, on goals that have some chance of being achieved, and he will be right to do so.        
	Yet, the Israeli offensive in the Gaza Strip will almost certainly end within the next two weeks. International revulsion at the carnage among Palestinian civilians will play a certain role. Any big loss of life in the Israeli army, or the capture of even one or two soldiers, would turn Israeli public opinion against the war overnight. And the clincher is that the Israeli elections are on February 10.        
	The war is being fought now to shift the opinion polls in favour of the ruling parties before the polls. However, it must be over and somehow look like a success before Israelis actually vote. The war against Hamas in Gaza looks more and more like the three-week Israeli war against the Hizbollah in Lebanon in 2006 which could hardly be called a success. It will last about as long. It will kill about as many Arabs, probably a thousand or so. And it will end with Hamas, like Hizbollah, still able to fire rockets at Israel.                
	Big mistake        
	This means that Binyamin Netanyahu, the Likud Party leader who was already leading in the opinion polls, is almost certain to form the next Israeli government. He is the ultimate rejectionist, the man who successfully sabotaged the Oslo Accords and effectively killed the peace process during his last term as prime minister in 1996-99. He rejects the very idea of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.        
	Netanyahu is a glib ideologue who does not understand strategy and sees no reason for Israel to seek peace with its neighbours if the price is giving the Palestinians back their pre-1967 borders. Israel currently enjoys three huge strategic advantages. It has the strongest army in the region, backed by the only modern economy and the only technologically competent population, as well as an absolute monopoly on nuclear weapons. And it has the unstinting, unquestioning support of the worlds only superpower. But none of these advantages is forever, and Israel needs to make peace with its neighbours while it still possesses them.        
	The existing Arab regimes are willing to make peace with Israel on the basis of the 1967 borders, mainly because they fear the further radicalization of their own populations, and perhaps even violent revolution, if the Israeli-Palestinian conflict continues to fester. But the Arabs as a whole have all the time in the world: sooner or later the wheel will turn and Israel will become vulnerable.         
	It is the usefulness of this war, not its morality, that Israel should be questioning. Unless it re-occupies Gaza permanently  which nobody wants to do, because it would mean a constant stream of Israeli military casualties  then once the army pulls back, Hamas will emerge, stronger than ever. The Arab regimes that might make peace with Israel will be further undermined, and Israel gets Binyamin Netanyahu as prime minister. As was said after the execution of the Duc dEnghien on Napoleons orders, the Gaza operation is worse than a crime. It is a mistake.

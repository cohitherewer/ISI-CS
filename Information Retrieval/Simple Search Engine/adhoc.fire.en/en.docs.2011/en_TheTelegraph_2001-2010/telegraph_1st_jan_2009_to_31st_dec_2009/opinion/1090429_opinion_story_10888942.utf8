The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | this is no truce
                                                                                                                 THIS IS NO TRUCE                                                    
	As in Pakistan, layers of lying and deception keep the truth hidden in Sri Lanka from the eyes of the world. Shortly after the Tamil Tigers announced a unilateral ceasefire  a masterstroke that coincided with the highprofile visit of foreign dignitaries and aimed at gaining maximum sympathy from the Tamil diaspora  the Sri Lanka government played its hand. It announced the conclusion of its combat operations in the north. This meant the end of heavy shelling and aerial bombardments, which, incidentally, the government has always denied resorting to. The gesture, much like the token two-day ceasefire some time back, allowed the government to achieve a public-relations coup without jeopardizing its interests. It immediately eased public pressure on the Mahinda Rajapakse administration, which could then push through transactions with the International Monetary Fund and other such bodies for dole-out money. On the tactical side, the government has lost nothing. With the action now concentrated on a five-kilometre stretch, the military can do with sniper action and confrontations without heavy firing. Naturally, the Sri Lanka government thought it necessary to announce, soon after multilateral aid had been pledged, that end of combat did not mean truce with the Tigers.         
	It is expected that the Sri Lanka government and the Tamil Tigers will work at cross purposes. Had the suffering population been anything other than collateral damage, the ceasefires on the warring sides would have coincided. But that is not to be. The stakes on either side are too high to allow a show of magnanimity. It is obvious that the Sri Lanka government will carry the war to its logical end  reclamation of all territory from the Tigers. The interest of the Tamil population will matter only after this objective has been achieved. The challenge for the international community is to wrest maximum concessions from the government for the fleeing population, and to see that even after the war is over, the well-being of the Sinhala Tamils does not remain subject to the governments narrow objective. This is a tall order. Sinhala triumphalism, evident from the overwhelming victories claimed by the ruling coalition in successive provincial elections, will not make it easy. Thus, when the hysteria dies down, it is essential to keep strings attached to the aid and to sustain international interest in the displaced.

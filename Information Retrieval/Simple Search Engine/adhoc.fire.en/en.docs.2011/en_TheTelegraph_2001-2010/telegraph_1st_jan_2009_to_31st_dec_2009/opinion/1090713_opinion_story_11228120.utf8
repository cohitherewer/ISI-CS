	Liberal reform is often the last thing driving State-sponsored mass marriages among the underprivileged. A bizarre mix of corruption and moral policing, implicating the state government as well as the beneficiaries, has come to light in the mass weddings in Madhya Pradesh that were made famous by the chief minister himself giving away the brides on most occasions. Poverty and middlemen led some couples who were already married to pretend to have come to be wed, and the way this was exposed is the stuff of grotesque comedy. A bride went into labour a few moments before the ritual exchange of garlands, with the groom and his family looking on unperturbed. But the governments reaction has turned the whole racket into something more sordid and abusive. All the women who had come to be married were summarily subjected to virginity and pregnancy tests. It was then assumed that the 14, among the 152, brides who were found pregnant (the virginity-test findings have not been reported) must already have been married, and hence were barred from the scheme.         
	So, testing the women has become the governments sole means of checking abuse of the scheme. This is an easy way out of addressing the root of the corruption, being abusive of the womens (and indeed the couples) bodies, dignity and privacy. The governments stance is founded on the essentially moralistic assumption that unmarried women do not have sex, the obverse of which is that women who are not virgins should not be allowed to have their marriages endorsed by the state government and its chief minister. The pregnancy tests are also founded on similarly bigoted logic, which takes advantage of the powerlessness of poor (often tribal), pregnant women. The Madhya Pradesh government must stop these tests on women and find some other way of checking the misuse of this scheme.

	With power comes responsibility                  
	Sir  The Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana proposes to establish the Rural Electricity Distribution Backbone in areas where this facility does not exist. The idea, though noble, is impractical, and can be successful only if there is surplus power. Most regions receive power below the required quantum. The infrastructure needed for this scheme is huge. Merely setting up a few electric cables will not solve the problem. The governments initiative will be appreciated only if a steady voltage of power is ensured.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Sunil Pradhan, Khariar, Orissa

      
	Road risks          
	Sir  As the article, Death rides the roads (Nov 1), suggests, deaths due to road accident are growing at a tremendous rate. While it is justified to sympathize with the victims, I feel that the indiscriminate issuing of driving licences to learners who are not fully aware of traffic rules and road courtesies adds to the problem. The vehicles today are so much faster and easier to drive than the older cars. These lull drivers into a feeling of complacency and power, resulting in road rage. Most people riding two-wheelers have just about graduated from riding bicycles and are, therefore, absolutely ignorant of traffic rules and road safety. The old saying that describes cars as death on wheels holds good even today.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Navin Malhotra, Calcutta

                
	Sir  There are large hoardings displayed all over the city by a cellular-phone service provider inviting people to walk while they talk. This idea may have sounded very exceptional at the story-board stage but it is clear that no one paid much attention to the realities of the volume of vehicular traffic. Indian cities do not provide users of mobile phones the opportunity to walk and talk at the same time. It can be done on the beaches of Mumbai perhaps, but not on the roads.          
	We have heard of several tragic cases in Calcutta where people have died while crossing roads or walking next to railway tracks when talking on mobile phones. It is not possible to follow road signs or hear other sounds while speaking on the phone. Youngsters today think it is very cool to plug their ears with music while travelling. It may be a great way to keep out unnecessary noise but it also keeps out the sounds of cars and buses, which honk to warn them.           
	Yours faithfully,      
S. Chakraborti, Calcutta 

                          
	All work          
	Sir  An applicant with some experience is generally given preference in a job. Should the same rule not apply also to candidates standing for elections as they would be entrusted with the task of governing the country? Merely inducting young faces will not draw people towards any party. If a candidate makes his work speak for him, the people will automatically vote for him.          
	There is plenty of work to be done, especially towards the modernization of West Bengal. False promises do not help politicians to stay in power for long. When will the leaders realize that the people of the state are terribly bored by their vulgar criticism of one another and also of the fake promises they keep on making?           
	Politicians should bring some consistency of approach in their work. If noise pollution is an important issue for them during Diwali, then the sound of microphones during election campaigns should be treated as gravely offensive as well. It is true that young politicians are capable of ushering in change in the state. But they fail to realize that work is of prime importance. They will fare well if only they work diligently.          
	Yours faithfully,

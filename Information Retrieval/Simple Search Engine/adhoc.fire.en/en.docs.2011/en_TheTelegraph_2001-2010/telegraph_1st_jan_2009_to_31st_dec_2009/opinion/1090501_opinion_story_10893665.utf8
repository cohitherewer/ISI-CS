The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Letters to Editor
                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Off limits                  
	Sir  This letter comes with a shock and also a protest against the fact that the National Library has been identified by the Election Commission as a place for the counting of votes (Citizen vote goes to library, April, 22). This reflects the lack of sensitivity as well as an authoritative stance on the part of the EC vis--vis the importance of libraries in our country  and more so the National Library. With its rich history and a commitment to reading and research activities, closing down the library, or even using parts of the library for the purposes of a general election, seems ridiculous. If democracy is about electoral politics, the same democracy assures individual liberty, and closing the National Library to the public is a definite violation of that (the liberty of reading inside a library). Thus it seems that one value of democracy is to be curtailed to uphold another. There are other public buildings such as five-star hotels in the vicinity of the National Library that maybe used by the EC under the same Section 160 of The Representation of the People Act, 1951 that the EC is using to get the National Library.           
	This move by the EC needs to be stopped at all costs, given that in the last general elections also the premises were used and mishandled (according to library sources), and that the prime minister had already apologized in 2005 for using the library for a business meet. Both these incidents are precedents for the library not to be given to the EC in 2009.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  As the editorial, Barging in (April 28), points out, the EC has been given a great deal of power to hold the biggest carnival of Indian democracy. So much so, the EC appears to be trampling over the democratic rights of the people. In the poll season, the EC cripples the normal life of people, and the elected government maintains a peculiar passivity. The autocratic attitude of the EC also becomes evident when schools, colleges and other institutions are requisitioned for the elections, and have to suspend their regular activities. Teachers and employees are forced to attend poll duty, and even a reasonable medical excuse is not taken into account. The new academic session in many states begins from May 1, as it does in West Bengal, and the use of school buildings and staff for the elections is bound to affect the smooth functioning of educational institutions.           
	The same happens with employees of the health sector, who are also compelled to serve the EC. As the election gets the utmost urgency, emergency services like health, education and transport take the backseat. The EC takes no permission from the residents before occupying their buildings and no exemptions are made on humanitarian grounds. Vehicles are picked up from the streets to ferry polling officers. So anarchy is unleashed as the State celebrates the festival of democracy. For a few days, the entire country is ruled by the bureaucracy. If democracy is the best political principle of a welfare state like India, it is now time to democratize the EC, which is a constitutional institution as well.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Wheres the catch?          
	Sir  The report, PM? Not now, thank you (April 26), has a comment on West Bengal by Rahul Gandhi. He says, I was shocked to see the status of the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme work in Purulia. Lakhs of job cards have been issued but families are not getting work. I find no difference between Purulia and Kalahandi, or for that matter with Bundelkhand. Apparently, he also stated that the situation in the state is far worse than in Uttar Pradesh. This prompted me to do a bit of survey. To my surprise, I discovered that on March 2, 2009, a cash award of Rs 1.50 crore had been announced for West Bengal by the Union minister for panchayati raj, Mani Shankar Aiyar, for being one of the four best states in the country under the Panchayat Empowerment and Accountability Incentive Scheme for the year 2008-09. Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Kerala were adjudged the top four states for empowering the panchayati raj institutions. The performance of the states was evaluated by the National Council for Applied Economic Research. Gujarat, the so-called developed state, remained out of the evaluation process as it has not constituted District Planning Committees so far.           
	Further, to quote the 2007-2008 report of NCAER, Based on the work done on the development of a comprehensive index of decentralization to the PRIs noted earlier, the extent and variation of devolution across the states was [sic] empirically quantified, based on the data for 2007. The rankings for the current year placed Tamil Nadu, Kerala, West Bengal and Karnataka among the top four states. These states had occupied the top four positions in the previous years as well. In my opinion, it would be too much too claim that either Mani Shankar Aiyar or the people who head the NCAER are Left Front sympathizers. To a layman, who does not understand the complexities of economics or statistics, the statement by Rahul Gandhi and the NCAER report or the PEAIS award are quite contradictory. If the statement is right, then the award given by the Congress-led government should be taken back. Then the credibility of the NCAER is at stake. Alternatively, if the NCAER report is right, then Rahul Gandhis conclusions about Bengal are entirely flawed.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Anindya Sarkar,

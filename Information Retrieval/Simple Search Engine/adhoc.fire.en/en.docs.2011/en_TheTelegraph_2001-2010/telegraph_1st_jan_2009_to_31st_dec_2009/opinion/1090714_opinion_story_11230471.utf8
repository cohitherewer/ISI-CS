The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Blackamoors in the backyard
                                                                                                                 BLACKAMOORS IN THE BACKYARD                                                                  
	Mislike me not for my complexion,/The shadowed livery of the burnishd sun,/ The best-regarded virgins of our clime/ Have lovd it/ I would not change this hue,/ Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.         
	Thus the Prince of Morocco to Portia, in Shakespeares The Merchant of Venice. Morocco, a tawny Moor all in white, has come to Belmont as a suitor in the hope of winning Portias hand. The seal of love will be set by lot, for Portias father has left the choice of her husband to chance, but it is a game of chance that betrays cold calculation. Morocco, as we can guess, must lose. A gentle riddance! Portia exclaims upon his exit, Let all of his complexion choose me so. Morocco is no faint heart, but he stands no chance of winning the fair lady.         
	The loser in the trial of love is nevermore to woo a woman, while the lucky winner gets to have both the maiden and her money. Fortune favours the blonde. Moroccos misfortune lies in an overage of melanin. Before the trial, Portia had assured Morocco, with delicious irony, that if she had her own way he, a renowned prince, would stand as fair/ as any comer I have looked on yet.         
	The quality of fairness, in these parleys, becomes strained. To be fair is to be beautiful, to be fair is to be just, to be fair is also to be white. The vicissitudes of this one word tells the long, winding story of how the West defined itself against the rest of the world  by painting the world in black and white. But was it only the West? No. To be fair, all great civilizations have been guilty of monochromatic megalomania. It took no research to discover the effectiveness of racial abuse: insults really got under your skin when they had something to do with your skin-tone. In the ancient world, perceptions of ethnic difference got mapped onto visible anatomical differences, and ranged themselves along a hierarchy. Christianity, by equating the sultry with the sinful, redefined cultural difference negatively as essential moral and psychological depravity. Black was evil, and so ugly. But the colour of sin never fails to seduce. The dark dangled the promise of delight in danger.         
	Shakespeares England was obsessed with blackamoors in its backyard. In 1596, Queen Elizabeth wrote to the Lord Mayor, The Queens Majesty, tendering the good and welfare of her own natural subjectsis highly discontent to understand the great numbers of Negars and Blackamoors which are crept into this realm. In reality though, if you were returning from the Globe after a performance of Othello, it was highly unlikely that you would bump into his kinsman on the streets. Because there were simply not that many. Public opinion, then as now, depended more on media reports than on empirical inquiry. Newspapers in those days carried cartoons of funny black fellows that said, You cannot wash an Ethiope white. Sovereigns are susceptible to paranoia. But as for the great English unwashed, there was nothing personal, or official, about their prejudice. In time though, beauteous blackamoors lent colour to affaires damour, as black blood crept into the language of love.  In the old age black was not counted fair,/Or if it were, it bore not beautys name;/ But now is black beautys successive heir. But blanche beauty burnished with fair ornament is beauty purchased by the weight, whose supposed fairness may betoken a whited sepulchre. The question is  to look lovely, and be loved, do you need to be fair?                    ANIK SAMANTA

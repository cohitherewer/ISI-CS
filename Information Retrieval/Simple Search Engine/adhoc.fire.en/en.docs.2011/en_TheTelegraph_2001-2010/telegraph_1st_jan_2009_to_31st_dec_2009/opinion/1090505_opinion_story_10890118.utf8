The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Filters, wrong signs, backdoors and black money
                                                                                                                 FILTERS, WRONG SIGNS, BACKDOORS AND BLACK MONEY                                  Dev Kar elucidates the methods used to assess illicit financial flows, while Ashok V.

	While L.K. Advani seems to be seeking political mileage through his claim that resident Indians have stashed between $0.5 and $1.4 trillion in black money outside the country since Independence, the Congress thinks these figures are excessive (Advanis faux pas, Ashok V. Desai, The Telegraph, April 21). Let me assure readers  no one knows for certain. As part of a project financed by the Ford Foundation, I have been researching the issue of the absorption of illicit financial flows (IFFs) for more than a year at the Global Financial Integrity, a think-tank in Washington DC. The main reason for the difficulty in coming up with absorption estimates is the opacity surrounding the operations of offshore financial centres, tax havens, and on-shore financial institutions. But it would be erroneous to take the GFIs estimate of average illicit flows from India over 2002-2006 and interpolate that average back to 1947 to come up with the size of slush funds abroad. If research was so simple, economists like me would be out of a job rather than be making lucrative careers.        
	My interest in writing this rejoinder to Ashok Desai is that the GFI report, Illicit Financial Flows from Developing Countries: 2002-2006, has not been properly understood, and has even been misquoted, in the political fray. I will start by addressing Desais misconceptions in the order in which they appear in his article.        
	Desai fails to mention that the cost of freight and insurance is explicitly taken into account in GFIs trade mispricing model and gives the impression that there was a gap in our analysis. Moreover, he does not mention that the other factors accounting for bilateral trade data discrepancies were also discussed in our study. It should be obvious to readers that such country-specific fine-tuning of IFF estimates is not possible when the objective of the study is to derive estimates for all developing countries and regions.               
	The GFI report points out that the country ranking provides a starting point for economists to focus on countries with the largest IFFs. This is not to say that the factors which Desai cites could be driving discrepancies in Indias trade data during 2002 to 2006. In fact, they are unlikely to drive those discrepancies. As far as I am aware, for the period under study, the Indian black market in foreign exchange has been moribund while trade reform has significantly reduced effective duties and subsidies for a broad spectrum of goods. Yet, the main underlying factors driving illicit financial flows from India (grassroots corruption and related desire to accumulate wealth abroad away from the reach of regulatory authorities) have been alive and kicking.              
	Desai can be forgiven for writing that researchers conveniently ignore the figures with the wrong signs, and take only those with right signs to be the right estimates of illicit flows. Ever since the trade mispricing model has been put forward (see, for example, Illegal Transactions in International Trade, edited by Jagdish N. Bhagwati, 1974), researchers have taken account of all signs in estimating capital flight from individual as well as small sample countries. The GFI study found that when this traditional method was applied to all developing countries (there have been no recent studies comparable in scope), Africa received a significant illicit inflow of $12.3 billion per year during 2002-2006. This is an absurd result because if Africa had indeed received illicit inflows of such magnitude, it would not have required official development assistance from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development totalling $2.5 billion during this period. We rejected the traditional method in estimating IFFs from all developing countries in the light of these and other anomalies. Far from a convenient rejection, a failure to relate to ground reality was the main reason behind our rejection of the traditional method. For the sake of comparison, illicit outflows from India under the traditional method (that takes into account all inflows) amounted to $16.4 billion per year on average compared to the $22.7 to $27.3 billion under the alternative method used in our report.        
	The main reason for proposing an alternative method is that economists have not seriously researched the issue of illicit inflows. As far as I am aware, there is not a single study that analyses and validates the nature and significance of illicit inflows into India or any other economy. Instead, contrary to what Desai would have us believe, economists have thus far equated wrong signs with illicit inflows, thereby seriously understating the issue of IFFs from developing countries. In our collective experience at the GFI, we have seldom come across traders bringing in illicit money through trade mispricing. Had that been the case, the monetary impact of such inflows (acting in unison with official capital inflows) could not have escaped the attention of the Reserve Bank of India (or the central banks of other developing countries).         
	Hence, the premise underlying the GFI study is that black money doesnt just hide  it tends to flow out and away from the reach of regulatory agencies. And once black money flows out of a country, it hardly ever comes back. Even if some black money may come back or round-trip in the form of foreign direct investment, its scale is minuscule in relation to gross illicit outflows or a countrys gross domestic product. It is not hard to see this. If tax cheaters and other corrupt people have gone to great lengths to shelter their wealth in secrecy, why would they bring it back to attract the attention of the government? Besides, we are talking about illicit inflows. Neither economic theory nor plain common sense can insist that illicit inflows necessarily benefit an economy. One could argue that if we are to measure the harmful impact of IFFs on an economy, it would not be reasonable to consider a net position with regard to such flows. On the contrary, if illicit inflows end up driving the underground economy as they very well might do, we should be adding outflows and inflows to measure their adverse impact rather than netting them out.         
	The best economic models cannot capture all the conduits through which money can be sent abroad, a limitation of economic models we have recognized at the outset to our report. For instance, an American state department report estimates that hawala transactions in India range between $13 to $17 billion annually and present a security threat to the country. Such swaps of domestic for foreign currency cannot be captured by any economic model, so that, if anything, our estimates of IFFs from India are likely to be understated. Nor can economic models capture a couriers cross-border transfer of foreign exchange in a suitcase. In view of the distortions in regional IFFs and the fact that economic models cannot capture all channels through which black money exits a country, we placed restrictions on the direction and size of IFFs rather than net out all dubious illicit inflows.         
	We filter out countries with large and persistent illicit inflows through the balance of payments and we only consider gross outflows through trade mispricing. While Desai acknowledges that we filter IFFs, he contradicts himself by saying we conveniently ignore the wrong signs. How one can filter and ignore at the same time is beyond me.              
	The first conditional filter asks the question  does the country show illicit financial outflow (through the balance of payments as captured by the World Bank residual model) in three or more years? Accept if it does, reject if it does not. The rationale is that a country with illicit financial outflows in three or more years out of five, cannot suddenly turn around into a net receiver of flight capital. That would fly in the face of macroeconomic theory. The second conditional filter only accepts a countrys illicit outflows if they exceed 10 per cent of its exports, a volume that is much larger than what can possibly be attributed to data issues. As a result of this filtration process, our estimates of IFFs from developing countries are quite conservative. Even so, illicit outflows have now come to outstrip official development assistance to developing countries by a factor of 10 to 1. The volume of IFFs from India is the fifth or sixth highest (depending upon the method of estimation) among all developing countries. We argue that if for every dollar in official development assistance 10 dollars leave a developing country through the backdoor, it is time that both donor and recipient countries adopt policy measures to address the serious long-term implications for poverty alleviation.               
	Recently, the United States of America, Germany, and other developed countries have started a crackdown on tax havens and onshore financial institutions to tax the capital that has been stashed abroad in contravention of applicable tax laws. While the stock of capital held abroad is minuscule compared to the size of these developed economies, they have taken some serious steps in addressing tax fraud and promoting accountability and transparency among all parties concerned. Given that poverty alleviation is still an endemic issue in India and that illicit outflows from India are significant, it is difficult to see why Desai would rather have the public and the government studiously ignore the problem of black money.              
	Ashok V. Desai replies:              
	Dev Kars 1541-word refutation of my 1200-word column may not set a record, but to make a dozen errors in 1541 words must. I do not have the time, nor The Telegraph the space, to refute all his errors and misrepresentations. I shall just point out a few to give the flavour. One, I did not interpolate (he means extrapolate) his 2002-2006 figures of illicit financial flows back to 1947. Two, Kar generously forgives me for saying that researchers conveniently ignore wrong signs, and goes on himself to reject the traditional method of taking all signs as given by estimates: he ignores the wrong signs because the alternative would have given an illicit inflow into African countries that to his percipient eye appears absurd. That, coming from a self-professed researcher, sounds convenient to my untrained eye. Three, he says: We filter out countries with large and persistent illicit inflows through the balance of payments and we only consider gross outflows through trade mispricing, and then says that I contradict myself by saying that he and his assistants ignored wrong signs. If he prefers to call ignoring of wrong signs filtering, that is fine with me. His mistakes appear simple to me; if they led to Ford Foundation ceasing to finance him, lawyer-politicians would welcome him with open arms. He can choose the party on the basis of the economic criterion of profit maximization.

                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	False step                  
	Sir  The proposal put forward by the Union finance minister, Pranab Mukherjee, in his budget speech to set up a campus of the Aligarh Muslim University in Murshidabad has the mark of vote-bank politics (AMU plan stirs misgivings, July 8). The objection raised in this context by the former head of the department of Islamic history and culture of Calcutta University, Osman Gani, is significant. As Gani points out, if the government is really serious about setting up institutions of higher studies for the minority community, then it should inaugurate another full-fledged university in the state. Since the government has already invited several world-class universities to have their campuses all over India, there is no need for another AMU campus in Murshidabad. This is especially so since the AMU, by no stretch of the imagination, is a university of the rank of Cambridge, Oxford or Harvard.          
	However, the fear expressed by several eminent personalities regarding the choice of Murshidabad as the site of the new campus appears unfounded. Murshidabad is as unsafe, or safe, as the rest of the country in these times when terrorist activities have affected not just the border areas but also every corner of India.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Prabhakar Bhattacharya, Ichapore, North 24 Parganas 

                
	Sir  The opinion that an AMU campus in Murshidabad would be unfeasible because of the sensitive location of this district on the border is ludicrous. What does an academic institution have to do with porous borders? Are all the inhabitants of Murshidabad illegal immigrants that they will pass classified information to the enemy state through the AMU?           
	Instead of doing something worthwhile to bring Muslims into the mainstream of culture and politics, all that the government of West Bengal is interested in is their votes. It is thus not surprising that the people have shown them the doors in the last elections. We are grateful to the Central government for having allotted money handsomely for the AMU campus. We hope that this will help the young people of Murshidabad recover from the educational impoverishment they have been forced into in the last six decades.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Rezaul Karim, Behrampore

                
	Sir  Instead of inviting the AMU to Murshidabad, the West Bengal government should concentrate on improving the standards of primary and secondary education in the district. The literacy rate among Muslims is lower than the national average. The drop-out rate among Muslim children is also high. The problems besetting the Muslims will not be addressed simply by opening a branded minority community institution such as the AMU. The findings of the Sachar committee have exposed the deprivations suffered by the minority community all over India, particularly in Left-ruled states such as West Bengal and Kerala. The West Bengal and the Central governments are now competing with each other to compensate for the neglect accorded to the Muslims in order to win their hearts. Topping the list in the Muslim-appeasement agenda is the establishment of an AMU campus in West Bengal, as if the state were lacking in educational institutions to impart quality education to the Muslims. The political motivation behind Pranab Mukherjees proposal is unmistakable. In the past, the AMU had got embroiled in controversy after it decided to reserve 50 per cent of its seats for Muslim students. If the proposed AMU in Murshidabad starts discriminating between Hindu and Muslim students, communal hatred might be sparked off in this state, which has been proud of its secular character till now.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Subhankar Mukherjee, Borehat, Burdwan

                
	Sir  By asking the AMU to establish a campus in Murshidabad, Pranab Mukherjee has given credence to the belief that there exist two Indias, one Muslim and the other non-Muslim. Since there is no norm barring the admission of Muslim students to any of the existing universities, the idea of a separate university for Muslims sounds ridiculous.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta 

                
	 n Sir  The AMU may not be of the class of Oxford or Cambridge, as the editorial, Wrong campus, says, but then, how many Indian universities are of that standard? The basic purpose of establishing an AMU in Murshidabad is to impart education to the Muslims who are lagging behind their non-Muslim brothers. Why should Visva- Bharati be better suited than AMU to set up a new campus? The AMU is a modern university that also has several non-Muslims studying under it. An AMU campus in Murshidabad may boost communal harmony in West Bengal.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Mukhtar Ahmad, Aligarh 

                
	Sir  Murshidabad has witnessed a steep decline in its levels of primary and secondary education in recent years due to the poverty and religious conservatism of its people. An AMU campus will not address these basic problems of the district. On the other hand, it might convert conservatism into fundamentalism among the youth. By proposing to set up an AMU campus in Murshidabad, Pranab Mukherjee is playing the old communal card of his party. But the results of the game might be dangerous. Bengal might lose its communal neutrality in the process.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	I have often wondered why the shot freezes before Charu and Bhupatis hands touch in the final sequence of Charulata. Is she reluctant to touch him because she is in love with another man  Amal, the much younger, and more handsome, brother of her husband who shares Charus interests in the arts? Or is this a sign of her own apprehensiveness that Bhupati, despite his conciliatory gesture, will not be able to forgive her for her transgression?        
	Charu belongs to an affluent family, is intelligent and beautiful, but, nonetheless, a woman of the late 19th century. The doors to the world outside, a world that fascinates and frightens her at the same time, have remained cruelly latched. In the end, she suffers banishment from the inner worlds of her husband and her beloved.        
	Like most other great films, Charulata works at many levels. But Rays masterpiece, which is an adaptation of Tagores Nashtanir, is immensely successful as an exploration of the complex dynamics between an older woman and a younger man who are bound not just by love but also by a network of kinship. Both Tagore and Ray had been intimately involved with older women. This perhaps enabled them to examine such an erotic and intricate relationship sensitively.        
	What is it that draws young men to older female relatives? In a society where the interaction between the sexes is far from free, and is enacted on the basis of rigorous codes, the boudi or the bhabi is a delightfully accessible creature, and hence often the object of fantasy for younger men. Charu and Amal may have had common interests, but such ties are not only about minds, they are also about bodies. For most men on the threshold of their adult lives, these women in the family bring with them the first stirrings of a craving that is uncomplicatedly sexual. Unlike the Oedipal fantasy, it is possible for this one to be played out more openly, perhaps because the strict norms that act as a template for social behaviour appear to be somewhat less constrained on this count. Cultural spaces across societies have proven to be accommodating in this respect and have yielded songs, literature and cinema that can be both playful and serious depictions of these relationships.        
	But the allure of such women is also informed by its very illicitness. Incest is taboo in most societies, as it has the potential to disrupt their foundations. But forbiddenness can be powerfully compelling. In a seemingly liberal world, one that has moved on from Charus, cyberspace has become the primary source of enjoyment of such illicit fantasies. Be it sex-chat with luscious sisters-in-law in the anonymity of the virtual world or dedicated pornography sites packed with explicit images and videos of older women, such online resources are specifically designed to let men enter their most repressed, yet most tempting, fantasies.        
	But there is a continuity here, one that connects Amal to the men of a different time. Amal, driven by guilt, had forsaken Charu and escaped to another life. The men in front of the flickering screen also have their own little secret to keep.

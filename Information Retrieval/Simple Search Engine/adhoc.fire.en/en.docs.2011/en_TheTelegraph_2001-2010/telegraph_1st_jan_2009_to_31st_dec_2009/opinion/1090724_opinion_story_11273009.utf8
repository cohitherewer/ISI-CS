It considers the accomplishments of medieval draftsmanship in depth, studying the evolution of illustrated manuscripts and some of the individual artists responsible for them. It gets together historians, scholars and curators to focus on several areas at moments when drawing was a particularly favoured medium, such as Carolingian Europe, Anglo-Saxon England and 12th-century Regensburg. On the left is a consanguinity chart from Isidore of Sevilles Etymologies, produced in a German abbey around 1160-65. Top right is from an English bestiary of 1200-1210, and below it are Hebrew text and hybrid creatures from the 14th-century Spanish Prato Haggadah, written in the Sephardic script and read at the Passover seder.

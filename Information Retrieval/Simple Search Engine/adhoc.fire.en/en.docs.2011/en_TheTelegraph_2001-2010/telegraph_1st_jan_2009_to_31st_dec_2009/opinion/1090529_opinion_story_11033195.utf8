An integral part of this culture was the club where men ate, drank, and looked for hidden mole in female bodies when inebriated. One of the principal all-white clubs of India was the Tollygunge Club, founded in 1895 by William Cruickshank. Permanent membership to the club was reserved for British nationals till as late as 1967. THE TOLLYGUNGE CLUB SINCE 1895 (The Tollygunge Club Limited, Rs 1,000) by Pradip and Amita Das traces the history of this institution from its inception to the present day. Proclaimed as a collectors piece, this book would be a valuable addition to the coffee table. At the top is a sketch (1993) of the club by John Nankivell. Bottom left shows a tea party of yore in the club lawns, while in the middle is the Tipu Sultan Room. On the right is a Barbet Bluebeaked in the club premises.

                                                                                                                 THATS THE WAY SHE WORKS                          - A pen-and-ink letter and the car mustnt be red					 					      Anuradha Roy                                                      
	In July this year, it was reported that Indias first professional woman photographer, Homai Vyarawalla, 96 years old, had decided to swap her 55-year-old Fiat for a Nano. She paid up, and was promised that the very first Nano out of the factory would be hers. However, the car company overshot its delivery date, upon which Mrs Vyarawalla cancelled her order. (To add insult to injury, she announced that a second-hand Maruti would do just fine instead.) In August, on Parsi New Years Day, Tata officials came personally to deliver her car and beg forgiveness.         
	After all that, by September she was considering selling the new car. She explained that she was tired of the media attention. Also, she didnt like the cars colour any more. She wanted to sell because she did not like driving a red car.         
	Which man would discard a car because of its colour? Which man would admit to such levity when it came to cars? In Hilary Mantels Beyond Black, two women decide to buy a new car. They set off for a car showroom as if to a supermarket, and subversively, they picked one because they liked the colour and upholstery ... when the salesman tried to talk car sense, they just giggled at each other. The truth is, they [cars] are all much the same these days, she said loudly. I dont know much but I do know that.        
	I encountered Homai Vyarawalla and her sensible whimsicality some months ago. I was scouring the net for pictures from the Nehru era. Any good ones I encountered seemed to be by the same person, Mrs Vyarawalla. How was I to approach the formidable woman, to seek permission to reproduce one of her photographs on a book jacket? And how astronomically priced would that permission be?         
	The pictures displayed on the net were all from a book called Camera Chronicles of Homai Vyarawalla, which came out in 2006. I knew Sabeena Gadihoke, the author of this book, very slightly, from chance encounters: we bumped into each other in a park now and then, where we talked for a minute about her cats and my dog and then went our way.         
	Publishing is a serendipitous thing. How authors and editors, indexers, artists, cartographers, printers, and binders find each other, how they work and squabble, create and destroy  such stories are written in invisible ink into the pages of all the books we read. When I first started in publishing, as a tiny cog in a gigantic wheel, I was endlessly distracted by these lines between lines. With an official file before me, I couldnt be faulted for playing hookey; but I was getting very little work done, spending hours instead reading the old letters of Jim Corbett, A.K. Ramanujan, Salim Ali, and others. There was an irate letter from an author who described the cover designers efforts as a cheap sari blouse; there were importuning letters from an editor to Satyajit Ray, begging him to translate Tagores Nashtaneer/Charulata  and his patient, courteous refusals. One editor spent two pages persuading an author that his book was delayed because the south-west monsoon had made printing presses too damp. There were scathing letters from an editor to his postmodernist historian authors, and their equally tart replies. Out of such correspondence grew friendships and enmities that lasted lifetimes.        
	There is still such correspondence, only it happens differently  and it is never preserved for posterity and book historians. Almost all my communication with Sabeena Gadihoke was on email or the phone. There was only one thing on paper: an old-fashioned ink-and-paper letter.        
	When Sabeena told me how much permission to use a picture by Mrs Vyarawalla was likely to cost, I hung up my gloves. The charge was perfectly reasonable  even low  by the stratospheric standards of professional photographers. But not for a small press that lived off scholarly books. I told Sabeena this, with much cyber-handwringing. Sabeena (whom I still knew hardly at all, but for these now daily calls about the photograph) mulled over it and suggested I write a letter explaining things. It was important that the letter were worded right, she said. I needed to write clearly, describe the book whose jacket the photograph was for, describe our publishing house. If Homai Vyarawalla liked the letter, she would give permission. And one last thing, Sabeena said: Very Important. Dont forget to call her Mrs Vyarawalla.        
	And so, after many years, I found some thick cream paper and unearthed my old black fountain pen and a bottle of ink. The pen was jammed with disuse. I had to use it like a quill. Apposite in a way: Sabeenas book describes how Homai, born in 1913, went to school on steam trains, and because Fountain pens had yet to make an entry ... they had to carry a cumbersome inkstand for their pens to be dipped in ink.         
	Dear Mrs Vyarawalla, I began, that part of the letter being predetermined. And then stopped. What next? Camera Chronicles provided no encouragement, warning me that: A lot of Homais time is taken up with locating prints, arranging them; mailing them to places and getting them back ... I sometimes get the impression that the photographs are a bother for her now. Vyarawalla agreed: Sometimes I say ki photography mera peecha hi nahin chodti!! [Photography always follows me around like a nuisance]        
	Paralysed for words without the comfort of keyboard and glowing screen, I took refuge playing hookey again: this time reading Sabeenas book. Its fascinating not only for its remarkable subject, but for its intimacy, energy, and eye for detail. Page after page, it unfolds an original, intrepid life. For thirty years, as a news photographer, Mrs Vyarawallas journeys ranged between Sikkim, Manipur, the Chambal Valley, the Delhi Gymkhana Club and Parliament House. Her childhood was deprived. Her theatre-actor father died when she was seventeen, and there wasnt much money. Because her mother was asthmatic, Homai had to cook before going to school. Still, she managed to get herself a boyfriend (whom she married after a fifteen-year courtship), take pictures, teach herself tennis, act in plays. As a professional, she woke every day at 4.30 am to cope with the demands of baby and job. When her husband died in an accident, she shut her lens-cap forever and transformed herself into a woman who kept house for her son, gardening with passion and joining a ladies club. Then her son died.         
	If someone tells me of a death, says Mrs Vyarawalla, it doesnt affect me. I am not heartless but it doesnt affect me because everyone has to go. There is only one certainty in life, and that is death. So why make a fuss about it? Ever since her sons death, she has lived alone. She does everything for herself: sweeping floors, mending slippers, plumbing and electrical repairs. Last year, Sabeena took her abroad for the first time, on a lecture tour to various Western universities, including Harvard, and she charmed every stewardess and scholar she met. Mrs Vyarawallas circumstances could be described as difficult, even tragic. Yet, with every page of Camera Chronicles, what was evident was her ability to suck the juice from life and sustain herself.              
	The cover photograph on our book will show Nehru and Ayub Khan standing side by side against an overcast sky. That is what readers will see. What I will always see, outside the frame, with her back to me, is a young Homai on her knees, struggling in a scrimmage of male photographers and tearing her sari in the process. Ayub Khan, noticing this in 1959, remarked how unchivalrous the other photographers were. To which Nehru, familiar with Homai from many photo shoots, laughed. Thats alright, he said, thats the way she works.         
	Sometimes it isnt words that write themselves invisibly between the lines of a book, it is images. For me, it is the image of a 96-year-old who is whimsical enough to want to change her car because of its colour. And to give a publisher the use of her photograph gratis  refusing even a token fee  because she approved of a pen-and-ink letter in the age of email.       The author works in Permanent Black and has written a novel, An Atlas of Impossible Longing

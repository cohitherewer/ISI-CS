	Does spelling really matter? In one sense, of course not: we can communicate in speech, as if writing, let alone correct spelling, had never been invented. But they have been, and the English language has made a mess of the result. A quagmire I called our spelling two weeks ago, offering readers an Owed to a Spell-Checker, a poem that was perfectly intelligible if you read it out aloud but perfect nonsense if you only used your eyes.         
	How much simpler, you may think, if English used strictly phonetic spelling, as, say, Italian does. There are indeed enthusiasts who believe, as the playwright, Bernard Shaw, famously did, that we should do so.        
	But are they right? My ode, inspired by a well-known, much shorter one, was lighthearted, but I didnt concoct it simply for fun. It exemplified that English, unlike Italian, has very many words that sound exactly like some other word but are quite unrelated to it and have a quite different meaning.                 
	Real difficulty        
	Linguists call these homophones: due and dew, for example, or missed and mist. Put enough of them together, using the wrong spelling for the meaning you intend, and you can produce what is, to the eyes, a jumble of tosh. Thats what my ode did. True, I cheated a bit, in places running the sounds of two words together and writing, eg, week round for we crowned. But the lesson was there: ignore correct English spelling, however bizarre  write, say, your train arrived before it was dew, so I mist you  and you may end up mystifying the reader too.        
	Strictly phonetic spelling could have that effect, on top of the basic objection to it that it would cut English off from its past. There are strong pragmatic objections too: a need for worldwide agreement, and  no trivial matter  for a new, expanded keyboard. Yet the arguments for phonetic or at least logical spelling are strong: the real difficulty that even many native English-speakers have with todays chaotic spelling, and the trouble it causes anyone learning English as a foreign language.        
	These are facts. You dont need the polls recently conducted in Britain and America by the would-be reformers of the British-based Spelling Society to prove them. But there is a radical answer: perhaps, within limits, correct spelling doesnt greatly matter after all. Thats not an argument I like, yet I admit its force. British spelling was (slowly) standardized only by about 1750. Americas got there later still. Yet people were writing in English for centuries before then, intelligibly, indeed rather well, you may think. And even now, plenty of our communication is done with sounds alone, in speech, where the issue does not arise.                
	Dotty spelling        
	The irreverent notion Ive advanced horrifies me. And yet, and yet. And when the chairman of the said Spelling Society declared recently that what is holding the UK and the USA back is the irregular spelling system he was way over the top. Agreed, it takes longer to teach literacy to British or American children than some others. Agreed, too many leave school still with a sorry command of their own language. Yet for some 200 years, those held-back countries dominated the worlds economy and politics. One of them still does, nor is it dotty spelling that has weakened the other. And now their illogical, crazily-spelt language has become the common language of the globe.         
	There is a case for spelling reform. But it is a weak one, and the spread of spell-checkers is rapidly weakening it further. Frankly, wee kneed waist know maw thyme on it.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A matter of shock value
                                                                                                                 A MATTER OF SHOCK VALUE                          - This years Nobel awards in economics were surprising					 					      Bhaskar Dutta                                                            
	Nobel Prize announcements sometimes have great shock value. This year, the committees awarding the peace and economics prizes have set new standards on this score. Virtually everyone agrees that President Barack Obamas record so far does not merit the peace prize simply because he has not been in office long enough to make any difference to world peace. The economics awards to Oliver Williamson and Elinor Ostrom, the latter incidentally being the first woman to get the prize for economics, have similarly confounded most economists.         
	Both were rank outsiders with the betting firm Ladbrokes offering odds of 50-1 on either of them getting the prize. At least two of my colleagues in the economics department in Warwick, as well as a very well-known economist visiting us from the United States of America, had not heard of Elinor Ostrom. Williamson, on the other hand, was, until a few years ago, a highly-cited economist. But, he had receded from the mental horizon of most economists since his important work was done in the Seventies.        
	Ostrom and Williamson have been honoured with this years prize for their work on economic governance. This catch-all phrase refers to the study of the sets of rules or institutions under which individual agents interact with one another. The notion of rules also has to be given a somewhat broad interpretation. Rules could refer to the judicial system which influences the success with which property rights and legal contracts are enforced. They could be the rules that govern market transactions, or transactions within firms or between the government and private citizens. Research on economic governance attempts to analyse what can be said about the connections between different types of transactions and the appropriateness or optimality of specific rules. The two Nobel laureates have explored vastly different aspects of this extremely large field.              
	Ostroms claim to fame is her work on the classes of problems labelled the tragedy of the commons, this term incidentally having been coined by the biologist, Gareth Hardin. Consider any situation where individual property rights over a resource are not well-defined, making it a common-pool resource. For instance, the resource could be the stock of fish in the ocean, or groundwater or forests on public land. Then, traditional economic theory predicts that the absence of individual property rights will imply that more of the resources will be utilized each period than is socially optimal. So, too many fish will be caught resulting in a depletion of the fish stock, far too many trees will be cut down, and so on.        
	The underlying logic behind the overexploitation of common-pool resources is simple enough. Each individual, say fisherman, has an incentive to catch as much fish as he possibly can because his catch can make only a marginal dent in the future fish stock. The problem of over-exploitation occurs because the small dents of several fishermen add up to a large hole in the fish stock. This suggests that the optimal policy response in such situations is either privatization or nationalization of the common-pool resource whenever these are feasible options. The caveat is necessary because neither option may be feasible in international waters.        
	Ostrom challenges the conventional wisdom that the lack of well-defined property rights will result in a sub-optimal utilization of resources. Based on several case studies undertaken by her, she claims that the individual users of common-pool resources often evolve their own system of governance in order to promote the collective good. Of course, she is also careful to point out that there are several instances where the prediction of conventional theory turns out to be correct.        
	This raises the obvious conundrum. What distinguishes cases of successful versus unsuccessful governance? The methodology of case studies cannot help in solving this puzzle. Unfortunately, neither Ostrom nor others have proposed any well-developed theory which can provide answers or explanations. Ostroms own work presents us with an interesting set of facts, and she also makes some very interesting suggestions about designing an appropriate environment in which user groups can formulate rules to promote the collective good. But she has no definitive work, which is surely a reasonable requirement to be included in the most elite group of economists.        
	Williamsons work of the Seventies was certainly seminal and was instrumental in developing the modern theory of the firm. What is often not realized is that a huge volume of transactions take place within a firm. This implies that markets and firms are often competing institutions. An obvious question is what environment makes one a more efficient mode of governance than the other.        
	Both have their advantages. Markets are likely to work well if there are no impediments to implementing detailed or complicated contracts. Markets will also be relatively efficient whenever there is a large number of buyers and sellers. In such thick markets, the costs associated with the market  haggling or bargaining and the ensuing delay  will tend to be small. A buyer who tries to bargain too hard with a potential seller may find that some other buyer has offered a better deal to the seller.              
	Conversely, firms are likely to function more efficiently in thin markets. In such an environment, bargaining between divisions of a vertically integrated firm can be minimized because of the hierarchical structure of any firm  the CEO acts as the final arbiter and so can take matters in hand if there is excessive bargaining. The flip side of the coin is that authority can be abused, and this represents the costs of the vertically integrated firm.        
	Williamson also points out that a vertically integrated firm will be the efficient outcome if an agent on one side of a transaction makes relation-specific investments in either human or physical capital. For instance, consider a supplier who undertakes investments in, say, machine tools, in order to produce a very specific type of input for a customer. If this input does not have too many buyers, then the supplier and the buyer get locked into a relationship. Intense bargaining will result unless the two are integrated into a vertically integrated firm.         
	An important element of Williamsons work on the pros and cons of vertically integrated firms is that it results in a set of empirically testable propositions  one is more likely to see a vertically integrated firm if there is asset specificity or when the nature of the transaction requires complex contracts. There has been a lot of empirical work testing the validity of these propositions. The evidence is heavily biased in favour of Williamson.

	Testimony By Anita Shreve, Little, Brown, Rs 550        
	Like most of Anita Shreve, Testimony is gripping, though not quite perfect. But then, one doesnt expect perfection so much as some sort of instant gratification from her bestsellers. Her writing involves a mix of romance, psychological thriller and whodunnit that usually goes down well with readers, thanks to the invariably happy, though suitably muted, endings. Shreve never fails to deliver, and her persistency even won her an Orange Prize nomination for The Weight of Water (1997).         
	In Testimony, the plot is thickly laid: stewed in suspense, garnished with twists and turns, and topped with a surprise ending. The surprise turns out to be rather lame, although not just a cheap trick. Trust Shreve never to lose control. Testimony begins with a graphic description of an orgy involving students of an American private school, but Shreve throws in a sly rider here, a rejoinder there, enough to manoeuvre our reactions and warn us off, in case we have any naughty thoughts.        
	The bacchanalian scene, featuring three teenage boys (two of them 18, one 19) and a girl of 14, is captured on camera and posted on YouTube. After a member of the staff intercepts the video and brings it to the headmaster, the latter discovers two of his most brilliant students, Rob and Silas, to be two of the participants, with James, aka J. Dot, being the third boy. The real name of the girl is never known, she prefers to go by the alias, Sienna. The immediate fall-out of this scandal is twofold: the reputation of the school, Avery Academy, is tarnished; and the boys are booked under the law in the state of Vermont that deems sex with underage girls, with or without consent, to be sexual assault.         
	It might appear initially that Shreve wants to show how salvaging the image of the school and keeping the news from the media become more important than the fate of the boys and the girl. The headmaster forces the boys to plead guilty in a signed confession, without allowing them the benefit of legal or parental advice. But this is just the tip of the iceberg.        
	Shreve uses a broken narrative, interspersing a third-person omniscient voice with personal testimonies given to a researcher who is studying alcoholism and male behaviour among private-school students. This strategy allows Shreve to play things safe, but then, she does not quite get away with it.         
	It becomes evident, for instance, from the written confessions of the boys that Sienna had seduced them in no uncertain terms, although the onus of resisting her advances lay entirely on them. Even her roommate, Laura, has no good things to say about her. Sienna appears to be a self-obsessed girl, who cherished her blonde moments  a little nymphomaniac running after trophy boys like Silas, Rob and J. Dot, who are not only accomplished academically, but also basketball stars.         
	So, it becomes singularly unconvincing when Sienna, allowed to have her say, proudly declares herself to be a victim. She wants to be on Oprah Winfrey Show, write a book about her trauma, and even go on a lecture tour of schools to raise awareness about the dangers young girls face from alcohol and boys. She just stops short of asking for money from the researcher for agreeing to do the interview. Shreve may be trying to be objective, but she does not fool anyone. After such an unkind portrayal, readers really do not have much sympathy left for the spoilt, rich Sienna, who appears more pathetic than deserving of pity or understanding.         
	Her contrast with the morally upright, but temporarily distracted, boys is quite revealing. Silas, it appears, was a model of good behaviour until he found his mother in bed with the headmaster. He had an idyllic relationship with his girlfriend, but did not confide in her once he found out the bitter secret about his mother. Rob, another infallibly virtuous hero, justifies his transgression as a momentary lapse, smitten as he was by Siennas divine beauty  mind you, no mention of her irresistible sexual attractiveness. J. Dot, with only his sporting skills to recommend him, is made to look like a lesser human being compared to his illustrious juniors. He is unabashedly self-defensive: the girl asked for it, he maintains till the end.         
	Shreve lays out complex issues (teenage sex, alcohol abuse in schools, consent and adulthood) in a humane context that is often misrepresented and sensationalized in the media, although she is not above emotionally blackmailing her readers into taking moral positions. She also provides rather tame justifications for the way her characters behave, by invoking external circumstances, as if the mind alone is incapable of making the body live out its illicit fantasies.

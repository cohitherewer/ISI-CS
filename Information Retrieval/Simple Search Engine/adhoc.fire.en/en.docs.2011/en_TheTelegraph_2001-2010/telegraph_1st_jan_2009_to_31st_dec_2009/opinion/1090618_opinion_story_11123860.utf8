                                                                                                                 GHOST STORIES                                  How passing his exams and being possessed by a spirit intertwine in the life of a boy in rural Bengal                                            
	I have passed! my friend, lets call him Salim, told me on the phone. He lives in a village in West Bengals South 24 Parganas, and he was referring to his Madhyamik exams. He and his family of jobless, violently schizophrenic father, illiterate, daab-selling mother and younger, school-going brother have invested a great deal of their resources in education, so they were all thrilled by Salims results. But there was an edge of tiredness and anxiety in Salims voice that made me ask him if he was all right. No, he said, he wasnt, for he was possessed by a spirit: Amake bhute dhorechhe. Sensing that I wasnt taking this seriously, his mother snatched the phone from him and gave me a detailed account, her tone swinging between serious hysteria and a sort of giggling embarrassment at having to talk about such things with a city person like me.        
	The day before his results were to come out, Salim had gone to his aunts place, where he coaches a class of ten little boys and girls in English, history, geography and maths. (He had rung me early that morning to tell me that he was feeling ill with nervousness about his results.) Before sitting down to teach, he started sweeping the floor of his aunts hut, when he accidentally swished his own leg with the broom. That was when the spirit got into him. He immediately got a fever, and his teaching quickly got delirious. He kept saying that he was going to flee home and never come back, and that his aunts daughter was going to die soon. His mother was fetched and while she was dragging him home, he passed out on the road after hurling himself repeatedly against a tree. This was exactly the place where a murder was committed recently (Salims mother used the English word)  a Muslim man had been killed brutally by another man who had surrendered (her word) later and was now in jail. She was convinced that it was this murdered mans spirit that had possessed Salim. She first took him to a maulana in the next village. He confirmed her diagnosis and took Rs 400 for a tabij and a magic preparation of water and oil. She then took him to the hospital, where Salim was given paracetamol and his blood taken for tests.         
	In a few days, Salim was better. When I visited them a week later, he was still a bit subdued, compared to his usual ebullient self. His father was tied to their bed and driving the family mad with his beating and cursing, so Salim took me to his school, where he had to collect the admission form for his higher secondary classes. His school was like the one Apu went to in Rays Aparajito  minimal, almost desolate, yet alive with mischief and truancy that were somehow not of this age. I realized that Salim was the star here, among the students as well as the teachers. His mentor was the English teacher, a mild-mannered man in his early thirties, who told me that Salim was his favourite student, and even though he was himself a Hindu man, he had been relieved to hear that Salim and his mother had gone to the maulana who he thought would exorcise most efficiently the spirit that had possessed the boy. There were ripples of mirth everywhere in the school about Salims possession. The NCC were camping on the school grounds. On our way out, Salim pointed to them and asked me if they were freedom-fighters. He also found it terribly funny that their tents looked like slums (bosti-barir moto).        
	Once, when I had gone to stay with them, I had walked miles from the village along the railway tracks with Salim and his best friend, Ranjan, to an ancient Shib-mandir. It had a huge, raised, stage-like courtyard ringed with immense trees. Here, the two of them sang for me an entire Behula-Lakhindar pala that they perform every year at the end of Chaitra in the neighbouring villages. They took turns to play the tragic hero and heroine, but we had to get up when it grew pitch dark and the mosquitoes wouldnt let us sit in peace, for there was no moon that night. Before we began the journey back home, Salim took me to the temple-well and made me wash away the deodorant and aftershave that he said he could still smell on me. According to him, artificial fragrances attract spirits and snakes in the dark, greatly hampering, Im sure, the night-life of the village dandies, among whom Salim and Ranjan were definitely the most vain.        
	Salims hut rests on rickety stilts above a stretch of stagnant water covered with water-hyacinths. There is one large bed on which everybody sleeps, with his father tied to one side of it. Lying down on it under a tattered mosquito net and with the stilts buckling underneath, it feels like being inside a hut within a hut, each more precariously put together than the other. That night, after we got back from the mandir and went to bed, Salim told me how, years ago, he had gone out to pee into the water at night and found that he had inadvertently done so on a floating human corpse. He was delirious for days after that, and that dead thing in the water still haunts his dreams regularly. He also told me that he would never ever spend a night in a hospital, for they are full of ghosts that come out of the stains and odours in the unwashed sheets and oilcloth on the beds. In Malda, I had got to know a gang of children who had run away from home and were living in the railway station, working as sweepers and water-sellers in the trains. One springtime, they all started getting chicken-pox, but every time a boy was put in the hospital, he would slip out and return to the station before nightfall in spite of being severely ill. And they would all speak of a headless ghost without hands and legs (haath, paa aar mundu kata bhooth) that haunted the hospital wards after dark.               
	After listening to Salim that night, it occurred to me that many of these railway children were used by the RPF and police to carry corpses (often headless or dismembered) from the tracks to the morgue after accidents, suicides and murders. I thought of sharing this with Salim, but he had already set his phone-alarm and fallen asleep. He had to get up early next morning for his maths tuitions.

	Dissent is the soul of not just democracy but also of all civilized discourses. But dissenters who wield guns have no place either in a democracy or in a civilized society. The huge number of voters  out of an electorate of around 140 million  who voted in the first phase of polling for 124 Lok Sabha seats across 14 states, unequivocally foiled the Maoist gameplan. The scale of this grand celebration of democracy is hardly diminished by the rebels attacks on a handful of polling stations and on police or other forces. Maoists are known to target elections with the express purpose of gaining propaganda points. The attacks resulted in tragic loss of lives, including those of some civilians. But what stood out on the first day of polling was not the rebels mindless violence but the Indian voters rejection of the Maoist brand of political extremism. In many of the areas where the Maoists struck, the voters knew of the danger to their lives. But that did not deter them from exercising the one invaluable right that even the poorest in a democracy have. By exercising their franchise in the face of the Maoist threats, the people in Maoist-infested areas reiterated their undying faith in the democratic process. This massive and peaceful rejection of the politics of violence is Indian democracys abiding hope.         
	Yet, the sporadic Maoist attacks should serve as one more wake-up call to governments and politicians. It is no coincidence that the Maoists thrive in areas close to forests and inhabited mostly by the tribal people. And that is largely because neither the government nor the democratic process reaches out to these areas. For all the growth of the Indian economy and the rise of a prosperous middle class, there obviously is a vast area of darkness that is ever ready to breed mutinies of all sorts. Much has been made of a two-pronged strategy to tackle Maoism. This strategy supposedly aims at fighting it as a threat to internal security while addressing the socio-economic causes of the rebellion. It is time the Centre and state governments formulated a holistic approach to deal with the threat. Unfortunately, Indias political parties rarely see beyond the next elections. And in every challenge they try to see an opportunity  for themselves. The Maoist challenge will remain after the elections are over. The question is whether governments and politicians will stay on in the besieged zones to fight the battle.

                                                                                                                 FACE THE STORY                                                                       
	THE CIRCLE (Steidl, $40) by Fazal Sheikh is a slim, medium-sized volume of around sixty black-and-white portraits. The books elegance and superlative quality of printing heighten the quiet power of its subject matter. As we turn the pages and reflect on what we see, the depth and difficulty of Sheikhs work, the unaggressive but relentless challenge that it poses to our imagination, begin to dawn on us. The Circle combines photographs from Sheikhs two earlier books, Moksha (2005) and Ladli (2007), to make a sparer but more concentrated work. Moksha focused on the widows of Vrindavan. But Sheikhs investigation of, and reflections on, the lives of these women made him go backwards, as it were, through the stages of their lives. This led to Ladli, about the lives and deaths of the beloved daughter on Indias streets, and in its slums and villages. These two books mixed the voices of their subjects, Sheikhs own writings, and the findings of the various organizations working with the women to discover from childbirth what women, the mother and her daughter, have to suffer.        
	In The Circle, the writing is pared down to a short preface by Sheikh, and only the portraits are gathered in an intermittent sequence, with the names listed at the beginning and not as captions. So the reader has to concentrate on the visual essence of each face, one or two at a time, without any background information. Slowly, what begins to speak are the layers of history inscribed on each face, and as we look, we learn to use our attention and imagination to listen to and ponder the stories of these faces, or measure the gulf that opens up between their being and our looking. There are subtle differences of focus between the different parts of each face. The eyes, mouth and details of the facial skin are sharper than the surrounding portions of the face, head and rest of the body within the frame, and the elements in focus seem to move closer towards us, even as we look. The faces of Simran (left) and Vimala (right) seem to grow with our looking to an almost unbearable clarity, so that they are created in the real time of the steadily held gaze rather than being caught in the decisive moment of a shutter clicking. The portraits I made, Sheikh writes in the preface, remind me of the conviction of their stories and ideals; how they confronted me with a forthright gaze, and what seemed to me a surprising degree of calm. I realized that for many of them, life was not merely a single line, but rather something more resembling a circle, in which hopes and aspirations that were not attained in this life might be bestowed on them or on others in the next.        
	For Sheikh, art photography and the making of books are integral elements of a human rights activism that is as committed to perfectionism as to accessibility. Most of his books can be read in their entirety, and in English, Hindi, Bengali and French versions, as part of the International Human Rights Series at www.fazalsheikh.org.

                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Contentious prize                   
	Sir  Indian athletes could bring home only one gold and two bronze medals from the Beijing Olympics. Given the yardsticks by which the Padma awards  the highest national acclaim for sports and other activities  are being granted, there is every chance that India will see a worse tally in the future (Unkind Padma punch, Jan 28). It is time the basic guidelines for the awards were reframed. The Padma Vibhushan should be given to the winner of an individual gold medal in the Olympics and the Padma Bhushan to the winner of an individual silver in the same event. The criterion for granting the Padma Shri should be laid down more strictly. It should be given to the winners of gold, silver and bronze medals, not necessarily the first in any particular sporting event, and also for sustained excellence in any individual or team sport, be it in the Olympics or elsewhere. If the norms are laid down, there will be less cause for heartburn and injustice. Similarly, norms should be outlined for other sporting awards like the Khelratna, Arjuna and Dronacharya, and they should be made public.          
	Yours faithfully,      
K.B. Goswami, Calcutta

                
	Sir  What point was the Press Information Bureau making by putting the list of Padma awardees for the year 2009 on its website on January 25, and yet forbidding the media from using it before January 26? News channels flashed selected names from the list in their January 25 bulletins citing reliable sources even though the list was actually present on the PIB website.           
	It is improper to grade Padma awardees in three variants in a country with a billion people. Merging the three categories would allow more candidates to be eligible for the honour. Even if three variants are maintained, a person should be honoured only once in his lifetime with any of the Padma awards. The list of Padma aspirants should have the clearance from intelligence and tax authorities before it is presented to the awards committee. The government should give reasons for deviating from the guidelines laid down by the K.R. Narayanan committee. The last date of receiving nominations was shifted by one month, that too, reportedly, with the flexibility to receive additional recommendations from the president, vice-president, prime minister or Union home minister. The selection of members of the awards committee should also be a transparent process.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Madhu Agrawal, Delhi

                
	Sir  Not all recipients of the Padma awards can command respect (Ash splash in Padma pond, Jan 26). For many, the Padma awards are nothing more than an annual ritual conducted without any serious thought behind it. How can Sundarlal Bahuguna, Anil Kakodkar and Sister Nirmala be equated with Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Akshay Kumar? What happened to the Olympic medal winners in boxing and wrestling? Why were sportsmen like Abhinav Bindra placed on the same pedestal as Harbhajan Singh?           
	Yours faithfully,      
Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad

      
	Sir  I was shocked to see Aishwarya Rai Bachchan in the list of names for the Padma awards. It will soon be time to award a Padma Shri to Rakhi Sawant and Mallika Sherawat for their contributions.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Tuneer Bondhopadhyay, Calcutta

                
	Sir  There should be no controversy over the granting of prestigious civilian honours like the Padma awards. It is fairly obvious that Aishwarya Rai Bachchan got her surprise gift because of her familys proximity to the Samajwadi Party leader, Amar Singh. It is a fair guess that the Bachchans can now be roped in to campaign for the United Progressive Alliance in the coming elections.           
	There are other indications of the awards being politicized. Was the Padma award given to Anil Kakodkar to acknowledge his contribution towards the Indo-US nuclear deal or to slight Prakash Karat? Doubts have also been expressed over the award to Sister Nirmala. Was it to appease the Christian community or to honour her for her selfless work for the poorest of the poor? It was also surprising to see Akshay Kumar getting a Padma Shri. The star himself has reportedly admitted that he does not know how to act, and attributes his fame to his expertise in martial arts. Clout, appeasement and self-interest are all that there are to the Padma awards. The government of India should stop this mockery at the earliest.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

                
	Sir  It goes without saying that the governments criteria for the selection of awardees for the various categories of the Padma awards appear mysterious and intriguing. Various state governments and regional lobbies project and recommend their respective candidates. Pressure groups at the central level also exert their influence before the final selection is made. In the process, the really deserving individuals  those who have made great personal sacrifices and contributed much to society  are left out. In this years list, there are many names from the world of entertainment and films. One would like to know what contribution these worthies have made to society? What sacrifices have they made to receive such honour? Whether film-stars or cricketers, the entertainers have raked in millions of rupees by way of fees and endorsements. What more do they deserve?                    
	Yours faithfully,      
K. Venkataraman, Mumbai

                
	Sir  Why are the Bhajjis and the Ashes being hounded out for vilification? Aishwarya Rai Bachchan has long been the international face of India, and hers, like Mother Teresas and Sister Nirmalas, is also a face that is Indias. Why try to hide under the burden of morality? There is also no way one can deny Harbhajan Singh or M.S. Dhoni their honour. They play world-class cricket and bring home the prizes India lusts after. As for Sushil Kumar and Vijender Kumar, their exclusion was, of course, an unfortunate omission. Perhaps it will steer them towards winning the silver in the next Olympics, or maybe even the gold. Besides, there is no way a billion people can be made to think similarly. This only means that each Padma award season is bound to be as controversial as the previous one.           
	Yours faithfully,      
J. Mahanta, Cuttack

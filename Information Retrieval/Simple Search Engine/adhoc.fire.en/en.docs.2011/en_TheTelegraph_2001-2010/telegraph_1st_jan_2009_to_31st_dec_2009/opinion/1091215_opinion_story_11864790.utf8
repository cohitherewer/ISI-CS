                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        BITS AND PIECES                                  Malvika Singh                              
	With the government at the Centre having buckled to the fast-unto-death pressure or blackmail, call it what you may, the United Progressive Alliance government has paved the way for many groups to make their demands and fast unto death till their personal little kingdoms are delivered. Vidarbha should take a quick lead and bring its demands to a boil. So should Gorkhaland, Bodoland, Maoland and Ulfaland, among others. Fifty-eight-plus states would be easy pie. Rumours abound about who forced the pace and brought about this negative decision. The great oral tradition tells no lies and the very small, key group of players who orchestrated the timing from Delhi with their partners in crime in the state, have defied the real political position in Andhra Pradesh as well as the late Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy, who was dead against the breaking up of this Congress bastion in south India.         
	A snippet of recent history  when the high command in Delhi was consciously misinformed by a vested interest faction about the possible election result in 2009, he, as the incumbent chief minister, asserted the correct political position, pulled the rug from under the feet of the manipulators, stalled the deal for the time being, and won an incredible victory, killing all talk of anti-incumbency. He understood the reality of his state. N. Chandrababu Naidu, who at the same time had tried to become the saviour of Telangana in a desperate effort to assert himself politically, lost badly. K. Chandrasekhar Rao and the Telangana Rashtra Samiti were wiped out at the hustings. To resurrect them for no reason at all, and to consciously dilute the presence of the Congress in the South, can only be described as a kneejerk reaction.              
	Scarred nation        
	The other explanation for this announcement was that the core group believed, wrongly, that there was a peoples uprising, and that stopping the bifurcation would lead to violence. To jog our recent memories, this was the same reason given by those who triggered the killing of the Sikhs in Delhi, the destruction of the Babri Masjid and more  passing the buck to innocent citizens who want none of this.        
	If the Congress was keen on the creation of Telangana, it should have started the process some years ago, when the TRS was a part of the coalition. Clearly, no thought has gone into that. Political business in the Congress is, as usual, meticulously planned behind the scenes in Delhi, with regional players making parochial demands. False statements about the reality on the ground are deliberately made to those few who finally take the decision in good faith. The leadership in Delhi should have its hand on the pulse. What prompted the Congress to destroy itself, just when it had begun to recover?        
	Has the Congress-led UPA worked out a meticulous plan to divide Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashta into sub-regions? Will it give in to the demands of Rayalaseema, Braj, Bhojpur, Oudh, Bundelkhand, Magadh, Darjeeling, Duars, Marwar, Mewar, Bhilistan and more? Is it serious about redefining state boundaries? Doing this sensibly requires a profound understanding of our civilization and a keen knowledge of the mechanisms and processes of decentralized governance. Alas, those who manipulate such moves are just political operators, not political stalwarts. That is the tragedy of present-day India. It is bereft of great leaders.        
	It would be fascinating to know how this deal happened. A little booklet written by a fly on the wall would make riveting reading and would expose the manner of politicking in India. Instead of calming tempers, faulty political judgement has stoked the fire that will engulf ordinary, decent citizens and leave the next generation scarred. Can this be reversed?

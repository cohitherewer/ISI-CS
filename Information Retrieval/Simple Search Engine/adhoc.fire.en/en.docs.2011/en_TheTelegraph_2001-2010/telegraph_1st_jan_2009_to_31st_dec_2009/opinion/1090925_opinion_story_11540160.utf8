The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Walk on the wild side
                                                                                                                 WALK ON THE WILD SIDE                                                                
	AN AFRICAN DIARY: 12 DAYS IN KENYAS MAGICAL WILDERNESS (Oxford, Rs 1,995) by Valmik Thapar is a day-by-day account of the authors sojourn in Kenyas Masai Mara and later, in Ol ari Nyiro, the countrys largest private conservancy run by a woman who shares Thapars passion for wildlife conservation. The book is embellished with over 200 photographs  most of them have been taken by Thapar and a few others by Amit Chhabra and Ian Johnson  which are a testimony to the stunning array of animals and birds that roam the surviving stretches of bush country. Unlike other visitors, Thapar is not primarily interested in photographing the Big Five. Instead, he attempts to document the rich diversity in this web of natural life  and is more or less successful. Thus, along with pictures of the lion, leopard, elephant, rhinoceros and buffalo, there are also rare and beautiful images, such as those of a puff adder soaking in the early light, the majestic long-crested eagle and the elusive bat-eared fox among other exotic, but lesser known, species that know the Mara as their home.        
	However, Thapars text fails to engage in the way that the photographs do. The book is in the form of a diary, and is a detailed account of the daily sightings. Thapar is obviously excited about his close brushes with wild animals, and this is evident from the liberal use of exclamation marks. But the reader should not expect to be enthused by the dreary prose, and might be forced to seek solace in the visuals. Nonetheless, Thapar, as always, raises some crucial questions regarding conservation and the environment, and suggests that India can learn from Africa how to overcome the odds in its own battle to save the forests.        
	Kuki Gallmanns excellent afterword The Guardians of Eden is an important inclusion. It not only chronicles the extraordinary journey of an Italian woman to Africa and her dedicated battles against poachers to save Kenyas wildlife but also answers some of Thapars questions regarding conservation. Gallmann is an advocate of the inclusive approach, and conservationists and policy- makers in India might benefit from her simple, yet innovative, suggestions to address the various problems that afflict, and sometimes cripple, the efforts at conservation made in India and Africa. Ian Johnsons The key to paradise is an equally illuminating account of the principles that have shaped eco-tourism and the role of the guide in this ancient and beautiful continent.

	Sandipan Samajpatis solo recital, organized by Ritwik (South) at the G.D. Birla Sabhagar on November 5, was distinguished by the artists naturally elegant style. Samajpati began with a careful, though not unadventurous, exposition of Yaman, before moving on to Hameer and Malkauns.        
	Trained by Manas Chakraborty and Ramashray Jha, Samajpati is the inheritor of two formidable traditions, each famous for its repertoire of rare ragas and colourful bandishes. Both his gurus have composed beautiful new ragas and introduced a unique whimsicality to the art of the khayal. In contrast, Samajpatis gayaki, although unmistakably informed by these twin sensibilities, may sometimes sound a bit safe. But, thanks to his richly sonorous voice, he never sounds dull. His voice can be playful, evocative, layered; it is always teeming with possibilities that could have been explored in more detail. Leaving aside the momentary struggles with the tempo, the khayals in Yaman were sung flawlessly, embellished with delicate meends and gamaks, and sparkling with inventive phrases. The composition in Hameer, typically for a bandish by Jha, was filled with a lyrical charm. Samajpatis excellent bolkari revealed his intelligent understanding of the words, which lent an extra edge to his interpretation.        
	The second half of the evening started on a pensive note, with an arresting rendition of Malkauns, once again devoid of frills and developed with grace and caution. Samajpati displayed impeccable taste by never giving in to the easy charms of virtuoso singing. The concluding hori thumri, a Manas Chakraborty creation, was sung competently although a trifle routinely. Hiranmay Mitra and Subhankar Banerjee provided excellent support on the harmonium and the tabla respectively.              
	The concert organized by the Academy of Indian Art and Music at Birla Academy on October 31 was a strikingly different affair. Sudeep Pals dhrupad in Yaman Kalyan was poorly structured and profoundly soporific. Pals vocal prowess is far from remarkable. His voice quavers embarrassingly in the upper octaves, while the heavy gamaks and bols come off indistinctly. For a raga relying heavily on meends, Pals Shankara was singularly flat and colourless. Ratnankur Mitras feisty pakhawaj playing proved to be the only saving grace.        
	The brindabadan by a group of tabla-players that came next did not liven up the proceedings very much. Although a popular choice, their teentaal was a tame affair, almost formulaic in its unoriginality and distorted by faulty acoustics. The final section, where Sugata Marjit presented khayals in Malkauns, had to be wrapped up in great haste. After a token elaboration, Marjit quickly moved on to superfast sargams and taans reminiscent of Vishmadev Chatterjee. Marjits frantic pace left the accompanists (Hiranmay Mitra on harmonium and Ujjwal Roy on tabla) breathless and the audience exasperated. He ended with a Bengali ragpradhan song and a self-composed bhajan.

	For the nation                  
	Sir  The railways minister, Mamata Banerjee, has stated that locals will be preferred for jobs in the organization (Wages eat into rail cash surplus, July 10). It would be interesting to see how the the word, local is interpreted by the railways. The Indian Railways is not bound by borders. It takes Indians to the farthest corners of the land. As such, the railways can be considered to be one of the true symbols of national integration. Therefore, the term, local, should have no relevance for the railways ministry.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Worlds apart          
	Sir  The arrest of poor people by the police in Lalgarh is unfortunate. K.P.S. Gill has compared the situation in Lalgarh with that of Punjab during the Khalistan movement (Crack tactics, tackle Maoists, July 4). In Punjab, militants had often inflicted violence on the police. But in Lalgarh, it is the police who have mercilessly beaten up the villagers, blinded Chitamoni Murmu and arrested ordinary residents for the blasts that had taken place miles away. Also, while Punjab is one of Indias richest states, the condition of Lalgarh is pathetic. There are no roads, electricity or food for the people there. The villagers are having to bear the tyranny of the men in uniform over and above this. Police atrocities have forced villagers in Lalgarh to join the Maoists. But the Khalistan movement was of a different nature altogether.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The ban on Maoists by the Centre is a strategic step meant to put the state government in a quandary (Delhi ban bares Bengal dilemma, June 23). But the ban will in no way put an end to the sufferings of the people in the affected areas. The poor people of West Midnapore, Purulia, Bankura, Burdwan and Birbhum have suffered the Left Front rule for over three decades. They have been denied the benefits of Central welfare schemes. Instead of taking steps to mitigate their sufferings, the prime minister and the home minister sent the armed forces to Lalgarh to assist the state government whose inept handling led to the aggravation of the current crisis. The Centre cannot wash its hands off by saying that ensuring the welfare of the common people is the responsibility of the state government. The steps taken by the Centre will neither make it popular nor solve the problems faced by the people.           
	Yours faithfully,       
A. Roy Mukherjee, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Tribal people have been ignored by successive governments for decades. Hence, they had no other option but to take up arms against a government that had siphoned off every penny, which was meant to be utilized for their development. The promises of roads, jobs, healthcare and vocational training for tribals have never been honoured. Bureaucrats and ministers have taken advantage of their ignorance and amassed wealth for themselves, while the tribals have continued their beggar-like existence. The state government now calls them terrorists. If tribals are terrorists, what should one call the government?                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot           
	Sir  Swapan Dasguptas fascinating thesis on the defiance of conventional sexual morality leading to a broader moral relativism was thought-provoking (Inclusive desire, July 10). Perhaps that explains the preponderance of homosexuals from the sangh parivar in the conspiracy to assassinate Mahatma Gandhi.                    
	Yours faithfully, Supriya Guha, Basel, Switzerland

	Stress is optional                  
	Sir  Kapil Sibals proposal to make the Class X board exams optional to relieve stress needs reconsidering (Against odds, plan to make exam optional, June 27). Perhaps he could learn a lesson from the Kerala education minister, M.A. Baby. Baby has introduced the grade-system in Kerala at the secondary level, reducing the value of these certificates. Almost all the Class X and XII candidates pass the examinations. However, when they appear for their medical or engineering examinations, they are put under sudden stress. No competition upto the age of 17, followed by stiff competition immediately afterwards, ends up not making much of a difference to the stress on the students.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Examinations are a necessary yardstick. The pressure of studies can be eased in so many different ways, like increasing the number of seats in educational institutions and doing away with quotas. The education system can be modernized and made more student-friendly. A lenient approach can be taken while grading. The examinations can be made simpler and easier so that students get their rewards according to their talents or intelligence. If the unfairness in the system can be removed, then the students will benefit automatically.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Kapil Sibal has set the tone for innovative changes at the school level. Our education system is archaic. It has evolved only slightly since the days of the British raj. No doubt the enrolment rates in schools and colleges have increased, but the quality of delivery has markedly deteriorated. Lack of incentives to enter the teaching profession and poor infrastructure are two major barriers. Poor families still see little hope of education leading their children out of poverty. So they do not encourage their children to attend school even if the facilities are available.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Kapil Sibals is a healthy initiative to modify the education system. An alarming number of stressed-out children have committed suicide over the past few years. A child who is not mature enough to get a driving license before the age of 18 should not be expected to go through the first major hurdle in his education. Along with this, we need a great deal of improvement in the quality of education being imparted in the lower classes at government and private schools. The initiative to regulate the fees of private schools is a timely step, which will give relief to helpless parents. The commercialization of school education should be kept within limits. Schools should also be responsible for safely transporting children between home and school.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  It does not make sense to have two board examinations within a span of two years. It is also a wise decision to maintain uniformity in all board examinations throughout the country. Every Indian is entitled to take competitive examinations in any part of the country, and a common yardstick to measure their abilities is necessary. However, in order to check irregularities in the admission of students, a central board of primary education should also be set up to conduct the Class VI examinations. Fresh admissions could be made to Class VII by means of a merit list prepared on the basis of this examination. Perhaps we should also think of ways to compel children of affluent families to go to government-aided schools. Affluent parents will then have to rethink before donating huge sums to get their child admitted to expensive public schools.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Kapil Sibal seems to have an impression that it is only the Class X board examinations that are traumatic. To get a child admitted to the kindergarten class in a reasonably good public school is no less traumatic. I see my grandchildren struggling with monthly tests in the lower classes as much as those who appear for these board examinations. Board examinations differ from school tests in that they grant public recognition to a certain standard of education for gaining employment or acquiring higher education. The cause of trauma is not the examination, but the limited opportunities for acquiring higher education because of getting less than the qualifying marks.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Kapil Sibal is in a hurry to reform education within 100 days of the United Progressive Alliances tenure. This raises doubts about whether Sibal is trying to reform the Indian education system or simply helping out the recession-hit American universities. Moreover, it is unbelievable that a foreign university would want to invest in India without a profit motive.           
	Given that private institutions in India make enormous profits, the implementation of any law that can prevent this is suspect. Foreign universities will enjoy fewer restrictions from the government and therefore make more profits, eventually taking over the Indian universities. The experience of foreign investment in our insurance and banking sectors substantiates this argument.           
	Yours faithfully,

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | out in the open
                                                                                                                 OUT IN THE OPEN                                                          
	Did you know that October 15 was World Handwashing Day? To many, this piece of information would have a trivial and faintly absurd ring. But take into account two other facts recently published, and suddenly something as banal as washing ones hands begins to mean a great deal more. First, in 2006, more than half the number of people in the world who defecate in the open lived in India. Second, 386,000 children, out of the 1.5 million worldwide who die annually of diarrhoea (the second leading killer of children), are from India. The latest report by Unicef and WHO on children and diarrhoea, where these figures have been presented, says that adults and children being able to wash their hands can reduce diarrhoea deaths among children by 40 per cent.         
	Several other ways of preventing and treating diarrhoea have been recommended in this report. But trying to imagine situations in which access to proper toilets and being able to wash ones hands are difficult, impossible or simply not part of ones regular habits gives a sense of the complexity of the problem in urban and rural India. In spite of the various rural sanitation schemes all over India, proper toilets are still scarce, or too purely dependent on government subsidy and divorced from community initiatives. For girls and women, this is not just a question of infection, but also influences decisions regarding going to school (many of which do not have toilets) or raises questions of safety in having to go alone to the open fields. Lack of clean water in the toilets, even when these are properly constructed, continues to be a problem. In West Bengal, arsenic-contaminated water is only one of a range of ills that the poor, and not so poor, have had to contend with in the face of the governments persistent indifference. But parts of some districts, like Purulia and Midnapore, claim to have made themselves free of open defecation.        
	In the cities, the problem is twofold. Among those who live in slums or on the streets, toilets and the most rudimentary practices of personal hygiene continue to be unimaginable. The homeless poor must cook, eat, defecate, urinate, menstruate, procreate, decay and die on the streets without the luxury of washing their hands before and after. All these activities happen so openly, and therefore so invisibly, in the cities that they have become part of their unshocking, everyday character, which nobody would dream of changing. And among those who do have toilets with running water, a lopsided notion of personal hygiene prevents them from keeping their hands clean for their own sake and for the sake of others. Nose-blowing usually happens publicly and violently in the absence of tissues or handkerchiefs and is seldom followed by handwashing, and men tend not to wash their hands after urinating in the absence of tap, sink and soap in the public urinals (when they do bring themselves to use these). So, the next time you grasp a handrail on the Metro and it feels warm to the touch, think of World Handwashing Day  and it may not be all that amusing.

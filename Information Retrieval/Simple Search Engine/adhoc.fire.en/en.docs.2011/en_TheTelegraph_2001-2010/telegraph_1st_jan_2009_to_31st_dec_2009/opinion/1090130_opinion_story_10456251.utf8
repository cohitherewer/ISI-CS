The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | lost the plot again
                                                                                                                 LOST THE PLOT AGAIN                                  BONA FIDE - Malvika Singh                              
	As we celebrate our gradual maturing as a democratic, secular and federal republic, a sadness tends to mar what should have been a proud moment. The intolerant attitudes of political dispensations, albeit marginal, have invaded civil society with a militant assault on all that they find incomprehensible because of their narrow minds and parochialism. A scary vacuum confronts us in both regional and national leadership across all parties, making us realize how the foundation laid in the 1950s has been corrupted, twisted, misused and exploited to suit the personal predilections of the rulers and their minions. Instead of adding to, and enhancing, the fundamentals to deal with a changing world, a self-serving political class, aided by an equally parasitical bureaucracy destroyed the ethics, morality and integrity of an inclusive and transparent governance.        
	This legacy of the last 59 years needs immediate, radical correction. To have Manmohan Singh at the helm for the last five years was an aberration, a breath of clean air unpolluted by devious, underhand politicking. There was a sense of purpose even though many of us wanted quicker, more deliberate action, and were often critical of the government. In hindsight, the United Progressive Alliance government delivered many goods  with the exception of some unacceptable doings indulged in by certain coalition partners who shamelessly acted for their own aggrandizement having got an opportunity of a lifetime to rake it in. To have a scrupulously honest prime minister was a godsend. It threw the wheelers and the dealers within the Congress into a tizzy because it began the process of their exit from the high ground of politics. They tried hard to discredit Manmohan Singh, scoffed at his rejection of political manipulation, attempted to demean him, but failed miserably. He rose above them, and has become the steady bridge for a generational transition.                 
	Brownie points        
	As the future unfolds and there is a glimmer of hope on the horizon, a rude interruption happens. A bizarre proclamation by Ashok Gehlot hits us in the face as he enunciates his urgent priority as chief minister to put an end to the culture of young boys and girls holding hands, going to pubs and malls because it is against Indian culture. What culture? Whose culture? He has, in one stroke, tried to transform a liberal, progressive party into a Talibanized entity. Next, will he enforce women to stay home and not work, cover their faces, and more? Having been brought into frontline politics by Rajiv Gandhi, a modern intellect for whom this kind of fake conservatism was anathema, it is shameful that Gehlot is being allowed to get away with this madness. It is indeed inappropriate and unacceptable that the legacy of Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi is being brutalized by petty, unlettered political entities. This mindset is an assault on our democratic rights.        
	The intellectual inadequacy and immaturity of such superficial, failed leaders, who have presided over corrupt governments, condoned corrupt colleagues and have not been able to deliver law and order, have made this great civilization into an unthinking, closed and disabled nation-state.         
	Some questions need to be asked: what is Gehlots cultural position on inter-caste marriages or inter-faith unions like between a Hindu and a Catholic  Rajiv Gandhi and Sonia Maino? Is he questioning the extraordinary legacy of the freedom of choice left to us by his mentors and leaders, by Nehru and Indira? Is he setting his personal agenda, deviating from the party morality of liberal civil freedoms or has he just lost the plot? Or is he merely playing silly politics, trying to gain foolish brownie points as he demeans his predecessor for being different from him? Gehlot should stay home and observe purdah. Cheers!

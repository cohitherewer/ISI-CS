The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A season of betrayals
                                                                                                                 A SEASON OF BETRAYALS                          - Two films and what they notice        Telling tales - Amit Chaudhuri                                                        
	A month ago, we found ourselves watching Attenboroughs Gandhi again, with its familiar mixture of earnestness and calculated design  largely because of our eleven-year-old daughters unexpected interest in nationalist history.         
	Not that Gandhi notices much. It possesses too good a story, composed in a series of neat, revelatory parables for it not to be a sort of festive offering, a Christmas nativity play. Noticing introduces an element of stillness to a narrative; and almost the only time this happens in Gandhi (inadvertently, from the researcher wanting to be true to documentary footage) is in the brief recreations of the Congress working committee meetings, the famous leaders situated on a mattress on the floor, their inward restiveness concealed by postures of lassitude. Gandhis arm is almost always bent at the elbow, as he leans to the left or right; as if either fatigued by the heat or subconsciously aware of an incursion of the erotic into the proceedings, he seems incapable of sitting upright. Its a posture common to certain forms of Indian conversation: Bhupen Khakhar occasionally captured this limpness in Indian, especially Gujarati, men in his paintings, and titled one of them (showing a single such figure) Sakhi bhav  which might be loosely translated as an air of feminine dalliance. Nehru is too patrician, too angular, to truly possess this languor; but he too, in these meetings, is leaning, trying to ease his slightly resistant body, like an eager, idealistic boy next to his wizened but experienced teacher. Although press photographers were privy to such congregations, they still have an atmosphere of flirtation and intimacy which the public eye cant breach: with one person saying something into anothers ear, while the other, head bent, listens  or (if you are watching a newsreel) nods his head. The fact that these people are to be found at floor-level, in a place associated in our minds with idleness and childhood, and that these leaders are trying to ignore the heat (the pankha-puller is at work; or a fan clatters overhead) gives to our politics a peculiar humidity.         
	From what I gather from glimpses on news channels, this is the way at least some meetings continue to be conducted today; upon the mattress, with a greater evasiveness of the eyes, accompanied by smiles  somewhat like a family of long lineage hiding its own malaise at a funeral. Someone has died; or possibly something. The progeny are all there: Jairam Ramesh, Chidambaram, Manmohan Singh, Pranabbabu, and, at the centre, the matriarch in the beautiful but unostentatious cotton sari, whose status is undeniable but at the same time implicitly uncertain. An old unappeasable grief marks her tranquil expression, mingled with a tenacious faith in power.         
	Is this, too, how the BJP meetings take place, with the figures arranged almost randomly, but centripetally, converging towards some invisible point of merging? And yet, though languor suggests familiarity and proximity, it also hints at deception and distance. The elbow and shoulder leaning in the direction of the figure on the left, imagine, has leaned tellingly away from the figure on the right. The person whispering into Advanis left ear is a million miles away from Vajpayee a few inches to his or her left, who, impassive, is ensconced in absolute solitude. The enactment of overweening intimacy also induces trivial but unexpected gulfs. All these working committee meetings, when they are not actually working (which is when, one presumes, the camera records them), have, with their exchange of confidences and their sudden solitudes, an air of The Last Supper  of imminent betrayals and disownings. This came to the surface of our consciousness with the emergence of Jaswant Singh in the last few weeks, and the tale of his secret dynamics with Vajpayee and Advani. Singh, you feel, unlike, say Rajnath or Amar Singh, is not a man to whisper confidences or have them whispered to him; his aloneness has a gnarled, organic quality; and, unlike Judas, you feel (clearly wrongly), he has no secret discontent. Jinnah, though, is only part of his problem. Well never know exactly what was going on, or going wrong.         
	As if in consonance with this theme of disowning (just as Attenboroughs film was televised to prime us for Independence Day), another movie, Gandhi My Father, appeared on the small screen the other night. I caught it purely by chance, during the obscure beaver-like fidgeting one performs in bed before going to sleep, and which is generally called channel hopping. I was drawn to it instantly, not because of the films innate qualities, but because  as if one were suddenly very far away from home  one is irresistibly drawn, late at night, to scenes from India on television: a train drawing into a platform; the glimpse of a field outside.         
	The film, as it turned out, was about Gandhis relationship with Harilal, the oldest and most difficult of his sons, who, in intense spurts, did many things during his troubled life: aspired to study law in England; thwarted by his father, turned to other activities, including alcoholism and questionable dealings with businessmen; briefly became a nationalist and a Gandhian, rather than just a Gandhi; later was also, briefly, a Muslim, Abdullah Gandhi; reconverted to Hinduism; died  not long after his father had  of liver disease. It is the story of the prodigal son, except that theres no permanent reconciliation on homecoming. Instead of ever saying to the already loyal, as the father in the parable says to the older brother who never left him: Son, thou are ever with me, and all that I have is thine... this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found, Gandhi apparently confessed: I was a slave of my passions when Harilal was conceived.         
	Gandhi My Father seems, at first, to have the air and the limitations of the Indian biopic, with the values given to this form by Attenborough, Shyam Benegal and Ketan Mehta. Dubbed voices, with the actors speaking their great historical lines in the studio, rather than in the heat and noise and uncertainty of filming, is one of the principal features of the biopic: it gives to it its enclosed, sepulchral, sacred mood. The use of a lingua franca is another: English in Gandhi; Hindi in the Benegal and Mehta films, and even in Gandhi My Father, lifting the politicians from the local languages they actually dwelt, argued and decried in into the high-flown and declamatory. And yet Feroz Abbas Khan, the director, escapes these shackling constraints by making Gandhi My Father episodic; by not staying with any event, however significant or traumatic, for very long. History in this film, as a result, begins to lose some of its symbolic fixity, and to take on the characteristics, the emotions, of memory. But I cant believe entirely that Gandhi spoke to Harilal with the controlled puritanical earnestness that hes shown to do by Khan. I imagine his manner of undermining his son to be slightly sarcastic; Gandhi had a sense of the acerbic, and used it to counter the English. No man who said Western civilization is a good idea, or could call an unsympathetic study of India the gutter inspectors report, would ever let go of irony as a weapon.               
	At the centre of the film is Akshay Khannas fascinating performance as Harilal. Here I must interject with a memory which came to me as I was watching the expressions on his face, of vulnerability and resignation. My father used to work in Bombay for a company that owned a cottage on the outskirts of the city, on Marve Beach, to which wed go on certain weekends. These cottages  called, romantically, shacks  were overseen by a man who looked like a retired Major, who we knew was Vinod Khannas father-in-law, the father of his first wife Gitanjali. We also found out that the marriage was coming apart. Partly it was put under strain by Vinod Khannas conversion to the Rajneesh cult, his move to Pune, where, among other things, he performed menial chores in the commune. Whether this has any bearing on Akshays execution of his task is doubtful; still, Ive never been able to keep the Major doing his rounds, nor my possibly misplaced intuition of a wound, from coming to my consciousness when I see Khanna acting.         
	This much both Khanna and the film succeed in conveying, as Attenborough doesnt: that any life, as Orwell said in relation to Dali, when viewed from the inside is simply a series of defeats. Its an observation that probably Jaswant Singh, Advani, Vajpayee, and Sonia Gandhi would all agree with. Once admitted, it must lead to a revaluation of history: that the choices we made, and not just others, were often wrong ones. But, remembering Khannas performance, Orwells remark on Gandhis intractable saintliness, made a year after his death, also comes to mind: To an ordinary human being, love means nothing if it does not mean loving some people more than others.

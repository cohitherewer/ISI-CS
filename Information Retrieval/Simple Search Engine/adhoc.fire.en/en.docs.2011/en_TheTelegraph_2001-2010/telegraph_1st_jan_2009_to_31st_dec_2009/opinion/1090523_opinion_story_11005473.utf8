	Liberal dollops of magic, mirth, the merits of virtue and reminders of contemporary reality go into the making of two current Bengali productions aimed at attracting young, adult audiences. The respective directors have dramatized each from Bengali short stories about fantastic journeys undertaken by two village youths.        
	Kuntal Mukhopadhyay got his inspiration from Shirshendu Mukhopadhyay for Samlap Kolkatas Lathi-kanda, in which a boy, Nabin, returns home with thousands of rupees from selling harvested rice, armed with a charmed stick gifted to him for protection. Meanwhile, Arun Mukherjee of Chetana drew on Swapnamoy Chakroborty for Manush kimba Kolbalish, about an unassuming errand boy, Taradas, who delivers video cassettes from his employers parlour to viewers homes. One day, a strange old man stops him and provides him, for free, a pair of wings to fly with, so as to make his job easier.        
	In both plays, our ordinary heroes expectedly run into trouble. Lathi-kanda features a range of petty criminals chasing Nabin, at first for his cash and later, once people realize the wondrous powers of his stick, to grab this amazing weapon. A secondary hunt for buried treasure in a ruined castle adds to the plot. In Manush kimba Kolbalish, Taradass wings lure the locals, from the police to politicians, to ask him for favours but, most ominously, some suspiciously-dressed outsiders convince him to fly a cargo of possibly hazardous material across the river. Both conclusions see the triumph of virtue, but the price paid for this victory differs.        
	Both productions are enjoyable and contain solid moral content that parents can heartily approve of. Samlap Kolkata has made Lathi-kanda very energetic and colourful, introducing muppets for variety. Best of all, it has the kind of hyperactive performance that only Kamal Chattopadhyay (picture, carrying Nabin) can produce, as a double-dealer shadowing the hero.        
	Manush kimba Kolbalish presents Chandan Chakraborty as the endearing, innocent Taradas. It incorporates songs and dances, plus puppetry, for wider appeal. However, the choreography is weak and the general dcor too barren for a tale deserving greater spectacle. Visually, only Taradass wings capture its imaginative flight. But in implying the threat of terrorism at the end, it grasps our real world better.        
	The Creative Arts Snow White and the Saline Curse, written by Sangeeta Bapuli and directed by Ramanjit Kaur, yoked the Brothers Grimm (hence Max Mueller Bhavan as collaborators) with the Sundarbans in the finale of its latest theatre course for little children. Although the thought of Snow White and her dwarf friends in the mangroves seemed most incongruous, the participation of nearly 30 kids in this awareness project on global warming in our adjacent delta made it a valuable educational exercise for them. Perhaps TCA could modernize Indian fairy tales, too.

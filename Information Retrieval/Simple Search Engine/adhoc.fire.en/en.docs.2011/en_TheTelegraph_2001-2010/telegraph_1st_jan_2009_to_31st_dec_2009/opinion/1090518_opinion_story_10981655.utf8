                                                                                                                 REACH OUT                                                    
	The mandate that the rest of India gave for a stable, Congress-led government in New Delhi extended to the Northeast as well. Few states need a stable and efficient government as much as Assam does. Two decades of ethnic insurgencies have taken their toll on social stability and economic development in the state. Tarun Gogoi should thus be relieved that the people once again preferred the Congress to the alliance of the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Asom Gana Parishad. Yet he has enough reasons to be worried. That the Congress tally in Assam dropped from nine to seven is, by itself, not a huge loss. Mr Gogois worst worry should be the loss of a large portion of the Muslim vote to the newly-formed Assam United Democratic Front. The fact that the partys veteran leader, Santosh Mohan Dev, not only lost the Silchar seat to his BJP rival, but also came third, is a measure of the erosion in the Congresss Muslim vote. The AUDF may have bagged only one seat, but it queered the pitch for the Congress in at least four constituencies, helping the BJP win them. The election results elsewhere showed Muslims reposing their faith once again in the Congress; the contrary trend in Assam should be a cause for concern for Mr Gogoi.         
	With a new, stable government under the partys leadership at the Centre and the assembly polls in the state still two years away, the chief minister does not face an immediate challenge from his political adversaries. But neither he nor his party can afford to ignore the future  and potentially more difficult  problems that the rise of the AUDF may pose. It is not that the Congress in Assam had not known about the threat the AUDF posed to the formers support base among the Muslims. The partys state leadership was apparently divided over a strategy to strike an alliance with the AUDF. Those who opposed the strategy were apprehensive that the Congress might lose some of its Hindu votes to the BJP-AGP alliance if it chose the AUDF as an ally. Mr Gogoi is known to have supported this line of thinking. But the poll results suggest that the Congress in Assam would have to rethink its strategy on winning back the confidence of the Muslims. An electoral alliance is not the only way to reach out to a group of people. But the party cannot afford to ignore the issue in Assam, which has the largest Muslim population for any state in India.

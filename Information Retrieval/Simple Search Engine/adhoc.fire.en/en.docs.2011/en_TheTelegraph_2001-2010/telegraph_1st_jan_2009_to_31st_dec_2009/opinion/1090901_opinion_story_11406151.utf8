The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | After the winds died down
                                                                                                                 AFTER THE WINDS DIED DOWN                                  Three months after the cyclone, Uddalak Mukherjee visits the Sunderbans to look at a corporate rehabilitation project                                            
	As I watched the waters rise on the Bidyadhari river, I was reminded of a passage in Amitav Ghoshs Hungry Tide. Ghosh had described how the boundaries between land and water are always mutating, always unpredictable in the tide country. Surrounded by the vast, grey Bidyadhari, I saw a stretch of land in the distance, but I could not be sure. It could have been the line that separated the river from the sky. In the Sunderbans, the rivers also blur the boundaries between what is, and is not, real.        
	I was on my way to Tipligheri, a remote tribal hamlet under the Lahiripur gram panchayat, to take a look at a rehabilitation project being run by the Hong Kong Shanghai Banking Corporation together with the World Wildlife Fund for the people devastated by Aila. On many an island in the Sunderbans, I was told, corporate bodies and non-governmental organizations had stepped in to fill the void left by the State, which had failed to provide relief to the cyclone victims. Six people had died in Tipligheri, three of them in an outbreak of gastroenteritis after the cyclone. A copy of a report, which I tried to hold in my hand and read in the fierce wind that blew from across the river, stated that the 84 surviving families were now dependent on food and shelter provided by the bank and the WWF.              
	Earlier, we had reached Gadkhali from Calcutta, crossed the river to Gosaba, and were now waiting on a rickety, motorized launch to get to Tipligheri. I was accompanied by Partho, the banks point-man who had facilitated the visit, and Chiranjib, a field officer from the WWF, together with a freelance photographer, a former policeman and a man from the fisheries department who was working on a de-salination project. The ride from Calcutta had been cheerful, with the former policeman entertaining us with stories from his uniformed days. At Gosaba, where the launch had stopped to pick up supplies, the mood was more sombre. Humbled by the sight of the river and the shadowy forest, we braced ourselves to visit a land and a people ravaged by winds and water.        
	Our boat set off, trailing grey foam, its engine making a thudding noise. We passed a line of boats, some of which were headed for the forest. Three months had passed after the storm, but I could still see its imprint on the banks: broken houses, bare stumps that were once trees, half-eaten bunds that were being rebuilt with sandbags and clay all over again. (Near Pakhiralay, Chiranjib pointed to the remains of a concrete embankment that had been washed away. In tide country, nothing, not even concrete walls, survive the elements, he said.) We left the Bidyadhari, crossed the Durgaduyani and then entered a channel called Dutta khaal near the Sajnekhali range. The half-submerged foliage of the forest continued unbroken along the banks.         
	Four hours later, we were in Tipligheri. I asked to be taken to the Lahiripur gram panchayat office first, where I was met by Radhakrishna Sarkar. Sarkar first told me how, on the day of the storm, he had waded into the swirling waters to rescue villagers and check for breaches in the embankment. Then he shared details of the rehabilitation work undertaken by the government in and around Tipligheri. An adequate number of tarpaulin sheets had been distributed (he could not tell me the exact number); government medical teams had visited the island shortly after the calamity; drinking water had been provided by the Sunderban Development Trust; each family had been given six kilograms of rice and some dal. (According to the West Bengal governments relief manual, after a natural disaster, each adult is entitled to 12 kg of foodgrains and each child to six kg of the same every month.) However, owing to irregularities in the list prepared by the foreman committee  a four-member body of the panchayat pradhan, panchayat samiti sabhapati, leader of the Opposition in the panchayat and the block development officer  that is supposed to identify the people eligible for relief, the money to rebuild damaged houses has not been provided yet.        
	Official statistics are like plasticine. They can be kneaded and twisted to make devious claims. Later, in the tribal hamlet, I was told that the panchayat in Lahiripur had provided only three kg of foodgrain in the month after the storm. The people here, mostly Mundas, had also heard that those who did not possess ration-cards would not be entitled to claim damages. None of the families, I was informed, had a ration or a BPL card. Forsaken by the State, they were now hoping to rebuild their lives with the help of corporate initiatives.        
	In Tipligheri, HSBC and the WWF have provided community kitchens, tarpaulin, medicines and mosquito-nets. To reduce the peoples dependence on the nearby forest, a vegetable garden, piggeries and poultries have also been set up. Community initiatives, too, have been undertaken to prepare raised earthwork. The talmukut variety of rice, which can survive saline conditions, has been planted on an experimental basis on 142 acres. If the experiment succeeds, it would be replicated in other parts of the Sunderbans to help fight crop failure on account of salinity. I stood near the community kitchen with a woman whose husband was killed by a tiger a few months back. She said that she would vote for the WWF in the next panchayat elections.               
	Is there then a case for relief and rehabilitation in the Sunderbans to be privatized, so that corporate bodies can help the victims directly, without the State acting as facilitator? The relief model that I saw in Tipligheri, seemingly transparent and participatory, seemed to be the right one. But private rehabilitation initiatives are not flawless. In the Sunderbans, there have been reports of NGOs doling out cup-noodles instead of puffed rice, even though there was an acute shortage of water to boil the noodles. The distribution of relief often adhered to political lines, and allegations of financial irregularities were not unheard of. Moreover, the reach of the State, and the funds that it commands, make its involvement imperative in such rehabilitation projects. The idea of a welfare state reneging on its responsibilities and forcing the people to survive on the munificence of corporate organizations and NGOs is unacceptable.         
	Evening had fallen on our way back to Gosaba. The islands  with their abject poverty and defenceless, heroic people  seemed to have affected us in different ways. Chiranjib was thinking about a meeting that needed to be organized in Tipligheri, Partho was immersed in calculations about how much money was still required to augment the work, while I sat and thought of the woman with five children who would never see her husband again. The river lapped quietly, but the forest was alive with the sound of the birds returning. Suddenly, I saw two creatures circling the darkening waters: they were dolphins, their graceful movement made me forget the misery momentarily. It was only then that I understood that in this land, webbed by immense rivers, beauty and terror were eternally bound together. Caught in the cycle of high and low tides, the beauty and the terror of the land, are the people who will never leave in search of dry land.

	Dying words        
	A woman who died of burns gave a dying declaration that her husband had poured kerosene all over her before setting her on fire with a matchstick. The husband was convicted and he appealed to the Bombay High Court, stating that the dying declaration was not credible. When the high court turned down his appeal, he approached the Supreme Court. Upholding the conviction, the Supreme Court held that once the courts were convinced that the dying declaration was trustworthy and voluntary, it could base its conviction on it. Since the lower courts had examined all the evidence in great detail and the doctor had stated that the woman had been in a position to give such declaration, the conviction of the accused was justified.

	Hire order        
	 A show cause notice was issued to the financier of a vehicle for the non-payment of tax. He wrote back saying that he was only the financier and not the owner of the vehicle. When the authorities proceeded to recover the tax from him under the Motor Vehicles Act, he approached the high court. The Madras High Court held that under the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act, if the vehicle had been bought under a hire-purchase scheme, whoever was in its possession as per the hire-purchase agreement was the owner. The court further held that in this case the authorities should have conducted an enquiry to ascertain who was actually in possession of the vehicle.

	Sound proof              
	 An excise inspector was charged with taking bribe under the Prevention of Corruption Act and was convicted by the trial court. Upon appeal, the Andhra Pradesh High Court acquitted him, saying that there wasnt sufficient proof that he had accepted the entire amount of the bribe. When the state appealed to the Supreme Court, the apex court set aside the judgement, saying that even if there was proof of the acceptance of a part of the bribe, the public servant should be held guilty under the act.

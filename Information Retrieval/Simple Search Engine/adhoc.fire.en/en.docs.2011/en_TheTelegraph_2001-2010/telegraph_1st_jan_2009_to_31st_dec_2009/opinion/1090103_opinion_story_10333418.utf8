                                                                                                               Well beyond redemption
										      THIS ABOVE ALL      Khushwant Singh                        New promises				                                       
	My father was a great one for making New Year resolutions. I inherited the habit from him. His resolutions were earthy, usually connected with food and drink that he relished, but did not agree with him. A hardy annual was I will not eat achaar (pickles) any more. He loved achaars of mango and lime. They gave him a bad throat, which gave him a cold. Every winter, he had injections of catarrhal vaccine to get rid of them. His resolutions lasted till the cold was gone, and he was back asking for achaar with every meal. I, too, like achaar with my meals. My preference are shalgam (turnip) and gajjar (carrot). They do not give me a bad throat or cold. I catch colds anyhow, four to five times a year. I dont have anti-cold injections. I fight them with Vitamin C tablets, aspirin, rum, honey and lime juice. No matter what I take, they last a week.        
	My New Year resolutions had higher moral calibre: I will not say nasty things about people I dont like. I will not tell a lie. I will not lose my temper, and so on. They were of shorter duration than my fathers  a little more than a week or so. Before going to bed for the night, I went over what I had said during the day to find out whether I had maligned anyone or told a blatant lie. I found that my friends found me getting more and more boring by the day. How can you be an interesting conversationalist without bitching about people? How can you be a story -teller without adding mirch-masala to your narrative? So, after a fortnight or so I return to lying and malicious innuendos about everyone. My friends find me a good company.        
	Now I am past 94 and well beyond redemption. So I have made a final New Year resolution: Hereafter, I will make no New Year resolutions.                
	For those who seek the path                
	88-year old Acharya Mahaprajna is the tenth head of Terapanthi Jains based in Rajasthan. He was only 10 years old when he decided to become a monk and an itinerant teacher walking barefoot from village to village delivering sermons on different topics. Some of them have been translated from Hindi to English by Sudhamahi Regunathan and published under the title, The Sun Will Rise Again. The translations read very well.        
	To be honest, I rarely read books on spiritual topics. I read this one because it has an introduction by our ex-Rashtrapati, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, whom I respect greatly but dont quite understand. He is an eminent scientist and at the same time deeply religious, respecting religions besides the one he was born into, a man with his legs in two boats and yet managing to keep them on course. Our differences are summed up in one of Acharyas poems:        
	Scientists have brought/ The typhoon of change/ So fast that boats of the old beliefs/ Have lost their moorings/ in the Ocean of the past.// Scientists have brought/ The typhoon of change/ So fast that boats of the new faith/ Are wandering aimlessly in the Ocean of disbelief.        
	I do not know if Acharyaji watches Indian films or the antics of our political leaders but he gets them right:        
	Such a waster/ Todays actor is one/ Who does not know how to laugh/ Or even how to make others laugh. Such a waster/ Todays politician is one/ Who does not know how to wake people up/ Or even how to let them sleep.        
	He round up the confusion in our minds in a few lines:        
	Difficult it is to live in the present/ Desiring summer in winter/ And winter in summer/ The name of desire is tension/ We do not know how to live in the present/ Nor to desire what is/ But want only what is not.                
	Foggy, cold and old        
	In the dead hour of the midnight        
	When the weather is        
	Foggy, cold and old        
	To see anything new, fresh and        
	 bright,        
	The trees are barren        
	With very few dusty and dry leaves,        
	And no flower in sight,        
	Finding nothing new in nature,        
	The crazy people of Western culture,        
	In the total darkness of the season        
	Have no reason        
	To bear        
	To say: Happy New Year

	Unholy intentions                
	A Sikh lad, standing on the roof of his haveli, saw a young girl walking down the street below and shouted: Aaja! Kothey uttay aaja  come, come up to the roof. The girl was enraged. She took off her slippers and shouted back, Laawaan juttee?  shall I take off my slippers for you?        
	You dont have to do that, replied the lad cheekily, This is not a gurdwara.

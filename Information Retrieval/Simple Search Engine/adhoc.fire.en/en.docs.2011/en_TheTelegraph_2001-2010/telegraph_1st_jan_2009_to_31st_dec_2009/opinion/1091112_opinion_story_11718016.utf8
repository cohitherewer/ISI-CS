	Freedom song                  
	Sir  The Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind has taken a rather narrow view of things by declaring that Muslims cannot be asked to sing Vande Mataram as it violates their belief in monotheism (Tone deaf, Nov 5). This is the second time that a fatwa has been issued against the national song. A similar edict was issued by the Darul Uloom of Deoband in 2006. Politicians are known to transform a non-event into a controversy to score political points. Similarly, religious leaders fail to take into account the national interest and spend their time trying to establish the supremacy of their faith vis--vis other religions. In their zeal, they end up interpreting issues wrongly, as is the case here. India is a secular country.           
	Every Indian has the right to practise a religion of his choice and cannot be forced to follow any one faith. Similarly, the national song cannot be forced upon a person or a community. But, at the same time, one should show respect towards the song and stand up when it is being sung or played.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Mahesh Kumar, New Delhi

                
	Sir  The issue of singing, or not singing, Vande Mataram has been turned into a meaningless test of patriotism. Singing Vande Mataram can hardly be considered to be a signifier of ones patriotic credentials. The song only asks Indians to respect their motherland and recognize their duty towards it. It has nothing to do with religion. Vande Mataram is a unifying force. The nation should be more important for its inhabitants than any religion.          
	Yours faithfully,      
P.C. Joseph, Bangalore

                
	Sir  The Jamiat Ulama-i-Hinds resolution against the national song has received unwarranted attention. In this context, I would like to mention a few things. First, Vande Mataram is meant to uphold the glory of India; it is not related to worship or matters of faith. Therefore, it is wrong on the part of Jamiat to argue that the song goes against the Islamic tenet of monotheism. Second, the fatwa issued by the Jamiat will give communal elements an opportunity to indulge in rabble-rousing. Finally, this fatwa is technically incorrect. Religious organizations should carefully assess the consequences of a ban, and the media should remember to cover issues that have wider social implications in a sensitive manner.                    
	Yours faithfully,         Faruque Md. Chowdhury, Burdwan            
	Sir  A hue-and-cry has been raised over the Jamiat Ulama-i-Hinds reiteration that the singing of Vande Mataram is un-Islamic. What was the need for the Muslim clerics of the Jamiat to issue a fatwa against the song and rake up a needless controversy? Why cant the maulvis focus on issues that demand greater attention? The Jamiats resolution will not only alienate Muslims further, but outfits such as the sangh parivar may also exploit the issue to reap political gain.           
	The singing of the national song should be a matter of personal choice. In a country immersed in corruption, can dishonest government officials hope to wash away their sins by singing the national song?          
	Yours faithfully,      
Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad 

      
	Sir  The timing of the Jamiat Ulama-i-Hinds fatwa is intriguing. Thankfully, it had not occurred to the learned clerics to ban Vande Mataram in the years after Independence, thereby enabling their co-religionists to lend their voices to the tuneful rendition of the song at that time.           
	Yours faithfully,

	High price          
	Sir  The staggering amount of money involved in the scam involving the Jharkhand chief minister, Madhu Koda, is a matter of serious concern (Koda quizzed after raid on 60 properties, Nov 1). Such instances of money-laundering end up in huge losses for the exchequer. Koda has been charged with appropriating funds to the tune of a few thousand crores. Similar charges have been levelled against the DMKs A. Raja as well. Such episodes point to a deeper malaise in the political system. This appears all the more shocking at a time when several debt-ridden farmers are reported to have committed suicide. It seems that Indias democracy is meant for privileged individuals who cannot be considered to be role models for the future generations                     
	Yours faithfully,      
H.N. Ramakrishna, Bangalore 

      
	Sir  It appears that Madhu Koda has swindled a huge amount of money. It was the Congress who helped Koda become the chief minister of the mineral-rich but poverty-stricken Jharkhand. Hence, it should be the moral responsibility of the Congress to ensure a speedy trial and harsh punishment for Koda.          
	Yours faithfully,       
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

                
	Sir  It is difficult to understand how an independent member of legislative assembly, a politician without strong backing or experience, went on to become the chief minister of a state. Madhu Kodas misdeeds must have had the tacit support of the political parties, which had come together to keep communal forces at bay. A few thousand crore is the sum a poor state like Jharkhand has had to pay as the price for this. If the allegations against Koda are true, the parties supporting him must also be blamed for bringing shame to the state. But now that Koda has become quite dispensable, his political benefactors are unlikely to stand by him.          
	Yours faithfully,      
D. Agarwal, Orissa 

                
	Parting shot          
	Sir  The Dalai Lamas visit to Arunachal Pradesh should be considered as the monks personal matter (1947 to 2009, claim to Tawang is shed, Nov 10). The Indian prime minister should firmly request China to stop harassing the Dalai Lama for the sake of peace between India and China.          
	Yours faithfully,       
K. Krishnan, Calcutta

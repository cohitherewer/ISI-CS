	It hurts                  
	Sir  One of the appreciable points of the interim railway budget presented by the Union railway minister, Lalu Prasad, was the introduction of more Garib Raths. These trains are meant for the common people and hence, more of these would surely benefit them. But it should be noted that the term garib, when applied to a particular group of people, is liable to give it an inferiority complex that is not desirable in a secular, democratic, and developing country such as ours. Keeping this fact in mind, the Indian Railways had long ago withdrawn third class coaches. But garib rath is even more degrading than the third class. Lalu Prasad could have thought of more appropriate names for his train such as Janata Rath, Sarbajanin Rath, Manokamna Rath and so on. He could have taken a lesson from the book of Mahatma Gandhi who called the lower castes Harijans to prevent them from feeling bad. It should be remembered here that although the fares of the air-conditioned Garib Raths are a little lower than those of air-conditioned first-class coaches in ordinary trains, they still remain beyond the reach of the poor. These trains mainly attract the middle class passengers. The real garibs cannot travel in them. If the middle class is also to be called garib, then 90 per cent of the Indian population has to be regarded as poor. Such a description is surely not very good for the countrys morale.

	Sir  I had purchased tickets on the Magadh Express from the passenger reservation system of Kaliyaganj on January 17, 2009 for March 7. The tickets were booked for a journey from New Delhi to Dalkhola in West Bengal with a break at Patna. We were in the waiting-list till Patna when we booked the tickets. Later, on March 4, we made it to the reservation-against-cancellation list and on the day of the journey, we were allotted numbers 39 to 42 on the RAC. Before the journey, I went to counter 30 of the New Delhi railway station to confirm our status. The person at the counter repeated that that we have been allotted seats 39 to 42 on the RAC and put this in writing on the ticket. This position was valid till 4 pm, when I had called up the reservation counter on my mobile. At 6 pm, when I went to the counter again to enquire our coach number, I found to my surprise and horror that we have been put on the waiting list in positions two, three, four and five. Perplexed, I got hold of the Train Ticket Examiners on the platform and asked them about our seat numbers. One of the TTEs advised me to go to the station manager, who turned me away harshly and asked me to board the train. Finding no solution to the problem, all the members in my group and I spent the night either standing or sitting huddled in the cramped space leading to the bathroom, enduring its stench. I am 63 years old, and suffer from several age-related diseases. Along with me that day were my disabled, almost blind wife, my son, and daughter-in-law with her ailing minor sons. Will the railway ministry compensate for the harassment and humiliation we suffered for no fault of ours? Our plight proves the negligence and impudence of the railway employees, who are paid well and yet would not do their duty.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Although some of the Electric Multiple Unit trains run for more than an hour at a stretch before touching platform, none of them has toilets inside the coaches. This causes immense discomfort to passengers, especially to the old, disabled or diabetic ones. It is not always possible for the latter to use the platform toilets in the course of a journey. All of us who travel by EMU trains will be obliged if the Union railway minister looks into the problem and introduces toilets in these trains.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The recent decision of the Indian Railways to run the New Delhi-Bilaspur Rajdhani Express up to Howrah for the next three months on an experimental basis will be welcomed by all Indians hailing from the east since this will open up a new era of superfast travel in this route, which is also one of the oldest and the most scenic train corridors in the country (Another Rajdhani for Howrah, March 2). The Nagpur-Howrah section of the South Eastern Railway has witnessed many firsts in the annals of the Indian Railways. Some of these, such as the first trial run of a superfast train that culminated in the introduction of the Gitanjali Express, are chronicled in the book, The Story of our Railways, by Jagjit Singh, who was the general manager of the South Eastern Railway and later the chairman of the Railway Board. I am sure that the Delhi-Bilaspur Rajdhani will be immensely popular. The Indian Railways must be thanked for this wise decision. I hope that this train will not be withdrawn after three months.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Different colours          
	Sir  The art of the bohurupis  people who used to don colourful make-up to transform themselves into divine beings and went around collecting money from the awestruck masses  is dying an untimely death in modern times. In the rural belt of West Bengal, watching the bohurupis dressed as mythological figures was a common form of entertainment. It was also a means of survival for the artists. One remembers the character played by Rabi Ghosh in the 1965 classic, Mahapurush, directed by Satyajit Ray. In the film, Ghoshs character would dress up as Hindu gods and goddesses to fool the audience. Of late, the government has banned bohurupis who do not have an identity card from performing. This has pushed the bohurupis, who are already threatened in this age of multiplexes, to the edge of extinction. Our state government, which is known for its patronage of our heritage and culture, should immediately do something to save this indigenous art from disappearing.           
	Yours faithfully,

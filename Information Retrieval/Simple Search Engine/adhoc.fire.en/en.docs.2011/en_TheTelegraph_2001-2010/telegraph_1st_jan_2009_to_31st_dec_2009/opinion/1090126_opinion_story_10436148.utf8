                                                                                                                 CLOSED GAMES                                                    
	Ramalinga Raju carried out the biggest heist in the country; he robbed a limited company, owned by its shareholders, of a sum, which will take a long time to count. His legerdemain involved mis-statement of the companys bank balances. They were certified by PricewaterhouseCoopers as the companys external auditors. They could have done so only under two circumstances: either they were complicit in his crime, or they had neglected to check the balances. Since the first is a crime and the second an error, everyone has assumed that the latter was the case. Still it is a serious error; if all chartered accountants failed to that extent, audit would not be worth the money.        
	There is no law against incompetence. Instead, India has, following the British precedent, delegated the task of disciplining errant auditors to their own cartel, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. The ICAI could have banned PwC from doing further audits until they were cleared. It omitted to do so. Instead, it sent PwC a show-cause notice, and gave them three weeks to reply. It may be argued that no one should be held guilty without a trial. But in this case, the evidence is in the public sphere; and clients surely need protection more than auditors. Then, even before the three-week period was over or a reply was received from PWC, the ICAI approached the government and asked it to ban the practice of local audit firms working in partnership with foreign consultants such as KPMG and Ernst amp; Young. Its sudden eruption was presumably because of the fact that the board appointed by the government to take over Satyam asked KPMG to do a new audit. The difference is that PwC was doing audits in India as a member of the ICAI and KPMG does not. It uses a member of the ICAI to do audits of firms it is looking after. That gives such firms the business of big Indian and foreign firms that use foreign consultants. Just why the secretary of the ICAI should get worked up about some members of the ICAI doing better than others is incomprehensible, unless he comes from a faction that does not get lucrative foreign business. Add to this the fact that the ICAI has taken no action against PwC for having failed to detect the misappropriation in Yes Bank, which failed four years ago. It would seem that the ICAI is run by a set of auditors who are so engrossed in matters of turf that they are incapable of taking action on principle.        
	It would, however, be unfair to the ICAI to take such a view. For the ICAIs main business  and a lucrative one  is to run the examinations for entrance into the cartel of chartered accountants; self-governance comes very low on its priorities. It is so low that it is worth asking whether the ICAI should be entrusted with it all.

	There are very few inventions that in one go transformed the contours of daily life and the world of high scholarship. The World Wide Web, which turned twenty this month, is one such invention. It is difficult to imagine that before 1989, people across the world lived uncomplainingly, without access to the web and the wealth of information that it provides. It all started with an idea that Tim Berners-Lee, then a scientist at CERN had. In a paper entitled Information Management: A Proposal, he argued for a creating a framework to organize and share electronic documents through the internet. The original proposal aimed to bring together academic institutions whose members could then exchange data, thoughts and findings. But like all truly brilliant ideas, the proposal broke the limits of such confines. Today, anyone who has access to a computer and to the internet, anywhere in the world, can actually access almost any information he wants without moving out of his home or the neighbourhood internet caf.        
	Most of the world has become so familiar and used to the World Wide Web that people have begun to take it for granted. Its impact can only be gauged by travelling back in time to a period when it did not exist. It was necessary then to look up a printed dictionary to find the meaning of a word or to trudge to the library to read a book or to check a reference. This is no longer necessary. There is always the easy option of clicking a mouse to open a relevant site which has the prefix, www, and finding the needed information. This has made life easier and also saved enormous amounts of time. What is equally important is that it has introduced an element of democracy and transparency into the management of information and knowledge. It is no longer necessary to be a specialist in a field to access information. The only expertise required is elementary computer skills and the ability to move fingers over a keyboard. The World Wide Web has opened up an embarrassment of riches.        
	What is significant is that the original invention of Mr Berners-Lee still retains its promise. Its full potential is by no means exhausted. One reason for this is the rapid transformation in the field of communication. A computer is no longer an essential requirement to access the web. People are doing it increasingly through their mobile phones, which means that they are using the web while on the move. This has profound implications for the developing world where most people are far likely to first own a mobile phone before they actually own a computer, desktop or laptop. In fact, Mr Berners-Lee is of the opinion that mobile phones are the key to the webs future. The belief that knowledge has no boundaries had acquired a different dimension, thanks to the World Wide Web.

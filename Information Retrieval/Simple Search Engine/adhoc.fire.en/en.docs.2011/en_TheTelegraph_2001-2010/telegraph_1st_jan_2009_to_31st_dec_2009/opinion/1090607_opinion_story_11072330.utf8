The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | humpty dumpty wins
                                                                                                                 HUMPTY DUMPTY WINS                                                          
	Words brook no bans. They pour into languages in an irresistible stream  from other languages, distant coinages, names and technical phrases, from abbreviations, mad moments and meaninglessnesses. The most widely used English word in the world, for example, is ok, and even that is scripted in more than one way. Yet that is no bar to expression. As Humpty Dumpty said scornfully to a bewildered Alice, when he used a word, it meant just what he chose it to mean, neither more nor less. Such masterful creativity is particularly on display as English, spoken by 1.53 billion people as the primary, auxiliary or business language, crosses its one millionth-word mark. Famous for its ability to gobble up other peoples words, the language is being added to at the rate of 14.7 words a day. Two sources are proving to be especially fertile: Chinglish  based on Mandarins absorption and transformation of English, and Hinglish, the casual, colourful, expedient mingling of Hindi with English. It is a relationship of mutual hospitality. Even when China tried to clean up its Chinglish before the Beijing Olympics in 2008, learned committees had to pass 171 neologisms which refused to be cowed. Among them was a new ideogram for brokeback to indicate gay, from the banned film, Brokeback Mountain. Bans just do not work with words.        
	So, in the other direction, among the words listed to carry English over its millionth-word mark is Jai Ho from Hindi, with others such as noob, a disparaging term for a neophyte in a game, and zombie banks that would be dead without government intervention. There is Chinglish too  chengguan: urban management officers.         
	The Global Language Monitor uses many techniques to determine which words should become part of English by tracing width and frequency of use. In 2008, for example, one of the top words it had found was the mint-fresh Obamamania. The GLM tries to keep tabs on a dizzying, inscrutable, intoxicating process by which sounds, resonances and universes of meaning tumble over one another in a seething frenzy of change and rediscovery, as elusive, cunning and inexplicable as life.         
	And as unsettling. Through a mysterious Humpty Dumpty-like choice, Jai Ho, emerging from the success of the film, Slumdog Millionaire, and A.R. Rahmans song, has been taken to mean It is accomplished. A call for victory or a victorious greeting in Hindi has suddenly been hurled into a new universe of meaning. As the ideogram for brokeback has in Mandarin, through a cross-fertilization both beautiful and unfortunate. Perhaps a later social-sexual movement will question the political correctness of the Mandarin brokebacks implications. Jai hoing that, to use a neologism, may not be easy.

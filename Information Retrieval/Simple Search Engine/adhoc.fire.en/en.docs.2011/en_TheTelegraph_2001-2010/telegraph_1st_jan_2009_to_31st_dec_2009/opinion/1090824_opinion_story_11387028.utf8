	Watch out                  
	Sir  Ashok Mitra rightly says that there is no other option for the middle classes of India and its neighbouring states than to be mute spectators to American imperialism, of which the subcontinent has long been a victim (Genteel debates, Aug 14). In the guise of preaching democracy, the imperialist superpower is shrewdly igniting hostilities within the subcontinent. Till the 1990s, the United States of America conspired against the erstwhile Union of Soviet Socialist Republic to curb its might. It acted likewise with some oil-producing countries of the Middle East, and thus created its problem child, Osama bin Laden. After the attack on the World Trade Center, the US was trying hard to fight Islamic terrorism. But even as it went off to Afganistan to drive away the Taliban, the US ignored the rising clout of the Taliban in Pakistan.           
	In recent times, the US has been firming up its diplomatic relations with India primarily to keep a vigil on China, a rising industrial giant, and also to sell US technology to India. By fighting among themselves, the south Asian countries play into the hands of the imperialists, whose purpose is to sell their weapons in this region and make money, rather than to help establish peace in the region.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Ashok Mitra has, as usual, lambasted the US to establish his beliefs. His contention that Indians who earn about 150 billion dollars through software exports and remittances have created an affluent class, who also happen to be the backbone of support for the ruling politicians, is strange. Money by itself cannot garner support. Had money been so powerful, the Swatantra Party, an association of the wealthiest people, would not have withered away. The writers most amusing observation is that the USs overarching aspiration is to establish a global hegemony; therefore wars have to be launched. In fact, it is the Marxists who gave the clarion call  workers of the world unite  to rule the world.           
	The US has not been the only aggressor in history. One would like to know why Russia invaded Chechnya, and China India, and why the African countries are fighting aganist one another when the US is nowhere involved in these wars.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Fools paradise          
	Sir  K.P. Nayar deserves credit for clearly showing up the Indian governments craven attitude towards the US, and our leaders acceptance of unequal treatment in every interaction with that country (Icon at the gates, Aug 19). The governments ingratiating act of inviting the US under-secretary of state for political affairs, William Burns, to an undeserved meeting with Manmohan Singh, has only compromised the dignity of the office of the prime minister.          
	If our elite leaders believe that appeasing America can help develop India then they are living in a fools paradise. The Lefts position that Indias sovereignty is being compromised by pandering to the US seems to be justified. The media, by blowing up the issue of Shah Rukh Khans detention for questioning at an American airport, have deflected attention from the greater insult to Indias pride and honour by its own guardians.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Tapas Biswas, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  K.P. Nayar has deftly traced the case of India s excessive reverence for the US, and also its obsession with celebrities. The hue and cry over Shah Rukh Khans questioning by officials of the Newark airport was quite unnecessary. With the American ambassador saying that Shah Rukh Khan is always welcome there, the matter should have been closed. But the media, by harping on the issue, have stoked controversy.           
	The aviation ministers statement that he would take up the issue with the US government was ridiculous. Would he be as pro-active in explaining the exemption of certain politicians and their relatives from frisking? In a democracy, politicians and common people should enjoy equal rights and respect. A nation that discriminates among its citizens should not raise an alarm if the same happens elsewhere. Our celebrities, too, should come to terms with the limits of their popularity.           
	A nation that continually worries about US reactions to its policy-decisions should stop hoping for grand treatment from the US. Some people have suggested that the US is getting paranoid over the 9/11 attacks. But the US has saved itself from terrorist attacks for almost a decade, while in India, one terror attack follows another. It is time India imbibed the virtues of a strong defence and work culture from the US rather than just following its fashion trends.           
	Yours faithfully,

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | What Needs To Be Taught
                                                                                                                 WHAT NEEDS TO BE TAUGHT                                  BONA FIDE - Malvika Singh                              
	Thankfully, today is the last day of the current session of Parliament, one that was fraught with misconduct and saw the wastage of precious time. We shall now have a reprieve from the endless and futile walkouts and inappropriate behaviour that have become endemic to the political space. The right to education bill has been passed. But complications are bound to arise out of the 25 per cent reservation for admissions with a tiny donation from the government that will neither cover the fee nor the other costs. Middleclass families, which put all their resources together by cutting down on their expenses, will have to bear the burden of a huge hike in fees to accommodate and subsidize the additional 25 per cent. The consequences of this move will soon hit the ceiling, and there is bound to be a case filed against this provision.        
	Why not have more Kendriya Vidyalayas with quality teachers and a sound syllabus to compete with private schools? Why does the government always sponge off private initiatives instead of challenging them with a better, efficient product, particularly in health and education? It is time attitudes began to change, and it is for the leaders in power to ensure that. Instead of walkouts, members of parliament should debate issues such as this one threadbare and reach a positive conclusion. But to do this, the elected representatives need to engage in some serious homework to determine the future of education in this country.        
	The school syllabus needs to be looked at with great care. To superimpose, mindlessly, a model that is alien to the cultural realities of India will continue to aid and abet inferior learning. The excitement of accessing knowledge is critically important in the years of schooling. It opens the mind to the vast landscape of knowledge and helps youngsters to decide on a future course of specialization. Therefore, the favoured syllabus should consider subjects that are familiar and intrinsic to Indias historical and cultural ethos. Only then will we spawn innovative ideas and alternatives for the future.                 
	Make it real        
	We must empower the young by reinforcing what is part of their special identity, and add to it the energy of a changing, shrinking world. That is the challenge. To include 25 per cent additional young, unadulterated minds into a moribund system will add to the general decline that has suffocated and overwhelmed us.        
	More often than not, young people studying in private schools are uneasy in their own environment when compared to those who are less privileged as the latter are more rooted in their skin. As such, when young people enter the English-speaking systems, they become socially insecure and feel that they have to clone their peers. This creates a great divide, which is bound to degrade the future of this great civilization. Conversely, those who have been educated in a Westernized, English-speaking cocoon feel alienated from the larger, real ethos and are insecure about that reality.        
	The Indian subcontinent will always have such, and many other similar, differences, layers and levels. We must celebrate the plurality and salute the diverse identities. That is the challenge for those who are drafting Indias learning and education policy. It has to be finely calibrated and carefully nuanced to retain all the strengths of this civilization and ensure their growth.         
	To replace one Westernized, alien syllabus with another can only make matters worse. This will confuse young, agile and aspiring minds. It seems absurd to ape and clone cultures that are not nearly as profound as ours in an effort to standardize and sterilize a vibrant, intellectually energetic, human resource  the multifaceted, diverse population of India.

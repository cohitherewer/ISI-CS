                                                                                                               MIND THE GAP                                                              
	Last week, when the Rajya Sabha applied its mind to the so-called right to education bill, 2008, only 54 members out of about 250 members were present. What is, however, more worrying is the ease with which the human resource development minister, Kapil Sibal, managed to convince the members to pass the bill that enigmatically denies the right to education. Several members expressed concern about the exclusion of more than 17 crore children below six years of age from the fundamental right existing in the Constitution for balanced nutrition, health and pre-primary education. Sibal offered the facile argument that the bill is under Article 21A, introduced in Part III through the 86th Constitutional Amendment (2002), limiting the governments obligation to 6-14 age group. This overlooks the fact that Article 21A is itself a much criticized dilution of the original Article 45, which included children below six years of age. This position, confirmed in Supreme Courts Unnikrishnan judgment (1993), still prevails since Article 21A had not been yet notified and will also continue to be valid even after the notification.         
	The issue of the lack of a definition of neighbourhood in the bill was also raised. The truth is that the bill has misrepresented the universal notion of neighbourhood school, advanced by the Kothari Commission and practised in several capitalist economies like the United States of America, Canada, France, Germany and Japan. Here, each school is assigned a pre-determined neighbourhood and all the children residing in the neighbourhood are required to study in the neighbourhood school without any discrimination whatsoever. However, the bills neighbourhood is not of the school but of the child. In the prevailing multi-layered and discriminatory school system that would be legitimized by the bill, this will mean that the poor children will be directed to attend sub-standard schools while those of the middle class or the elite will have access to Central schools or private schools. Sibal camouflaged this fact by stating that the state governments will frame rules in this regard. How would the state governments bring in the notion of a neighbourhood school that does not exist in the bill itself? Sibal also announced that a group is on the job preparing up the estimates... Once the Bill is enacted, we will make a demand for additional resources. Are we talking about a legislation to provide a Constitutional guarantee for finances or just continuing with governments oral assurances? The truth is that a financial estimate of Rs 2.28 lakh crore as an additionality over the next seven years was sent by the ministry to the cabinet secretariat in February 2008 after due approval of the Planning Commission. Why has then the bills financial memorandum chosen to state that it is not possible to quantify the financial requirement on this account at this stage?        
	Will the bills schedule of norms and standards improve the status of the government schools? Recent data reveal otherwise. In view of their enrolment status, almost two-thirds of the existing government primary schools will continue as sub-standard schools (2-room and 2-teacher, 3-room and 3-teacher). One of these classrooms is bound to be turned into a store-room for mid-day meals since a separate provision is made only for the kitchen. The bill also says that the government-school teachers could be deployed for census, elections and disaster relief duties. When this happens, the malaise of a teacher teaching more than one class in one classroom will ensure deterioration of the quality of teaching. Under the pretence of not deploying the teacher for any non-educational purposes, the bill has cleverly left adequate scope for deploying him for non-teaching tasks such as surveying children and arranging for their inoculation. Who will teach when even one out of these teachers falls sick? The bill prefers not to know. Would the governance of these schools improve? Not for 75 per cent of the primary schools, which will not be provided a separate head master if one adheres to the schedule. In the case of upper primary schools, the bill provides for a pupil-teacher ratio of 1:35. However, most of these schools already have a better pupil-teacher ratio than this. The bill will thus fail to break the barrier of sub-standard and truant teaching, and only legitimize the present reality. This is why the Article 21A states that free and compulsory education will be provided in such manner as the State may, by law, determine.        
	Clearly, the bill will empower the government to abdicate its Constitutional obligation to provide mass education of equitable quality, to demolish the vast government-school system except the elite schools like the Kendriya or Navodaya Vidyalayas, and to expedite the pace of commercialization through public-private partnership. The people will have no choice but to continue their struggle to replace this farcical bill with a new one outlining the framework of a public-funded common school system based on neighbourhood schools from the pre-primary stage to Class XII. Hopefully, the government would respect the democratic nature of the Lok Sabha and hold public hearings.       ANIL SADGOPAL

	It is easy to be charmed by the doll-like creatures that Nisreen Moochhala models out of clay and puts inside little boxes with painted backdrops, resembling tiny props in a puppet theatre. As if on cue, Moochhala calls her latest work, Small Things (Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre, January 12-22). But the cuteness is entirely deceptive, and it would be unfair to the calibre of this artist to infantilize her efforts, as the catalogue essay does with a disarming sweetness. Once upon a time... the essay begins, as if it is an introduction to the works of a toy-maker rather than those of a serious artist, and goes on to spin out a fairy tale  there was a little girl who didnt know what loneliness was....        
	These opening words are in acknowledgement of the gregarious years that Moochhala spent in the bustling town of Surat, growing up in a joint family full of elders to look after her. However, living under the perennially watchful eye of ones family is not necessarily a pristine idyll. Such a benevolent vigilance also impels the body to seek out a corner of its own, where its desires and despair can be experienced in all their fullness. There is always a tussle between the private and the public, solitude and conviviality, leading to a perception of space at once tense and fragile: what appears, at one moment, to be ones own room may turn, in the next, into a community dining hall.         
	This duality is captured in Dinner Time and Pearl Necklace, two works in two boxes, identical in shape and size. In the former, a makeshift kitchen turns into a dining room for a family, while in the latter, a woman tries out a necklace in front of a mirror, with a few others, presumably family members, going about their lives inside tiny slots made of wooden partitions. These two vignettes could well be mirror images: the same space looking different at different times of the day. Moochhala visited her maids and, in her own words, saw how they lived in cramped, boxlike homes. In a small place... there is the kitchen, the place to wash, to sleep. Newly weds make a high platform, one couple sleeps on top, another beneath. Her work bristles with this press of humanity, a quiet everyday drama surrounded by peeling walls and fading colours. People stare out of windows at acrobats (picture) or at a wedding party. Beggars loiter aimlessly, while idlers sit daydreaming: some of them are abstracted from what is around them, their stories articulated with an unspoken vividness. Moochhalas intimately realized visions hark back to Bhupen Khakhar and Sudhir Patwardhan, but remain inimitably her own.

	There is something audacious about the proposal that the Supreme Court should take over the task of making laws. The arguments being put forward by those who are in favour of giving to the apex court the power to enact laws believe that there are too many gaps in the existing legal structure, and through these gaps escape many offences and social evils that are not adequately covered by the existing laws. The legislatures are too slow to make laws and often those who are supposed to make the laws are guilty of taking advantage of the loopholes that exist in the laws. The proponents of this radical move are therefore arguing that the judiciary should become more active, and step in to act as a surrogate for the failures and the lapses of the legislature. They strengthen their argument by pointing out that, in some cases, the Supreme Court has already taken over the role of lawmaker by issuing directives. Fortunately, there are voices of caution and conservatism even within the judiciary.        
	The position that the judiciary should not involve itself in the process of making laws is derived from the doctrine of separation of powers that is integral to the Constitution and is a concept that is fundamental to the idea of a popular democracy. The executive, the legislature and the judiciary have their respective fields of activity that are well delineated. Since, in a democracy, the people form the basis of all power, their representatives are given the responsibility of enacting the laws that will govern the lives of the people. Thus law-making becomes the primary duty and responsibility of the legislature and its members who are all elected by the people. The executive implements these laws and the judiciary ensures that those who violate those laws are duly punished within the framework of the existing laws. There are bound to be deviations from this ideal state of affairs. But those aberrations  even when there are too many, as in India  cannot form the basis of tampering with the doctrine of separation of powers.        
	In India, there is always a propensity to confuse levels of discussion. The failure of the legislatures to perform their duties adequately and responsibly cannot be compensated by over-empowering the judiciary. The legislatures failure is located at the level of operations. This cannot be remedied by eroding the principle of the separation of powers. The problem that lies with the legislatures should be addressed at that level, and steps should be taken to ensure that they function properly and pass the laws that are necessary for the smooth and effective administration of the republic. The judiciary should be left unencumbered so that it can perform its essential duty of judging and punishing those that violate the law of the land. Indian democracy, with all its faults, functions on the basis of the separation of powers among the three organs of the State. This functioning can be improved not by blurring the lines of separation but by ensuring that all three function effectively within their domains.

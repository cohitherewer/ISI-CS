	Stalin rsquo;s nemesis: The exile and murder of leon trotsky
  By Bertrand M. Patenaude, 
  Faber, Rs 799  
	This book could easily have been called Trotskys Nemesis. Leon Trotsky, who was murdered in Mexico by an agent of Josef Stalin in 1940, was with V.I. Lenin the maker of the Russian Revolution. What destroyed Trotsky far away from his homeland was an instrument that he had helped to create.  
	After Lenins death in early 1924, Stalin and Trotsky became implacable enemies. The latter lost the succession battle and emerged as the foremost critic and opponent of Stalin and Stalinism. Stalin had Trotsky expelled first from the top echelons of the Bolshevik Party, then from the party itself; finally, he had him expelled from Soviet Russia. Trotsky, as the prophet outcast (as his outstanding biographer, Isaac Deutscher, described him during the last phase of his life), moved from Turkey to France, to Norway and finally to Mexico where Stalin had him killed. The plot to get rid of Trotsky will stand in history as one of the most elaborately planned affairs even in the bloody annals of Stalins tyranny.        
	Trotsky in exile was among the first to write about Stalins tyranny, but what was ironic was that he never renounced his faith in the Soviet Union as the harbinger of the future. He could not recognize that the violence that manifested itself under Stalin, killing and imprisoning millions of men and women, was rooted in the very system that he and Lenin had built. Trotsky and Lenin in power had been as ruthless in the elimination of enemies as Stalin had been in removing those who opposed him. The Russian Revolution was born in violence, in a putsch that Trotsky had engineered. Violence stalked Trotsky across continents till it overwhelmed the man. This was Trotskys nemesis.        
	In October 1926, during a stormy Politburo meeting, Trotsky described Stalin as the gravedigger of the revolution. This led to Trotskys expulsion from the Politburo. What Bertrand Patenaude reveals is that immediately after Trotskys outburst, sitting in Trotskys flat, Yuri Pyatakov said, Stalin will never forgive him unto the third and fourth generation. This is exactly what Stalin proceeded to do, secretly plotting against the man he saw as his principal adversary. A megalomaniacs paranoia convinced Stalin that as long as Trotsky was alive he was not secure in power. His success was predicated upon Trotskys elimination.        
	The general contours of Trotskys final exile in Moscow were well known from the last book of Deutschers three-volume biography. This book adds details from sources that Deutscher could not have consulted. The pain, the tension and the impending death become real through this narrative.        
	What is absolutely new here  and this is from archives that opened after the collapse of the Soviet Union  is the planning of Trotskys assassination. In March 1939, Pavel Sudoplatov, head of the administration of special tasks reporting to Lavrenti Beria, the NKVD chief, was assigned the job of planning Trotskys murder. By July 1939, the plan was in place, and was codenamed Operation Utka. Stalin authorized the operation aimed at the liquidation of his rival. What followed was a process of recruitment, cover and the penetration of Trotskys household in Mexico.        
	The research of this book is solid, but this does not burden the writers unravelling of a chronicle of a death foretold.

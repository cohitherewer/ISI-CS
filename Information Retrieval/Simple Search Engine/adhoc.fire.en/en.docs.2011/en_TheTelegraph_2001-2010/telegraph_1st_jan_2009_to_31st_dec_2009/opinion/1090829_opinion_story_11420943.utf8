The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | improved peril
                                                                                                                 IMPROVED PERIL                                                          
	Why do most attempts at raising the quality of life in Calcutta end up raising little other than stress and danger levels for its ordinary citizens? The new flyovers could be taken as the first signs of a phase of improvements in the city. Yet, after the disruptions caused by the slow and cumbersome process of their construction, Calcuttans did not take long to realize that these flyovers not only spoilt the few eye-catching streets and facades that were left, but they also made scarcely any difference to the state of the traffic. With little foresight and planning behind them, and with the civic authorities quite ignorant about complex traffic management, the congestion only got worse. For the flyovers to work, it is not enough to just build them without thinking about every other related factor, from ways of keeping the vehicle count in check to the maintenance of these newly built structures.         
	It is the same story with taking old, polluting vehicles off the streets. After years of criminal delay, when some vehicles did go off the streets, what followed was chaos and acute inconvenience for the commuters. Once again, there was no planning on how to create alternative transport systems, build more LPG outlets or quickly process bank loans for those who wanted to replace their old vehicles with new ones. There was only the endless, callous killing of time. The time gained was used to do nothing but ignore the courts, harass citizens and seriously damage their health, and keep alive a debased populism over which rival political parties found themselves in perfect agreement. Of course, a great deal of money and power were at stake here, as with the building of the flyovers.        
	The same pattern is being repeated now with the extension of the Metro Railway. Even if half the time and energy spent in thinking up absurd names for the new stations had gone into working out a strategy for coping with the increased number of passengers, then travelling on the Metro would not have become the dangerous nightmare it has turned into over the last few days. The expansion demanded parallel action regarding frequency of trains, more ticket counters, more people to man them, a fresh look at safety and security, and teaching new commuters how to conduct themselves without putting themselves and others at risk. Just noting how frequently the escalators have to be taken apart in order to keep them working should make regular commuters worried about the standards of safety in the stations. And if the escalators are in such a state, what about the rest of the stuff? Trains with handrails, panels and doors coming apart, exposed electrical wiring next to leaking water-pipes in the stations  all look fairly dodgy and grim, even if one decides to overlook the question of aesthetics.        
	When lopped limbs and damaged lungs are part of the normal course of things, it is ridiculous to complain about overcrowding or ugliness. To be able to get to work or return home in one piece is all one can hope for.

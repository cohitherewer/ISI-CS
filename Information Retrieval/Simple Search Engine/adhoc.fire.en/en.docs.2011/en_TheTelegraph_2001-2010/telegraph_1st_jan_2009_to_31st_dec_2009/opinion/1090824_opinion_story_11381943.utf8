                                                                                                                 LEARNING CURVE                                  FIFTH COLUMN - GWYNNE DYER                              
	Its still a nest of terrorists around here, but nobody worries about it much. These days, when you hear a helicopter at night, its only the medevac chopper bringing some urgent case down to the main hospital at Bayonne on the coast. In the bad old days, the helicopter you heard would have been using infrared detectors to spot Basque terrorists heading across the mountains at night into Spain. This south-western corner of France is just as Basque as the much larger Basque-speaking provinces of Spain, but Euskadi ta Askatasuna (Basque Land and Liberty) always used France as a safe rear area and did its actual killing across the frontier.        
	The terrorists are still around, and they enjoy a certain amount of local support. On August 15 was the summer festival in the local town, Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port, and everybody for miles around was drinking and dancing in the square below the citadel, waiting for it to get dark enough for the fireworks to begin. Suddenly banners were unfurled on the city walls: Kidnapped? Tortured? Murdered? Where is Jon? So you ask, and it turns out that everybody knows who Jon is. Hes a local man, universally believed to be an ETA member, who got on a train to Toulouse, but never arrived. Everybody also believes that he was carrying a large sum of money for the ETA that leads nasty cynics like myself to contemplate several other possible reasons for his disappearance, though local opinion is convinced that it was the State that got him.        
	Yet local opinion is not really very upset about it. Most people dont care much if the French police seized or killed Jon, or if somebody else robbed and killed him, or even if he just decided to disappear and live on the proceeds. Its all part of the game that some play on the fringes of society; theyre welcome to play it as long as they dont frighten the horses.        
	Across the border in Spain, where the killing happens, people take the ETA more seriously, and there is less sympathy for the killers among Spanish Basques. Yet there is also irreducible support for the extreme nationalist option. Spain does not let political parties that openly support terror run in national elections. But when a radical Basque party was allowed to run in the June elections for the European parliament, it got 140,000 votes.                
	Delayed lesson        
	Thats only five per cent of the population in those provinces. The terrorist struggle for Basque independence has so few supporters because the Basque provinces of Spain already have almost complete control over their own affairs. But that tiny minority of hardliners is enough to sustain the armed struggle forever.        
	The French police now cooperate closely with their Spanish counterpart to catch the ETA militants who shelter in the French Basque provinces. Even when they didnt, nobody in Spain suggested invading France to stamp out the terror sanctuaries. That would be grotesquely disproportionate.        
	The ETA story teaches us three things. First, you dont need a terror base; an isolated farmhouse or an anonymous city apartment will do. Second, you should treat terrorism like any other crime: use the police to track the perpetrators down, and dont inflate the whole problem by getting the army involved. Third, you must not expect a decisive victory. When we talk about a war on crime, we do not expect all the criminals to come out one day with their hands up, after which there will be no more crime. Success is defined in terms of keeping the crime rate down. Success in anti-terrorist operations has to be seen in similar terms.        
	Eight years of the war on terror have created a huge military, corporate and bureaucratic lobby in the United States of America whose livelihood depends on a highly militarized approach to terrorism; so it will be a long time before a saner strategy prevails in Washington. But people generally do the right thing in the end  after they have exhausted all the alternatives.

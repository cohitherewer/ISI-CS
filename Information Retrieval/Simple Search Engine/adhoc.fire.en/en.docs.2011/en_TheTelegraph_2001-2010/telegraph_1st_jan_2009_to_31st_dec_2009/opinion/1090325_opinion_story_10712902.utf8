                                                                                                                 LEFT WITH VERY LITTLE                                  Sumanta Sen                              
	The Congress could not have had a bigger jolt than what it suffered in Bihar even before the votes have been cast. While the impression was gaining ground that as the leader of the United Progressive Alliance, the Congress was trying to bring Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan together, the two joined hands to work out an electoral adjustment that left only three seats for the leader. Their assessment of where the Congress stood in the states political map could not have been more eloquent. After all, the Congress has less than ten seats in the assembly.        
	The Congress is fretting and fuming and threatening to spoil the Yadav-Paswan alliance. But can it disregard the reality? The Congress in Bihar, as also in Uttar Pradesh to a large extent, has long been irrelevant among all sections of the electorate. Its ambivalence on the Mandal issue angered both the forward and backward castes, and the situation remains that way. The Muslims moved away from the Congress in the wake of the Bhagalpur riots in the 1980s, and matters did not improve for the party when the Babri Masjid was demolished with the then prime minister, P.V. Narasimha Rao, seen as doing nothing in the lead-up to the demolition. That was once again a case of ambivalence: the Congress was seen as running with the Muslim hare and hunting with the Hindu fundamentalist hound. Every time a crisis developed, the Congress was perceived as a party not knowing which way to turn. Now it has in effect been reduced to a signboard party, a fact rubbed in by Lalu Prasad and Paswan.        
	Perhaps the two would have been a little more generous had they not been faced with a formidable opponent in the shape of the present chief minister. Nitish Kumars performance in the last four years has been impressive, and that has helped him expand his base in the state. Lalu Prasad and Paswan have realized that they have a fight for survival on their hands, and that they cannot extend the courtesy of giving more seats to the Congress, which is an insignificant force in Bihar. They also know that the joint front of the three communist parties may not win more than a couple of seats, but can make things difficult in many a constituency.                
	Wrong move        
	In a way, the Congress must blame itself for the present situation. After leading a coalition for five years, the party suddenly decided that the elections will not be contested in the name of the UPA but constituents will fight it on their own, working out adjustments wherever possible. The Congress thought this would enable it to seek newer pastures, but the ploy has boomeranged. Freed from the responsibility of an alliance, the constituents naturally felt that there was no question of accommodating the leader where it was weak. Hence the tough stand of Lalu Prasad in Bihar, Sharad Pawar in Maharashtra and Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh.         
	Here is how things stand. The third front has called for a non-Congress, non-BJP formation, and Lalu Prasad, Paswan and Pawar may well respond positively. The Congress leaders know this and the more they ridicule the third alternative, the more they seem to be whistling in the dark.        
	Elsewhere in the country, as in West Bengal, the Congress has had no problem picking up the crumbs thrown at it by the bigger partner. But when it comes to Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, the party cannot reconcile itself to the fact that there has been a sea change in the political situation since 1977. In Bihar, it kept on insisting that it was the charisma of its leader that saw the UPA win so many seats in 2004, ignoring the combined effort of Lalu Prasad and Paswan. Now the Congress should wake up to the reality of its allies leaving the party only 9 of the 120 seats. And they certainly had the objective conditions in mind.

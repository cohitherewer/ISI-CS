                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Checks and balances                  
	Sir  The impressive performance by the Congress and its allies in Maharashtra, Haryana and Arunachal Pradesh in the recently concluded assembly elections reflects the peoples confidence in the policies and programmes undertaken by the Congress-led state governments (2.5 out of 3, Congresss real victory lies in BJPs defeat, Oct 23).          
	At the same time, the emerging importance of the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena cannot be underestimated. It is hoped that its leader, Raj Thackeray, will behave as a responsible politician in times to come. Taking into account the rise of the MNS, the Congress cannot afford to be complacent. It can continue to enjoy the peoples mandate only by implementing programmes centred on the welfare of the common man.          
	Yours faithfully,       
R. Sekar, Visakhapatnam

                
	Sir  The Congress has done well in the elections to the three state assemblies. These elections have once again underlined the fact that the Congress is the only party with a truly national presence. Its victory in Maharashtra is remarkable, since it has come to power in the state for a third consecutive term. While it is true that it benefited from the split in the Opposition votes, there can be no doubt that it was the only party that could capture the peoples imagination. This is reflected in the fact that it got a high vote-share even in those areas that had been hit by farmer suicides.          
	The Bharatiya Janata Party, on the other hand, appears to be a party in decline. It has failed to put its house in order after the debacle in the Lok Sabha polls earlier this year. The alliance with the Shiv Sena has cost the party dearly, since the latter no longer has the same hold over the peoples pulse. Moreover, Raj Thackeray ate into the BJP-Sena combines votes and severely dented its prospects. If the BJP cannot set itself right now, its future will be bleak.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Ambar Mallick, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The way the BJP has been declining, and so becoming irrelevant to the countrys politics, is a matter of concern. The victories of the United Progressive Alliance in the assembly elections is due more to the failure of the BJP than to its own performance.          
	In any democratic system, the Opposition is as important as the ruling party, which must be kept in check. The BJP has not been able to hold on to the goodwill that was generated by Atal Bihari Vajpayee when he was at the helm. Poor performance as a responsible Opposition, lack of clarity on key issues, infighting, as well as the expulsion of top leaders have badly affected its image. The present leadership is weak and unimaginative. The BJP should give the reins of the party to leaders from the new generation. It should also bring back its expelled leaders,who may be the ones best suited to resurrect the party.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Raghubir Singh, Pune

                
	Unsolved issues          
	Sir  The audacious Maoist attack on West Midnapores Sankrail police station, in which two officers were killed and the officer in charge, Atindranath Dutta, was kidnapped, has shaken the states security system completely (At Maoist mercy, Oct 21). Sending a combined force to destroy the Maoists will not solve the problem. The cause behind the problem is too deep-rooted. When a man is deprived of the three basic needs of food, clothing and shelter, his anger and frustration can force him to challenge the social system.          
	The Indian government has failed to check the widening economic gap between the rich and the poor which has been growing steadily since Independence. As time goes by, the situation becomes worse. There has not been any serious attempt to economically uplift remote and poor villages. There are many villagers who cannot get a meal everyday. The Maoists will continue to make their presence felt as long as these problems remain unsolved.          
	Yours faithfully,         Anindya Bhattacharya, Calcutta     
	Sir  The killing of the two police officers at Sankrail deserves utter condemnation. It amply proves that the Maoists will not desist from taking the harshest measures to combat the governments policies. Their demand for the release of the tribal women who were held on suspicion of having Maoist links should not have been complied with. Such abject surrender is only likely to increase the Maoists atrocities.          
	The incident at Sankrail should come as an eye-opener. The chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, has to tackle the problem through discussions with the Centre. Indifference on the part of the government will only pave the way for the rebels success. The leader of the Opposition, too, has to come forward and play a constructive role in curbing this menace, forgetting factional bickerings for the time being.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Indranil Sanyal, Calcutta

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | not enough
                                                                                                                 NOT ENOUGH                                                    
	Nestling in a new bill waiting to become law could be fresh hope for the pursuit of excellence in India. The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (reservation in posts and services) bill, 2008, has been passed in the Rajya Sabha and is waiting for the Lok Sabhas approval. On the face of it, this bill looks like one that would provide the legal foundations for reservationism in the Indian civil services. But closer, and cannier, inspection reveals that it might provide a way out of reservations for 47 academic institutions. This select body of the exempted will be made up of institutions of national importance like the Indian institutes of technology and of management, some universities (Delhi and Visva-Bharati, among others), premier medical institutes and iconic ones like the Victoria or the Indian War memorials, the National Library and the Indian Museum. Most importantly, this is good news for quality higher education in India  or at least, potentially so. It is a pity that the beginnings of change in the Centres attitude to reservation seem to be coming so late, after a great deal of divisive, disruptive and opportunistic politics has deeply damaged the ethos of higher education in the country. This kind of damage control could easily begin to look like too little too late.        
	According to a logic that has been founded on nothing but the primacy of merit, The Telegraph has consistently argued against reservations, particularly in institutions of higher education. It is the same logic that has repeatedly prompted the IITs and IIMs to resist the Centres attempts at compelling them to introduce and implement faculty quotas. Any major appointments made on criteria other than those of quality are likely to radically compromise the standards of excellence, which premier institutions ought to embody. So, instead of just 47 select institutions, the most logical thing to hope for is that all such institutions should do away with reservations and consider nothing but merit. The wording of the bill also exposes the Indian States strange doublespeak on reservation  promoting it, yet relegating the reserved to only the lowest grades of appointment, and seeing it as inimical to the idea of national importance. Given the contradictory and fraught nature of such thinking and politics, institutions of excellence deserve to be completely liberated from the shackles of reservation.

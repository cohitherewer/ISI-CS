The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A Message from the people 
                                                                                                                 A MESSAGE FROM THE PEOPLE                                   Neha Sahay                              
	Should public opinion sway judges? The verdict in the case that has rocked China  that of a 21-year-old hotel employee who stabbed two government officials, one fatally, after they tried to rape her  makes one wonder about this.         
	Deng Yujiaos case was reported in this column last time. Public pressure in favour of the girl forced the police to change the charge against her from intentional murder to excessive self-defence. Last week, the court found her guilty of the charge, but exempted her from criminal punishment and set her free because of diminished responsibility for three reasons. First, she did act in self-defence. Second, she had turned herself in immediately. Finally, she was said to be suffering from depression, and thus had a limited capacity to take legal responsibility for her actions.         
	Deng Yujiao was in tears as the press mobbed her after the verdict, saying she had expected a harsher sentence. She now wanted to get her mental disorder treated and get a new job, and maybe acquire a new skill. But in her first full-length interview in her grandparents home, Deng hardly got a chance to speak. Her mother, aunt and grandfather did most of the talking. Her grandfather revealed that Deng had been taking pills for insomnia for the last two years. Now, their first priority would be to get her treated, and definitely take her away from the vulgar place where she had been working. (Sexual services were regularly offered in that hotel; hence the party officials chagrin when Deng refused them.) He also expressed sorrow for the family of the official who had died.        
	However, in the gratitude expressed by the old man to the high and mighty who had helped them through the case, emerged a disturbing fact: the beauteous young woman, who had become Chinas True Heroine, was being kept under watch by the same party whose officials had tried to rape her.                 
	New icon         
	Various high party functionaries had visited her in hospital. (She had been admitted to a psychiatric ward after her arrest, and a television channel had shown her lying on a bed with her ankles tied, crying, Father, they beat me!) Other officials continued to be in touch with her. Was this out of concern, or fear that she might really become the heroine of a peoples movement against venal officials?        
	Another disturbing aspect was the change in lawyers midway. The original defence lawyers, who travelled all the way from Beijing to fight for Deng, had to return after her mother sacked them. Curiously, the police announced their dismissal before the mother did. Two local lawyers were then hired for her. Asked about this, Dengs grandfather said that the original lawyers were more interested in publicizing the case; and they kept insisting that she had been raped when she hadnt.        
	The verdict has made people rejoice at the victory of their efforts to save Deng, who in their eyes had become an icon of courage. The judiciary is not independent in China; it is a part of the executive. That means the government wanted Deng to walk free. Why? Did Beijing fear that a harsh punishment would lead to unpredictable unrest? Already, the anger had gone far beyond the internet. Last year, a young man who killed six policemen after suffering their harassment for long, was executed; but he continues to be hailed as a hero on the internet.        
	Dengs verdict is indeed a triumph of public sentiment. By finding Deng guilty of the crime she was charged with, yet setting her free, the court is seen to have upheld the law and shown its sensitivity to public sentiment. In addition, the verdict has sent out a strong message to power-hungry party officials. Would this happen in democratic India with its independent judiciary?

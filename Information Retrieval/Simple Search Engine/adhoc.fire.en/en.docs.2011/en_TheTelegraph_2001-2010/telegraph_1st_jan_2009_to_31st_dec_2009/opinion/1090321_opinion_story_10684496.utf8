	Now that Indian galleries, collectors and (alas) auction-houses have come round to agreeing that photography can also be art, a whole new world of lucrative possibilities has opened up suddenly. This need not be good news for art. It has become possible for veteran as well as younger photojournalists to select their images, enlarge them in silver gelatin to an impressive size, frame them expensively and put them up in some sort of an art-space with clever lighting  and lo, an Artist is born! And the prices get arty too.        
	Looking at Marc Ribouds photographs (Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre, March 3-10), it was impossible not to recall the brilliant German photography shown here last June. Comparing Ribouds black-and-white (and a few faintly coloured) photographs with the unforgettable work of Bernd and Hilla Becher, Andreas Gursky, Thomas Struth or Candida Hfer hanging from the same walls, one couldnt help feeling a little sorry for Riboud. He makes his pictures from a different sort of impulse, and under normal circumstances it would have been unfair to contrast the eminently forgettable charm of his India or China with, say, the meditative classicism of the Becher water-towers. It would be like finding Khushwant Singh frivolous compared to Amitav Ghosh, or Nora Jones shallow compared to Gwyneth Jones. I take photographs the way a musician hums, writes Riboud. He seems happy to be humming his way through life, without quite getting down to making music. There is a way of showing the work of photojournalists like Riboud that puts the images back into the context of the news stories or books they were part of originally. In the absence of these original contexts, the photographs become unremarkable, or even pointless.        
	But even as photojournalism goes, Marc Riboud has not gone very far  at least with this selection of images. Most of this show looks like Cartier-Bresson on a dull day. The pictures lack the quicksilver intelligence that takes HC-Bs photography beyond journalism or caf posters. Ribouds India is eternally peacocks (picture), camels and elephants, China misty mountains, England hats, coats and old people, Afghanistan boys and guns, and Paris the Eiffel Tower being merrily painted. And lots of underclad children in mischief or misery. The work covers nearly six decades, but the Fifties photos look identical to those of the Eighties or of 2002.

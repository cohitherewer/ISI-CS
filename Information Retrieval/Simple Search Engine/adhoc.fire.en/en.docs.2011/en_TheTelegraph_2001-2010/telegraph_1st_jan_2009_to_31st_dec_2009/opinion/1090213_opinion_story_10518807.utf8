	Hitler rsquo;s Empire: Nazi Rule in Occupied Europe By Mark Mazower, Allen Lane, pound;13.99  
	It is difficult even for anti-colonialist nationalists to see Adolf Hitler as an empire-builder, cut from the same stone as Clive, Rhodes or Gordon. But as Mark Mazower shows in this exhaustively researched book, this was one of the images that Hitler had of himself. Was he entirely wrong in having such a self-image?  
	By 1942, midway through the Second World war, the Germans controlled within Europe a landmass larger than the United States of America. It was, as Mazower notes, more densely populated and more economically productive than any other place in the world. The conquest and consolidation of this huge area were the culmination of Hitlers foreign policy. He also believed, like other empire-builders, that the conquered lands, in his case Europe, existed fundamentally to serve the interests of Greater Germany. Hitler was doing to large chunks of Europe what many European countries, especially Great Britain, had done to Asia, Latin America and Africa. It puzzled Nazi leaders no end that Britain had principled objections to the Nazi project of empire. Alfred Rosenberg commented, It seems to us that the British empire too is based on a racially defined claim of dominance. The British, too, were driven in their colonies by a sense of racial superiority, and within Europe by the hatred of Bolshevism.        
	Mazower, however, is too good a historian to accept these similarities at face value. He analyses the differences between Hitlers empire and the colonial ones, and, in the process, brings out the formers unique features.        
	With all their violence, exploitation and discrimination, European empires in Asia, Africa and Latin America had grown up over long periods of time, and their dominance extended over largely rural societies. The Germans, on the other hand, imposed their rule very suddenly in the midst of a war and they chose to inflict this on urbanized societies which had powerfully shaped and already formed senses of their own national identity.        
	The other difference was that Hitlers new order erased the existence of countries like Poland, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia. There was also the intensity of the violence. Figures illustrate the scale of the terror. In September 1939, before Hitlers main move of eastward expansion, there were six main concentration camps housing 21,400 prisoners. By the beginning of 1945, this had expanded into a network of camps containing more than 700,000 prisoners, most of them from the conquered territories in the East. Between the end of 1941 and the beginning of 1942, more than two million Soviet POWs had been allowed by the Nazis to die in camps. In three years, 1941-44, the system of extermination camps had been invented and perfected, and in them over five million Jews had been killed. Six million Europeans had been reduced to the status of slaves and forced to work in and for the Reich. No empire had previously unleashed such a regime of terror in such a short time. What is equally significant is that even the Nazis had not contemplated this before the onset of the war.        
	There is another aspect to which Mazower draws attention: the extent of collaboration that the Nazis received in the areas they conquered. In Mazowers telling words, What was striking was not that Europeans resisted, but they were mostly so hesitant to do so. Large parts of Europe fell in line and did exactly what the Nazis demanded. This tends to get overlooked in the saga of heroic resistance against the Nazis.        
	Mazower takes Nazi rule and its horrors outside the confines of Germany. Outside the land of its birth, the Nazi vision had a bizarre bankruptcy that was perfectly reflected in the regimes military failures, especially in the East. Mazowers book, in one grand but penetrating sweep, looks at this experience that ruined Germany but may have made Europe.

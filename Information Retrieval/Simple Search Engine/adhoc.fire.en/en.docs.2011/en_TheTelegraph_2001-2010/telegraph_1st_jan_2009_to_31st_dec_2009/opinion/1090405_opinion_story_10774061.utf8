	 You no longer need just two to tango. If the mad dance of political parties is anything to go by, one can have as many partners as one chooses. While the wild party goes on, the Congress is quietly trying to put its own house in order. This was evident in the preparations before the release of the party manifesto. Since, by then, the Congress president had already made up her mind about letting Manmohan Singh keep his job, some other odd jobs needed to be finished: answering questions about Varun Gandhi, for instance. It was decided that it would only be apt if the prime ministerial face of the party took the queries and Varuns aunt  Sonia Gandhi  took the backseat. It was also decided that since the posters of the troika  Singh-Sonia-Rahul  were creating confusion about who exactly Sonia Gandhi was backing for the top job, Singh and Sonia would share the same poster while Rahul would go solo from now on. Fair enough, but there may still be doubts about who the Congress poster boy is.                         
	 Is the Congress taking the middle path? The Congress manifesto committee under its chief architect, Pranab Mukherjee, is said to have prepared a draft that had initially run into 187 pages. It was the result of Pranabdas painstaking research that had involved consultation with various lobbies  NGOs, businessmen, farmers and so on. When Mukherjee was discussing the matter with the captains of industry, a top industrialist is supposed to have advised him to reduce the manifesto to a single page. After much pruning, the document was reduced to its present size  21 pages.                             
	 Theres no stopping the rumour mills. Their most recent product has to do with Varun Gandhi. The Election Commissions much-ado about the youths rant is supposed to have to do entirely with the chief election commissioner, N Gopalaswami. Given the allegations of bias towards the saffron party, the grapevine has it that Gopalaswami needed to do his bit to prove his impartiality. Hence the EC has gone on an overdrive against Varun.                             
	 Try as much as they can, not everything in the Congress house can be set in order. Take the case of Suresh Pachauri. The name of the Madhya Pradesh Congress chief did not figure in the partys list of Lok Sabha candidates from the state. Pachauri had been keen to contest from Hoshangabad and had even been nursing the constituency for three years. But the Delhi durbar did not oblige him. The reason? He is head of the state Congress. But so are the people who have been given tickets in Bengal, Rajasthan and Orissa. Pachauris supporters believe a powerful caucus in Delhi has checkmated him. Meanwhile, the Bharatiya Janata Party in Hoshangabad has come up with its take on the issue: Ek samosa, ek kachori, bhag gaya Suresh Pachauri.                             
	 The times might belong to the lauh purush, but the vikas purush has not gone out of reckoning. Atal Bihari Vajpayee is not contesting the elections, but the BJP leadership still wants him in Lucknow for the sake of Lalji Tandon, a party faithful, known for his complete devotion to Vajpayee. (Remember the infamous sari-distribution on Tandons birthday in 2004 that was originally planned to channel goodwill for Vajpayees candidacy?) Lalji claims to be a shadow candidate of Vajpayee, but despite the self-advertisement, the party knows it will be difficult for him to win, unless of course, the mentor himself turns up to vouch for Laljis words. But since Vajpayees health will not permit even a guest appearance, the party has decided to telecast his recorded messages. Something is always better than nothing.                            
	 The Trinamul Congress has mastered the strategy to disable its political opponent  hit it at where it hurts the most. Singur was a small proof of that. A greater proof lay in didis priceless comments made before television cameras. Mamata Banerjee made a point to punctuate her by-now famous interview with apposite quotes and couplets from the works Rabindranath Tagore. There are few who do not know of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees love for the poet, and those who did not should have been made aware of the fact by the furore the chief minister raised over the EC directive. Was this then didis way of taking on her rival on his own turf?                        
	 Too many cooks spoil the broth; so it has been with the Congress. The party has fielded Kapil Sibal, Anand Sharma, Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Ashwani Kumar to take on the BJP and third front leaders in debates and talk shows during election season. But the seemingly formidable team of legal eagles has ended up messing up the partys case. In his interactions, Sibal seems to be obsessed with his constituency. Sharma, on the other hand, behaves more like someone in charge of the information and broadcasting ministry than a party spokesperson, while Singhvis Hindi translations of English idioms and proverbs leave everyone flabbergasted. Kumars problem lies elsewhere. The junior minister, who is selling himself as a bilingual spokesman, has been busy organizing lunch and dinner meets. The other day, the guests (scribes) were told that the host was available for interviews after desserts! Now that is far from perfect timing.

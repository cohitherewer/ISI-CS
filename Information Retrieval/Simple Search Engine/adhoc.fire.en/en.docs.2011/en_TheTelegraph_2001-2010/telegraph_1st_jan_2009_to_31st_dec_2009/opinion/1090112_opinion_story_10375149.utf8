                                                                                                                 TRUTH BE TOLD                                                    
	After much serious deliberation, the minister of corporate affairs has superseded the Satyam board and inserted his own nominees. There are no surprises in this: those appointed are not bad, but their essential qualification is that they are on the right side of the government. This step betrays two misconceptions. The first is that the board has power to prevent misappropriation. A companys board meets once a quarter at most. It deliberates items on an agenda prepared by the companys top managers. One has to be incredibly nave to think that they would have placed before the board a record of their own misdeeds. The second misconception is that the worthies the minister has chosen can take control of the company and prevent further malpractice. It would be rude to say that the minister has been ineffectual; the best that can be said is that replacing the board is neither here nor there.        
	The one body that should have detected the crime, long ago, is PricewaterhouseCoopers, the external auditor. It took some time to think of an excuse for its failure; but it has come up with one, namely that the falsification of accounts was supported by evidence. That is hardly a revelation; a man of B. Ramalinga Rajus education and sophistication would surely cover his trail with skill. Detecting his fraud would require accounting expertise. That is why the law requires companies to appoint qualified external auditors, and why companies pay them millions for auditing. This fraud runs into thousands of crores, and was perpetrated over many years. If an external auditor cannot get even a scent of it, it must be asked what auditors are worth. If PwCs explanation is accepted, the statutory requirement of external audit may just as well be scrapped. A few thousand wealthy auditors would lose their livelihood, but the rest of India would not notice their absence.        
	Hence, it is important that the failure of PwC be investigated, and it be made to accept its responsibility. But that can wait. What is far more important is that a new, independent chief accounting officer be appointed for the company, and that he be given the support and resources to put the companys accounts back in order. When he is ready, there should also be a fresh, independent audit of Satyams accounts. The board of directors is not irrelevant, but the government conveniently forgets the fact that the company belongs to its shareholders. It is the shareholders who should appoint a new board. The share of the Raju clan in the equity is so small that it is unlikely that it will have much influence on the choice of new directors. The registrar of companies should call for nominations of new directors from shareholders, allow time for deliberations amongst them, and then supervise the election of a new board.

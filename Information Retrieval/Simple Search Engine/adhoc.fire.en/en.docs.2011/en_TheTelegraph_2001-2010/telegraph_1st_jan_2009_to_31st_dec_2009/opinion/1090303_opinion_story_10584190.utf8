	Wide berth                  
	Sir  I travelled by the Hatia-Ranchi-Howrah Express on February 17. I was pleased to note that the authorities have stopped the recently introduced practice of inserting an additional berth in the middle of the aisle seats. This retraction shows that the Indian Railways is bowing to public pressure. But I would like to know who had put forward this bright idea of a middle berth. He must never have travelled in a sleeper coach. If he had, he would have known that it is not possible to accommodate an additional berth on the aisle without inconveniencing all three passengers. The amount wasted on refurbishing the additional berths should be deducted from this persons salary. Somebody should be accountable for public money spent uselessly.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  I know that the Union railways minister, Lalu Prasad, is favourably disposed towards railway coolies, but I was not aware of the extent of his kindness. On February 13, my wife and I were waiting at the New Delhi railway station on platform number 1 to board the Garib Rath coming from Saharsa to go to Amritsar. All the electronic boards at platform 1 were showing the train number and the coach numbers of the Garib Rath. Then, just 15 minutes before the arrival of the train, it was announced that the train was coming to platform number 5. All the passengers had to shift quickly to platform 5 with their luggage as there was precious little time left to catch the train. As a result, there started a mad rush, just short of a stampede, to get on the overbridge connecting platforms 1 and 5. It was not possible for me to carry our three heavy suitcases one by one up the stairs of the overbridge and then down again on the other side without disturbing my ailing wife. So I had no option but to hire a coolie who demanded an astounding sum of Rs 300 for his labours. The same story was repeated in the Amritsar railway station on February 17 when we were waiting at platform 1 for the Howrah Mail. Again, just 15 minutes before the scheduled departure of the train, it was declared that the train would leave from platform number 5 instead of 1. Again, the coolies had the time of their lives and demanded whatever amounts they felt like from the passengers. It was a kind of open blackmail.          
	I would like to point out here that in both cases, there were no trains in either of the platforms when the announcements were made. Why were the platform numbers for the trains then changed at the last moment? Assuming that it was necessary to make the change, it could still have been done well before the scheduled departure time. This would have given the passengers sufficient time to shift from one platform to the other, and would not have left them at the mercy of the coolies. Had the change of platform at the last moment taken place only once, I would have accepted it as being the result of a technical problem. But two similar incidents cannot be dismissed as mere coincidence. Hence, I think that there is more to the episodes than meets the eye. The precious votes of thousands of coolies and their families all over India are now guaranteed for Lalu Prasads Rashtriya Janata Dal and its allies. A sound poll strategy indeed.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Since the last decade, hundreds of immigrants have illegally occupied the lands to the north of the Sealdah mainline. They live in slums constructed on the sides of the railway line. They have made makeshift lavatories covered with jute bags beside the track. This has made travelling on suburban Electric Multiple Unit trains in the mornings a hellish experience. The stench between Belgharia and Dum Dum is unbearable, more so in hot and humid weather. The commuters agony increases when a crushing load of passengers enters the trains at Belgharia. However, things have come to such a pass only in the last five years.           
	Is there any leader, irrespective of party colour, who can take care of this problem? Or do the netas think that they have done their duty by importing people from neighbouring countries or states, giving them voter identity cards, and settling them on railway land? In their eagerness to secure the immigrants votes, have they ever spared a thought for the millions who travel by local trains?           
	The commuters are terrified as another election approaches. Probably this time too, hundreds of people would be invited to settle on the remaining patches of green beside the track. The tracks become their playground, forcing the trains to slow down while moving through this hell. It seems that only god can help the middle class passengers who cannot afford a house in the city proper and so are forced to commute by train from the northern suburbs.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  An appalling instance of development work can be observed at the Park Circus railway station. Two banyan trees there have been cruelly shorn of their leaves and main branches. These green, leafy trees were not only beautiful but they also protected passengers from the sun while they waited for trains. On enquiry, it was revealed that these trees had been axed so mercilessly in preparation of the visit of the divisional railway manager to oversee the progress that has been achieved in the renovations being done to the station. Who will teach these thoughtless people the value of these trees? They were creating no obstacle for the overhead wires, which are at least 15 feet away.                    
	Yours faithfully,

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Better Safe Than Sorry
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        BETTER SAFE THAN SORRY                                  Abhijit Bhattacharyya                              
	It has been reported that the Inter-Services Intelligence chief, lieutenant-general A. Shuja Pasha, has floated the idea of getting a seat at the diplomatic high-table during the Indo-Pak talks. The proposal was apparently presented during a meeting with the three defence advisers in the Indian high commission in Islamabad in July 2009.         
	The ISIs plea to be officially recognized as a legitimate diplomatic entity dealing with New Delhi is quite surprising. If this were to happen, one wonders what would then be the fate of the Pakistani politicians and diplomats. Would they get eclipsed, once again, by the army? The ISIs demand for a change in role seems highly unlikely though.         
	The ISIs proposal was followed by the blunt clarification by Mike Mullen, the chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, that the ISI has been supporting militant groups in Kashmir and in the Federally Administered Tribal Area bordering Afghanistan. Mullens statement exposed the rogue State within the state of Pakistan.                
	Evil plan        
	There is nothing new in Mullens statement for the Indian establishment. India has been vocal about the ISIs proxy war in Kashmir for a long time. The ISI has also been crossing the Indo-Nepal border with ease, and trying to goad a section of Bangladeshis to support anti-India activities to avenge the 1971 disaster.        
	Among the most harmful acts to disrupt international relations was the ISIs successful bid to forge a nexus with the Bank of Credit and Commercial International. The seventh largest bank of the world, and the largest Islamic bank in the 1990s, it had financed numerous militant organizations and laundered money with the ISIs assistance.        
	The ISIs enterprise in India is very well documented. It has been alleged that the ISI was one of the main supporters of the Khalistan movement. Credible media reports state that the ISI is dominated by Pashtuns, the same tribe that is the Talibans base of support across the border in Afghanistan. Thus, partly because of its family, clan and business ties with the Taliban, the ISI, even more than Pakistani society in general, has become increasingly enamoured of radical Islam in recent years.                 
	Take care         
	The list of actions by the ISI against India is endless. When India bled, the world simply misread the cause of trouble. Now, as a coalition of international armies fights the Taliban, Indias help is being sought to ease matters for the Nato-led troops. Surely, India understands its international obligations to maintain peace and order.         
	However, India must be careful not to fall into a welllaid trap. It would be potentially disastrous for India to allow the ISI and its agents to come to the table to talk trade, tourism, and terror with New Delhi. India would do much better to talk to those who have been appointed to hold political office as well as with economic advisors instead of spending time confabulating with the ISI whose sole aim is to spread death and destruction. The Indian leadership needs to be wary of an organization that has been accused of espionage and subversion, and of patronizing saboteurs and drug smugglers.         
	India must exercise utmost caution. The country has to talk with restraint, and act with discretion. Indian leaders must take lessons from real life. If a neighbour is a criminal, one need not invite him for dinner. Instead, it is better to keep a watch on his activities and maintain a minimum level of cordiality. India need not go close to shake hands. It should maintain its distance from those who spell trouble.

	Imagine a great symphony orchestra playing Beethovens 9th in London, Berlin, Vienna or New York. Now try to imagine a woman conducting this orchestra. Impossible. There could be a few women in the orchestra, but only a few. In the last movement, there would have to be women in the choir to sing the Ode to Joy, and two women singing alto and soprano among the soloists, who are likely to be quite grand. But no, Simon Rattle, James Levine, Daniel Barenboim or Zubin Mehta on the podium cannot be imagined as anything but male. Nor could Beethoven, for that matter. The entire history of Western classical music, and our visual imagination of it, would become topsy-turvy if the maestro turns into a maestra, a word that connotes schoolmistress in Italian.        
	It is astonishing how in the 21st century, in spite of Western political correctness, conducting and composition are still the bastions of unabashed and iconic maleness. Yet, women are, and have been for long, a vital presence in the performance of this music, as instrumentalists and singers, often of legendary virtuosity and fame. For the record companies, impresarios, opera-house managers and funders of musical events and festivals, women are immensely valuable, musically and visually, but the division of the kingdoms is almost absolute. If you listen to Western classical music, you will have heard, or heard of, and be able to recognize the faces of Mitsuko Uchida, Martha Argerich, Waltraud Meier or Kathleen Battle. But how many people would know of Judith Weir, Chen Yi, Ellen Taaffe Zwilich or Kaija Saariaho  all distinguished contemporary composers? Judith Weirs name would perhaps ring a bell, but without bringing to mind any of her compositions. And the same with Clara Schumann, whose husband, Robert, is now part of the Romantic pantheon. Dame Ethel Smyth, the English composer and suffragette, is remembered almost entirely for having fallen in love with Virginia Woolf, who wrote to Quentin Bell that the experience was like being caught by a giant crab.        
	Yet, the best conservatories are full of women learning how to conduct and compose; many of their teachers are women too. It is also not true that women never get to conduct the great orchestras of the world. But they are almost never appointed as musical directors or principal (or even assistant) conductors of the orchestras that they are occasionally allowed to conduct. I say almost because in 2007, Marin Alsop created musical history, at the age of 51, by becoming musical director of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra  the first woman to lead a major American orchestra (picture). America is a little better than Europe in these matters. With Leonard Bernstein as her mentor, Alsop would often conduct the New York Phil, and was the first woman principal conductor of the Bournemouth Symphony orchestra in Britain. Before she took over at Baltimore in 2007, she was one of only 11 women who had been among the 348 conductors under whom the New York Phil had performed since its founding in 1842. Almost 90 per cent of the members of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra had opposed Alsops appointment.        
	Among the few women who had conducted the NY Phil, the most famous was Nadia Boulanger (1887-1979), who also conducted the Royal Philharmonic in London in the Thirties. But she is remembered today as a great teacher (Aaron Copland and Daniel Barenboim were her students) and not as the conductor and composer she also happened to be, like her equally brilliant sister, Lili, after whose death in 1918 Nadia never composed again. Nadia was a fearsome teacher who made her students memorize both books of Bachs Well-Tempered Clavier and then made them play each fugue transposed to a randomly-set key. But she was also dogged by paralysing diffidence as a musician. If there is anything of which I am very sure, it is that my music is useless.

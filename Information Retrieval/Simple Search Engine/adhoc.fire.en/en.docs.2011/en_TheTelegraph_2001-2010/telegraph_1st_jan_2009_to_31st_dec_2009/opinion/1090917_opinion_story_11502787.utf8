                                                                                                                 SHOE BITE                                                    
	At least three others have done it so far, yet none has complained of being tortured in captivity. It all began with Muntadhar al-Zaidi, an Iraqi journalist, who had hurled his shoe at George W. Bush last year. Soon afterwards, the Chinese premier, Wen Jiabao, got a boot in the face at Cambridge University, followed by the Israeli ambassador to Sweden, who was hit by footwear in Stockholm. In India, a reporter with a reputed daily aimed his sneakers at P. Chidambaram when the latter dodged a controversial question at a press conference. Dissent, when expressed in such a preposterous manner, deserves unconditional censure. But what follows once such incidents have taken place may turn out to be even more insidious. While the Indian home ministers attacker was summarily sacked by his employer, a more sinister fate awaited Mr al-Zaidi: he was sentenced to three years imprisonment. Recently, Mr al-Zaidi earned his freedom after the term was reduced to nine months. The Iraqi scribe received a heros welcome not only from his community but also from the rest of the Islamic world. Hundreds of fathers have offered up their daughters for marriage to this young Iraqi. Muammar Gaddafi has invited him to reside in Libya for good, while Hugo Chvez has topped up the same offer of citizenship with an additional $100,000 to help Mr al-Zaidi settle down in Venezuela. His bosses, too, have got him a brand new car and a four-bedroom apartment.        
	But Mr al-Zaidi has little reason to feel cheerful. Having emerged from prison with a missing tooth, fractured ribs and an unhealed broken foot, he claims to have suffered regular beatings, electric shocks and whipping. Although a free man now, he fears the retribution of American secret service agents. It is revealing that among four perpetrators of the same kind of crime, only one was singled out for such unique mistreatment. Is it because he was tried by the judiciary of a country, which his target, the former US president, had left after installing a mock democracy and with a big grin on his face? Mr al-Zaidi said that by throwing his boot he wanted to counter the way the United States of America had humiliated his homeland by placing it under its boots. Perhaps this crime of turning the tables on the worlds most powerful man had incited the ire of the puppet prime minister Mr Bush had entrusted Iraq with.

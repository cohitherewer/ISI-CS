	Driven by force                  
	Sir  Indians have felt proud of their country because it is neither a banana republic nor ruled by someone like Idi Amin. But the case of the Election Commission usurping the Tata Safari owned by Sachin Halder punches a hole in that pride (Coolly inappropriate, May 9). A couple of decades back, when I was working in a neighbouring state, I had heard how a colleague of mine had been offloaded, along with his family, from their car before it was impounded by the EC. On a different occasion, the brand-new Maruti of another colleague had been targeted. Since he immediately proceeded on an official tour, that misfortune could be averted. Now that the polls are over, the draconian measures used by the EC, and approved by the State, would hopefully be reviewed.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Ashok Ghosh, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  The editorial, Coolly inappropriate, while narrating the incredible predicament of Sachin Halder, whose car was requisitioned for election duty, has overlooked the fact that these requisitions are made by the local administration, and not directly by the EC. The EC alone cannot be blamed if a State agency, engaged in the maintenance of law and order, commits any excesses. The fact remains that power is misused, at all levels, by most people in this country, particularly so in West Bengal.          
	Most political parties do not abide by the rules prescribed by the EC, be it rules on the defacement of walls or on the holding of public meetings at street corners leading invariably to traffic congestion. Innocent people are killed by goons of some parties for supporting their political rivals. One fails to see what the EC can do if the ruling party resorts to abuse of power. The EC is responsible for the conduct of free and fair polls, but it also depends on the state governments to perform this duty. In Bengal the insidious culture of coercion and intolerance makes the ECs job extremely difficult.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Asit Kumar Mitra, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Sachin Halder is not the first person to get reprieve from the court, which has asked for his car to be returned to him immediately. There are others who have received a verdict in their favour, but had to keep waiting to get back their vehicles. It is sad that law-enforcers are the first to break the law. If the subdivisional officer does not listen to the high court verdict, do court orders carry any weight? How can the common people then be expected to obey such orders?          
	Yours faithfully

	Tax trouble          
	Sir  It is heartening to know that the moderate clerics of Pakistan have woken from their slumber and raised their voice against the Taliban. In the name of Islam, the Taliban are not only committing atrocities against non-Muslims, but also against Muslims. They recently extracted an exorbitant amount of money as jiziya from the Sikhs of the Orakzai region. Those unable to pay up have had their houses bombed, and had to flee from Swat, their home for centuries, to safer places. The Barelvi branch of Sunni Muslims, together with the Ulema Council of Pakistan, should make it clear to the Taliban that the jiziya must not be extracted by force and the acquisition should be in consonance with Islamic principles.          
	The jiziya was a tax imposed by the Muslim State on non-Muslims  only on able-bodied adult males, and not on the aged, weak and infirm, women, children and monks  for protection against any military invasion by outside forces. During the time of the Prophet and the four Caliphs who succeeded him, the rate of jiziya was less than the rate of zakat to be paid by Muslims to the state treasury every lunar year. Moreover, the money from jiziya was spent strictly on army expenses, and was not for public use. The Caliphs had insisted that the dhimmies or non-Muslims be treated with due care and affection for they contribute to the treasury. Apart from imposing the jiziya on non-Muslims, the Taliban are committing atrocities against women, some of whom, as we know, have been flogged in open daylight, or have been put to death for defying the Taliban diktat. The Taliban have forced the closure of several girls schools as well.          
	The people of Pakistan must realize that not merely non-Muslims, but Muslims, too, are suffering at the hands of the Taliban. The heavy fighting with the Taliban has forced an exodus and created a humanitarian crisis. Pakistan should take the cue from Sri Lanka and wipe out the Taliban. If sharia is to be enforced, it should be according to the injunctions of the Quran and the four Caliphs.           
	Yours faithfully,       
S. Balakrishnan, Jamshedpur

                          
	Better luck next time          
	Sir  I had filed my nomination as an independent candidate from my state, Sikkim, for the Lok Sabha elections this year but had to withdraw under pressure from my family and community. I was told that I was politically inexperienced, that politics itself is a dirty game and the last resort for scoundrels.           
	My desire was to serve the people with humility. I had thought that I could break the stereotypical assessment of a political leader. Unless educated and determined people  who can rise above the greed for power and luxuries  come to the forefront, politics will remain dirty. I have not given up. I dream of a corruption-free society and State.           
	I plan to work in the intervening five years so that I remain firm about my decision when I file my nomination in the next general elections.           
	Yours faithfully,

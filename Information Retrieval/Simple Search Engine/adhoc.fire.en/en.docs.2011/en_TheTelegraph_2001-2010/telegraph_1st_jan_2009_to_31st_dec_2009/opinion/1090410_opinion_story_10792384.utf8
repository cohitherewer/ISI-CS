	Somewhere towards the end By DianaAthill, Granta,
  pound;2.75  
	Editors are trained to improve their writers style and even content. Editors revel in their own anonymity. Editors are not known to be writers. Diana Athill is the exception to these generalizations.  
	She worked with Andr Deutsch, a Hungarian migr, to set up his eponymous publishing house. She worked there till she was well into her seventies, and to those in the know of the secrets of Londons publishing world, she had the reputation of being one of the best book editors. After her retirement from Andr Deutsch, she took to writing and her book, Stet, won very high acclaim. That book was her memoirs of her time in publishing, setting up the firm, and then her work with various authors. Her memory was clear, her prose precise and her judgments unambiguous.        
	This book could also be described as Athills memoirs, but they are more in the nature of reflections on old age. Death forms a large part of the book as Athill prepares herself for its inevitable and impending arrival. She reveals that she comes from a family whose members have had long lives. She writes movingly about her mother and her grandmother. While her mother was old and ailing in Norfolk, Athill was working in London. The distance and the separation did not make caring easy and Athill is honest about her guilt and about the steps she took to cope with the situation. These sections could not have been easy to write, but her recollections are refreshingly free from even a hint of morbidity.        
	The other aspect of her life that she writes about with disarming frankness is her sex life. It is clear that Athill enjoyed sex  both the tenderness and the physical pleasure  well into old age. She has the rare ability to make the distinction between her romantic attachments  even fantasies  and those that were driven by sexual pleasure. She writes also of one very special relationship where the sex declined and disappeared but the friendship endures. These sections are really fun to read because Athill does not make her readers into voyeurs in her private life. She records feelings and events that were intensely personal without actually making the reader feeling uncomfortable. She has the gift of sharing.        
	There are two very unusual chapters in this book. One is on how she took up dressmaking as an activity, and actually took classes on it. At one point in her life, she became so fat that dresses off the peg did not fit her any more. Since she couldnt afford bespoke, she decided to learn how to make her own dresses. At that time, it was possible in London to attend such special classes. The other section concerns old age and driving. Athill suffers from terribly painful feet, so her car is an essential part of her life. She also quite obviously enjoys driving and is aware that her driving skills are declining with her advancing years. There is a rather harrowing description of an accident that she was involved in through no fault of hers.        
	The most delightful aspect of this book is Athills description of her relationship with people younger than her who have become close to her. She not only writes about them and their lives with a great deal of affection, but is also able to step back and not be judgmental about them. She offers sage advice to those who enjoy the company of the young: I am convinced that one should never, never expect them to want ones company, or make the kind of claims on them that one makes on a friend of ones own age. Enjoy whatever they are generous enough to offer, and leave it at that.        
	This book is written with great humour and without a hint of remorse, bitterness or self-pity. It is indeed difficult to believe that she is actually as old as she says she is  she is well into her nineties. Her prose makes one regret she didnt take to writing earlier. The editors desk was not her real vocation even if it was her chosen one.

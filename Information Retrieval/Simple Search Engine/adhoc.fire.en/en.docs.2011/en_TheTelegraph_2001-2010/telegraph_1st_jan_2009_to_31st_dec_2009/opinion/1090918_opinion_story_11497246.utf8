	Pipe dream                  
	Sir  Ramachandra Guhas article, Superpower fantasies (Sept 12), deftly traces the hollowness of India s claims to superpower status that the countrys political and business elite have been harping on of late. Such immediate concerns as astronomical prices of essential articles, drought in many parts of the country, farmers suicide, the rise of Maoists, as well as poverty, illiteracy, the ever-increasing religious and cultural divide, the spectre of terrorism and so on, are reasons enough why India cannot become a superpower in the near future.           
	Politicians claim that India has successfully braved the recession, but with an erratic Sensex and job losses across many sectors, the reality is a far cry from such optimistic assertions. It may be claimed that inflation is under control, but it does not take an economist to see the worrying reality of the market. One speaks of globalization and the Indo-US nuclear deal as phenomena that would revolutionize the economy. But with a majority of the population living below the poverty line, without access to education, it is reasonable to assume that many of our countrymen would not even understand the significance of such complicated terms, let alone reap benefits from them.           
	India has joined the mad-race to become the next big world power, but until it deals with the problems in its own backyard, it does not stand a chance in the competition. At the heart of the problem is the fact that India is less of a nation and more of an assemblage of states with separate cultures and communities. Many Indians tend to identify themselves in terms of belonging to a particular religious or linguistic community rather than as Indian nationals. The countrys politicians have shrewdly exploited this provincial mindset. Policies are rarely made keeping in mind the interest of the nation as a whole, but are mostly meant to appease a particular section of the population. That apart, the expensive habits of the countrys leaders, which are being highlighted by the recent austerity-drive of some ministers, show that Indian democracy has degenerated into a plutocracy. India has still miles to go before its superpower dreams can begin to materialize. Considering the way political and economic leaders are performing  all words and little action  it is unlikely to come true any time soon. Optimism and ambition are good, but not when they give way to day-dreaming.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Landlocked          
	Sir  This is in reference to Ashok Mitras article, Squeeze capitalism (Sept 11). While Tata Motors has shifted its small car project from Singur to Sanand in Gujarat, the fate of the 1,000-acre land in Singur remains uncertain owing to the state governments apathy. Farmers who had sold their land to the Tatas in the hope of better economic returns have been let down by the abandonment of the project as they have had to settle for meagre monetary compensation instead of fresh opportunities of employment. The worst sufferers are those farmers who had not received compensation for their land. The much greater sum of money that the Tatas have supposedly paid the government may have filled the states coffers, but it has not mitigated the suffering of the poor farmers.           
	Perhaps investors are not considering West Bengal as a viable industrial destination on account of its perceived inhospitable work environment, and also because of the global economic slowdown. In this situation, the Left Front leaders should bury their ideological differences and work with the railways minister, Mamata Banerjee, so that her proposal to set up a railway-coach manufacturing unit in Singur can be realized. If the government makes an appeal to the Tatas on behalf of the farmers, the latter should return the land to the state authorities. Mitra has rightly pointed out that Tata Motors has failed to fulfil its commitment to the lease by cancelling the project, and is therefore neither justified in holding on to the land nor in claiming compensation from the government. Both the Tatas and the state government seem unwilling to concern themselves about the proper rehabilitation of those who have lost their land. The compensatory packages given to them by the government were far from adequate.           
	To take the land away from the Tatas by issuing another notice of acquisition would be harsh on them. But the Tatas should appreciate that any commercial venture involves some element of risk and should change their attitude towards the issue in Singur. Since the acquired land cannot be reclaimed for agriculture, the sooner some new industrial project is set up on it, the better it would be for the livelihood of the farmers.           
	If Mamata Banerjees proposed project, which she has said will take up only a part of the land, materializes, it will be her responsibility to return the remaining land to those farmers who had been unwilling to part with their land. If the project does not come through, the government should make the best use of the abandoned land by relocating Wipro and Infosys, which have now been displaced from Rajarhat, to Singur.                     
	Yours faithfully,

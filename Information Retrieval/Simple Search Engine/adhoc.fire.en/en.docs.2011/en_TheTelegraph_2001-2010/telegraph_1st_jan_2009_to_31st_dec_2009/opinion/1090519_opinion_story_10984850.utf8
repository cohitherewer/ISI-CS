	They were all wrong  the electronic media, the analysts, the traditional pontificators, all bound together by a deep animosity towards the Nehrus and the Gandhis, and therefore unable to accept that the Congress was working to restructure itself to face a changing world with an aspiration to liberate itself from the rigidities of caste and class affirmations, hoping to move forward in an inclusive manner and rebuild its base. At the helm of this exercise is Rahul Gandhi, a determined young leader who was pooh-poohed by the media and the intelligentsia alike, a general secretary who compelled the decision to stand alone in Uttar Pradesh and contest one of the toughest-ever elections. He delivered a shock to all the self-styled pundits who will now have to take him seriously because he is beginning to change the narrative of Indian politics. The Congress defeated Mayavati, was merely one seat behind the Samajwadi Party, and thus destroyed all the projections made by the backroom boys feeding the front-room anchors looking for sensational stories based on flights of fancy rather than hard facts from the ground.        
	The other gross misjudgment of these communicators was the belief that an incumbent coalition, led by a quiet, committed, dignified and highly-competent prime minister, who was working rather than playing politics, was too weak to win. They mocked the Congress president when she separated party work and governance of the nation, taking on the responsibility of the party herself. She was accused of having put a puppet in place because it suited her to keep the seat warm for her son. How wrong they have been proved. Sonia Gandhi was more than politically astute to force the segregation, and her non-interfering support to her coalition government and to the prime minister brought dignity back into both these offices. The opposition to the National Advisory Council was foolish, to say the least, as the latter was the bridge to thinking out of the box. It should be brought back into action.                
	Winner takes it all        
	For an incumbent coalition to win a decisive mandate after five years of uninterrupted rule is the biggest feat of recent times. All that unadulterated garbage of bringing Bofors into the front page; Arun Shourie giving us long and tedious lectures; those pompous editorials on the Rahul Gandhi factor, laced with personal abuse, emanating from the victims of the BJP propaganda  India has rejected all this. The day Sonia Gandhi pitted Manmohan Singh against L.K. Advani for the post of the prime minister, the Congress began to take the lead. The energy of Sonia Gandhi, her tacit belief in what her party and the UPA government had set as their agenda, and her relentless campaigning alongside Rahul Gandhi, won them the victory.        
	L.K. Advani has been retired off as a rejected page of contemporary history, and will be remembered for having called an incumbent, honourable prime minister of a national coalition a nikamma. India, appalled by such ugly politics, chose to reinforce the stature of the Congress, led ably by Sonia Gandhi, and to endorse the government led by Manmohan Singh, and the restructuring of the future by Rahul Gandhi. The posters of L.K. Advani, Rajnath Singh and Narendra Modi juxtaposed with those of Manmohan Singh, Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi won hands down. Five years down the road, even Narendra Modi will be too old to compete with a Rahul Gandhi. By then, the Congress may well have reinvented itself with fewer dalals and more leaders, excited by the power with which India can be transformed. With a liberal dispensation, incorporating the best of the left-of-centre positions and merging them sensibly into the changing reality, the Congress could be a formidable opposition to a right-wing Hindu nationalist BJP.

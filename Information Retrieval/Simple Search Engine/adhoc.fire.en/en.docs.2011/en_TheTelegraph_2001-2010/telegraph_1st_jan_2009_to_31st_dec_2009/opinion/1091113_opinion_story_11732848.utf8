	President Asif Ali Zardari is widely reported to have made up his mind about his final resting place, Ghari Khudabaksh, where his wife and her family are buried. It is difficult to miss the irony of the president on a hunt for a grave at a time when his presidency is under serious threat. The Pakistan supreme court has listed criminal and graft charges against Mr Zardari for hearing within the next few days. Although the list was prepared way back in August, and a hearing, in itself, may not amount to much given the fact that the constitution grants the president legal immunity against prosecution, the timing of this apparently routine procedure is most inopportune for Mr Zardari. It is likely to give wind to the sails of the powerful political agitation building up against him. And in case the supreme court rules against the National Reconciliation Ordinance (which, by suspending the legal charges against Benazir Bhutto and her husband in 2007, had made way for their re-entry into electoral politics) in the two petitions pending before it, the renewal of the court cases against Mr Zardari may make it morally and ethically untenable for him to continue in the highest elected office in the country. This is precisely the situation Mr Zardari has been desperate to avoid, and his political opponents, led by a self-righteous Nawaz Sharif, equally desperate to precipitate. This cat-and-mouse game has led Pakistan into a series of entirely avoidable political crises ever since the February 2008 polls when the nation unanimously voted for the return of democracy, and, with it, political stability.         
	There can be no arguments over the necessity of taking a legal process to its logical culmination. There can, however, be serious reservations if the law is made to serve narrow political ends. If the passing of the NRO was one such end, its repeal may also become another. The booting out of Mr Zardari has become the chief political purpose of a number of power brokers in Pakistan, the army being one. Mr Zardaris bold and unconventional posturing vis--vis India and the other forces viewed as traditional foes of Pakistan and his rapport with Pakistans Western allies have made the army edgy. His exit holds the promise of not only reverting the balance of power in its favour (a more gullible president can ensure that) but also of distracting the people from their immediate fears and insecurities.

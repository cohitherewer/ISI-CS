	It is only about a month since a democratic struggle led to the reinstatement of the chief justice of Pakistans supreme court. This singular achievement is being undermined by a quaint Sufi on the mountains of Mingora who has just announced that democracy is un-Islamic. There are chances that Sufi Mohammed will inspire many in his country to take a fresh look at such seminal political moments. He is the leader of Tehrik-e-Nifaz-e-Shariat-e-Mohammadi, and his cult status has been manufactured by the State itself in Pakistan. For the administration in Islamabad, the formula had initially been simple. If piecemeal solutions like the re-imposition of an earlier judicial system could keep the mullahs happy and stop guns from booming in the distant provinces, the State could go the extra mile, rehabilitate even those it had branded as terrorists and help them transform themselves into peacemakers. That is how Sufi Mohammed became the hero of Swat. The twist in the tale is that the peacemakers in Pakistans badlands are no longer willing to play the role assigned to them by the State. They are now a State unto themselves. As Sufi Mohammed has made it clear, his territory now has a judicial system that does not fall within the purview of the Pakistani State. The corollary is that Swat, and neighbouring Buner and Mansehra (to which the judicial system is being continually extended) will henceforth have their own laws as well, and perhaps their own foreign policy. Muslim Khan, an aspiring cult leader, has already invited Osama bin Laden, al Qaida chief, to visit his territory.         
	The Pakistan government is undoubtedly worried, which is why it has gone ahead with the presidents seal on the Swat deal in order to convince itself of the efficacy of such peacemaking. It is obvious that Islamabad still cannot bring itself to admit to the failure of its strategy. The bigwigs met recently in Dubai to rehash the programme of containing the Taliban. Given that Islamabad is likely to be overrun by the Taliban soon, the Pakistan government may find itself operating from outside the country.

	The mystic who came from afar                
	THE SUMMER OF COOL (Puffin, Rs 199) by Suchitra Krishnamoorthi is the first novel by the well-known actor and singer. It is set in downtown Mumbai, in a housing complex called Swapnalok Society, where ten-year-old Chitrangana, the protagonist, lives with her mother. This precocious little girl, with an eye for the quirky, finds enough amusement in the lives of her neighbours to keep herself occupied. There are the Mukherjees  secretly called Underwear Uncle and Aunty because they dry their undergarments in full view of everybody. Then there is Sita Maami, who has discovered a new formula for a soft drink. Also, a dog kidnapper and a handsome young bachelor. Add to this Chitranganas ambition to become a bathroom decorator, and the little girl has her hands quite full. But the gaping hole in her universe is her absent father. Once Chitrangana is given a doll, who speaks only with her, she sets out on a quest for her missing parent. This is an entertaining book, although a trifle sentimental in its resolve to lead the young heroine to true love at the end.                        
	THE RECESSION AHEAD? (Mark-Age, Rs 60) by S.C. Kakar is a slim handbook intended for business leaders, students and research scholars of economics, policymakers, investors at large, general readers and even economists. This is quite an ambitious readership. But why exactly would specialists wish to consult this flimsy little volume? As for the general readers, newspapers, TV channels and the Wikipedia should be a good enough, perhaps even a better, guide to the economic crisis.                                  
	THE BOOK OF MUINUDDIN CHISTI (Penguin, Rs 250) by Mehru Jaffer tells the story of the great Sufi mystic of Ajmer. Given the apocryphal nature of much of what is known about Chishti, a large part of the literature on the saint is enmeshed in speculation. Jaffer tries to disentangle the facts from the fiction by providing a comprehensive history of the arrival and spread of Sufism across India. While charting out this intellectual trajectory, she explores the rich legacy of Chishti in a lucid and moving manner. There are some lovely illustrations with the text.                        
	NINE DECADES MARXISM IN THE LAND OF BRAHMINISM (Other, Rs 190) by S.K. Biswas explores why Indian communism could not deal with the challenges of casteism. An interesting subject indeed, though marred by a slightly hysterical and oratorical style.

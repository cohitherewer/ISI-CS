	Gap widens                  
	Sir  In Wishes are not horses (June 19), Ashok Mitra states that anti-poverty measures did not, in the past, make the slightest dent in the state of the nations poor; such measures are unlikely to create much of an impression in the future either. Does Mitra seriously believe that the provisions of 100 days of paid work and cheap housing for the poor are useless? If so, are there any alternative measures that Mitra can suggest? Incidentally, Amartya Sen, while delivering the first Hiren Mukherjee memorial lecture in the central hall of Parliament, had admitted, while no major famine had visited India since independence, in China millions of people died [from famine] in the 1950s. So, some difference was made to the lives of the poor in India.           
	The percentage of people in India living below the global poverty line has also gone down substantially since Independence. This is no mean achievement for a country that was under foreign rule for a considerable period of time. Poverty in India is not uniform. For instance, there are fewer people living below the poverty line in Punjab than in West Bengal. The fact that some states have prospered and others have not indicates that State policy is not always anti-poor.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Ashok Mitras brilliant article critically examines the poverty and inequality persistent in India due to the faulty economic policies pursued by the government. They have resulted in the rich getting richer and the poor becoming poorer. According to a World Health Organization report, about 49 percent of the worlds underweight children, 34 percent of the worlds stunted children and 46 percent of the worlds wasted children, live in India. Most of Indias villages do not have access to potable water, electricity, good roads and basic healthcare facilities. Many people continue to defecate in the open, even as the number of Indian millionaires continues to rise. Unless the government brings forth a semblance of equality, the Naxalite and Maoist insurgencies in the country will continue to rise and become difficult to control.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Blot on the shine          
	Sir  It is quite shocking to know that the picture of the man inside a prison van hiding his face with a piece of black cloth is that of a popular film actor (Shiney in custody, wife rushes back, June 16). What Shiney Ahuja is alleged to to have done to his maidservant deserves outright condemnation. The Hindi film industry is quite familiar with such incidents. There have been various charges under different sections of the Indian Penal Code against successful actors like Salman Khan and Sanjay Dutt. But these actors are now working in films, and one of them even tried to contest the elections unsuccessfully. Ahujas contacts at high places means that he may succeed in escaping exemplary punishment even if his crime were to be proven. No word of praise is enough for his victim. She had the courage to come forward and lodge a complaint against the actor for his misdeed.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Subhayu Saha, Murshidabad

      
	Sir  Spousal compassion is a must for marital bliss. So Anupam Ahujas assertion that her husband, who has been accused of raping a teenage maid, had been framed is understandable (Shineys wife sees frame-up June 18). Anupam seems to be sure that Shiney is not capable of such a crime. Being his wife, she may definitely be the best person to know this. But her conjecture that Shiney cannot commit rape because he is a man who neither smokes or drinks is, at best, risible.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Tapan Pal, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Shiney Ahujas case once again raises certain questions regarding the conduct of the print and electronic media whenever a celebrity is accused of a crime. Anupam Ahuja took this opportunity to defend her husband, who, she thinks has been framed. According to reports in the media, the victims boyfriend had demanded money from the actor, and threatened to tarnish his image in public. But we must remember that the victim is young, poor and helpless. Moreover, such incidents are not exactly unknown in the film industry. The case is now in court and the judiciary will decide on the quantum of punishment.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad 

      
	Sir  It is unfortunate that a successful Hindi-film actor has been accused of raping his maidservant. Such allegations raise a number of questions about a person of such high social standing. Rape is a beastly act that no sane person can commit. If such a crime is not punished severely, it will encourage criminals to commit more such acts. One wonders why there are so many cases of rape even in societies that are mostly liberal about sex. Normally, such incidents are the results of suppressed sexual desires. This explanation is not in support of rapists, but is an attempt to understand the circumstances that lead to such a crime.           
	However, in many instances, women misuse the law against rape. A woman may willingly indulges in sex but accuse the man of raping her to protect her honour or to extract money. Such acts should also be condemned.          
	Yours faithfully,       
M. Kumar, New Delhi

                
	Parting shot          
	Sir  Global warming is an imbalance in nature caused by unplanned growth and development. Carbon dioxide is being released into the atmosphere at a frightening pace, along with other harmful gases. The effects of global warming are too severe to be neglected.           
	The rise in temperature results in a rise in sea levels. Therefore, the probability of frequent and stronger hurricanes destroying low-lying nations cannot be ignored. The people should realize the perils of global warming before it is too late.          
	Yours faithfully,

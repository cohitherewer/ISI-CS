	The US-led global war against terror seems to have changed course and raised the spectre of a full-fledged military confrontation between India and Pakistan. After the Mumbai attack, India is urging for visible and effective action against the perpetrators from Pakistan. However, what appears to have blunted the shrill cries of war against Pakistan on this side of the border is the fact that Pakistan is Americas principal partner in its campaign against terror. After 9/11, the United States of America wanted the world to come on board to protect itself. The first country compelled to join the US bandwagon had to be Pakistan, which is universally acknowledged as the epicentre of global terrorism.         
	After the 1971 debacle, the Pakistan army adopted proxy war as one of its tactic, keeping in mind its plan to promote terror. It outsourced religious soldiers to fight a superior adversary, the Soviet army, in Afghanistan. Thus, without firing a single bullet officially, the Pakistan army, along with the ISI, rendered yeoman service to Americas plan to defeat the Soviets. And after the enemy crumbled like a house of cards, Pakistans army could afford to claim to be one of the chief destroyers of the Red Army.         
	After the Soviet capitulation, the outsourced forces became unemployed as there was no enemy to fight. A job opportunity had to be created, and the Pakistani generals felt that nothing could be better than sending these kalashnikov-wielding men to fight in Kashmir, or for Khalistan in Punjab. To pursue this cause, Pakistans generals built close links with Islamic groups, which, in turn, helped create a vast network of Islamic militants  from Kabul to Kashmir  to fight a proxy war in the interest of Pakistan and its army.                
	Trade tactic        
	Nevertheless, the use of terrorism as an instrument of State policy nearly floundered with the entry of the US-led Nato forces in Afghanistan after 9/11. The depots and routes that were used to supply US-made arms and ammunition as well as food and fodder to the Islamic fighters battling the Red Army are now being used to help the forces that are fighting the Taliban and al Qaida. Today, Pakistans army is faced with the dilemma of battling the groups that it had created.         
	As for the chances of a war between India and Pakistan, they look rather slim. Pakistan would be foolish to go for a conventional war with India in which its defeat is certain. Hence, that country is better off using its expertise and experience to bleed India by resorting to terror strikes like the one in Mumbai.         
	India, on the other hand, is a country with several fault lines and many sub-national movements.The saving grace for India is its burgeoning economy, which influences the lives of millions of people from the neighbouring countries. Hence the best way to deal with a nasty neighbour would be to choke it economically. India could start with an incremental reduction of, approximately, 25 per cent of bilateral trade and wait for three months to see if any improvement takes place or not. In case of a negative result, the quantum could be increased to 50 per cent, and India could wait and watch for developments for three more months. Thereafter, in case there is no improvement, all ties between India and Pakistan  be they trade and commerce, culture, travel or tourism  should be severed.         
	The internal chaos created by the preachers and leaders of an aggressive Pakistan would spell doom for the country. Pakistans survival, so far as India is concerned, will depend on Indias ability to act with probity, integrity, as well as with unity in purpose. For India, the war can be won without firing a bullet, because it is the power of economics that will carry the day forward for a nation that acts in unison.

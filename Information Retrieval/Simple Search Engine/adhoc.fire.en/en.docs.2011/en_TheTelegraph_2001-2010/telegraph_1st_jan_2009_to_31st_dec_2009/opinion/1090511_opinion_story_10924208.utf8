The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | another curtain falls
                                                                                                                 ANOTHER CURTAIN FALLS                                  FIFTH COLUMN - GWYNNE DYER                              
	Most people have trouble finding Moldova on a map, and it isnt getting any easier. A growing number of people are dedicated to making the country vanish from the map  and most of them are Moldovans.        
	It began when about 15,000 people, almost all of them young, came out on the streets in Chisinau, the capital, a month ago, to protest against the outcome of the recent election. They claimed it had been stolen by the Communist party, but that wasnt their only complaint. When the scene turned ugly on April 7, and the crowd stormed both the parliament and the presidents office, many of them were chanting We are Romanians, and carrying Romanian flags.        
	The buildings were looted and partly burned, and the government of Vladimir Voronin arrested hundreds of rioters. It also accused Romania of backing the protesters, expelled its ambassador, and imposed visa requirements for Romanians. In reply, Romanias president, Traian Basescu, declared that he would not tolerate a new Iron Curtain, and changed Romanian law to give Moldovans easy access to Romanian citizenship.         
	Moldova was part of the old Soviet Union, and Russia has already condemned the Romanian action. There are still Russian troops in a breakaway part of Moldova, the so-called Transdnistrian Republic that illegally declared its independence in 1990. Are we heading for another confrontation like the Russian-Georgian one that exploded into war last year, only this time right on the borders of the European Union instead of on the far side of the Black Sea?        
	Probably not, although the situation is both tangled and fraught. For one thing, landlocked Moldova, sandwiched between Romania and Ukraine, has no common border with Russia. For another, the pressure to unite Moldova and Romania comes mainly from within Moldova itself, though most Romanians feel sympathy for it as well.                
	Going gets rough        
	Moldova, also known as Moldavia or Bessarabia, was one of many former Balkan principalities that re-emerged from Turkish rule as the Russian Empire drove the Ottoman Empire south in the course of the 19th century. Most got their independence, including what is now Romania  but Moscow decided to keep Moldova even though it had always been Romanian-speaking. After the Russian Revolution in 1917, Moldova did manage to unite with Romania for a couple of decades, but the Soviet Union took it back as part of the Nazi-Soviet pact of 1939.        
	There was a good deal of deliberate Russification in the following decades, and the narrow, industrialized, densely populated strip east of the Dniester River (Transdnistria) wound up with a two-third majority of Russian and Ukrainian speakers. After the Soviet Union collapsed, they fought a civil war and broke away from Moldova, fearing that the Romanian-speaking majority in the rest of the country would unite with Romania. That didnt happen: the EU isnt interested in expanding that far east, and Romania didnt want to sabotage its own chances of joining. But now Romania is safely in the EU  and things are getting rough in Moldova.        
	The Moldovan government is not a tyranny. It is an elected government that is communist in name only, and the recent election was certified free and fair by observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.         
	The protesters claimed electoral fraud, but the split is really more generational than political, with younger Moldovans believing their future would be brighter as Romanians. The solution is easy: let Moldova west of the Dniester join Romania, leaving the Slavic majority in Transdnistria to become another outlying enclave of Russia. But this is post-Soviet space so nothing is easy and theory doesnt work. This one will run and run.

	In a society where paternalism comes naturally, it is difficult to make people perceive ragging as an adult abuse of power, rather than a juvenile violation of discipline. Colleges, universities and other institutions of higher education often tend to deal with this offence with a combination of protectiveness and suppression that points up their inability to have a clearheaded and adult understanding of what ragging is all about. The Supreme Courts latest anti-ragging norms cut through all this evasive vagueness and proclaim ragging for what it is, a human rights abuse. What the court makes binding on all such institutions is sharp and clear. First, no institution should try to keep such an episode, nowadays often of a violently abusive nature, within the family, as it were, hushing it up as an internal matter or appearing to protect the alleged offenders. They have to be reported to the police, followed by the lodging of a first information report. What this makes culpable is not only the act of ragging itself, but also the institutions inability to deal with it promptly and properly. Other punishments (like the reduction, or even denial, of grants) could be meted out in the latter case. Second, there should be no delay in suspending students who are caught ragging, even if a proper inquiry has not been conducted immediately after the incident. This should, however, not amount to a denial of justice, for the institution should always exercise its discretion and give the alleged offender a chance to have a say in the course of subsequent investigations. So the institution has to play a discerning and proactive role, even if the rulings have had to come from a higher authority (which, in itself, says something about how most institutions have failed to do their proper disciplinary duty).        
	Most Indian campuses are highly politicized spaces, where students and staff are always already placed within factions or embody partisan affiliations. So offences like ragging get taken up into structures of power that are external to the internal hierarchy of an institution that ought to be determined, not by political pressures and compulsions, but by rules and principles of conduct. The courts specifications make it possible to abstract episodes of ragging from such politicized networks of power and deal with them according to clear-cut legal norms.

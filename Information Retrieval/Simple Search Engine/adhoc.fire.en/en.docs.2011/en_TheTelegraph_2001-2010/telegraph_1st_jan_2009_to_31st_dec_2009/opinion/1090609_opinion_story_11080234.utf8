The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | come clean
                                                                                                                 COME CLEAN                                                    
	Indian communists never tire of projecting themselves as holier than others. If a high-ranking comrade is charged with corruption, it has to be a case of political vendetta. It is for the judiciary to decide if Pinarayi Vijayan, secretary of the Kerala unit of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), is guilty of corruption in a Rs 374-crore energy deal with a Canadian firm, signed during his tenure as the states power minister. But the way the party has made it an issue against the states governor, R.S. Gavai, smacks of street-level politics. The only question one could reasonably raise about Mr Gavais decision to sanction Mr Vijayans prosecution is why he had not given his assent to the Central Bureau of Investigation earlier to go ahead with the case. When the Supreme Court ruled to provide for such sanctions in cases involving elected representatives of the people, it had not meant that politicians could use it as a shield against corruption. If Mr Gavai had wanted to use his sanction as a political weapon, he could have given it before the last Lok Sabha polls. That would have embarrassed the CPI(M) and its leaders a lot more than the sanction has done now. The partys ire against the governor would suggest that it is not keen to let the truth of the case come out in the open.        
	It is easy, though, to understand why the party is so upset with Mr Gavais action. The governors sanctioning of Mr Vijayans prosecution comes as an insult to the grievous injury that the CPI(M) suffered in Kerala and Bengal in the just-concluded parliamentary polls. Also, the allegation against Mr Vijayan over this particular case has been at the centre of the turf battle within the Kerala unit of the CPI(M). The bitter and unending feud between him and the states chief minister, V.S. Achuthanandan, has made a mockery of the CPI(M)s claim to being the model of a disciplined party. If the state cabinet had earlier advised the governor against sanctioning Mr Vijayans prosecution, it was clearly done under the pressure of the party. It should be immaterial to the merit of the case if one faction of the party stands to benefit from Mr Vijayans discomfiture. It should also be irrelevant if his prosecution adds to the problems the CPI(M) general secretary, Prakash Karat, has been facing since the last elections. The real mystery about the case is why the party and its leaders are so uneasy about coming clean.

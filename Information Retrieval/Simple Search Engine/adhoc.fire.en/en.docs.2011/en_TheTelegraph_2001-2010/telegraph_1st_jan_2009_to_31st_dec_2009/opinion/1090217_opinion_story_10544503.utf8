	Nothing should be left to chance. If there is anything the Mahinda Rajapakse administration has learnt in the course of its prolonged war with the Tamil Tigers, it is this. The lesson is earning it rich dividends in war and in politics. Although the ruling United Peoples Freedom Alliance, led by Mr Rajapakses Sri Lanka Freedom Party, had been confident that its military successes were enough to secure for it both the Central and Northwestern provinces, it took nothing for granted. While the army notched up major victories one after another, Mr Rajapakse and his men got busy with the electoral campaign in the provinces. The president personally campaigned in many of the places, his administration made sure that a surge in civic facilities diluted popular grievances and a controlled media presented the right picture to the right people. The results of the provincial elections bear indications of this hard work. The UPFA has obtained a clear majority in the Central province and is all set for a similar performance in the Northwestern province when the results there are announced following a repoll in one of its districts.         
	There can be no doubt that the government is using its military victory as its trump card. But it is unlikely that this election, or the ones to follow, would have been such a cakewalk for the UPFA had the opposition put up a fight. The United National Party, given its endorsement of the offensive against the Tigers, could only crib about corruption and government excesses in its lack-lustre campaign  all of which fell flat in the war hysteria sweeping the country. Despite that, the fact that the UNP garnered 38 per cent of the votes cast shows that there are enough chinks in the UPFAs armour to exploit. But neither the UNP nor the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna seems to have much energy to take on the UPFA.

                                                                                                                 UNSTABLE STATE                                                    
	Unstable coalitions being the flavour of the season, Jharkhand can claim to be in the political mainstream. It is thus no surprise that both the United Progressive Alliance and the National Democratic Alliance are in tatters in the state. The UPAs troubles were only to be expected after what had happened to it in neighbouring Bihar. In Jharkhand, though, the fissures have run deeper. Not only have Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan split with the Congress, but there are also problems between the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha and the other UPA partners. Clearly, the regional leaders are keen to extend their spheres of influence. But that can happen only at the expense of the national parties. The troubles within the NDA are somewhat different. The Bharatiya Janata Party faces a revolt within its ranks for supposedly being a little too generous to the Janata Dal (United). The BJPs strategy is an extension of its plan in Bihar where the party expects favours from the JD(U). Surely, the making and unmaking of coalitions will continue in the state even after the Lok Sabha polls.         
	Yet, there are few other states that need political stability more badly than Jharkhand. The Maoist threat to life, property and institutions is far greater in Jharkhand than in the other states. In recent years, the rebels have increasingly used the state as a base for expanding their activity to neighbouring West Bengal, Bihar and Orissa. Worse still, the state has not had a stable and efficient government capable of effectively fighting the Maoists. Also, it is one of the poorest states in the country, where the availability of food, drinking water, primary education and basic healthcare are all far below the national average. Abject poverty, in turn, feeds the Maoist propaganda against democratic institutions. Political instability can only reinforce this vicious cycle.

	Running a government is very different from running a political party. Prakash Karat, general secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), can afford to forget this, but not Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, whose duties and functions as West Bengals chief minister must take precedence over his loyalty to the party. Mr Karat may delude himself by engaging in supposedly ideological battles with the Congress and the government it leads at the Centre. Mr Bhattacharjee, by contrast, has a state to govern and cannot afford to waste his time in political brinkmanship. He has, therefore, done the right thing in moving in step with the Centre in tackling the Maoist threat in West Bengal. Some leaders in the CPI(M) are believed to be hesitant about taking a tough line on the issue. The chief ministers refusal to submit to party sceptics suggests that he is prepared to put governance before politics. If the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, has agreed to continue the anti-Maoist operations by Central forces in Bengal, it is clearly an endorsement of Mr Bhattacharjees strategy. The chief minister has reasons to be satisfied also with the Centres decision to launch similar operations in Jharkhand. The battle against the Maoists should not be reduced to a partisan one aimed at scoring points over political rivals. It is a national issue, and the Centre and the state governments should make a common cause of tackling it together.        
	The same attitude to Centre-state cooperation should help Mr Bhattacharjee in other areas too. His industrialization campaign has been in disarray since the violent opposition to it by his political rivals, especially Mamata Banerjee. Three of Indias biggest corporate firms  Tata Motors, Wipro and Infosys  had to step back from their plans to set up new units in West Bengal. These new units could have substantially changed the economic face of the state; their withdrawal now captures the deepening despair of potential investors. It looked in recent months as if the chief minister too had given up hopes of renewing his industrialization drive. He now says that he is trying to get things back on track. Given the current trend in the states politics, it is no easy task. Mr Bhattacharjees best bet is to get New Delhis support for his industrialization initiative. A friendly Centre can help him do his job better. More important, this is in West Bengals interest.

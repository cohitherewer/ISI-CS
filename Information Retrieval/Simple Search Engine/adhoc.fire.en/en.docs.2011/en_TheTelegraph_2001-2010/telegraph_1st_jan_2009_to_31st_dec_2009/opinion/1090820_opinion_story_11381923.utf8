The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Unresolved questions of life and death
                                                                                                                 UNRESOLVED QUESTIONS OF LIFE AND DEATH                                  Indian debates on abortion are riddled with anxieties about privileging the rights of the child over those of the woman, writes Chirosree Basu                          Right to choose                                  
	Somehow, the Supreme Courts verdict to let a mentally-deranged girl in Chandigarh Nari Niketan keep her pregnancy continues to bother me even a month after it was delivered. It would, of course, be inhuman to suggest that the Punjab administration should have been allowed to abort the child, which the 19-year-old orphan was so looking forward to having as a playmate and who would also be her first blood relation (her counsels words). And yet, the future of the child as bhaiya to its mother, and almost nothing but an entirely forgettable responsibility (like its mother) for the State, causes worry.         
	Why did the woman have to be given her plaything when she was denied that other, more important, ingredient of her life as a mentally-challenged resident of a state-run orphanage  security? Her present condition, after all, is the result of her physical violation by the homes securitymen. Did the guilt of not being able to provide this basic entitlement have anything to do with the state administrations unwillingness to go ahead with the abortion? (It could have done so under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act without asking for judicial opinion, given its role as guardian of a rape victim.) Did sentiment bring about the coalescing of opinions  of civil society and the judiciary  in favour of this deprived girl?        
	It seems I am not the only one uncomfortable with the judgment. M. Jeeva, a core member of the Campaign Against Sex Selective Abortion in Tamil Nadu, believes that the matter should not have reached the court and the state administrations abdication of its responsibility to abort the child born out of rape was unfair on the woman. This is because the woman was conscious neither of her sexual violation nor of the resultant pregnancy. Besides, What about child rights? he asks, pointing to the unfavourable environment that the child would be born and brought up in.              
	I suddenly realize that Jeevas argument could be flying in the face of all that he is campaigning against. His organization, Cassa, has been running its programme against sex-selective abortions for years now. The right of the female child to be born, no matter how unfavourable the environment, lies at the root of the campaign that has been trying to expose how infanticide  more importantly, sex-selective abortion  is reducing the male-female ratio in the districts of Tamil Nadu. Why then should he champion the right of the female child to be born but not that of the child of the mentally-retarded woman?        
	The crux of the matter is consent. Both the MTP Act and the Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (Prohibition of Sex Selection) Act and Rules decree that abortion cannot take place without the consent of the woman. In the case of the Chandigarh orphan, Jeeva says, it was hardly there, given the fact that she is not wholly aware of her condition. Consent, borne out of choice, is almost invariably there in case of women undergoing sex-selective abortions. This consent/ choice may be dictated by social conditions and it may not be free  but that is another matter. Organizations like Cassa try to dissuade women from choosing the sex of their child so as to break the nexus between the medical fraternity and the law-enforcers to prevent maternal mortality. Jeeva categorically mentions that he (and his organization) is pro-abortion, that is pro-choice, but not when such choice is in favour of killing the female foetus.        
	Jeeva, in fact, states the government policy, which, feminists repeatedly point out, is motivated more by its population-control prerogative than by womens right per se. The MTP Act allows women the right to abort if the pregnancy is the result of the failure of contraception, if the pregnancy occurs as the result of sexual violence, if the pregnancy is a severe threat to the physical and mental health of the mother, or if there is reason to suspect the child, if born, will suffer from disease and deformity. But the choice is limited to the first 20 weeks of the pregnancy and it cannot be exercised if the intention is to abort a baby only because it is of a particular sex. Abortion is allowed after this period only if the continuation of the pregnancy threatens the life of the mother. However, only qualified medical professionals are allowed to decide if there is enough threat to the life of the mother. Women have no choice in this matter.        
	It is this lack of choice after the 20-week stipulation that angers Dr Nikhil Datar. Datar is now a household name after his pioneering effort at supporting Niketa Mehta, who in the 24th week of her pregnancy, challenged the law that came in the way of her decision to abort her child. The latter, doctors had diagnosed, would have had severe cardiac ailments if born. The Mehtas plea, struck down by the Bombay High Court last year, had led to the establishment of a commission to look into the case. Datar has himself filed a lawsuit with the Supreme Court on the matter.        
	The apex courts decision on the mentally-retarded girl in Chandigarh elates Datar. Although disparaging of the Punjab administrations decision to go to court, he finds the judgment revolutionary, since it acknowledges that even a mentally-retarded person has the capacity to (give) consent. He feels that the judgment is pro-choice. And that is exactly what he is fighting for.        
	The central tenet of Datars argument is that abortions should be allowed in cases of severe abnormalities detected in the foetus after the 20-week limit, which he says is arbitrary. It is arbitrary not only because it is no longer as dangerous to abort after this time-limit as it was before (as in 1971, when the MTP was legislated), but also because of a contradiction in policy. Datar says that Indias laws allow women the right to abort in case of abnormalities within the 20-week period  this shows that there are no moral hang-ups on the issue and definitely no overarching pro-life disposition. Yet, this right is suddenly, and quite arbitrarily, withdrawn after the 20-week gestation. Unfortunately, it is only after the 20-week period, say around 22-26 weeks, that a diagnosis of any abnormality can be confirmed. The aim behind Datars dogged pursuit to change the law is to empower women to make choices.               
	Datar, however, draws what he calls a lakshman rekha when it comes to pre-conception or pre-natal sex selection or the attempt to create designer babies. But he is not willing to curtail the choice of abortion after the 20-week limit only because people like Jeeva insist that it would undo all efforts to prevent sex-selection abortions. Sex-selection, Datar argues, is done long before 20 weeks, now that technology makes this possible even within 12-15 weeks, and women who choose to go through the process do not wait for their pregnancy to show before making that choice.        
	The debate on the amendment of the MTP Act on these grounds has been acrimonious between the Jeevas and the Datars. But both sides seem to be talking and arguing on behalf of women inhabiting two different worlds.         
	In the rural areas, and towns of Salem, Dharmapuri, Namakkal, Theni and Madurai districts, where Jeeva often travels, and which have a juvenile sex-ratio hovering in and around 900, the scan centres that help women decide on their pregnancy still have low-resolution monitors and not always trans-vaginal attachments that can confirm the sex of the foetus before the 20th week of pregnancy. A large number of women may go for their first check-ups in the first trimester, but only a handful go after 20 weeks, when abnormalities can be confirmed. In any case, imprisonment on charges of infanticide, which leaves the surviving children in the lurch, have taught women that abortion of the female foetus (invariably the second, third or fourth in birth order) is a better choice  even in the third trimester than the messy killing of a girl child after she is born. It is apparent that the birth of a girl child is perceived as a greater evil than the birth of an abnormal child.        
	Would the extension of the 20-week limit give a freer choice to the women in the world Jeeva frequents? Unlikely. Since it would still be illegal for them to abort a healthy female foetus, they would continue to go to quacks or retired nurses, if they need to, in their third trimester. What could make the job for Jeeva and Cassa more difficult is that the nexus between medicos and bureaucrats/law-enforcers could now increase the frequency of third-trimester operations by passing them off as legally permissible interventions to forestall the birth of abnormal children.         
	And how would a change in the MTP Act affect the women of the world Datar works with? It would give them legal access to a form of medical treatment that is now available only in the backstreet. But would it empower them, as Datar insists it would?        
	In her book, Recovering Subversion, Nivedita Menon points out that the sanction for aborting abnormal fetuses implicitly means we are accepting a hierarchy of human beings based on certain physical traits and capabilities. If that is acceptable, then it would appear natural to deny the right of birth to those considered inferior in this hierarchy, and that could include women as also people of other categories. There is another problem. The choice to abort abnormal fetuses may free women of the image of selfless maternity, but they may feel like an agent of quality control on the reproductive production line (as the social activist, Rayna Rapp, puts it). Above all, women will remain under the control of the medical technocracy. Datars idea of a national registry of abnormal fetuses and more specialized medical monitoring of this category of patients definitely adds to this fear.              
	It is obvious that both Jeeva and Datar have problem spots in their logic that they are not willing to confront. Jeeva is infuriated by Datars idea of the extension of the 20-week limit on eugenic grounds because he believes disabled children too have the right to be born. Yet, he does not question the fact that till the 20th week, the MTP Act actually allows abortions precisely on these grounds. How does his pro-life argument fit in with his pro-abortion (but limited choice) viewpoint?        
	On his part, Datar fails to realize that the zeal to increase the reach of science, and facilitate womens access to it, is not really amenable to lakshman rekhas. As Menon would argue, pro-choice is not always pro-woman. And as Chandigarhs unique case shows, pro-life is not always pro-child or pro-woman.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Absence of imagination
                                                                                                                 ABSENCE OF IMAGINATION                              VISUAL ARTS      Soumitra Das                                               
	There was a time, some decades ago, when art lovers from all walks of life used to look forward to the annual exhibition at the Academy of Fine Arts in which leading artists from all over the country used to participate. This was long before the commercialization of art, and artists strove to show their best because there was no hope of financial gain. What mattered most was the appreciation of viewers.         
	The art world has undergone a sea change and the annual exhibition at the Birla Academy of Art amp; Culture (Jan 09 -Feb 01) is a big thing these days, if only in size (485 exhibits).Well-known artists from Calcutta and Santiniketan and also from other states did take part in it, but that did not have any effect on the quality of the exhibits, most of which were dross. Truth to tell, it was such a huge exhibition, covering almost every inch of wall space on four floors of the building, that it was well nigh impossible to fill up all that space with high quality art.         
	Not only quality, but display also took a beating. The paintings were so close to each other that the viewer got confused easily. The labels identifying the artists were awkwardly placed, and in one installation it was fixed on the work itself. This goes against all rules of exhibition. It would be impossible to even make a mention of some of the better exhibits, but the award-winning entries could throw light on the yardstick of the judges. Amlan Duttas Evolution of Time, which won the award for painting, was in the photo-realist style. The rotary telephone sets strewn across a waste of sand were no more than that  it did not carry the work any further than the artists far-from-awesome skills. Anupam Das won an award in the same category. He had painted a nightmarish mask in a rectangle hemmed in by smaller squares, showing miniature cartoon-like figures. This was, at least, somewhat more intriguing than Duttas entry.         
	Harjit Sahas Nilachal  depicting Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and painted in a traditional style  displayed no exceptional talent. Bengal artists, any way, are known for their skill-based art, the skill often being an end in itself. Avijit Mukherjees drawing of instruments in everyday use and vegetables in a spare style showed some spark of imagination that was lacking in most entries. Finally, Manjushri Chakrabortys ceramic sculpture of a buxom nude lying on her back with her legs in the air, as if in the throes of ecstasy (picture), had a strong physicality. Everything, from the womans thick limbs to her glazed skin, exuded unbridled sexuality, which was like a whiff of fresh air in this very staid, overlarge show.

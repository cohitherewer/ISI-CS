The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | After the war
                                                                                                                 AFTER THE WAR                                                    
	It would have been impossible to bring the war in Sri Lanka to a closure without a final announcement about the fate of the Tigers topmost leadership, particularly of Velupillai Prabhakaran. Total victory could come only after the total rout of the enemy. The remaining days of the war, fought judiciously after a no-less significant electoral battle had concluded decisively in a distant coast, have thus produced a rich haul of dead men, including the feared leader. However, as the Sri Lanka government must be painfully aware, it will take more than an announcement to indisputably kill Prabhakaran. Not surprisingly, the governments claim about his death was almost immediately contested by the international media cell of the Tigers, and it will remain contested irrespective of the evidence. Whatever the actual fate of Prabhakaran, there is little doubt that the armed offensive of the government has successfully managed to liquidate the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam as a military force and reclaim all territory from the Tigers. This is a singular achievement, unparalleled within the country and in many parts of the world which have witnessed insurgencies of the same intensity as Sri Lankas. Although the twin objectives of the military offensive have been accomplished, the war cannot become an end in itself. There is before the Sri Lanka government the stupendous task of rehabilitation and reconstruction, and together with it, the more onerous responsibility of bridging the psychological chasm between two peoples that the victory is likely to deepen.         
	The immediate work will have to start at the refugee camps where hundreds of thousands of the homeless are housed, cut off from the rest of the world and without any contact with their near and dear ones. Their resettlement in the north, and not their alienation, should be the target of the government, which will have to fight hard against its post-war phobia of sifting the displaced for remnants of the LTTE. What it will also have to keep in mind is that the years of discrimination and Sinhala supremacist policies created the Tigers and allowed them to preserve their sway over a helpless population. The end of the war, in fact, should be regarded as a starting point from which the governments battle begins for reclaiming the minds and hearts of the Tamil people from the lingering shadow of the Tigers.

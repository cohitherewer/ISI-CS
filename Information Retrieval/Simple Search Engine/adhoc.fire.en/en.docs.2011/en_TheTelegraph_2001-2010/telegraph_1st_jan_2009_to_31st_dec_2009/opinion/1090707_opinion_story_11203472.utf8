Desai                          While they look on                                        
	For someone whom Euromoney designated the worlds best finance minister in 1984, one more budget would be a cakewalk. And in a sense, Pranab Mukherjee could not have chosen a better year. The elections are over, and with them the need to spend lakhs of crores buying votes. According to his figures, the three stimulus packages of the past year cost 3.5 per cent of national income, and took the fiscal deficit to 6.5 per cent. Whilst national income rose 12 per cent in nominal terms, Central government expenditure rose 36 per cent. The share of citizens consumption in additional expenditure during the year was 27 per cent; governments share was 32 per cent. And all that expenditure just disappeared into unknown pockets, leaving no trace.        
	But now, the elections are won, and the Opposition is prostrated. Mukherjee must have noticed that he was interrupted only once; it was late in his speech, by the Yadav pair, Mulayam and Lalu. The depleted ranks of the Bharatiya Janata Party listened to him in silence, as did his erstwhile friends, the Communists. With the political battles behind him, Mukherjee should have faced less importunate demands for political favours.        
	In another sense, however, it was a difficult year to make a budget for. Last year, Mukherjees predecessor, P. Chidambaram, had boasted of 12 uninterrupted quarters of over 8 per cent growth, and looked forward to ever higher growth in future. Mukherjee faced a fall in growth to 6.7 per cent last year and 5.8 per cent in the last two quarters. Being a good minister, he had to accept his economists word that the slump would be brief and that the economy would be roaring before the end of the year. But he could not ignore the fact that manufacturing growth has collapsed, and that imports and exports have fallen in absolute terms. He had to stimulate the economy. But with a bulging fiscal deficit, he could not continue to spend his way out of recession. In the past year, he had increased revenue expenditure by 35 per cent, and actually reduced capital expenditure. Being back in power for another five years with no political competition in sight, he did not need to continue to take such a short-sighted view.        
	He has promised to return to the path of rectitude  but not yet. He proposes to increase revenue expenditure by a quarter, whereas his revenue receipts are expected to go up only 9 per cent. He expects to raise fiscal deficit from 6.5 to 6.8 per cent of GDP. That is improvident. But most of the revenue expenditure is on interest, subsidies and defence. The budget abolishes the provision for special securities that the government issues to fertilizer companies, and reduces the provision for securities to oil marketing companies from Rs 75,000 to Rs 100,000 crore. So subsidy reductions seem to be in the offing. That is laudable. But in general, Mukherjee continues to walk in his disastrous predecessors footsteps, to pile on more debt and to fetter his successors freedom of manoeuvre. Every year we read the finance ministers words and comment on his myriad little alterations. But we never count the cost of the short-sighted government of which he is a star performer. The budget could be a crucial source of finance for nation-building investments. It could be used to secure the country against the dangers arising from international financial instability. It could dismantle the complexities Chidambaram introduced and make taxpayers lives easy. It could give them relief in a difficult economic climate. Such are the opportunities missed once more this year.        
	While a major simplification must await another year, Mukherjee did correct some major mistakes of his predecessors. He abolished the fringe benefits tax, Chidambarams ill-conceived invention which introduced quite unnecessary complications into corporate managers lives. He also abolished Chidambarams 10 per cent surcharge on personal income tax, though for no reason he decided to continue with the surcharge on corporate profits. He got rid of the commodities transactions tax. These are all laudable measures. But perhaps the most radical change is to base corporate exemptions on investment rather than on profits. Profit-linked exemptions were available only to profitable companies, whereas it was often loss-making companies that needed relief most. Now, if they invest for the future, companies will earn exemptions.        
	However, confining exemptions to a few chosen industries will be seen as pork-barrel politics. For instance, inclusion of gas pipelines could be a favour to Reliance Industries, as also the extension of the tax exemption under Section 80-I(B)9 from oil to natural gas. The budget is replete with such changes, which reek of special favours  for instance, abolition of duty on unworked corals, or on just five additional items importable by sports goods manufacturers. Considerations of special favour have never deterred finance ministers from giving tax concessions. But they create demands for more concessions, and complicate the direct tax system at every step. They also give tax authorities fresh opportunities to contest classification of items, and create lucrative sources of bribes. Successive finance ministers have given so many concessions that even the revenue departments do not know how many there are. A future finance minister will, I hope, make a bonfire of them. It is not only concessions that are marketable; higher duties also earn fortunes. For instance, the finance minister has raised import duty on gold and silver; this will make smugglers happy. There was a time when Haji Dawood was their king; presumably, this concession is meant for some new beneficiaries, although he will not hesitate to exploit it.        
	The BJP governments brought down customs duties to extremely low levels; now there are many items that bear import duties of 5 to 15 per cent. Mukherjee has played around with many of them, reducing most by 2.5 per cent. These low duties may give a finance minister much room for political games. But they raise little revenue; their wholesale abolition would simplify their victims lives.        
	Generally speaking, government enterprises get favoured treatment from Congress finance ministers, being the treasured relics of its socialist past. So it was a pleasant surprise to see Mukherjee abolish a concession to Indian railways, and to make them subject to service tax. Lalu Prasad will think that this is the unjust reward the railways got because he made them profitable; but they can afford to pay the tax.              
	I have avoided comment on Mukherjees expenditure proposals because the pork-barrel politics that goes into them would be too monotonous to describe. But the monitoring and reporting systems set up for the national rural employment guarantee programme do create some assurance that the money spent is creating employment and accomplishing public works. The government has apparently decided to give the same money wage to NREG workers all over the country. That, in my view, is a mistake; the wage should be related to the local market wages. The government should aim to achieve full employment; but it should not raise market wages without thinking of the consequences for agricultural production and inflation. But overall, NREGP works well; I wish other programmes of the government were equally transparent.

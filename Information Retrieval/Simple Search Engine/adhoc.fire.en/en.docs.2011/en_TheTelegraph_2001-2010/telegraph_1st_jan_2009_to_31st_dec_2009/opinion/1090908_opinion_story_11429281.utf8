	Father figures                  
	Sir  Ramachandra Guha in his article, The calling game (Aug 29), rightly criticizes the tendency of governments to name public utilities and welfare schemes after the scions of the Nehru-Gandhi family. It is true that the naming of airports, stadia or streets after political personages is a common enough practice in India. But is this also not a worldwide phenomenon? Pariss international airport is named after ex-president, Charles de Gaulle, and New York Citys Idlewild airport has been renamed John F. Kennedy International Airport. This apart, there are innumerable streets all over the United States of America named after George Washington. There is even a whole state that gets its name from him.          
	However, the communists can be called the masters of this name game. They often change names of whole cities  for instance, the city of Volgograd was renamed Stalingrad, St Petersburg became Leningrad, and Saigon became Ho Chi Minh City. The Marxists of West Bengal have preferred foreign comrades to national heroes. So we come across Karl Marx Sarani, Ho Chi Minh Sarani and Lenin Sarani in Calcutta. It is good that the main cities of India have been renamed not after political demigods but on the basis of history. So Bombay became Mumbai, Calcutta Kolkata, Madras Chennai, and so on.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The naming of places and schemes after political leaders undoubtedly has more to do with the personal interests of individuals and political parties than with reverence. While they indiscriminately use the names of political figures for government programmes and suchlike, apolitical cultural icons, who are the conscience keepers and pillars of our civil society, are largely ignored. Perhaps we, the common people, are also a party to this practice. We admire the heroes who have stridently fought for various causes. So we justifiably have memorials for the unknown soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the country. But do we care to honour the anonymous workers, for instance, of the oilfield, Mumbai High, or of the Delhi Metro who were recently crushed to death? Like soldiers, these are also men who die on a daily basis for the cause of nation-building. No wonder we have countless Shiva temples, but only one for the creator-god, Brahma, at Pushkar.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  It seems that in modern politics, party leaders do not like to be popular in their lifetime. After they pass away, their followers pay them tribute by recalling their deeds and naming streets, stadia or railway stations after them. The name of a national icon such as Lal Bahadur Shastri has been immortalized in the slogan, Jai jawan, jai kishan, and many other such dedicated souls are likewise remembered. However, given the fact that India is famous for its democratic credentials, it is strange that we hardly have monuments named after local celebrities or, at least, after non-political people. Instead, the names of schemes and bodies for public welfare bear the testimony of political power  as the Rajiv Gandhi Sewa Kendras indicate.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Himanish, Durgapur 

                
	Teething trouble          
	Sir  The Metro Railway of Calcutta has been extended to benefit more passengers, and this is good news. But the plan hardly takes into account the constraints and capacities of the existing infrastructure. As a regular passenger of the Metro, I now see a sea change in the comfort level of Metro travel, especially during office hours. It is not that we should always get a seat, but at least we should be comfortable while standing. The current overload in the Metro results in suffocation, doors refusing to get closed, passengers sniffing at one another, making sarcastic remarks like, Uttam Kumar should be named as Bongaon, and so on. And these commuters are not wrong. They deserve to be treated with minimum decency while travelling.          
	The other day, a passenger had difficulty in breathing but could not get off as the door was closed, the way out was tightly blocked and the train had stopped running because of some signalling problem. If this state of affairs continues, it is will cause some miserable deaths in the near future. The railways ministry should have carefully considered the realities before extending the Metro. That way, it could have avoided much discomfort. Politically influenced decisions in the running of such public services ultimately causes damage to society.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Dipankar Sen Gupta, Calcutta

                
	Sir  After the new Metro stations till Garia Bazaar came into being, passengers assembled at the ticket counters are frequently heard calling out One Uttam Kumar please (Ekta Uttam Kumar dekhi), Two Surya Sens, and so on. At first, such requests may sound comical but to a sensitive ear, it is like standing in a supermarket where these stalwarts of Bengal have been put on sale. When one says, One Uttam Kumar please, it sounds as if that person is wanting to buy a commodity called Uttam Kumar. The railway authorities might have thought that they are honouring these icons by naming the stations after them, but in reality their strategy is only serving the purpose of mocking the contributions of the great men.          
	Besides, the chief purpose behind naming is not to honour but to highlight the particulars of the object through a short expression. It is true that sometimes names come attached with special sentiments but when naming something like a railway station, I think sentiments should be put aside for higher good.           
	Railway stations should be named after their locations so that even a new passenger can, at first glance, know where they are situated. The much-hyped naming scheme does not satisfy this basic criterion of successful naming. Not only the Metro, but also the ordinary railways have been the victim of some such ill-considered names. In the Panskura Junction to Haldia rail corridor, one station has the name, Saheed Matangini Hajra. In the Tamluk to Digha route, there are three railway stations tagged Laban Satyagraha Smarak, Nandakumar and Deshapran. Why give useless names?                    
	Yours faithfully,

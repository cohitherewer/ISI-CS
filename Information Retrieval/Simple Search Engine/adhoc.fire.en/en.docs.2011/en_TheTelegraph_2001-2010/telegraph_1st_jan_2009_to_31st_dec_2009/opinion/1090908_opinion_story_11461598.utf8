                                                                                                                 HANDS OFF                                                    
	The increasing clout of the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha in the Darjeeling hills reflects poorly on the administrative machinery in West Bengal. While the demand for separate statehood lies in limbo, the hills continue to function more or less as any autonomous region, thanks to the brazenness of the GJM. Since the Gorkhaland agitation got a fresh lease of life under Bimal Gurung, the GJM has sprung quite a few surprises on the local population. From stalling daily life on the hills with sporadic bandhs to blackening the faces of the Gorkha people for not wearing the traditional dress, the GJM has left behind an anarchic trail. It is no surprise, therefore, that the latest disturbance in Darjeeling has been the work of the Gorkhaland personnel, an outfit formed out of the supporters of GJM to act as troubleshooters during rallies. Sadly, now the GLP has become a source of trouble itself.        
	After placing a ban on smoking in the Mall and an embargo on the supply of alcohol as well as the sale of gutka, the GLP moved on to moral policing last week. The latest victim of its surveillance is a young couple, pulled up for holding hands. Ironically, the GLP had miscalculated its moves with this one, as the enraged duo turned out to be married to each other  but that is beside the point. It is of utmost concern that Bengal, so long a safe haven from cultural fundamentalists like the Ram Sena or the Shiv Sena, is becoming prone to hooliganism of this sort. And the state government is no less to blame for this than the GLP. Had the former dealt with political delinquents with an iron hand ever since trouble started brewing in the hills, things would probably not have come to this pass. The only ray of hope in this sordid episode is the active public anger shown against the GLP for meddling in the lives of the citizens. If the GJM has any sense left, it ought to reflect on this censure and mend its disruptive ways.

	Its been a little over a month since the war ended in Sri Lanka. But the country still seems to be in the grip of the euphoria that followed the hard-earned victory. India, on its part, is trying its best to break this euphoria. This is evident from a terse reminder from the Union home minister, P. Chidambaram, that Sri Lanka was not doing enough for the rehabilitation of its internally displaced people. The comment  Indias first expression of dissatisfaction after the fighting ended in the islands north  coincides with the furore raised by politicians in south India. The All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam recently staged a walkout from the Tamil Nadu state assembly after its demand for a resolution that Sri Lanka be taken to the International Criminal Court for human rights violations was not met. But even without this trigger, there would have been reasons to point out Sri Lankas lack of initiative. Apparently, the country is still to work out an action plan for rapid rehabilitation. Strangely, though, local council elections for Jaffna and Vavuniya have already been announced and nominations are being filed, reportedly, by candidates of the Tamil parties.         
	Indias reminder will not be taken kindly by Sri Lanka, which has sizzled every time it has been reminded of its duty towards its people. There is no doubt, however, that Sri Lanka has made conciliatory gestures to India of late and has even agreed, on Indias request, to allow entry to a ship loaded with aid from the Tamil diaspora. But it is unlikely to let India dictate terms. India has repeatedly, even during this months visit by Sri Lankan dignitaries, made its interests clear. It wants resettlement, facilities created for students to resume studies and medical care to reach people who need it. To facilitate these, India has given a Rs 500 crore loan, has taken an active role in providing educational assistance (footing the bill for the establishment of a university faculty for Tamil alternative medicine in Trincomalee) and sent medical assistance. Reportedly, the loan still lies unutilized. It is also likely that Indias assistance with rehabilitation in the north, as in the east, will be suspected as its attempt to wrest back political control. Given the encouragement from China and other nations like Iran, Libya and Pakistan, Sri Lanka may drag its feet on rehabilitation and political settlement in the north. But it will do so at its own peril.

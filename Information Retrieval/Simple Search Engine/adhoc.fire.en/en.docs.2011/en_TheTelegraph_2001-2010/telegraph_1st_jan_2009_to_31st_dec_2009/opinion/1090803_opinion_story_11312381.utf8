The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | changing city
                                                                                                                 CHANGING CITY                                                    
	To breathe palpably cleaner air on a day that is not a bandh is a rare privilege for Calcuttans. It is, indeed, a measure of the citys decline that breathing clean air should be mentioned as a privilege, when Calcuttans deserve to be able to breathe healthily without having to feel beholden to the government, the courts and the police. The levels of hydrocarbons, particulate matter, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide have never been this low in the city in the last couple of decades, and oxygen levels reassuringly high. The roads are also noticeably less congested. Yet, the more-or-less effective, though far from perfect, enforcement of the high court ban on commercial vehicles more than 15 years old has made commuting within the city considerably more difficult than before. The many vehicles that have stayed off the roads, and would hopefully continue to do so, have not been replaced adequately. There has also been no planning at all to ease the citys long-overdue rite of passage into respiratory salvation.        
	This is inevitable. There is no way that such a major change in a citys deeply entrenched systems and habits can be effected without it being somehow a difficult and painful process. This is not to say that nothing can be done to make it less difficult. But all stakeholders in public transport must keep the end in sight and try to bear with the means. Practical and progressive thinking, unhindered by pseudo-political passion and habitual inertia, is the only way to make this transition worth it for everybody. From vehicle-owners and drivers to the concerned government departments, LPG providers and banks must get their act together. What should unite everybody is the absolute necessity of the change, and the realization that by enforcing it, the courts are in no way being gratuitously punitive or anti-people. The sooner everybody, from ordinary commuters to the heads of the government and the police, falls in line with this vision of what all human beings are entitled to, the easier it will be to get a new system working.

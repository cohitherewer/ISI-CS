	Specially reduced prices offered by British and American publishers exclusively for the Indian market now are almost half of those demanded for their own markets. For instance, J.K. Galbraiths The Great Crash, 1929 is available here for Rs 399 against the published price of 9.99 in the United Kingdom  which is about Rs 800 at the current rate of exchange .        
	When publishers can offer the book at half its published price, do they make an exorbitant profit when they sell it at the published price? What is their pricing formula that allows them to offer such competitive prices? Here are the ground rules of the game that will help you figure out whether they are winners or losers.        
	First, all special offers are made before the book is published. The Indian distributor has to pitch in his demand before production starts so that the publisher has simply to add on the extra cost of paper and binding; the other fixed costs are absorbed by the publisher to make his quote more competitive. What this means is that the unit cost, without taking the fixed costs into account, works out to be pretty low for the Indian distributor.        
	Second, special prices with exclusive distribution rights are offered only when a minimum quantity is ordered; it is not given for single or even multiple copies of the book. Keeping the economies of scale in mind, the higher the quantity, the lower unit cost, and vice versa.         
	This exercise is not as simple as it sounds because often the only information that the distributors have is the publicity material, which says little about the books scope. So, what the distributor has to go by is a hunch based on his years of experience.         
	Third, special deals do not provide the facility of returning unsold copies that is available for normal trade deals. Goods once sold cannot be returned  which means that the distributor has to make sure that the entire stock is sold in the domestic market: not a single copy can be exported under the terms of the contract.        
	Lastly, since such deals are one-off arrangements, there are no credit facilities. For the Indian distributor who relies heavily on credit and returns, these terms are pretty hard. He has to fall back on his own resources. In spite of these limitations, more and more special Indian price deals are being struck because the returns can be pretty lucrative.         
	Indian pricing formula is simple: the unit cost multiplied five or six times. That is, if the landed cost is Rs 10, the price is fixed at Rs 50-Rs 60. This allows the distributor to offer up to 50 per cent discount to the retail trader which leaves him with Rs 30-Rs 40. Take away Rs 10 for the unit cost and a little for handling costs; the distributor is still left with a handsome profit. Which explains why more and more special low-priced books are coming into the market. In any case, we cannot afford the published prices for British or American books. Its a win-win deal for both sides.

                                                                                                                 HIGHER GROUND                                                    
	Before being judged by a court of law and by the people of his state, the chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir, Omar Abdullah, has judged himself and found himself guilty till proved innocent. This is the summary of his stature that he gave to the state governor while tendering his conditional resignation, which he wants the governor to accept if his guilt is proven by law. The guilt that prompted Mr Abdullah to take this unprecedented step is not the one being levelled against him by the Opposition  his involvement in the 2006 sex scandal, which is yet to be proved. It is his realization, and admission, of the fact that any public figure who has the finger of suspicion pointed at him, loses the moral right to hold public office. Mr Abdullah might be a political novice, but his grasp of this uncelebrated political wisdom indicates a maturity that is found lacking in many a veteran politician. The chief ministers stand has suddenly shifted the ground on which politics has been, and is being, played in his home state. The Peoples Democratic Party, since it pulled down the previous government and lost to the National Conference at the hustings, has been playing a dubious game over the Shopian tragedy by exploiting Mr Abdullahs political inexperience to the hilt. Mr Abdullahs reaction to the charges in the assembly  unrehearsed, yet not quite intemperate, coming as it did after a series of trying circumstances  has somehow rescued both his image and the soul of politics. His emphasis on honour and self-respect as qualities without which no public figure could hold office will be worrisome for politicians.        
	However, there are issues which the chief ministers heightened sense of morality should not inure him to. Mr Abdullah came to office with a lot of goodwill. He has squandered a lot of it by his foolhardy actions in order to match the political pitch set by the Opposition. His government is yet to deliver on the promise of good administration. Public institutions have to be strengthened, human-rights issues handled more effectively and transparently, the guilty (such as those in the 2006 scandal) brought to justice, and the problem of Kashmirs position vis--vis the Indian nation has to be addressed. The Opposition is making the most of these shortcomings. Mr Abdullahs morality play cannot be sustained if he stays away from work, and from these problems, for too long.

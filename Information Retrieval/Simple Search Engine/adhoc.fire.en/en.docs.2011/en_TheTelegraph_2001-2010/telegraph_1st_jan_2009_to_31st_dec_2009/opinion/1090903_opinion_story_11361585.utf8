The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Rafts upon a shadowy underworld
                                                                                                                 RAFTS UPON A SHADOWY UNDERWORLD                                  The most elusive fancies are those that are curled around the images of the family dining table, a pair of shoes and the humble umbrella                                            
	So much of civility is about slicing the body into two. Clothes do this in an obvious way, but some furniture do it more interestingly. The neatest body-slicer is the table, especially the dining table. As you lean forward to eat and talk, your polite self gets cut off just below the breasts. So those parts of the body connected with digestion remain discreetly out of sight. A civilized meal is often one in which the balance between eating and talking is maintained by the mouth and fingers so effortlessly that those at table could keep up the pretence of ignoring the food altogether. Such meals are a triumph of the higher over the lower functions of eating  Jane Austen winning over Rabelais.        
	In the dining room, it is always supposed to be sweetness and light above board. This is a world of mats and coasters and crockery, of conversation and its unspoken rules. But it floats like a raft upon a shadowy underworld, a wilderness of legs  table legs, chair legs, human legs. The best view of this world is that of the cat. This is rather a waste because a cat is interested in nothing other than what it gets to eat. It is entirely indifferent to what the legs and feet might be up to among the shadows. The upper-lower divide at table reminds me of a sauna, where you notice people sitting forever in breast-high water in the jacuzzi. Their impassive faces do not betray even a hint of the feverish explorations going on underwater. They are Roman emperors above the water, but satyrs below.         
	Playing old rules against new differences, the dining table both includes and excludes, gathering people around itself, yet setting them apart too. Even in liberal Indian homes, where servants wear slippers and their children go to school, their eating at table with the family remains as much of a taboo as, say, somebody in the family marrying one of them. To insist that they sit with us to eat causes so much distress in them  more acute and deep-rooted than embarrassment  that to insist seems more oppressive and unequal than letting them continue eating on the floor.        
	Even when your seat at table no longer indicates your status in the family, it somehow becomes part of who you are, and where you are, in the existing structure of things. When my mother was in hospital and I sat in her chair to eat with my father, I became my mother in a way that I found inexpressibly disconcerting  but less so than leaving her place empty. The same thing happens when my father is not eating with us for some reason. In spite of being one of the most un-patriarch-like people I know, he always eats at the head of our oval dining table. But to sit in his place and eat with my mother when he is away feels a bit like a dreaded succession, a vaguely scary reduction of ones identity to the purely filial. I imagine this is how Shakespeares Prince Hal felt, on a grander scale, when he found himself trying on his fathers crown at the sleeping kings bedside.        
	In our family albums, up to the time of my early birthdays more than two decades ago, the special feasts with the extended family and friends are all being eaten on the floor. The dining table was meant only for the elderly and infirm. But in the older photographs of my mothers childhood in Dhaka, from the early Forties, the women and children are having their ordinary meals, especially lunch, on the floor, while the dining table is for the men, with the children sometimes joining them up there for dinner. Perhaps it all goes back to a time when there was a different relationship between people and the food they ate. The food was grown, gathered and made with ones own hands, usually on ones own land. So one sat close to this land when one cooked and ate. It was a way of being grounded, brought down to earth, through food  like having to sit down on ones haunches in order to defecate, until civilization came up with a higher perch.        
	Perhaps the earth tries to keep us close to itself, against the rise of civilization. But dining tables  the paraphernalia of a proper meal  would never work without the downward pull of gravity. Imagine trying to have a banquet on the moon.

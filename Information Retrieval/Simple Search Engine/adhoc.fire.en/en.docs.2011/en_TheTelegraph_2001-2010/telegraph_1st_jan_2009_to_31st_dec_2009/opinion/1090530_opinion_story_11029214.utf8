	Loose tongue                  
	Sir When public figures start using inflammable language, it is a matter of concern. Leaders like George Fernandes and Datta Samant were known for their fiery speeches and the government dealt with them as best as it could in those days. However, over the past three years, some former legislators have started asking people to take the law in their own hands if the government did not accede to their demands. The media have done their duty by reporting such speeches, but the executive has failed by not taking legal action.

	Sir  Swapan Dasgupta in his article, Ask them no questions (May 1), has deftly highlighted the age-old Indian tradition of hero-worship. The phenomenon is not just confined to films and sports but has also gone on to create scores of so-called godmen and great leaders, the champions of humanity. This goes for captains of industry and of the State as well.          
	The mass layoff at Infosys on ground of non-performance puts into question the much-publicized ideal of compassionate capitalism championed by N.R. Narayana Murthy. The obvious truth is that these organizations are business houses: they are out to make money rather than to uphold humanitarian or charitable concerns, a truth they would prefer to keep under wraps. The media have obliged by deciding not to rake up these issues and Narayana Murthys image remains unblemished.          
	Our economist prime-minister undoubtedly commands respect. Yet he has repeatedly denied the reality of the recession. Inflation rates may be dipping, but the prices of everyday commodities such as rice, cereals and oil are sky-rocketing. The Sensex, too, has fallen steeply.           
	That apart, his tiffs with L.K. Advani, while making sensational news, have not done much to enhance his dignity. Optimism is a virtue, but when it is based on the motive of delivering election-stunts, it becomes a vice. The media and the people have preferred to turn a blind eye to these issues and out of a strange reverence for the prime minister, have not grilled him on these. Perhaps they consider him immune to the mistakes in decision-making that common men are susceptible to.           
	I would like to urge the people to think rationally and weigh the alternatives before endorsing any idea propagated by someone of high rank so as not to be prejudiced. As rational beings, we must make use of our judgement and education. This is essential for upholding the democratic credentials of our nation.                     
	Yours faithfully,         A. Bhattacharyya, Guwahati               
	Sir  The article, Ask them no questions, was timely and in-your-face. It is indeed true that we Indians are more comfortable worshipping people than trying to learn anything about them. The case of Rabindranath Tagore is an apt one. Very few care to read him, but everybody worships him. Many do not know what he has written or how great his management skills were in setting up a university in adverse natural surroundings when there was practically no infrastructure.           
	As regards Manmohanonomics, I am reminded of a football commentary: after Xavier Pius (a Mohun Bagan striker) had missed a sitter, P.K. Banerjee had commented that you have to be a footballer to miss such a chance. Anybody who had not played football would have scored. With edible oil at Rs 100 and cereals at around Rs 75 per kilogram, I often wish I could say that you really have to be an economist to manage the economy like this. A less qualified person, equipped with his ignorance, would have managed better.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Deba Pratim Ghatak, Durgapur

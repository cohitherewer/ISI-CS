	The Copenhagen Accord on climate change is like Indias nuclear deal. The deal, which was announced by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and then president of the United States of America, George W. Bush, in July 2005, had a tortuous course. For well over three years, it was on, then it was off, intermittently on again and off again. Even now, after it has been embraced by the die-hards in the global nuclear non-proliferation regime such as Canada and acknowledged by Japan, the only victim of a nuclear attack, doubts are raised from time to time about where the Indo-US deal is finally headed. Yet, the agreement has prevailed.        
	So it will be with the climate change deal reached at the United Nations summit in Copenhagen last week. Some will see it as the foundation for a soon-to-come treaty that was agreed upon at the end of two years of persevering work leading to the summit. Others will play it down as nothing more than a reference paper that was an essential face-saver to conclude the climate change summit.        
	Indians ought to be familiar with such differing interpretations of what really is something straightforwardly the outcome of intense, often dramatic, negotiations. After all, at the end of the most comprehensive Indo-US engagement in history, the protracted talks between the National Democratic Alliance governments Jaswant Singh and Bill Clintons deputy secretary of state, Strobe Talbott, following Indias nuclear tests 11 years ago, the two sides could not agree even on how many rounds of talks Jaswant Singh and Talbott had held.              
	The most sober assessment of the outcome in Copenhagen has come from the UN secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon, who described it as an essential beginning, which scored progress on every front associated with climate change. If there was one knight in shining armour during the darkest preparatory phases of the climate change summit and in Copenhagen itself, that knight was the UN secretary-general. When everyone despaired about the 15th UN Climate Change Conference or COP15, as it is commonly known, Ban almost alone remained optimistic. From the US Capitol to China, from the Commonwealth summit in Trinidad and Tobago to the Group of Eight meeting in Italy, Ban tirelessly travelled all of this year, determined to see that COP15 did not end in disarray.        
	It is typical of the American spin machine that the Copenhagen Accord is being projected as the product of Barack Obamas somewhat unconventional style of diplomacy, which was in action at the Bella Centre, the venue of the climate change summit. Equally, the Indian and the Chinese media are separately painting the summit in colours that show their new clout on the world stage.        
	But behind the scenes, the unsung hero of Copenhagen was Ban Ki-moon. When the dust has settled a little on the controversies over how a deal was carved out of the acrimonious gathering at Bella Centre, an image from Copenhagen, which many people will remember, is that of a pretty Venezuelan delegate to the summit bloodying her delicate hand while banging on the table and clapping to be heard by the conference. Equally stirring the conscience of the world for some time to come will be the frantic pleas by Tuvalus delegate not to trade tomorrow for thirty pieces of silver today  a reference to the proposal by the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, to help raise $100 billion in climate finance.        
	While everyone is focusing on how Obama barged into a meeting of the heads of delegations of Brazil, India, South Africa and China, and crafted the final deal in Copenhagen, no one is, unfortunately, talking about an equally dramatic one-hour meeting at Bella Centre where the UN secretary-general intervened to prevent the summit from collapsing, summoned all the aggrieved delegations and gave them a very patient hearing.        
	Ban could not obviously give them what they were clamouring for. But what he gave them was respect and recognition. Indeed, when Tuvalus delegate returned to the conference after the meeting with the secretary-general, his remark was that within the UN, we are given respect as nations, and that the secretary-general gave them time when the leaders of big nations or rich countries had no time for them. Without that one-hour meeting between Ban and the aggrieved delegations, the Copenhagen summit would have collapsed. Nicaraguas demand in the final hours of the summit  made on behalf of the dissenting delegations to suspend COP15 without any final outcome  was withdrawn only after the crucial meeting called by Ban and a procedural intervention by India on the floor of the conference.        
	What Ban achieved at the climate talks last week was a repeat of his performance in Bali two years ago, when he saved a crucial meeting preparatory to COP15 which, too, was heading for collapse like the Copenhagen summit in its final hours. Ban had left the Bali meeting and flown out of Indonesia, but when he was told that there had been no agreement at the preparatory conference, he turned around and flew back to Bali, persuading the famously intransigent Bush administration at that time to give in on their disagreements on the floor of that conference.        
	The power of spin in the age of 24-hour television and the short shelf lives of news stories are such that nobody now recalls that none of the so-called heroes of Copenhagen  Obama, Manmohan Singh and the Chinese prime minister, Wen Jiabao  was even planning to attend the Copenhagen summit until a few weeks ago. Obama made up his mind to go for the climate change talks only at the end of last month, actually after Ban went to the US Capitol earlier in November and sweet-talked members of the American Congress, which has a pending bill that actually limited what Obama could commit in Copenhagen, a Congress which is deeply suspicious of Obamas intentions on global warming. Wen also announced his decision to attend the COP15 around that time after long discussions with Ban.         
	Singh, whose reluctance to jet around the world is well known, had decided against going to Copenhagen until he was told that with Obama and Wen there, India too needed to be represented at the level of the head of government. Actually, it was the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, with whom the prime minister has a very comfortable relationship, who finally persuaded Singh to go to Copenhagen when the two men had a meeting on November 27 on the sidelines of the Commonwealth summit, a meeting that spilled over into an unscheduled lunch. Besides, Ban had bent over backwards to persuade Singh to attend a climate change meeting that the secretary-general had convened in New York in September. But the prime minister chose not to go to New York and went for the Group of Twenty summit in Pittsburgh instead, although the two meetings were back to back.        
	The reason why Ban is the unsung hero of Copenhagen  but a hero, nevertheless  is also the nature of his job. The UNs chief cannot be a decision-maker because he does not have any of the powers of a head of state or government. But Bans strength, which other world leaders have begun to appreciate more than half way into his five-year tenure as secretary-general, is that he is quite happy to work behind the scenes and leave the credit for what has been achieved to others with clear political agendas like Obama, Sarkozy or the British prime minister, Gordon Brown. They have to be seen as having done things, they have to go to their people and get re-elected.               
	In this context, Bans natural, East Asian style of low-key, but intense, diplomacy has come in handy. In every crisis since he became the UN secretary-general  including the crisis in Copenhagen created by a lack of trust between rich nations and emerging economies like India on the one hand and between small island-states and everyone else on the other  Ban has been careful not to surpass or upstage elected leaders of governments that make up the UN. He has also made it plain that his role is not to make policy, but to work on those who make policy, be persuasive and talk, but also listen as much as talk.        
	Ban is remarkably different in this regard from some of his predecessors who had a tendency to become the secular pope of the world community in their role as head of the world body and use the UNs bully pulpit to speak, and speak about the great issues of the day. It is true that the UN secretary-general has to speak out about the world he is dealing with, but more than any of his predecessors, it is clear that Ban wants to be remembered for what he accomplished and not for what he said.               
	This is not to say that he has been found wanting when a public demonstration of the UNs commitment to an issue was called for. In the build-up to the climate talks, when many other leaders were content with pious sermons, Ban chose to be the first UN secretary-general to make a dramatic visit to the Antarctica and focus on the problem of global warming by standing on Antarctic ice sheets melting beneath his feet. It was this style of his that made even the modest achievement in Copenhagen possible.

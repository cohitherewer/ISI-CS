The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Border Baits 
                                                                                                                 BORDER BAITS                                                     
	China may not be the only country that uses unresolved issues with neighbours as tools of diplomacy. But its ways of doing so are always an indication of more elaborate gameplans. Beijings objection to the visit by the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, to Arunachal Pradesh is thus no isolated act of diplomatic indiscretion. It is part of a renewed Chinese campaign to bait India on the border issues between the two countries. The aim obviously is not to solve the border disputes but to exploit them for other purposes. That Beijing was raising the bar on the dispute over Arunachal Pradesh was evident last December when it sought to block an Asian Development Bank loan for some infrastructure projects in the state. Chinas claim over the state, which it calls southern Tibet, has no basis in history. Chinas argument that it cannot accept the McMahon Line in settling its border disputes with India is, at best, a ploy. For it has solved its border problems with Myanmar on the basis of the same historical agreement. History apart, the Chinese posturings over Arunachal Pradesh are also a blatant violation of the principles for discussion on the border disputes agreed upon by the two countries during the visit of the former Indian prime minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, to Beijing in 2003.         
	The important question for New Delhi is how to respond to Beijings intransigence. The external affairs minister, Pranab Mukherjee, has reiterated Indias position that Arunachal Pradesh is an integral part of India. India has also expressed its disappointment and concern over the Chinese position. It is good that the official Indian responses so far have been rather low-key, despite a relatively stronger protest over the Chinese role in building infrastructure in Pakistan. The prime minister himself set the tone of the Indian response when he dismissed some media reports suggesting a sudden increase in Chinese incursions into Indian territory. India does not need to be paranoid about a Chinese threat or do anything to create mass hysteria over it. A mature Indian response would be to go about the task of strengthening the defence of the border and improving infrastructure there. Creating an atmosphere of public hostility is of little use for effective diplomacy. The people of Arunachal Pradesh, though, rebuffed China by voting peacefully  and in massive numbers  in Tuesdays polls.

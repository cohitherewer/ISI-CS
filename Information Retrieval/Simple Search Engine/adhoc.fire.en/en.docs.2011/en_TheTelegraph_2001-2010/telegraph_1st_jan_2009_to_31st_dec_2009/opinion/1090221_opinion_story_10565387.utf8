The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A romance gone sour
                                                                                                                 A ROMANCE GONE SOUR                              This above all      Khushwant Singh                        No fairy tale				                                       
	I have great regard for the Bishnois. But there are some members of the sect whose behaviour leaves me dumbfounded. They were the first in India to realize the importance of saving our forests and wildlife from destruction. The most important event in their history is that in which some of them gave up their lives to prevent the Alwar state constabulary from enforcing a timber contractors right to cut down a forest. To this day, you can see deer roaming about in Bishnoi villages. Some years ago, in this very column, I published a picture of a Bishnoi woman breast-feeding her baby boy and a new-born fawn deserted by its mother  a most heart-warming example of love for animals. I assumed that the Bishnois were a god-fearing sect with high moral standards. However, there is also a very high incidence of violent crime, including murders, among the Bishnois. Most of them are due to family feuds and vendettas. The Bishnois also produced Bhajan Lal, once chief minister of Haryana, who was amongst the most unprincipled politicians of his time. And now we have his son, Chander Mohan, alias Chand Mohammad, till recently the deputy chief minister of Haryana. He has gone one step further than his sire. He is the most talked about man in Haryana today, and is known all over the country for the wrong reasons.        
	Chander Mohan had everything going for him  he was the son of a chief minister, educated at the Lawrence School in Sanawar and married into a rich family. He lived in a spacious mansion with his wife, two children and dogs. He was first elected a member of the legislative assembly, and then made the deputy chief minister. He also liked his booze and had a roving eye. One afternoon, it fell on a light-skinned, raven-haired, doe-eyed woman in her mid-thirties named Anuradha Bali. She was a practising lawyer and worked as the assistant advocate-general. She was on the look-out for a husband, home and security. She responded to Chanders overtures. They began to date secretly, then decided to come out into the open and get married. As a criminal lawyer, Anuradha must have known that bigamy is a criminal offence. Also, as a lawyer, she knew that the only way out was to convert to Islam, which permitted a man to take upto four wives at a time. So they threw all caution to the winds and converted to Islam. He became Chand Mohammad and she, Fiza Mohammad. It was a thoroughly dishonest exploitation of Islam. As should have been anticipated, Chand Mohammad was disinherited, made an outcaste by the Bishnois, and dismissed from his job. Fiza also lost her caste and her job. Both became the laughing stock of society. The whirlwind romance lasted for barely a few months. Chand Mohammad ditched Fiza and went back to his family. Fiza failed in an attempt to take her own life and now lives on a diet of media interviews and vows of revenge. The sorry tale of romance-gone-sour has not ended. Both are yet to explain their conduct to their families, friends and to society.         
	Chander Mohan, alias Chand Mohammad, is obviously an unstable character. He is probably in need of medical and mental treatment. About Fiza, ne Anuradha, I am not sure. She seems to be relishing the media attention she is getting. But for how long? Sooner or later, the law will catch up with her.                
	Legendary figure                
	Hari Singh Nalwa (1791-1837) was one of the most renowned and trusted generals and administrators of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. He was the one who turned back the Afghans and Pathans invading India for over five centuries back into their homelands. They had made Khyber Pass a one-way traffic route. Nalwa not only reversed the route of traffic, but also ruled the province with an iron hand, giving the traditional marauders of India a taste of their own medicine. Consequently, while his name was used by Afghan and Pathan women to frighten their children into submission, in India, his name is used with pride as that of one who paid the invaders back in their own currency, and with compound interest. Many legends have grown around Nalwa; it is hard to sift facts from fiction. At long last, we have one of his descendants, Vanit Nalwa, gather textual material, including ballads composed by the generals admirers, as well as old paintings, and put them together in one volume: Hari Singh Nalwa: Champion of the Khalsaji. The book will be available in the market by the time this article is published.        
	Vanit Nalwa has written about her distinguished ancestor with unconcealed pride, about the ruthless methods he used to crush turbulent tribesmen of the north-west frontier. They have never forgiven the Sikhs for what Nalwa did to their forefathers. His name still rankles in their minds. Nevertheless, her book is a most valuable addition to the bibliography of Sikhism.        
	Vanit Nalwa is a practising psychologist, with a doctorate in neuropsychology from Delhi University. She did her post-doctoral research in Oxford and won a Fulbright scholarship to the National Institute of Mental Health in Maryland in the United States of America.

	The Roman Catholic Church in India is standing on the threshold of a potentially revolutionary change. This is evident from the admission of the Catholic Bishops Conference of India, the highest ecclesiastical body of Catholics in this country, that there has been centuries-long injustice against women, and from its first attempts at redeeming this by allowing women to have equal representation in the decision-making bodies of the church. This would mean throwing open employment opportunities for women in seminaries and pastoral councils at positions from which they had been barred. It would be unfair to reduce the CBCIs proposed plan to its pecuniary advantages. Its proposal is unprecedented, given that Catholic orders, throughout the world, have given women minimal decision-making powers, in spite of promoting their participation in fund-raising, education and church maintenance.         
	The justification for this restriction have been found in Christian tradition, which assigns specific roles for men and women in society, and in the fact that Jesus Christs apostles were male. While elaborating on the Churchs lack of authority to ordain women, these were also the arguments that Pope John Paul II had put forward in 1994. The arguments have persisted, provoking major splits within any order that sought to challenge them. The recent decision of the Church of England to ordain women as bishops prompted a vertical divide within the Anglican Church in Britain, and in the world. But Protestant orders have shown more tolerance towards accommodating women in the higher echelons of power in the Church than Catholic ones. And it is in going against this trend that the CBCI is proving to be something of a pioneer. Its measures could promote a paradigm shift in the way the Catholic order throughout the world looks at the role of women in the Church. Although they have been denied positions of power to which men had unlimited access, the Church has never denied that Christianity gives equal respect to both sexes. Perhaps the CBCI has taken the first step towards revaluating this theory, and by doing so, also questioned the dogmas that guide the Churchs attitude to women. That, hopefully, will not only call for a reassessment of womens abilities as priests, but also turn the spotlight to other critical areas of empowerment, such as their reproductive rights.

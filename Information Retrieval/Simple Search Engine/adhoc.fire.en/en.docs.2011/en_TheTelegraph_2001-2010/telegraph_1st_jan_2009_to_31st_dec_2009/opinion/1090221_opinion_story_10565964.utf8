The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Making the green one red
                                                                                                                 MAKING THE GREEN ONE RED                                                          
	The power to destroy is intoxicating, and any limit to that power intolerable. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) does not see why it cannot have the whole of Calcutta to do with as it likes  fill it up with poisonous smoke, let auto-rickshaws, buses and taxis run amok while hand-carts trot athwart streams of traffic on the busiest roads, bring everything to a standstill with processions and demonstrations, let all noises, from car-horns to microphones, shatter the peace of hospitals and schools, and turn every green spot into a dusty aridity remarkable for its ugliness and polluting potential. Unable to bear the fact that destroying the green of the Maidan and the environment of the Victoria Memorial with rallies is limited to a few occasions only, the sports, transport and youth services minister of West Bengal, Subhas Chakraborty, went to Delhi to ask the defence minister, A.K. Antony, that the Calcutta Maidan, under the guardianship of the army, be handed over to the state government.        
	Mr Chakraborty may be eager to bell the cat because this superhero aspirant with the unforgettable white hat looks after sports and youth together. He even wants the race-course cleared of racing  horse-racing has nothing to do with people  and use the space for different sports. His concern is understandable  where will his boys run about and cook and have their sloganeering picnics, if the army, the horsy clubs, the courts, those fancy intellectual types called environmentalists and other fools of that ilk insist on spoiling their innocent joy? But his eagerness should not obscure the fact that the chief minister himself seems convinced that the West Bengal government has some kind of feudal right over the Maidan. The government is not promising to look after it better than the army, it wants, as the chief minister wrote in a letter to the Union defence minister in August last, the use and possessional right of the place.        
	When the chief minister of a state talks about possessional right of a place in someone elses charge, he puts at risk the principles and premises of lawfulness and governance. The absurdity of his sports minister demanding the Maidan of the Union defence minister could have been likened to a spoilt child throwing tantrums if the serious issues this brings up could have been dismissed. To have free use of the Maidan for party rallies, it is the government  of which the party is the dominant partner  that is fighting, first the courts, and then the Centre. The chief minister, who feels possessive about both the Maidan and the Book Fair, lamented recently in a public function that the fair had to be held elsewhere this year. When a chief minister publicly laments a court order, or a sports minister demands the right to destroy the Maidan and the race-course, it is not really funny anymore. It is also frightening.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Sell the king
                                                                                                                 SELL THE KING                                                    
	From being an emblem of national pride, Air India has become the latest example of shoddy management that has led to the crisis-like conditions within the company. Its problems will test the resolve of Manmohan Singhs government to reform public sector enterprises that have become welfare programmes for unionized employees. Its losses of nearly Rs 4,000 crore for 2008-09 and the request for a bailout package of about Rs 14,000 crore will add pressure on the already precarious state of public finances. True, globally, airlines have suffered billions of dollars worth of losses as a consequence of the financial crisis. But Air India has gotten into dire straits for a variety of other reasons, among them being the merger with Indian Airlines  which itself had been loss-making for years  the slowness to respond to the challenges posed by low-cost airlines domestically and the competition stemming from other international carriers that have come in as a consequence of bilateral agreements with other countries. The increase in airline fuel prices  which account for about 15 per cent of the cost of operations  has dented the airlines profitability considerably. The poor quality of customer service has added to passenger dissatisfaction.         
	The utility of a national airline as a symbol of a countrys identity is irrelevant in todays context. India is not an island economy for which a national airline has strategic importance. The civil aviation minister had tough words for Air India, saying that the company will have to get its act together, but a number of factors lie outside his control. But most importantly, under government ownership Air India will be unable to take the kind of hard decisions that will secure the financial viability of its operations or restore its past glory. While the management has stated its intention of cutting employee costs, there is no clarity on whether it will actually reduce its 31,500-strong workforce. Similarly, a lot has been said about restructuring, but the benefits of any such efforts from the merger with Indian Airlines are not evident. The best solution would be to sell Air India, rather than trying to get into a long and expensive salvage operation. British Airways, Japan Airlines, Singapore Airlines and Thai Airlines have all benefited from becoming privately held companies. So can Air India; the government should spend its political capital and do it.

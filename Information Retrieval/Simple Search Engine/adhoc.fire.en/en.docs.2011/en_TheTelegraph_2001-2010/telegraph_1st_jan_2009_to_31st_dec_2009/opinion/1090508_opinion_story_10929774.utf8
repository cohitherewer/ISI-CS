The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A talk Without frills
                                                                                                                 A TALK WITHOUT FRILLS                                  BONA FIDE - Malvika Singh                              
	Rahul Gandhi answered a wide-ranging set of questions in his first large and formal press conference in Delhi on May 5. It was refreshing and candid, real and truthful, without the predictable jargon that has plagued political talk on television, in debates and talk shows. Some channels have referred to the hour-long question-answer session as a speech. The first half-an-hour, when journalists thought they would trip him by asking serious questions, witnessed succinct and intelligent replies without frills and trappings. As the allocated time began to draw to a close, there were desperate attempts to get quickie responses and silly sound bites to the predictable and inane questions.        
	Sadly, our press has become lazy and cynical. It is unable to tear itself away from its pre-conceived positions vis--vis almost all the issues that confront India. It seems to have lost the ability to stand back, to listen and admit that it has been partisan or simplistic in its evaluations. Misinterpretation has become a habit, one that viewers can see through. Breaking News that afternoon was based on a misrepresentation. Rahul Gandhi said he thought that Nitish Kumar and Chandrababu Naidu were chief ministers who worked towards their goals and did deliver some results. What is wrong with that? It is far more graceful than saying, as Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan did, that they are forming a grand combine apart from the Congress to win votes for their respective caste-based parties, only to return to the Congress when it suits them to share the spoils of office. Sick!        
	Paswan could not understand how Rahul Gandhi, having praised Nitish Kumar, could fight him in Bihar. Why not? Thats what a democratic system demands, and there is no rule in a democracy that says you must be abusive towards your opponent. Sane, normal, candid responses from a new generation with a different mindset could well change the political narrative over the next few years.                 
	Brownie points        
	Reactions from the leaders and spokespersons of the Opposition to Rahul Gandhis interaction with the press were heavily peppered with blubber, irritation, arrogant statements, and dismissive comments. Their body language spoke of their unease and their sulks were in sharp contrast to the measured and cool responses of the general secretary of the Youth Congress. Evidence of their unease was coming at us fast and furious throughout the day.        
	Congress leaders, whose generational colleagues are the Karats, the Lalu Prasads, the Ram Vilas Paswans and others, are also scared by the transparent responses that came across the footlights from Rahul Gandhi. Are their days of base and corrupt politics, in which habitual conniving against their own party members to retain power has become an accepted norm, where manipulating individuals present themselves as being close to the point of power, heading to an abrupt end in the next few years? A cleansing seems to be on the anvil.        
	The electronic media, revealing veiled political biases depending on which channel you happened to be watching, picked out comments from the press conference and blew them into hot air balloons that they released in the air. But viewers are not foolish, blind or deaf. The slinging match was farcical and ended up giving more brownie points to the young leader. In the mean time, the old and weary, tired and predictable men hammered on against him with not a single new idea as a counter point. Nor did they have anything to show for themselves, anything they had done in their tenure that was salutary and out of the ordinary. The entire exercise sharpened the divide between the players of a failed past and those charting the future; between a jaded narrative and an aspirational challenge.

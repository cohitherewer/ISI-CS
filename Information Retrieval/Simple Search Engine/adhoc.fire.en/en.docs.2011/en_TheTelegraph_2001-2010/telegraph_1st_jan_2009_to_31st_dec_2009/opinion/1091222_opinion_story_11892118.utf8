                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        SAFE PASSAGE                                                    
	Had Daood Sayed Gilani, settled in Chicago but born to a Pakistani father and an American mother, applied for a visa to India, he would probably have been summarily turned away. So he used his other name, David Coleman Headley, in the application form, knowing too well the magic charm of this alias. He secured the permit quite painlessly, and made nine trips to India on a business visa without ever arousing the least bit of suspicion. In the course of his visits, he allegedly made extensive footage of potential targets and passed it on to the Lashkar-e-Toiba. Headleys intelligence served as the guideline for the 26/11 attacks. So, how were the officials at the Indian consulate in Chicago so easily duped? True, Headley has green-brown eyes, looks Caucasian, and has spent all his adult life in the United States of America. But so have millions like him of East-West parentage, who are settled all over the free world. Yet seldom do embassies encounter such conundrums as one of a terror suspect having a distinctly un-terrorist-like name. A name like David Coleman Headley on an American passport was enough to assuage all worries. Had the slightest attention been spared, officials would not have missed Headleys birth name or his fathers nationality, which would have led to a detailed background check, and probably a suspension of his visa. Since 9/11, Muslims have felt persecuted for their religious identity. Headley trumped the shapers of stereotypes at their own game.        
	Highly embarrassing and dangerous slips usually provoke knee-jerk reactions, followed by overzealous damage control. Predictably, India is treading that familiar path. First, it tightened entry restrictions for US and British citizens holding long-term visas. Now, a blanket ban has been imposed on US citizens who were born in Pakistan or even in parts of undivided India that now belong to Pakistan. A sense of security earned at the expense of racial profiling is unlikely to last long. There is also no guarantee that the Headleys of the future would not originate from outside the US, from one of the many members of the league of big nations. Globalization has turned human networks impossibly complex and widespread. So hasty measures, executed with impunity, would not be able to harness terror, which is now more expertly outsourced than ever before. Only greater vigilance will keep the Mr Hydes away.

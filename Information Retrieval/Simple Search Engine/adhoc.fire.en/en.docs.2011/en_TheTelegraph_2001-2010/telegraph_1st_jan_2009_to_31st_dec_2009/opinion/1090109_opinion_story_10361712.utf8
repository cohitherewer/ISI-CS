                                                                                                                 WORD OF MOUTH                                                    
	Mahmud Ali Durrani, like David Kelly, is the fall guy. Kellys admission to the media in 2003 of his governments sexing up of its dossier on Iraq had severely compromised the Tony Blair administration. Similarly, the national security advisor of Pakistan has forced upon his prime minister the first misstep in a carefully calibrated campaign against India. Much of the war of words that has ensued between the countries after the Mumbai attack has hinged on the nationality of Mohammad Ajmal Kasab. Pakistan has sought to stave off all allegations of its links with the incident by studiously refusing to acknowledge Kasabs Pakistani origins. The acknowledgment would have, automatically, provided the first point of engagement in the debate over Pakistans role in the attack and its responsibility in the spread of terror. Mr Durrani, has, therefore, conceded very precious ground to India. Yusuf Raza Gilanis anger at Mr Durranis indiscretion is understandable. His government was forced to revise its claims, made in the earlier half of the same day Mr Durrani went to the media, that it was still too early to establish Kasabs nationality.         
	Even if Mr Durranis sacking were to be justified by the ethics of governance that regulate the roles of all public servants, what could justify the backtracking of the leader of the opposition on similar claims? Nawaz Sharif had risen to the challenge of his role as the sounding board of the government when he had criticized the administrations tactics of blocking information on Kasabs origins. Within days he had been forced to eat his words. But Mr Sharif is not the only one to have been put on this curious diet. None other than the prime minister himself had gone back on his word regarding sending the chief of the Inter-Services Intelligence to India. Mr Durrani may be accountable to his government. But to whom are Messrs Sharif and Gilani accountable? The people of Pakistan, or the other stakeholders whom Mr Gilani has referred to while announcing his decision on Mr Durrani?

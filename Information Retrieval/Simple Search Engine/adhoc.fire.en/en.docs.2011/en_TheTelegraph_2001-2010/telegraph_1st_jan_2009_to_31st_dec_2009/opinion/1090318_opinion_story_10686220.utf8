	Healthy returns   
	Some doctors running nursing homes challenged a notification that classified nursing homes as commercial establishments. This required them to be registered under Punjab Shops and Commercial Establishments Act and also deposit the requisite fees. The Punjab and Haryana High Court directed the government to reconsider the matter, taking into account the fact that a similar notification on certain establishments would soon be withdrawn. The petitioners approached the court again but their plea was rejected once more. Some educational institutions were, however, exempted. Dismissing the petition, the court held that educational institutions and nursing homes could not be clubbed together as nursing homes were not non-commercial, non-profit organisations. (S.K. Gupta vs State of Haryana)   
	School woes        
	 The inspector of factories issued a notice to Bishops School, Ranchi, to get it registered under the Factories Act. The school approached the court to quash the notice. The authorities had issued the notice under Section 85 of the Factories Act, which empowered them to apply the act where a manu-facturing process was carried on. The authorities contention was that the school used a generator. The school argued that it had used the generator during power cuts. The Jharkhand High Court quashed the notice, stating that a school could not be involved in a manufacturing process in the way a factory could.

	Vile violation        
	 The Banking Regulation Act prohibits the employment or the continuation of employment of persons convicted by a criminal court of an offence involving moral turpitude. Accordingly, a bank employees service was terminated when he was convicted for an offence under Section 498-A of the Indian Penal Code and Section 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act. The employee filed a writ petition, stating that his sentence was suspended and that it was only a matrimonial dispute. The Madras High Court, however, held that the conduct of the petitioner was inherently depraved and accepting dowry was an offence involving moral turpitude.

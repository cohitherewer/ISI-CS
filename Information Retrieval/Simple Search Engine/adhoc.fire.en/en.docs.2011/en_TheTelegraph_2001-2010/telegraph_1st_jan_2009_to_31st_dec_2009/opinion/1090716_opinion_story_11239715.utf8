	It is not easy to reform the judical system. Anyone given the task, as V.S. Malimath, formerly chief justice of the Karnataka and Kerala High Courts, must have known, would be bound to wade into difficulties. There is a lot obviously wrong with Indias justice system, such as the overload of pending cases, the long delay in trials and low rates of conviction. Such problems are faced by countries such as the United Kingdom too, where a serious attempt to reform the system brought about a storm of frenzied discussion and disagreement just as Mr Malimaths recommendations did. But there are certain built-in checks in the UK justice system that India has decided to dispense with. The accused in criminal trials in India no longer have to face a jury. The presence of a jury would automatically prevent outrageous delay. Far more important, perhaps, is that a jury could become one of the chief guarantors of greater accountability and continuity.        
	For it is accountability that seems most precious and rare when the alleged murderers of a professor of political science conducting elections within his college in Ujjain are released for want of evidence. The Malimath committee report had suggested that the justice system be geared to find the truth, not merely to sift through evidence to prove a charge beyond all reasonable doubt. But the means envisaged to give courts and the police a more active role did not find many takers. Yet sometimes the truth does not even await a quest; it may be staring the world in the face. The tragic death of H.S. Sabharwal did happen, and it happened in public, in the middle of a crowd consisting of his students, colleagues and other members of the college. Yet political pressure from the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Madhya Pradesh government was strong enough not only to persuade witnesses to forget what they saw, but also to ensure that they were not subjected to inquiry or termed hostile. Some, it appears, were rewarded. Even though the Supreme Court directed that the case be shifted to a court in Nagpur from Ujjain purely because of such distortions, it was evidently too late. The case had fizzled out, and the six accused, from the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, and frankly friends of the chief minister, were found innocent of both culpable homicide and of murder. This time the process did not take too long, although justice remained elusive.

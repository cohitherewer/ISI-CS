	Two minutes to history        
	The watchmaker (Penguin, Rs 250) by Nanak Singh is the English translation of the Punjabi classic, Pavitra Paapi, by the authors grandson, Navdeep Suri. A pioneer of Punjabi modernism, Singh is famous not only as a master storyteller, but also as a stylist who crafted a lyrical idiom out of colloquial Punjabi. The characters in his novels are strong, but beset with ethical dilemmas. In this story, Kedar, a desolate orphan, arrives in Rawalpindi in search of employment. Hired as a watchmaker, Kedar spells doom for Panna Lal  the man whose job he usurps. Unable to deal with his abject poverty, Panna Lal deserts his family  but not before blaming Kedar for his misfortunes. Inevitably, Kedar is riddled with guilt and decides to take care of Panna Lals family. The complications deepen as Kedar falls in love Veena, Panna Lals daughter. This romantic tragedy has been turned into a Hindi film, with Balraj Sahni as Panna Lal and his son, Parikshit, as Kedar.                  
	Getting your point across (Macmillan, Rs 195) by Phillip Khan-Panni has a self-explanatory title. Although this is no doubt a How To book, Khan-Panni is not a typical writer in that mould. In fact, he reveals a sense of humour in the Preface itself when he concedes that this book is a little longer than [what] you might expect of a guide to getting your point across succinctly. You may not be entirely persuaded by Khan-Pannis trade secrets  the Three Ms and the Four Ks or the Hook  but there might be bits of information that may take you by surprise. Did you know that Lincolns historic Gettysburg Address contains a little more than 200 words and was delivered in just two minutes?                                
	Monster (Penguin, 2.99) by Allan Hall tells the story of Josef Fritzl who kept his teenage daughter, Elizabeth, imprisoned for 24 years in an underground bunker and had seven children with her. This is a journalists account of the nightmarish years, embellished with grisly details and sensational revelations. An epigraph from Hitler sets the tenor of the book, which revisits Fritzls sordid childhood, his adolescent love for Nazism, and later sexual perversions. The account is rounded off by interviews with the Fritzls neighbours, Elizabeths school friends, criminologists, lawyers and psychiatrists.                        
	THE ANGEL OF GOD (Cedar, Rs 195) by Jyothi Menon reads like a catalogue of banalities without any narrative holding the chapters together. This is a sorry proof of what HR experts with literary aspirations often manage to produce  a mishmash of corporate jargon and Art of Living signifying very little.

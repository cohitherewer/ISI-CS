Rao                              Unkindly light				                                                   
	I have many times bemoaned the gross indiscipline among consumers, employees in State-owned power companies, and the lack of accountability of bureaucrats and politicians concerned with electricity in India. They prevent India from powering itself like China into consistent and high economic growth. Distrust of markets is compounded by fears of misuse of electricity trading, as by Enron in California. Result: India has not made optimal use of even the available electricity.        
	Indian governments are not known for their farsightedness. An extraordinarily far-sighted change in electricity policies was the Electricity Act, 2003 piloted by the late P. Rangarajan Kumaramangalam, then minister for power. His intention was to overcome the immense constraints due to the concurrent nature of electricity under the Constitution. He hoped to transform the electricity sector with this act.        
	Over 95 per cent of the electricity sector was owned and managed by Central and state governments, with the states accounting for about two-thirds. Distribution was almost entirely in the control of the state governments. The Centre monopolized interstate transmission and had created generation capacities that were allocated to the states. For the electricity supplied to states, tariffs were unilaterally decided by the Centre. The states decided tariffs to consumers.               
	State governments bore the growing losses of their electricity undertakings from government budgets, thus cutting funds for roads, health, education, and so on. Losses were caused by industrial and household customers stealing electricity with the collusion of electricity employees, cheap or free electricity supplies without limits to farmers and other special interests, gross inefficiencies in operations, bad maintenance, lack of commercial approach among the engineers and bureaucrats who were the top management, little trading in electricity from surplus to deficit states, and by practically no private investments except in captive generation plants set up by industries to assure stable supplies for their businesses.         
	Kumaramangalam recognized that private domestic and even foreign investment in the sector was vital if it was to meet the needs and aspirations of a growing economy. Electricity investments must be of all types, public and private, for captive use, for trading in spot and futures markets, for long-term contracts to distribution companies and to large consumers. If supply constraints prevented tariff determination by forces of supply and demand in markets, tariffs must be determined rationally after allowing the enterprises to make adequate returns. Independent regulatory commissions were created at the Centre and in each state for this purpose. Subsidies were to be rationalized and to become entirely a charge of the governments. Optimizing the use of available power required an integrated system of information, adequate transmission, trading between states and efficient operations. It was necessary to stimulate private investment in generation for captive use, and for selling to whoever required it and was willing to pay for it. Trading in electricity would be at prices determined by market forces. It would improve availability even if supplies were short, by matching short-term surpluses in one part of India with deficits in another. Most demand would be under long-term contracts with tariffs determined by regulation.        
	Since electricity cannot be stored, there needs to be an independent mechanism to keep minute-to-minute track of how much electricity is entering the system, from where, and who has consumed it. This must be within estimates of supply made by each generator and of demand by users or distributors. Correct accounts of all these transactions and preventing overload of the system required an independent entity, not connected to any of the users of the system, to manage the load and dispatches in the system.        
	Transmission networks are a natural monopoly. Its cost of construction entails a high fixed cost, but once constructed it has a low and constant marginal cost. It made little sense to have duplicate transmission networks over the same routes. Since electricity requires transmission facilities that have to be specially built to move it from the generator to the distributor or user, it was necessary that the transmission network was easily available to anyone who wanted to use it and would pay a fair and non-discriminatory price for doing so. This facility of open access to the transmission network, which in India has been a government monopoly, was a key element in the Electricity Act that Kumaramangalam piloted and got approved by Parliament in 2003.        
	Without open access there could be little electricity trading, no optimization of use of the limited available electricity, no wider use of the surplus power from captive plants, and no new generation capacities built for supplying consumers willing to pay extra. Open access was at the heart of the new electricity system envisaged by the 2003 act.        
	In 2009, six years after the act was passed, open access is yet to make much progress. Reluctance of electricity regulatory commissions, state governments and state electricity undertakings have not enabled it. Electricity regulatory commissions are almost entirely composed of retired government servants. Their mindset is to protect the financial position of State electricity undertakings, not the consumer interest in availability of more electricity. States also want to protect their electricity undertakings that may lose profits and show larger deficits if open access was allowed and good, paying customers migrated to other suppliers.         
	Regulators think similarly. The act requires a surcharge for open access, to meet some part of the costs of cross-subsidizing special interests. State regulators determined this surcharge at such high levels that sending electricity on open access made it unaffordable. Recently, the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission has intervened to force more reasonable surcharges and to push open access, with little effect so far.               
	Transmission capacity has been constrained and, even if open access was feasible on costs, the capacity to move electricity was inadequate. In 1998, the government amended the act to allow private entry into transmission. But the Central government monopoly undertaking in interstate transmission, Power Grid Corporation, was able to prevent private investment and protect its monopoly. Private investment in transmission was prevented for over six years and the continuing transmission capacity constraints also prevent open access from taking off. State governments like Karnataka have disallowed open access and taken dubious shelter under the Electricity Act, 2003 for doing so. They have also prevented open access for selling electricity in another state.        
	The load despatch centres were under the state electricity boards or State-owned transmission corporations. State governments have so far prevented their becoming independent bodies. They remain tied to the principal players in the electricity system. Without an independent load despatch centre in each state, open access is hampered, with the doubtful independence of the load despatch function.        
	The CERC has also restricted the scope for electricity trading and the wider use of open access by putting a cap on trading margins, and more recently, proposing a cap on the price of traded electricity. This removed the incentive for private investment in generation capacity for trading purposes. Little capacity specifically for trading purposes has been created. The CERC thus restricted the need for open access.         
	Thus, until today, open access, a crucial element in the Electricity Act, 2003 has been subverted by all governments and quasi-government authorities in the electricity sector. This lack of accountability and discipline in electricity is clearly a failure of Indian governance.        
	Unfortunately, neither the public nor the media have understood how the countrys progress is held back by misconceived policies to protect state electricity monopolies.

                                                                            Sunday , November 8 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                              TOO HIGH TO COMMAND                                                          
	The scene is anything but decent in Karnataka. While numerous people in the north of the state are struggling with the devastation wrought by floods, rebel Bharatiya Janata Party legislators are biding their time in a five-star hotel. The Karnataka tourism minister, G. Janardhana Reddy, is leading the rebellion against the chief minister, B.S. Yeddyurappa, and has as support his older brother and revenue minister, G. Karunakara Reddy. The Reddy brothers are mining barons from Bellary, and their regional clout was particularly useful for the BJP during the last assembly elections that brought the Yeddyurappa government to power. It is Mr Yeddyurappas allegedly dictatorial style of functioning that is apparently the cause of the Reddy siblings ire. They want the chief minister out, and the assembly Speaker in his place.        
	The tussle is between kingmakers with a regional power base and the chief minister, a favourite of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and the BJP. It uncovers the irony at the heart of all national parties in India  a partys state units have to abide by the decisions of a central leadership situated far away from the scene of action. The structure dictated by a centralized command was a legacy of the Congress, initially created for historical reasons  the party ruled most states  that later developed into a clearly delineated hierarchy with Indira Gandhi at the head. No party is free of this, partly because of the similarity of political environment and partly because of their own cultures. Instead of carrying out an advisory or monitoring role, party high commands impose their chosen candidates, decisions and solutions to problems on the state units, often weakening them or damaging their positions. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) in West Bengal, for example, has suffered repeatedly in the state because of the decisions of its central leadership. So has the Congress often enough, for candidates and alliances chosen by the high command have often been fatally wrong for the states.        
	Rebellions are inevitable if the local leadership does not grow from the soil. Leaders should be chosen by the state unit, which should also nominate the candidates it finds most fit. The dominance of a central leadership violates democratic ethos. Revolts are ultimately the result of the paradoxical absence of inner-party democracy among parties running a democratic country. Federalism is peculiarly alien to the Indian mindset, and that is most obvious in the constant tension between state units and central leaderships of the national parties. What is needed is a restructuring in party organizations that can only come from a changed attitude towards the devolution of power. The idea of the high command is the bane of Indian politics.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Take a walk on the dark side
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        TAKE A WALK ON THE DARK SIDE                                  In India, what in other cultures are relegated to the realm of the pornographic become part of the warp and woof of everyday life                          Philippe Jarrigeon, The Operation (2008)                                  
	Winterthur is on my mind for two reasons. The name of this Swiss city kept coming up in all the reports Id been reading on the internet about the ban on minarets in Switzerland. Winterthur has only one mosque with a small minaret, from which the call for prayers is forbidden by law. But it is situated in one of the 22 (out of 26) cantons that had voted by referendum against the building of new minarets. Feminist groups in Winterthur and a few other cities have declared that minarets were too aggressively phallic to be part of the skyline of a modern nation that had embraced direct democracy so successfully, the results of the referendum being the latest affirmation of this modernity.        
	The phallus brings me to the second reason for this city being on my mind. Winterthur also has a state-of-the-art museum of photography that had an exhibition last year called Darkside: Photographic Desire and Sexuality Photographed, the catalogue of which, co-published by Steidl, is among the books Im reading now. This show, together with the accompanying book, confronts the political and aesthetic difficulties of looking at pornography as art, and art as pornography, and of photographys relationship with this two-way traffic. It reproduces  with the antiseptic neutrality and exquisite precision that the world has come to expect from the Swiss  a huge arc of mostly Western, and some Japanese, photography of a sort of relentless, but deadpan, explicitness: from sepia images of early-20th-century, pseudo-Greek minors with their togas undone to Jeff Koonss send-up of conjugal sex in tutti-frutti colours in the Made in Heaven series of 1991. It includes Gary Grosss infamous photograph of the pre-pubertal Brooke Shields in a steaming bath, The Woman in the Child, recently banned from being shown at the Tate Modern. The texts invoke Sade, Foucault, Barthes and Bataille, with chapters like The Hysterical Hystery of Photography and No One Knows What the Body Can Do.        
	Ive always found pedantic discussions of sex vaguely funny (apart from being a bit sad), and was delighted when my favourite English don, the late Tony Nuttall, wrote a brilliantly robust book on the pathos of sterile pedantry called Dead From the Waist Down. If youve ever tried desperately not to nod off during post-lunch sessions at conferences on The Body, then youd know what I mean. Tenured academics holding forth on Transgression usually inspire me to fierce bouts of doodling. Yet, the bizarre montage of banned minarets and arty sex that the image of an unknown Swiss city became inside my head lent to my reading of the Darkside catalogue in Calcutta (most blessedly un-Swiss of all cities) a kinky and contrary edge.         
	While looking at photographs so beautifully composed to shock, I remembered how, during a trip to Switzerland organized by the Swiss government for Indian journalists, we were taken from one to the next of an endless series of identical model villages where model citizens in model costume milked model cows in model fields against model peaks, and were told little other than which Bollywood film was shot where, and then taken to the restaurants where the actors had eaten, and how we were expected to be thrilled, as Indians, with all this. I also remember how I had to suppress, in the midst of such wholesomeness, hygiene and order, the urge to do something terribly wrong  in the way respectable little children sometimes scream out Bad Words (usually vernacular synonyms for shit and related organs) in their rage against the elders. In that world of moo-cows and museums, the hills alive with comfy-looking chalets (now with Polanski locked up in one, ruing his brush with the Woman in the Child), I suddenly understood what arouses the Will to Transgression in all its infantile thrill better than I could ever have done by reading the most lascivious of French theorists. I began to sense why Calvin and Giacometti were both Swiss.        
	In India, where there are few museums in which it can be stylized into art, or other spaces where it can be ritualized into play, transgression becomes part of the warp and woof, chaos and cosmos, of everyday life. The wildness of its gods and goddesses, or its perverse epic heroes and heroines, instead of merely inhabiting the realm of religion, art or myth, are part of the crackle of normalcy. The opening and closing of the Pandoras box of convention blends into the rhythms of the mundane.        
	I shut Darkside and set out for work in the winter afternoon. I hear the snip-snip of the barbers scissors, and see the chhatu-seller squatting close between the barbers legs, their legs almost intertwined. The sensation of his hair being deftly handled has given to the young mans face a look of bliss that, together with the barbers impersonal tenderness, makes me think of Bhupen Khakhar. He would have painted them into a quotidian moment of caritas between strangers  public, yet private too. Drivers sprawled in their cars half-emerge from their siesta to gaze at the girls flocking out of school. The song from a car radio turns these schoolchildren, for a while, into the Lolitas of Ballygunge Place. A madwoman unashamed of her withered dugs steals this quiet hour to wash herself at the tube-well. The istiriwalla lies on his cart and looks at her from across the street. Around them all are homes, some with large red swastikas on their faades. I emerge from one without a swastika and look at all this. What am I doing on my way to work?                    AVEEK SEN

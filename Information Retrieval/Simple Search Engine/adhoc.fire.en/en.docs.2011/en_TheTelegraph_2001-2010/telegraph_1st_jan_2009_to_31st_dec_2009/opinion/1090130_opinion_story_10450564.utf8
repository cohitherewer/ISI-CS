	Mister Pip By Lloyd Jones, John Murray, pound;12.99
    
	A group of children in a small village on a tropical island in the South Pacific being read to from Great Expectations by a solitary white man sounds like an unlikely plot even for a novel. But Lloyd Jones makes this come alive by allowing us to get under the skin of the narrator, Matilda, a teenager whose father has gone away to work in Australia, leaving her with her domineering, if long-suffering, mother on an island full of myths and stories.  
	Yet it is not these stories that transform Matildas life, and even that of the village. This happens when Mr Watts, popularly known as Pop Eye, the only white man in the village, married though he is to a black woman called Grace, begins to read from Great Expectations to the children in the old schoolhouse. The author of the book is introduced as Mr Dickens to the children, and the book as the greatest he ever wrote.        
	A strange and a completely unknown world opens up before the children who know nothing of the world beyond the ocean that surrounds their island. Through a mysterious process, Matilda and her friends come to occupy the world of Pip, the protagonist of the novel, and of 19th-century London. Matilda, to use her own phrase, gets under the skin of Pip, and he becomes her secret friend. Any reader will recognize this experience. Books can overwhelm us, even take over our lives and radically alter them.        
	On the beach, Matilda makes her shrine for Pip, with his name written on the sand and decorated with shells. She doesnt know the consequences that this is to have for the small village as it gets engulfed in rebellion and counter-insurgency. The latter forces, on one of their raids, discover this shrine and want to know who the man Pip is. There is no answer. So they burn the village. In another raid, they discover Mr Watts, who says he is Pip, and they kill him. They also rape and kill Matildas mother, who says that she is Gods witness to the fact that Mr Watts was murdered.        
	In between these two raids, a group of rebels arrives to which, over seven nights, Mr Watts narrates his life story. The entire village listens to this telling and young Matilda realizes that he has actually taken on some aspects of Pips story, and even of the myths and stories about the island that he had heard from his late wife.        
	The novel thus acquires many layers. Matildas discovery of Great Expectations and the joys of reading; the history of the village as it gets involved in rebellion and its suppression; the story of Mr Watts as he tells it. To these is added a final layer. Matilda, now without her mother and her mentor, Mr Watts, is helped by a few elders to escape from the island, and she goes to join her father in Australia, near Brisbane.        
	Thus begins Matildas journey to womanhood, of reading Dickens and of self-discovery. Mr Watts, she finds much to her dismay and surprise, had actually read to them from an abridged version of Dickenss novel. She reads the original and this the first step towards her attempt to become a Dickens scholar. Before she leaves to do her research in London, she also traces the roots of Mr Watts  a search that has its own moments of bewilderment and poignancy.        
	In London, tired and depressed pursuing Dickens one day in her bedsit, Matilda turned over the topsheet of her paper on Dickens Orphans, and wrote, Everyone called him Pop Eye. That line is the first sentence of this novel. Out of an obscure village, through a tortuous route, is born a novelist.        
	It is difficult to put this book down. There is no need to know Great Expectations to love this novel. The writing explores the inner world of a sensitive girl as she reads, learns, and sees violence and kindness around her. The novel grows with the girl, her sense of loss and discovery. There are passages of great beauty and sadness, just as there are pages that describe a cruel, bare-knuckle reality. Over all its richness, it is also a novel about reading and its mysterious joys.

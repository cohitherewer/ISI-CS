The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | THE UPPER HOUSE
                                                                                                                 THE UPPER HOUSE                                                          
	It is significant that in the Constitution of India the Rajya Sabha is referred to as the Council of States and the Lok Sabha as the House of the People. In thus describing the two houses of parliament, the founding fathers indicated the objectives of the two chambers, as well as the focus of their powers and functions. The presence of an Upper House or a House of Elders is premised on the logic of providing a corrective to decisions arrived at in the Lower House. In Great Britain, the members of the House of Lords are representatives of the Crown. India, being a proud republic, could not, of course, create an upper chamber completely modelled on the House of Lords. The founding fathers looked across the Atlantic to borrow from the constitution of the United States of America and to create a federal chamber. This is reflected in the name Rajya Sabha or the Council of States. This aim was not fully met because of the system of election to the Rajya Sabha. All the states do not have equal representation in the Council of States. It can be argued that the federal character of the Indian State is not truly reflected in the composition of the Rajya Sabha.        
	There are some other features of the Rajya Sabha that are worth noting. One is that it is a permanent house, it is never dissolved. Similarly, the Rajya Sabha cannot dissolve a government. The founding fathers were thus careful in distinguishing the role and function of the upper chamber from that of the House of the People. In the latter, members are subject to the people who elect them every five years. Members of the Rajya Sabha are not so directly accountable to the people. By raising the age limit of the members of the Rajya Sabha to 30, the founding fathers expected that the level of reflection and debate in the Upper House would go deeper and be more knowledgeable. In the functioning of Indian democracy and in the rough-and-tumble of Indian politics, many, if not most, of the original intentions of creating the Rajya Sabha and a bicameral parliament have fallen by the wayside.        
	It is no longer possible to say with any degree of veracity that the Rajya Sabha reflects the interests of the states. The government in power and the various political parties see the membership of the Upper House as an instrument of extending their patronage. Membership to the Rajya Sabha has become an elaborate rewards system. Individuals who cannot be elected through the popular vote are made members of the Rajya Sabha, and then even made ministers or prime ministers. All this makes a mockery of not only the original purpose and justification of the Council of States but also of the conventions of democracy. The latter are an essential element in the proper functioning of a parliamentary democracy. The Rajya Sabha is crucial for maintaining the federal character of the Indian polity. Let neither be mocked.

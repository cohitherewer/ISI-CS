	Photographs of Rabindranath Tagore are a puzzle. His body language is often not quite in tune with his expression, his posture sometimes subtly out of kilter with his surroundings, his eyes always intriguing, and appearing to change in light and life upon each fresh view. However posed according to the photographic conventions of his time, or by his own desire, his image is disturbingly alive. The exhibition entitled Tagore and the Romance of Travel, at the Rabindranath Tagore Centre, ICCR (Dec 4-16), as part of the ICCR Festival, Tagore Beyond Frontiers, was another reminder of Tagores vitality, not just through the photographs displayed but also through its theme.        
	Curious, adventurous, restless, Tagore describes himself on different occasions as a bird whose wings are set aflutter at every call from across the sea, as a wayfarer on the wide road, always thirsty for the distance, longing to explore the unknown Outside. The picture on top shows him comfortably posing against the rails of the S.S. Ethiopia, leaving for China in 1924, his benign smile belied by the eager tension in his shoulders and the happy concentration in his eyes. Beside him stand Nandalal Bose, Kalidas Nag and Kshitimohan Sen, the apparel of the four men a study in the distinctive fashions of the period.                  
	The text accompanying the photographs deftly touches on Tagores comments about wanderlust as it competently relates the story of Tagores travels all over the world. The exhibition was finely curated by Supriya Roy, capturing in a series of panels the sequence of the poets trips, their durations and destinations, his enjoyment and disappointments, the plays, films and concerts he went to, the extraordinary personalities he met and their reactions to him, the public receptions he received and the honours showered upon him. Apart from the photographs in which Tagore himself figures are those of the famous he met, such as Mussolini and Romain Rolland, punctuated by an occasional reference point, such as the publicity poster for Gilbert and Sullivans The Gondoliers (bottom) that Tagore went to see at the Savoy Theatre in 1890, the Nobel citation (anything else would have been too ironic), or the painting, Dana, by Carolus-Duran, which sent the young Tagore into raptures over the beauty of a beautiful human body.        
	Some of the photographs are quite unusual, although it is always fun to see even familiar pictures in large format. All of them are from the Visva-Bharati collection, but the viewer may look in vain for the photographers identities. That is the shadow that slightly mars the delight of seeing Tagore, for example, as a handsome young man in England, or reading near a window in Denmark, in San Isidro, in the Forbidden City, in Villeneuve, with Helen Keller or Sigmund Freud, or surrounded by rich wall-hangings at the tea party in Ahmedia Garden Springs in Persia, thoughtfully selecting paintings for the exhibition at Moscow, dreaming of the spiritual past and materialistic present of Japan, seated on a carpet in a sheikhs tent in Bushire where he had gone by plane just to experience briefly the pleasures of being an Arab Bedouin that he had imagined in his poetry, visiting the Borobuddur Temple, or just being greeted by people, sometimes thousands of them, in halls, stations and at receptions. The highs and the lows of his visit to Italy unfold through text and image, as do the dramas of friendship and distance, love and distaste in America.         
	A most appealing panel was the one on the modes of travel. It brought home to the viewer the discomfort that Tagore willingly took on in order to see the world and meet its people. The text, quoting from the poets hilarious descriptions of donkeys in Suez City and a horse-drawn carriage in London, is only surpassed by the photographs, one of which has Tagore on a rickshaw in China, being carried in a litter in Germany, and, the best of all, being solemnly lowered in a barrel from a ship by crane because he wishes to see Sri Aurobindo at Pondicherry.         
	At Baghdad railway station, Tagores unforgettable face is seen in the distance, framed by the darkness of the coachs interior, looking out upon the seething mass waiting to greet him on the platform. But most of the men in the foreground are gazing back at the camera, while the few burqa-clad women look steadfastly at the poet. Surrounded by Tagores face and form, it is impossible to forget Robert Bridgess remark in 1913 that the relevant panel reproduces  the poet is an extraordinarily good-looking fellow.

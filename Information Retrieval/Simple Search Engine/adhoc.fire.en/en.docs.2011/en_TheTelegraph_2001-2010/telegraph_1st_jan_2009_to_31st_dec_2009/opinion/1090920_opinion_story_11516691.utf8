	 Now that Madam has flown economy class and Rahul Gandhi has taken a train, the civil aviation ministry babus at Rajiv Gandhi Bhavan are contemplating some cost-cutting measures. Their boss, Praful Patel, has reportedly come up with a proposal that Air India should sell off its majestic premises in Mumbais Nariman Point to ease the financial burden. But officials perched lower in the pecking order are not terribly excited with Patels plan. The high costs of renting accommodation in an expensive city like Mumbai, they argue, would only make matters worse. Some wise men have also drawn a parallel with Pan Am. The former American national carrier, caught in a terrible cash crunch in the mid-1980s, had put up a massive building at Manhattan on sale. But the carrier went out of business shortly for a few years. It remains to be seen whether Patel would take lessons from the past to secure the future of Indias national carrier.                 
	 The third edition of the Indian Premier League may still be a few months away, but a match is already on between a Rajasthan Royal and a Delhi Daredevil. Vasundhara Raje Scindia, the former chief minister of Rajasthan, has taken on Rajnath Singh, the Bharatiya Janata Party president, in this contest. Raje is yet to resign from the leader of the Opposition post, even as Singh tries to pull strings from the capital to make her quit. But despite Singhs best efforts, Raje has not budged from her seat, forcing partymen to quip that the Rajasthan Royal seems to be ahead of the Delhi Daredevil in this whole new ball game.                            
	 Indias rajneeti is guided by the stars. Often, it is also a family affair. With the inauspicious shraadh behind us, and three states bound for polls, one is seeing hectic parleys in the corridors of power. Expectedly, leaders are fighting over tickets for their wives, sons and other relatives, but this time around, in the Congress camp at least, the wives seem to hold the edge. In Haryana, the outgoing CM, Bhupinder Singh Hooda, wants his wife to be given a chance to fight from his constituency, Rohtak, while he moves to another seat. Congress MP, Navin Jindal, who represents Kurukshetra, also wants a ticket for his missus, so does Avatar Singh Badana, who is keen to see his wife become a neta in her own right. The manoeuvres, if successful, will not exactly result in the empowerment of women, but they may lead to more jibes about the dynastic culture in Indias Grand Old Party.                            
	 Meanwhile, the by-elections are over in Bihar, and the results have brought the smiles back on Congressmens faces. But hasnt the Congress, fighting without allies, won just two seats? That may be the case, but Congress workers are happy because of two reasons and are quite open about the first. The good showing by the Rashtriya Janata Dal and the Lok Janshakti Party, they say, will convince Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan not to press for a tie-up with the Congress. Senior leaders in the Congress had been trying to make the duo understand for a long time that caste equations in Bihar are such that if the RJD, LJP and the Congress were to fight together, they would only help Nitish Kumars Janata Dal (United) net the bulk of upper caste votes. But in the event of the Congress going alone, it would wean away a sizeable chunk of these votes from the JD(U), thereby spelling trouble for Nitish. But what Congressmen are perhaps loath to share is the second reason for their glee. A better showing by Lalu Prasad and Paswan, they think, will put an end to the duos constant demands for rejoining the UPA bandwagon.                            
	 Renuka Chowdhury may have lost the parliamentary polls, but there is no stopping her from making uncomfortable noises. We heard that she has shot off a letter to the home minister, accusing the ministry of failing to curb the Maoist problem in her native state. Some in the Congress feel that this is nothing more than an attempt to hog the limelight, but the Andhra Congress, we are told, has pressed the high command to take disciplinary action against her. But will it quieten Chowdhury for a while?                            
	 Natwar Singh has also demanded a brief stint of silence from the embattled Shashi Tharoor in the hope that the Congress will appreciate his peace-making abilities and reopen the doors for him. But Singhs hopes, like those of Andhra Congressmen, are likely to be snuffed out, say the pundits.

	 Lodhi Gardens is a favourite among netas, babus and businessmen. A few middle class enclaves have come up near it as well, and morning walkers  from all classes  strolling briskly on the lawns are a common sight. The BJP leader, Arun Jaitley, has now achieved something special on these greens: a little, shady spot has been rechristened as Jaitley Corner.      
	This has got Congressmen worried because members of Indias first family are also known to take their walks on these very grounds. Before another battle starts with the Congress attacking the BJP for biting off a slice of its turf, the mystery behind Jaitley Corner needs to be unravelled. Some morning walkers apparently often see Jaitley sipping tea and nimbu paani with his friends on a bench in a corner. The lucky ones among them have also been invited on occasions to share the goodies that are provided by one of Jaitleys friends. We think that it is this last gesture that has helped Jaitley earn a name for himself in the park.

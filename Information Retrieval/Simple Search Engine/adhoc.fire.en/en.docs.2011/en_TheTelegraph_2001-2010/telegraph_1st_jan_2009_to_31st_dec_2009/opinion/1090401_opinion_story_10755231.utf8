The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Recuse me, please
                                                                                                                 RECUSE ME, PLEASE                                  There has been a sudden rise in the incidence of judges being asked to withdraw from cases. Rahul Jayaram probes the motives behind the practice                          Long road to justice: A memorial for the victims of the Uphaar cinema fire 10 years after the tragedy took place                                  
	Recuse me, please! may well be the newest catchphrase for judges in India. Recusal, in legal parlance, refers to a judge abstaining from participation in an official action such as a legal proceeding. And, from the looks of it, the rise in the incidence of judges withdrawing from high-profile cases has become the focal point of a fracas between one group of the legal fraternity and another. Lawyers have been taking on judges and the latter have also been hitting back.        
	Legal experts say that recusal comes into play when a judge has a close relationship or friendship with a party whose case is pending before her/him. Under these circumstances, the lawyer puts in a plea asking a judge to be removed from the case as he or she may be biased.        
	Of late, a series of events has brought the term recusal into the limelight. Recently, Justice Arijit Pasayat of the Supreme Court, who was heading a bench hearing a case relating to the Bangalore-Mysore corridor project  filed by the Nandi Infrastructure Corridor Enterprises against former Prime Minister, H.D. Deve Gowda  withdrew himself from the case following an application by Gowdas lawyer, senior Supreme Court advocate Shanti Bhushan. The reason: Gowda had been rapped by Judge Pasayat during an earlier hearing and he thought the judge may be subconsciously biased.        
	In January, in the kidnapping case against Punjab inspector general of police Sumedh Singh Saini and three other police officials, the mother of one of those missing alleged a nexus between the judge and the accused. According to the litigant, the judge and the accused hailed from Chandigarh, were classmates in a masters course in history at Punjab University, and were presumably good friends. She even attached a copy of the result sheet with her petition.        
	In another well known instance of recusal, lawyer and former Union law minister Ram Jethmalani (representing the Ansal brothers in the Uphaar cinema fire case) got Justice B.N. Agrawal who was part of a team hearing the case, to withdraw from the proceedings. Jethmalanis reason was that he had already written articles in the press critical of Agrawal, which could impact the hearing. And, in a curious instance last year, Justice Roshan Dalvi of the Bombay High Court withdrew from the ongoing case between Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) and National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC). RIL had applied to the Bombay High Court seeking the appointment of a new judge on the basis that Justice Dalvi held four shares in NTPC.        
	All these developments have had some judges and judges collectives hot under the collar. Some of the recent instances seem to have misused the feature of recusal, they claim.        
	It is the judges prerogative to withdraw from a case, says an advocate and a member of the Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Association that recently held a meeting in Delhi on the sudden spurt in the number of applications for recusal. It can be brought to the judges notice that there may be a possibility of bias. But judges have been pushed and prodded by certain high-profile lawyers representing powerful politicians to withdraw. It questions the neutrality and freedom of the judiciary. And these are some very senior and experienced judges were talking of. Its a ploy to remove a judge who may not favour your case, for whatever reasons.        
	P.N. Parekh, president, Supreme Court Bar Association, spells out the circumstances, by and large, where a judges recusal from a case kicks in. 1) the judge holds shares in a company whose case hes hearing. 2) S/he happens to be related to one of the lawyers in the case. 3) The judge is found guilty of misbehaviour in court (which is very rare). 4) Lawyers presenting a case feel there is reasonable apprehension of subconscious bias by the judge, he says.        
	Its the last one that falls in a grey area and is open to manipulation, Parekh and other legal experts claim.        
	However, there is no written clause or provision in the annals of Indian law enumerating the grounds on which recusal can take place, explains P.C. Agarwal, advocate, Supreme Court. In that sense, it is an informal process, although it does involve some paperwork whereby a lawyer who does not want a judge to hear a case puts in an application with the court, spelling out his reasons for the judge to be removed from the case.        
	But a judge can refuse to recuse too. Withdrawing from a case is entirely the judges discretion, and if a judge feels that he has been unfairly asked to withdraw, he too can file a counter application in the same court, says Agarwal.         
	Former chief justice of Delhi High Court Rajinder Sachar admits that recusals are not always completely aboveboard, but at the same time he plays down the number of such cases. Yes, we have had cases of judges having to recuse (often being pushed by lawyers), but these are few and far between, he stresses. But if there have been cases of lawyers digging up dirt on a judge to ascertain if indeed he will be biased, then that is very unfortunate. And yes, recusal is open to misuse sometimes, he says.        
	Senior advocate Shanti Bhushan insists that lawyers are just doing their job here. It is the duty of the counsel to bring it to the notice of the judge that he or she may be biased in a case. If a litigant feels there is reasonable apprehension of that, then he can ask for a case to be transferred. It is standard legal practice, he emphasises.         
	Though many judges are miffed by the recusal applications pouring in, noted cyber affairs lawyer Pawan Duggal stresses that the practice is actually one more method of empowering the litigant. Its use and misuse lies entirely in the hands of the lawyer, he says.

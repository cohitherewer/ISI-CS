The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A Hero for the People
                                                                                                                 A HERO FOR THE PEOPLE                                  MALVIKA sINGH                              
	Watching the captains of Indian industry adulate Narendra Modi, by suggesting that he was the best man to lead India, and then, a few days later, to see the same men, possibly wearing the same suits, flattering the prime minister in Mumbai, virtually in denial about what they had said loud and clear in Ahmedabad, was sickening, to say the least. One would have expected Ratan Tata and Sunil Bharti Mittal, two exceptional businessmen, to have been businesslike: keep their distance from Modi or any other politician, control their emotions and thereby set a new benchmark, which would determine the future relationship between business and politics that have got tangled in knots of togetherness. The ghost of the command economy, which had caused the two to become completely interdependent, and had, in the process, set the stage for corruption and malpractice to enter the scene, seems to be alive and kicking.        
	The phrase, to curry favour, a strange Indianism, is an apt one to describe almost everyone in the business community. Yet, the recent hypocrisy that the public was witness to was unwarranted. Hailing Modi in rhetorical superlatives and then praising Manmohan Singh for what he has accomplished during his tenure, all in the same breath, left much to be desired. If only the prime minister, in his speech at the the Economic Times Awards ceremony, had responded to their muted praise, had compared it with their earlier gung-ho comments on the expertise of Modi, had then poked some fun at them, forcing them to fiddle about in their chairs, it would have made for some entertaining visuals on television and a good copy. The real problem is that the businessmen are a pampered lot, forever whining about what they have not been given, wanting everything on a platter, including safeguards for themselves, even as they deliver speeches about the free market economy and the need to take risks.                 
	Plot lost        
	But all is forgotten when the chips are down. Then they come running to the government for their bailouts. Entrenched in corrupt corporate governance, using slush funds to take care of the politicians and the bureaucracy, these professionals are no better, in terms of their ethics of operation, than the political class, which they damn and abuse with consistency.         
	Sanjay Dutt is a competent actor, but seeing him on his Lucknow rath was like watching a third-rate farce. Comparing him to Mahatma Gandhi was equally ludicrous. Have we, as a people, lost the plot? Surely, these are not the men and women, however well-meaning they might be, who will extricate India from the mess we are in? On the other side of the globe is a Barack Obama making history, trying to step out of the box, connecting and communicating, wanting to change the course. When will politics become a worthy profession, and not merely a stomping ground for those with no expertise? When will the Indian political space cease to be a haven for all those who have blotted their copy book with corruption?        
	Until a radical cleansing happens and purges the dirt out of the system of governance, the organized and unorganized sectors of the economy will not mature. Therefore, the first thing that needs to be done is to break the nexus. This can only be done by the government of India.        
	The prime minister needs to show us that if there are any political leaders of any party involved in aiding and abetting the deals in the Satyam-Maytas case for a start, the State will not protect them. Instead, it will denounce and dismiss them, particularly if they happen to be from the ruling party that he heads. This one move could herald change. He will be a hero for the people of India, a modern Mahatma.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Glimpses of promise, marred by shoddy training
                                                                                                                 GLIMPSES OF PROMISE, MARRED BY SHODDY TRAINING                                  MUSIC - Ashwin Sahay                                                  
	The sparse attendance at the Debut Concert at the Sandr Hall of the Calcutta School of Music belied the promise of a students concert of such a reputed school. The ensuing performances proved to be a travesty of the phrase debut concert.        
	A debut is the first public appearance of an emerging artist, a performance by a carefully taught and well-rehearsed student embarking on a career in music. That was unfortunately not the case. However, there were glimpses of promise that need better preparation, more attention to choice of repertoire and musical and technical instruction.        
	The evening began with a guitar solo played by Raktim Ray. Dependent as usual on electronic amplification, Raktims presentation of J.S. Bachs Suite No. 1 lacked expression and knowledge of interpretation, although there was fairly good intonation most of the time. Raktims poor management of the untidily stapled copies of music between movements was another glaring example of his lack of preparation and irresponsible grooming.        
	The second performer was the 12-year-old violinist, Pramit Sarkar, playing Beethovens Romance in F and the well-known first movement from the Spring sonata. As expected, there was a marked lack of technical preparation and understanding of the nuances of these beautiful works. There was no attention to detail or phrasing in what are considered to be rather mature pieces. Little Pramit doubtless has potential, which was evident in the musical quality of his playing, but this should not be over-exploited till he has grasped the basics of some simpler works. At this stage, more attention should be given to position and bowing techniques.        
	Prosenjit Lahiri sang Schuberts Stndchen. His intonation was very good, but if this was vocal baritone, there was no command over placement or projection. The same can be said of Promod Fernandess rendition of Ave Maria by Schubert. All the vocal performances were made ridiculous by the use of karaoke pseudo-accompaniment. The third tenor, Deep Chakraborty, sang the boringly familiar, Bsame Mucho. Once again, there was no awareness of technique. There is so much to be learnt in presentation and attack. Deeps introduction suffered an interruption due to a lapse in coordination with the track.        
	Sumana Ghosh, the first soprano of the evening, sang Pie Jesu by Faur. Once again, there was evidence of no voice placement and poor training that impaired projection. If it was at all necessary to use a microphone, she should have been taught to use it from a judicious distance. Promod Fernandes then sang Schuberts Ave Maria. Not only were important aspects of vocal placement and projection missing, but no attention was paid to pronunciation. Little Eva Rajans Colours of the Wind was sung in its pop style with pleasing dynamics and good breathing control. It was by far the best vocal offering of the evening. Deep Chakrabortys Bsame Mucho had fairly good intonation but all of the drawbacks of the previous male voices, including that of poor track sync at the start, were there.        
	The guitar offering by Ritwik Bhattacharya was better than the first one. Archan Bhowmik, the only pianist of the evening, played the first movement of Mozarts Sonata in C and the Prelude in C sharp minor by Chopin. It was again marred by a lack of analysis and attention to detail.

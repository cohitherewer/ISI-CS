	Hornets nest                  
	Sir  In The split reality (Nov 20), Ashok Mitra brings to the fore what is already well known  the preferential choice of news designed to bend public opinion in a certain direction. The stark contrast between the wide coverage given to the Centres response to the unrest in the tribal areas and the taciturnity of the fourth estate about the lack of implementation of that response has been well depicted by Mitra. Just why the otherwise active intellectuals and social workers, whose hearts never fail to reach out to the oppressed, have remained relatively inactive about the goings-on in some other parts of the country is indeed intriguing. It is understood that not all news can be given equal prominence. However, it is appalling how a report by a Centrally-appointed committee, pointing directly at the syndicate of State, political classes and private players, failed to stir the hornets nest.          
	Even as the prime minister received extensive media coverage by advocating an act that would allow economic benefits to trickle down to the tribal people, it is disappointing that the same media kept silent about a darker aspect of the same issue. The prime minister urged the states to work together with the Union government. It seems they have done just that  only to create a civil-war-like situation, thanks to the Salwa Judum.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Kaustuv Bhowmik, Hooghly

                
	Sir  Ashok Mitra has blamed Tata Steel and Essar Steel for trying to grab village land rich in iron ore in the Bastar region. Mitra thinks that this is one of the reasons for the adivasi unrest there. Can Mitra then explain why there is tribal unrest in the jungles of West Bengal, where there is no attempt at land-grabbing by business tycoons? In any case, by forcibly taking away land, neither Tata nor Essar would get the title deeds. Forced acquisition will result in social workers, NGOs, independent lawyers, the press and political parties coming to the rescue of the dispossessed. Also, the judiciary in India is considered fair and equitable  the rich have often lost cases against the common man.          
	It is only the State that can grab land by force, as was done in Singur. It is funny that the States tyranny in Bastar has been condemned by Marxists, yet similar atrocities by the Leftist government in West Bengal was approved of by the left-leaning intellectuals. Mitra has castigated the Salwa Judum but has kept silent on what Leftist cadres are doing against the tribal people of Bengal.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Better late than never          
	Sir  The employees of the government of West Bengal must realize the importance of their duties and put serious emphasis on their assigned jobs over personal gains. (Late lamented, Nov 20). Bengals reputation for work culture has steadily declined. The state is becoming a laughing stock as work progresses at snails pace here, as opposed to the chief ministers Do it now doctrine. The Left Front government has been at the helm of affairs since 1977. It is largely responsible for the pathetic state of affairs. It has always failed to draw the line between polity and administration, and encouraged indiscriminate trade unionism. Unwarranted protests from trade unions made the administration ineffective. The usual norms and decorum of office started dwindling and employees began to reap undue benefits. The former chief minister had lamented the high rate of absenteeism, but had failed to punish delinquent officials. Even superannuated pensioners of the state government have to run from pillar to post to move their files.          
	However, all is not lost. The government needs to initiate harsh measures to curb the intransigence. Else, things will go from bad to worse.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Indranil Sanyal, Calcutta

                
	Sir  In a welcome move, the finance minister of Bengal, Asim Dasgupta, has embarked on an initiative to make the government function better by administering a renewed work culture among the babus of Writers Building. This has prompted some employees to revolt against a circular that enforces punctuality. Lame excuses have been cooked up to explain latecoming. Even press photographers were attacked as they tried to document the routine ritual of reporting late and early dispersal from work. It is shameful that these officials have no remorse although they earn hefty salaries, incentives and bonus.          
	The government should not compromise with the trouble-makers. If a strict stand forces employees to behave themselves then that will be a relief for those who come to Writers Building from afar to settle important matters. The government should enforce the rule by which continued latecoming for three days would lead to the forfeiting of a days leave. It should also consider installing modern gadgets for recording the time of arrival of the employees.          
	Yours faithfully,

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | MORTAL Subject
                                                                                                                 MORTAL SUBJECT                                                    
	The debate over the right to end a life, either through abortion or assisted suicide, puts the State in a strange quandary. This is one area of human rights that the State finds impossible to relocate to the black-and-white domain of legal rights from the nebulous grey region of natural rights. The right to die a dignified death is truly a legal no-mans land, as Charles Falconer, the former Lord Chancellor of Britain, has observed. Mr Falconers remark vindicates the overwhelming public support for euthanasia, or medically assisted suicide for the terminally ill, in his country. Shortly after 85-year-old Edward Downes, a reputed British conductor, and his 74-year-old wife, Joan, a ballet dancer, ended their lives at a clinic in Switzerland, an opinion poll in The Times revealed that 74 per cent of the respondents want euthanasia to be legalized in Britain. The mass support for mercy killing stems from a purely humanitarian instinct of sparing the incurably ill the indignity of a slow death. Joan Downes, for instance, had recently learnt that she had terminal cancer, and wanted to go before her vigour gave way to a vegetative state. Edward Downes, her companion of more than five decades, had lost his hearing and sight, two of the most precious faculties for a musician and bibliophile. Without his wife, his life would have lost all meaning.        
	The argument against assisted suicide, like the rationale provided by the pro-life lobby, is often solely based on botched-up moral proprieties bred by religion. Beyond such crudities, there are more sophisticated reasons for not endorsing euthanasia as a fundamental right. There is always the danger, especially in developing countries, that such a privilege would be misused. In India, for instance, there is the fear that assisted suicide may lead to the further prospering of the already thriving racket in organ transplant. Indian society also abounds with instances of elderly relations being neglected, tortured, even murdered for inheritance. Yet it is also imperative that enlightened societies do not spawn autocratic governments that put an absolute and unthinking embargo on certain fundamental premises of human life  primarily on the right to govern ones own life through informed choice. So long as there is voluntary consent, compassion, not control, should preside over such matters of life and death.

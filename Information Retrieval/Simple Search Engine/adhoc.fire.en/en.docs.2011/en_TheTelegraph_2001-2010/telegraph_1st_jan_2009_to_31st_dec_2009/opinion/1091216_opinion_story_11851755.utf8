	Tricky clause                  
	Sir  The state government has consented to the proposal to set up a coach factory in Singur. But the Trinamul Congress has demanded that the disputed 400 acres of land be returned to the unwilling farmers (Rail Singur nod with rider, Dec 10). Under the Land Acquisition Act, the State reserves the right to acquire land, which must be used for public purposes. Once the land has already been acquired, how can the government go about the task of returning it? In Singur especially, it would not be possible to till the land even if it were made available to the farmers because the Tatas had operated on it for a considerable period of time.          
	An industry cannot come up on patches of land interspersed with cultivated fields. If the 400 acres are returned, the remaining 600 acres cannot be stitched together to form a contiguous stretch adequate in shape and size to accommodate an industry. Besides, one wonders whether the disputed land can ever be satisfactorily redistributed among the farmers so that each gets land of the same size and productivity as the one he used to own.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Kaustuv Bhowmik, Hooghly

                
	Sir  Singur is once again in the limelight (Singur game in full flow, Dec 9). Mamata Banerjee has proposed to set up a coach factory on the land vacated by the Tatas. The government is willing to co-operate if Banerjee is serious about the proposal. However, the TMC is unwilling to negotiate on its demand that the 400 acres of land acquired illegally from unwilling farmers by the West Bengal government be returned.           
	The whole issue of land acquisition has thus come alive again. Both sides are yet to reach an agreement on how much of the land belongs to unwilling farmers. Unless this basic issue is resolved, the coach factory, which has generated hope among the people of the area, will not see the light of day. Only if both sides sit down together will they be able to to redeem their past mistakes.          
	Yours faithfully,        Prabhakar Bhattacharya,

	Sir  Bengal is bracing itself for yet another political drama. Mamata Banerjees tricky clause is well thought-out and comes as a political googly to the Left Front government, which had never imagined that it would be invited by the ministry of railways for a joint venture in Singur. But is Banerjees scheme practicable? If she manages to pull off this feat, her capability to work for the good of the state will be proved.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Singur has become a political football, and the people of West Bengal have given the TMC a penalty. If the TMC misses the shot, it will move further away from its target victory in the 2011 assembly elections. But whether or not Mamata Banerjee comes to power is hardly a concern for the people of West Bengal. They want industrialization and employment in the state. They are not willing to be mere spectators of a political game.The electorate is keen to find out how Banerjee will fulfil her promise of returning the 400 acres that were taken from unwilling farmers in Singur. The TMCs claim gives the impression that it is easy to return the 400 acres. Intellectuals and activists have firmly supported the TMC in this. The people of Bengal are eagerly waiting to see what the TMC can accomplish in extra time before 2011. It is easy to score a penalty but a miss may prove costly.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Not cool          
	Sir  Stephen Hugh-Joness article, Icons without charisma (Nov 25), gives a general idea of the way language is freely utilized today. However, such misuse does not stop at the improper application of charismatic and iconic. Consider the commentary during any cricket match. With a few exceptions, most commentators are rather liberal with superlatives. The most modest of shots going for a boundary is likely to fetch raptures of spectacular, magnificent, brilliant, terrific, and, what I believe is their favourite, outstanding. Two or three shots may indeed be outstanding, but to say that every single stroke stands out would be a bit of an over-statement.           
	The thoughtless use of superlatives is, however, just a small aspect of the much more serious issue of the decadence of language. In urban India, for instance, the vocabulary of half of the youthful population is filled with such asinine words as cool, chill, cute and so on. Every sentence they utter in their mother tongue is laced with half-formed English phrases, which ruin the essence of both languages, affirming the users knowledge of neither. They idolize the perfidy of the Chetan Bhagats, instead of the assiduity of the R.K. Narayans. With remarks similar to like, cool hai yaar!, they leave you wondering about the true relevance of climate change today. Such inanities can only be arrested by intelligent reading. But you tell them that, and they might remark, R.K. Narayan, like, who?                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Step out          
	Sir  There has been a steady rise in the number of high-end schools in the city (School cool, Nov 29). Their intentions may be noble, but they come across as nothing more than extensions of business houses that have turned education into a commodity. I feel that amidst all the glamour and technology, the very essence of learning is lost. If students answer questions in class by pressing a key, they fail to interact and communicate with those around them. Even if one fails to respond in class, there is no sense of shame. But going through the humiliation of failure is an important experience. Being over-protected can be extremely detrimental to the development of children who will have to step out into the real world eventually. If they lead cocooned lives in air-conditioned classrooms and always travel in air-conditioned buses, they will feel displaced when the time comes to face real life.          
	Yours faithfully,

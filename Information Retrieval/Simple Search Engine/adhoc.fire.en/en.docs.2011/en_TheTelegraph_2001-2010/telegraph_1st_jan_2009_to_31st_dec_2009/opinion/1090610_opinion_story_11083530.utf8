	Mighty fall                  
	Sir  Ashok Mitras article, The fate of man (June 5), opened a floodgate of memories concerning George Fernandes. There was a time, according to Mitra, when Fernandes could do no wrong. Fernandes had even won the parliamentary elections from Muzaffarpur by a margin of almost 400,000 votes. However, in the elections to the 15th Lok Sabha, he fared miserably from the same constituency, and his deposit was forfeited. Many will agree with Mitra that Fernandes himself is responsible for his downfall. One would do well to remember the unsavoury revelations made by a leading magazine against Fernandes. It is said that if someone were to destroy a man, he should be put in power for sometime. Fernandess unquenchable thirst for power finally brought him down from his pedestal.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Prabhat Sen Sarma, Hooghly 

                
	Sir  The political legacy of George Fernandes cannot be forgotten. Fernandes was a dyed-in the-wool Lohiaite. Ashok Mitra has highlighted some memorable facts about Fernandess career perhaps in the hope that they will be shared by the youth. Fernandes may not have had a large number of friends, but he fought his political battles sincerely and with a lot of commitment. However, I find it strange that Mitra did not mention Fernandess role in the creation of the National Democratic Alliance. Fernandes was one of the pioneering architects of the NDA and had played a stellar role as the convenor of the regime during its stint at the Centre. Mitra, an ardent leftist, expectedly, has his share of differences with the Hindu-Right, including the Bharatiya Janata Party and its allies. The Left has even supported the Congress in the past. But Fernandes maintained his anti-Congress stand and even managed to form a non-Congress government without the help of Left parties. For this reason alone, the people of India will hold him dear to their hearts despite their differences with him.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Jayanta Datta, Chinsurah, Hooghly 

                
	Sir  Ashok Mitra seems to be amused at the fate that befell George Fernandes. In a democracy, the rise and fall of politicians is a natural phenomenon unlike communist countries where disgraced politicians are treated shabbily by the party. In a democratic country, the fate of a leader is decided by the people, and not by the ruling satraps.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Crumbling city          
	Sir  I am writing to you to express my anguish at the state of the civic infrastructure in Calcutta. The citys civic problems seem to have magnified after the last elections. I would also like to point out that the media have failed to mobilize public opinion on this crucial issue. Even as the rest of India marches forward, Calcutta lags behind with its pot-holed roads. The roads seem to have been created for the sole purpose of doling out money to contractors, rather than as carriageways for vehicles. There are a number of excuses that are cited for this appalling state of affairs, and the lack of finances is only one of them. Similar sloppy excuses are given to explain the abysmal condition of the other aspects of the citys civic infrastructure. The media must also take the blame for not assessing the achievements and failures of the civic administration in a comprehensive manner. Unless the media take it upon themselves to utilize laws such as the Right to Information Act, and publicize the successes and failures of public institutions, the citizens will have little hope of having access to a better civic life.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Indranil Sarker, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Are we living in a metropolitan city? The infrastructure in Calcutta seems to be woefully inadequate to tackle natural disasters such as the one we had recently. Aila was a nightmare for the people of Calcutta. These days, the prospect of yet another cyclone hitting the city makes the Calcutta Municipal Corporation more scared than the people. The reason the corporation is worried is because it lacks the infrastructure that is required to provide services during an emergency. But then this is nothing new for the corporation; a spell of rain for even a couple of hours causes water logging in most parts of the city. The question is who will take responsibility for the loss of lives and property during the devastating cyclone? The mayor has stated that the corporation will be able to take lessons and improve on its performance if another cyclone were to strike the city. One wonders whether this was said in jest, or whether this is the time to crack jokes even as numerous residents continue to suffer due to the lack of amenities such as food, water and electricity.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Old is gold          
	Sir  Leander Paes must be congratulated for winning the French Open doubles title (Double delight for Paes, Dlouhy, June 7). This is Paess ninth Grand Slam title, and it proves, once again, that age is certainly not a factor in sport. In the final, Paes got injured in the middle of the final game but returned to play the winning shot after receiving some treatment. His determination, optimism and tenacity have turned Paes into an icon among young tennis players. Injuries, illness, even the famous split with Mahesh Bhupathi have failed to break Paess iron will. Like Hemingways immortal character, Santiago, it seems that Paes believes that a man can be destroyed but not defeated.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Anindya Bhattacharya, Calcutta

	Indians who want a break from the stressful system of marks-based admission should look at China. Here too, the pre-university national examination is a killer. Only high-scorers can get into the countrys best universities. However, for some institutes, students also need background certificates that rule out gang and cult membership and criminal records, including those of close relatives. In police and army training institutes, candidates also need a no-objection certificate from the local police. This is now being used to blackmail trouble-makers.         
	Two such instances were reported in the press last month. In the first, the candidate was denied the NOC to a prestigious institute because her father had once been imprisoned for three days for petitioning the authorities. The village committee had not repaid money borrowed from him way back in 1997 despite repeated reminders; he, therefore, began approaching officials. In 2005, his food processing plant closed down. His petitions intensified. In 2006, he was detained for three days for disturbing social order, and told that if he agreed to the loan being repaid in instalments, he would be freed. Later, the village officials took him out to dinner as an apology. Till date, only the interest on the loan has been repaid, not the principal amount.        
	When she found out the reason for the police denying her the certificate, the student, though devastated, tried to keep it to herself and went off to her grandmothers house. But she couldnt help confiding in the old lady, who immediately informed her parents. The father was consumed with guilt, but the girl told him not to blame himself, or beg in front of anyone. She could apply to another institute, or even go into some other field. But the father decided to call the local newspaper hotline. After the story broke, the police gave the certificate, apparently on the villagers intervention.                 
	Zealous press        
	The parents now run a barbecue stall in Beijing, to supplement their income and pay for their daughters tuition, so that she can realize her childhood dream of wearing a police uniform. The institute she has joined will train her to work in a court or a prison; her ultimate aim is to become a judge.        
	The other student wasnt so lucky. A daughter of farmers, this high-scoring candidate wanted to join the military academy because not only was it free, but she would also get a subsidy for studying there, and be assured of a secure job. But the local police refused to give her an NOC because in 2007, her parents had been imprisoned for 15 days after they got into a scuffle with their neighbours over a land dispute. The officer whod dealt with their case was the one who had to sign the form. When the girls mother argued that their actions should not affect their daughter, he replied, Even if your kid has astronomical talent, shes not going. So long as Im alive, Im not signing this. Meetings with the district-level officers proved to be of no use.        
	The parents decided to inform the press. After denying that the officer had said these words, the police told the reporter that they werent too sure about the background standards needed for admission to a military academy; but they were sure that they must be stricter than those for a police academy. The reporter checked out the guidelines. A criminal sentence or Party disciplinary proceedings meted out to close family members debarred a candidate; imprisonment of parents by public security officials was nowhere listed.         
	After the story appeared, the district officials, whod refused to intervene earlier, approached the family with offers of monetary compensation. But admission to that academy had, by then, closed. These episodes show the dangers of protesting; but equally, the zeal  and power  of a controlled press.

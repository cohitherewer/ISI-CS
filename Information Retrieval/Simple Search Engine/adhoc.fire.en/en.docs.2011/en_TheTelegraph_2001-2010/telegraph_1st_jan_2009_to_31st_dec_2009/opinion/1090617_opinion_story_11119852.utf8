	A political party in the throes of an identity crisis needs more than a superficial introspection. The Bharatiya Janata Party, perhaps because it is incapable of realizing that it faces an identity crisis, is not even engaging in any kind of introspection. It is merely playing the game of blaming various people. The identity of the Bharatiya Janata Party is tied to the star of Hindutva. The impolite way of saying the same thing is that the BJP is a puppet on a string that is held by the leaders of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh in Nagpur. Whenever the BJP has attempted to break out of the dominance of the RSS, it has been reduced, even in electoral terms, to a ridiculous minority. The problem is that the BJP leadership realizes that it cannot even attempt to rule India as a national party under the flag of Hindutva. It has to refashion its ideology into an inclusive one. To do this would be to take away the birthmark of the BJP and to leave it without its original identity. This is the fundamental problem with the BJP that neither its leadership nor the puppeteers in Nagpur are willing to address. The issue is important if the BJP is to survive as a party capable of forming a shadow cabinet to the Congresss real one.        
	At the present juncture, the BJP is in no position to offer a coherent opposition to the United Progressive Alliance government. It does not know what its role should be because its very identity is under threat. While the BJP leadership is in sleep mode, it has been subjected to sniper attacks from some figures who fancy themselves to be important Hindutva leaders. The unfortunate truth is that no one in the sangh parivar sees them as such. A former civil servant, a minor princeling of yesteryear and a lapsed journalist cannot claim that they are insiders of the parivar. Like a communist party, the parivar also has its own hierarchy where years of dedicated service are always privileged over the Johnnies-come-lately. These sniper attacks are therefore of very little consequence. What is critical are the BJPs refusal to recognize its plight and the fact that it has an octogenarian leader who is unwilling to admit that his best days of service to the party are over. Under the circumstances, the best that the BJP can hope for is to be a lame-duck Opposition party with even more dwindling influence outside the Lok Sabha.

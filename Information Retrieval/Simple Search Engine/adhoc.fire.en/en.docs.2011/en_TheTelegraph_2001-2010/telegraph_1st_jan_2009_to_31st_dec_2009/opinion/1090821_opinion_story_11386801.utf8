	The Story of a widow By Musharraf Ali Farooqi, Picador, Rs 495        
	The title of Musharraf Ali Farooqis novel tells it all. The novel deals with an unexpected decision of a middle- aged widow that entirely changes her quiet life. In this novel, Farooqi ventures into two uncharted territories, which even seasoned novelists would have tried to avoid.         
	First, he enters a world that most male novelists fight shy of  the psyche of a woman. Second, he attempts to tell the story of a middle-aged widow, not of a young lady. Both these areas are not only difficult but are also fraught with dangers for Farooqi, as he is still far away from experiencing the trials and tribulations of middle-aged life. After all, fiction is not only about writing a story. It is also about the ability of the novelist to make the reader so involved in the world of fiction that he becomes a part of it. Farooqi certainly has the ability to overcome the hurdles involved in the process. But it is difficult to say whether he has succeeded in doing so.        
	The novel starts with a widow, Mona, staring at the portrait of her dead husband, Akbar Ahmed. This makes her feel that he is constantly with her. She hung it in her living room, where she spent most of her time. The portrait played an important role in her life. When her husband died, Mona led a quiet life, for he had left her a comfortable income and two daughters who were happily married. She led a routine life until the arrival of a widowed tenant next door. Salamat Ali proposed to marry her, and this changed her life. She was forced to take a decision against her familys wishes. The more she tried to assert herself, the more the members of her family tried to save her from what society would consider a dishonour. The portrait, too, seemed to express its discontent at her decision. Nevertheless, Mona married Ali. It was only after sometime that Ali showed his true colour, and Mona realized that she had come too far to retreat.         
	Mona is the most important character in the novel, and Farooqi tries to make her life-like. She is a woman who fights not only for her own right to enjoy life, but also against the hypocrisies of a conservative society. Salamat Ali is depicted as a highly unpredictable person. Though he is the most important man in the life of the widow and an ardent lover, he is also instrumental in bringing grief to the lady.         
	Mona, on the other hand, is calm and quiet, although she is capable of taking tough decisions. When Ali unceremoniously breaks into her life, she does not like it, but slowly comes to accept the fact that she likes the attention she gets from this stranger. Similarly, when she comes to know the darker side of the man in her life, she takes some time to arrive at a judgment. Mona is a modern woman trapped in an outdated society. She is neither moved easily when happiness knocks at her door, nor is devastated when things go awry. The Story of a Widow is also a family drama. Although it is set in Karachi, it could very much be an account of any Indian city where the joint family is still alive.         
	Farooqi is good at delineating scenes of family squabbles, so much so that it seems he takes pleasure in probing into them. It is surprising that he could devote so much attention to details, and impart such finesse to his work by concentrating on things people usually consider trivial. The novel portrays contemporary Karachi society, with its attempts to overcome some taboos of Pakistani life. Written in a simple prose hardly found in modern fiction, Farooqis novel will give readers a chance to listen to a new voice from the subcontinent.                     SHAMS AFIF SIDDIQI

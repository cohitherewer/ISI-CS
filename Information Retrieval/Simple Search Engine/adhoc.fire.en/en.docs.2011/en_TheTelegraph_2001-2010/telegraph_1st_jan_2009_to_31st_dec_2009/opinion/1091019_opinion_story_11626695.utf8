                                                                                                                 HARD HIT                                                    
	The steady onslaught of the Taliban in Pakistan is targeted at places where it is supposed to hurt the most  the man on the street and security personnel and installations. Over the past few days, marketplaces and residential areas in Peshawar and Lahore have been bombed with as much impunity as police stations and security locations. The targets have been carefully chosen. The recent anti-Taliban movement in Pakistan which saw the army flush out militants from Swat and spread deeper into the north-west was borne on the shoulders of powerful public opinion against militancy, which in turn propelled the army forward. The violence in Pakistan is aimed at breaking the back of the operation. The bloodshed and the resultant fear and anxiety are expected to force the people  particularly in cities, where opinion is formed and conveyed  to review their support for a State pogrom against the Taliban to ensure peace. The targeting of the army is more sinister. It is supposed to state that the Taliban are no longer happy to play the armys errand boys. They are capable of carrying their war into army cantonments and headquarters, and if pushed, even to nuclear installations. And given their multiple links within the country, with other militant groups deep inside Pakistans hinterland, with political constituencies and members of the civil society and the army, the militants have the potential to set off an unprecedented wave of unrest and discord in Pakistan.         
	The fear is real. Pakistan, which is witnessing the current spate of violence as a fallout of its military operation against the Taliban in the north-west, has no option but to consider more military action in Waziristan and other contiguous areas with the risk of equally frustrating results. The opening up of many fronts of war  in the borders as also in Punjab, from where the recent violence has come  is likely to complicate the civilian governments choices and worsen its relations with the army. It might even spark off a civil war since Pakistan is perilously divided on how to wage the war and against whom it should be fought. What can hold the country together is the army and the civilian leadership working in unison. Unfortunately, the two continue to function at cross-purposes. And the army, simultaneously playing victim and victor, is bound to make a bid in the coming days to wrest the initiative Pakistans Western allies so want to deny it.

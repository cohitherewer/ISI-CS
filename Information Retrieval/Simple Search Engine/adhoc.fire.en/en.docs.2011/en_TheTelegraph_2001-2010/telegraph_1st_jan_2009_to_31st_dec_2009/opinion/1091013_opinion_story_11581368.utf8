                                                                                                                 A ROAD NOT YET TRAVELLED                          - World-class institutions of higher education have to be paid for					 					      Bhaskar Dutta                                                            
	Kapil Sibal has been amongst the most lsquo;visible rsquo; of cabinet ministers in the present United Progressive Alliance government. The minister for human resource development has shown indefatigable enthusiasm in formulating schemes and plans for the education sector, as well as in meeting various stakeholders and the media. Unfortunately, his efforts do not seem have fetched him the rewards that he was perhaps hoping to receive. The gulf between goals and likely achievements grows ever wider.  
	A symptom of the malaise in higher education is the agitation launched by faculty members of the Indian institutes of technology. Despite several months of protests and demonstrations, and some meetings between government officials and representatives from the teachers, the latest announcement of pay scales has been judged grossly inadequate by the IIT faculty. Scientists from institutes such as the Indian Institute of Science as well as faculty from the various Indian institutes of management are very likely to come to the same conclusion.  
	The specific points of disagreement between the IIT teachers and the government are not as important as some of the broader issues connected with the higher education sector  although they are clearly related. Manmohan Singh and his government want to set up several world-class educational institutions, and presumably maintain the standards of the existing institutions. What bundle of salaries and other facilities will be sufficient to attract world-class researchers, the overwhelming bulk of whom are currently outside the country, to return to India? What will induce bright young engineers to choose an academic career in the IITs instead of entering the vastly more lucrative private sector? How will the very large expenditures be financed?                    
	Unfortunately, this does not imply that academic salaries are adequate. Some numbers may put things in perspective. The starting salary of an assistant professor in economics in a good North American university is over $100,000. Even after adjustment for higher prices in the United States of America by the so-called purchasing power parity index, this figure in Indian rupees will be roughly Rs 1,600,000. So, even if we assume that young economists abroad will readily give up, say, 25 per cent of their PPP-adjusted US incomes in order to return home, they still need to be paid about double the current salaries.        
	Moreover, Sibal and his crew must realize that salaries constitute just one component of a much larger package that researchers take into account when they evaluate alternative job offers. Experimental scientists need state-of-the art laboratories. All researchers, both in the sciences and humanities, need first-rate libraries, computers and software, generous research grants to travel abroad in order to attend conferences and workshops, to work with foreign collaborators. How many Indian institutions offer any of these facilities?        
	The setting up of first-rate educational institutions (or upgrading existing ones) is clearly an expensive business  marginal changes in salaries, minuscule increases in research grants  will simply be money wasted. This raises the question of whether the government should be the sole or even principal financier of higher educational institutions. After all, public money spent on a new university means so much less money available for a new hospital.        
	There is no reason why other providers cannot enter the scene. For instance, the private sector has a relatively small presence in the higher education sector, at least partly because of the widespread feeling that they will charge high fees and thus make high quality education the exclusive preserve of the rich. However, this is not an inevitable consequence, once a corrective mechanism that I discuss later is installed. The private sector has typically entered specific segments of the higher education sector  medicine, management and engineering. Graduates from these institutes earn very attractive salaries almost immediately after they obtain their degrees. Surely, they should be charged the full cost of their education? Indeed, I have always wondered why management institutes need public grants. The government should withdraw almost completely from the scene by giving the IIMs complete autonomy over what they teach, what fees they charge, what salaries they pay their faculty  but ask them to support themselves.         
	Of course, foreign direct investment is typically a very useful source of additional funding in several sectors of the economy. It is tempting to conclude that the entry of foreign universities into the higher education sector will play a similar role. This has been a hotly debated issue in recent times, and the government has refrained from trying to pass the appropriate legislation in the previous Lok Sabha since it was not sure of securing majority support. The Telegraph and other newspapers report that a bill allowing the entry of foreign universities will soon be presented in the current Lok Sabha. If some of the best universities set up campuses in India, it will certainly augment the supply of high quality education in India, and should therefore be encouraged. Unfortunately, this will not be an unmitigated blessing. Presumably, they will offer substantially higher salaries and facilities to their faculties. One consequence of this will be that the better researchers in our existing institutions will be tempted to join the local campuses of the foreign universities.              
	The greater participation of the private sector and foreign universities will certainly result in a significant increase in fees. Liberal government scholarships can mitigate some of the adverse distributional consequence. But perhaps a more wide-ranging solution is for the government to put in place an extensive system of student loans. All needy students should be able to obtain loans at reasonable rates of interest, and be required to service these loans only after they start earning. Such systems exist in several countries, and there is no reason at all why they cannot be introduced in India.        
	At least in the next few years, the government will continue to be the major financier of higher education in India. If we want world-class institutions, then we have to provide their researchers with job packages which are comparable to similar institutions elsewhere in the world. Perhaps it is time to make a radical departure from the current system, where virtually all institutions are treated alike in terms of salaries and other facilities. The only feasible financial plan is to select a few institutes and provide them resources on a vastly different scale. This is admittedly elitist. The alternative is the current system where only wealthy parents can afford to send their children abroad to the best universities. Surely, the latter is significantly more elitist and inequitable?

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        A NEW LIGHT                              Fifth Column - GWYNNE DYER                              
	It was ostensibly about obscenity, but really about corruption and censorship  and in the end, justice prevailed. On November 16, a Zambian court found the journalist, Chansa Kabwela, not guilty of distributing obscene material with intent to corrupt public morals. What obscene material? She had sent photographs of a woman giving birth in a hospital parking lot during a nurses strike to senior government officials.        
	President Rupiah Banda called a press conference and declared the photographs pornographic. Kabwela was arrested on obscenity charges. She faced a five-year jail sentence if found guilty. But Bandas real motive was probably the fact that the paper Kabwela works for, the Post, constantly accuses him of corruption.        
	 The pictures Kabwela sent out were not pornographic. Rather, they were horrific: images of a woman in the midst of a breech birth, the babys legs dangling out between her own while its head was still inside her. It all happened in a hospital parking lot (she had already been turned away from two clinics), but nobody would help her because of the strike, and the baby suffocated.        
	Her appalled and furious relatives brought pictures of the scene to the Post. Kabwela did not publish them because they were so upsetting, but she sent copies to senior officials together with a letter urging them to intervene and settle the strike. Thats when Banda declared the images pornographic and had her arrested.        
	The courts are still independent in Zambia, and in the end Kabwela was found not guilty  but many of the witnesses were genuinely more shocked by photographs of a woman naked from the waist down than by the horror of what was actually happening. As one witness said: We are all Zambians here. We all know this is not allowed in our culture.        
	The word youre looking for is prudish, and it applies to a lot of African popular culture. Never mind whats actually happening. We dont want to hear about it, and we certainly dont want to see it. The Zambian elite has been devastated by HIV/Aids and yet nobody wants to talk about sex, let alone about the links between sex, power and violence.                
	Deadly silence        
	Go a thousand miles south to South Africa, and the gulf between appearances and reality is even wider. Last June, the countrys Medical Research Council published a study on rape and HIV which reported that 28 per cent of South African men admitted to having raped a woman or a girl. (A further 3 per cent said that they had raped a man or a boy.) Almost half the rapists said they had raped more than one person and three-quarters of them said they had carried out their first assault before the age of 20. They didnt use condoms, and they were twice as likely to be HIV+ than non-rapists. This is a national calamity that is killing more people than a middle-sized war. Yet few South Africans are willing to talk about it. Many Africans will be feeling defensive at this point, but a lot of this reminds me of where I grew up. There was an amazing amount of low-level violence around and also a lot of sexual predation. In the boys school I went to, male teachers molested boarders on an industrial scale, although day-boys like me were fairly safe. None of it was ever admitted or discussed in public.        
	I now live in a culture where we are no longer prudes. Everything is out in the open, including trivialized, commercialized sex on TV. Around half of all marriages end in divorce, but gays, once persecuted and forced to hide, can get married if they want to. You can still get mugged in the street, but the level of casual violence is sharply down. I bet that the real figures for rape are down a lot too.         
	I like the transformed culture I now live in a lot better. It occurs to me that what we are seeing in Africa may be as transitional as what I grew up with in Newfoundland. In that case, the moral and cultural changes that conservative Africans see as a descent into darkness may be a move towards the light.

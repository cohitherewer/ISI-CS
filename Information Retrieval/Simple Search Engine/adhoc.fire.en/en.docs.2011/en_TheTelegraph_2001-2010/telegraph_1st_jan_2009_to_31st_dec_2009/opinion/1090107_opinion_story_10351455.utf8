                                                                                                                 STARTING POINTS                                                    
	Jammu and Kashmir is making a fresh beginning, and the youthful new chief minister of the state, Mr Omar Abdullah, personifies it. Even without Mr Farooq Abdullahs Bollywood references, the drama that has surrounded the appointment of Mr Omar Abdullah to the chair should have been obvious. It follows a curious turn of fortune for the separatists, whose call for a boycott of the elections was overturned by popular mandate. There is also a rather bitter history of political marriages between the National Conference and the Congress in the state. The new chief minister has to answer a tough call. With the Peoples Democratic Party in opposition (its sympathy for the separatists intact), the Hurriyat Conference bent on proving the polls dubious, and a renewed interest across the border to destroy peace in Kashmir, he will have to watch every step he takes. The determination to rise to the challenge was evident from the choice of the cabinet, which has sought to give equal representation to the three regions of Kashmir, Ladakh and Jammu. But his policies and their implementation have to be equally wise. This is an altogether different ball game.        
	With general elections round the corner, the first few months are bound to prove more difficult than usual for the chief minister. Memories of division and strife that powerfully captured the popular imagination during the Amarnath controversy are bound to be revived, making the months that follow challenging. But the new dispensation, especially the national party as a partner in governance, has to remember that the demands for bijli, sadak and paani, and for freedom from fear and bloodshed, form the crux of the mandate. It is only through the keeping of these basic promises that the National Conference can move towards fulfilling its other promise  of finding a response to the call for azadi that would be practicable within the framework of the Indian Constitution.

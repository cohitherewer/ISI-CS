The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Monsters under the bed
                                                                                                                 MONSTERS UNDER THE BED                                                                  
	When I started living alone, one of the first problems I had to deal with was my fear  of creepy-crawlies, and of ghosts. It took me some time to get used to the fact that my mother was no longer at hand, ready with a slipper to deal the fatal blow, every time a roach flew in through the window. Left to my devices, I realized how helpless I was against the marauding hordes of red ants, the fluttering moths that inevitably settled on me, and the lizards that eyed me cunningly from every corner of the room. On mothers expert advice, I armed myself with bottles of Hit to bring damnation upon insects and reptiles.         
	It was not that I succeeded all the time. Hit took care of ants and roaches, but what about the fruit bats that would fly about the room in dizzying circles every summer? In the early heady days of my independence, a fruit bat, probably distracted by my shrill cries, landed in a bucket full of water. As it squeaked while drowning, I bawled at the top of my voice, unsure whether to feel more sorry for myself or for the dying creature. Thankfully that day, a friend had been close at hand, and he emptied the bucket with the still-alive bat on the street below, thereby earning the wrath of every passer-by.         
	Even more dangerous than the fruit bats are the lizards, which are my sworn enemies. I see a ghastly yellow head with beady eyes hanging from the ventilator and I know I am being watched. The horror does not stop at the constant surveillance. I often find objectionable brown and white droppings on the fresh bedsheet, which then has to be changed again. The other day, when I went to the kitchen for a drink, I saw a lizard wrapped around the filter tap, extending its pink tongue every time a drop fell from the nozzle. I was so disgusted that I decided to kill the fiend once and for all. But before I could be back with a weapon, the lizard cast me one disdainful look and disappeared behind the heap of utensils.        
	While I can plan various strategies in my fight against living creatures, I was, and still am, defenceless against the paranormal. The monster under my bed makes me freeze with every movement of its creaky body in the dead of night. A few days ago, when there was an earthquake in Calcutta at about 1:30 in the night, I was sure that the monster had transformed the bed into a rocking horse to give me a taste of its might. Just when I thought my head was going to spin backwards, as happened to the girl in the film, Exorcist, the rocking stopped, and I promptly fell asleep again.        
	Come winter, and I am treated to a thoroughly extraordinary phenomenon at dawn each year. The muezzins call at the break of day comes interspersed with a busy drone, as if of a restless crowd in the agora. To my sleep-soaked mind, the hum seems to be the voice of history, preserved in the ether and released in waves in which I start floating as well. Sceptics have volunteered to unravel the mystery of these voices for me, but I am in no mood to listen. There is nothing like lying alone in bed in the morning chill, breathing in the scent of dawn, and imagining my inarticulate prayers, voiced by nameless presences, flying heavenwards.                          ANUSUA MUKHERJEE

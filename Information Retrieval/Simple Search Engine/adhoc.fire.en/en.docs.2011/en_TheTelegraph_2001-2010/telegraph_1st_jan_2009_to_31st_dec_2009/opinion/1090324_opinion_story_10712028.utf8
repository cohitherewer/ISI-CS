	The arena of international sports carries with it the stamp of Western dominance. This is revealed in the number of trophies Western countries continue to win and also in the manner in which sports administration is controlled. There were a few signs that at least one game, cricket, was slipping out of the Wests grasp and that its control was coming into the hands of south Asian countries. This trend has suffered a setback with the decision to shift the Indian Premier League tournament away from India. The ostensible reason for this is that the IPL schedule clashes with that of the general elections and this makes it difficult, if not impossible, for the government to provide adequate security cover for the matches, players and spectators. Without in any way underestimating the critical importance of security, it cannot be denied that the matter could have been resolved through parleys between the government of India and the Board of Control for Cricket in India. Such negotiations were not seriously pursued and now security, read terrorism, has stumped cricket in India, after doing the same in Pakistan. This will inevitably harm Indias overall international image. The best way to counter the threat of terrorism is to continue with normal life and, in India, nothing signals normal life more emphatically than cricket and its popularity.        
	The decision to shift the IPL is the product of a collective failure. The principal reason for this failure is also evident. Cricket has become completely politicized in India. The popularity of cricket and the money it commands have attracted to cricket many politicians from various parties. Thus the game is now controlled both at the national level, and in some states, by politicians. This has meant that during the discussion regarding the IPL tournament, those who should have spoken as cricket officials and administrators often spoke as politicians. Some of the asides of even the home minister, P. Chidambaram, suggested that he was scoring points over political rivals rather than trying to arrive at a solution to the problem. Entrenched political positions made the controversy over the IPL schedule take the form of a proxy battle between the two main political parties. Cricket may even be made into an election issue. A nation, after all, does not live by polls alone.

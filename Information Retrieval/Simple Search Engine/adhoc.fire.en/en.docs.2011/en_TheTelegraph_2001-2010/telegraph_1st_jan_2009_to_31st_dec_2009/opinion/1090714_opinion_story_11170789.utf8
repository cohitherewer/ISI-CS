The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Dusky sirens and their discontents
                                                                                                                 DUSKY SIRENS AND THEIR DISCONTENTS                                  Skin colour becomes one of the many props on which the caste system supports itself in India                                            
	Aishwarya Rais aura just got brighter. Frances highest court found the cosmetic company, LOreal, guilty of racial discrimination after it sought to hire an all-white staff for selling its shampoo. And this after Rai had made the same point against the company last year while refusing to endorse its skin-whitening cream. But not all of us are as politically correct as Rai. That we still worship whiteness is evident from the way fairness creams do brisk business in this country. Young women (and men) with geisha faces stare from every other billboard and television commercials seem to teach that the first step towards gaining self-confidence is to become fairer. Advertisements for fairness creams even come with a shade card to mark the stages in the progress from dark to a lighter skin.        
	The fascination with fairness is interesting in what it tells us about our desires. Perhaps we crave for a whiter skin because it is precisely what we do not have. But in a tropical country such as ours, it is not really possible to have the alabaster whiteness of northern Europeans and the Japanese. In colonial times, white women were sneered upon for having skin resembling uncooked flesh. Then why do we increasingly aspire to an approximation of that skin tone? Is to be fair to be beautiful as well? Not really, if we look around us or consider the iconic beauties of Indian literature. Draupadi, who made the suitors at her swayamvar quite helpless with lust (kammohit, according to Kaliprasanna Sinha), was dark. So was her favoured husband, Arjun, and the original playboy, Krishna. In Kalidass Meghadootam, the gathering rain clouds torment the exiled Yaksha by reminding him of his lost beloved. The dusky sirens from ancient Indian literature prove that the modern beauty myth is just that  a myth, perpetuated to leave some people in a state of permanent dissatisfaction.         
	But perhaps there is more to the story. The Vedic term for caste is varna, which means colour. The Aryans, who were light-skinned, created the three-tiered caste system to distinguish themselves from the indigenous people  the dasyus, dark and different, who formed the lowest ranks of the hierarchy. Much has changed since Vedic times: the castes have mingled in ways which render the original divisions invalid, and caste has morphed to some extent into class. But fairness still continues to be equated with higher caste or class and darker skin with the lower in our collective unconscious. And this applies not only to Hindus but also to other religious groups in India.         
	The renowned sociologist, M.N. Srinivas, quotes Zarina Bhatty in the essay, The Changing Position of Indian Women, to point out that Muslim society in India is divided into two sections, the Ashrafs and the non-Ashrafs, of whom the latter constitute the majority. The Ashrafs are the upper-caste Muslims who claim foreign descent and have as its evidence a fairer skin, while the non-Ashrafs are the lower-caste converts, the darkies. Similarly, Dalit Christians make up a discrete category among Indian Christians, with separate pews sometimes reserved for the former in churches. Thus skin colour becomes one of the many props on which the caste system supports itself in India. No wonder then that the market for fairness creams thrives in this country. Why bother about possible health hazards such as skin cancer when a tube worth a few bucks can become the ticket to an imagined nobility?         
	Although we have fairness creams for men as well nowadays, the original target group remains women. As the nigger of the world, the woman always has to put in that extra effort to be included among the privileged. If the Brides Wanted column in matrimonial advertisements is anything to go by, then no matter how educated or accomplished prospective brides are, their most desirable quality is still a light complexion. If dark at all, the girl has to be luminously dark (ujjal shyambarna) as compensation.        
	It is a pity that we do not remember the sultry Draupadi, who had not one, but five husbands to do her bidding.                          ANUSUA MUKHERJEE

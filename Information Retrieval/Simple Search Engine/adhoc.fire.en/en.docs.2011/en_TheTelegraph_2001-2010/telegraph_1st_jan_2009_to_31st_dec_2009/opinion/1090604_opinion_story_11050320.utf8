The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Revisiting the memories of a massacre 
                                                                                                                 REVISITING THE MEMORIES OF A MASSACRE                                   How does the Tiananmen Square uprising exist in Chinese public memory on its 20th year? Ashis Chakrabarti looks back on his visit to the square on the 19th anniversary of the historic event                          A man in Taiwan walks past Jeff Wideners photograph of the 1989 Tiananmen Square tragedy ahead of its 20th anniversary                                  
	I met Yuan Cheng under the portrait of Mao Zedong that surveyed the scene from its perch at the Gate of Heavenly Peace on the northern end of Tiananmen Square. She had taken a break from her job as an apprentice with a management firm and come to the square with her friends to savour the excitement that filled the Chinese capital in the run-up to the Beijing Olympics. Giggling between bursts of broken English, she offered to paste a red, heart-shaped sticker on my left cheek. I let her do it and struck up a conversation.        
	All around the square people streamed in and out endlessly, waving little silk flags of China and of the Olympics. Foreigners were stopped, offered little mementos, and cajoled into posing for photographs with smiling young boys and girls, their fingers raised to signal V. Food stalls and peddlers of Olympic trivia could barely cope with the crowds, who seemed to be ready to pay much higher prices for the most ordinary stuff.        
	Nobody complained in an atmosphere like this, Yuan said, itd have been even more of a carnival if China hadnt had this earthquake tragedy.         
	It was June 4, and I decided to spend the evening roaming the streets around Tiananmen Square. The idea was to try and catch glimpses of Chinese public memory of the historic event that shook the country 19 years ago.        
	I hesitated to ask Yuan the question directly and went about it rather tentatively. Did she know about another tragedy that struck China in this very square 19 years ago? Yuan looked at me puzzled, her face breaking into an embarrassed smile. I knew she was too young to have a personal memory of the Tiananmen massacre; she belonged to what the Chinese called Ba Ling Hou, or the post-80s generation, that had grown up under Deng Xiaopings economic reforms. No, Yuan knew nothing of that event. She never heard it discussed at home or at her university where she studied business economics.        
	On this fourth of June, only two things mattered to the Chinese  the coming glory of their Olympic golds and the sorrow over the Sichuan earthquake. The Tiananmen massacre was not even a memory for the young; for the old, it was still a bad dream that they would not like to either remember or talk about, especially with a foreigner.        
	In fact, the Tiananmen tragedy was the last thing they would like to be reminded of. The Olympics and the earthquake, on the other hand, served an important purpose for the government and the ruling communist party.        
	With the pro-Tibet activists clamouring for the worlds attention with protests and demonstrations, the government and the party in Beijing desperately needed to work up a nationalist frenzy to counter the anti-China propaganda. Following the pro-Tibet protests in Paris, the nationalist backlash showed in the demonstrations and short-lived boycotts organized in Beijing, and in other cities, outside the stores of the French retail chain, Carrefour.        
	The Olympics were always going to come in handy to showcase the Chinese dream. The Sichuan earthquake of May 12 plunged the nation into sorrow and also rallied the nation behind the government. If the Tiananmen tragedy was a dim and distant nightmare, this was no time to burden the public memory with it. China was too overwhelmed by the promise of one triumph (the upcoming Olympics), and by a tragedy (of the earthquake) to be thrown into the agony of another painful memory.              
	Of course, the government and the party had done everything they could to erase the Tiananmen tragedy from public memory. But not everyone has forgotten; not all traces of that memory have been wiped out.        
	On June 4 last year, as I wandered around the huge square trying to get some English-speaking Chinese talk about that catastrophe, a young man told me how they had smuggled videos of the massacre into their university dormitory many years later. But, of course, he would not discuss it, and certainly not with a foreigner living in Beijing. And he would not give me his name.        
	Another young woman recalled how, close to the midnight of June 3, her father had ran down their apartment near the Police Hospital behind Tiananmen Square. He returned home, telling the family that bullets had hit the apartment wall. The woman, then five, remembered her father looking grave and fearful. Army tanks rolled onto the square, and hundreds of student protesters, who had been on hunger strike there demanding democracy, were gunned down between the midnight of June 3 and the early hours of June 4, 1989.         
	There are others who also remember. Inside China, the most prominent of them called themselves Tiananmen Mothers, a group of women who lost their children in the crackdown and who now try to compile a list of the dead.         
	But keeping alive a memory that the government and the party want to bury has its risks. Elizabeth Pisani, who covered the momentous event for the Reuters, writes in the latest issue of Granta that three editors on a provincial newspaper in China were sacked in 2007 because a clerk in their office, not knowing what had happened 18 years ago, allowed a tribute to the victims of 4/6 to slip into the classified advertisements column.        
	And, of course, most of the leaders of that movement  Wang Dan, number one on the Most Wanted list after the crackdown, Wuer Kaixi, number two on the same list, Chaohua Wang, Shen Tong, Chen Ziming and others  remember, and act on their memories, from their homes in exile in the United States of America or in England.        
	But what about the average Chinese in small towns and villages in that vast country? The Western media would like one to believe that the anger and grief over the Tiananmen massacre burn on in the hearts of millions of Chinese.        
	A colleague in Beijing rubbished such talk. Look at the Chinese political history of the last one hundred years, he told me sitting in a crowded restaurant not far from Tiananmen that evening, and youll see how many millions were killed in all kinds of battles  between the republicans and the emperors army, between the Kuomintang and the Communists, in the Japanese invasion, and then in the great famines that followed Maos mad Great Leap Forward, and in the Cultural Revolution. The Chinese historical memory is nothing if not crowded with massacres, he said, as we supped on cold beer and Peking Duck.              
	He didnt dispute that many remembered; but what is more striking in todays China is how little the young people care. That is why they coined the word for the post-1980s generation  to characterize todays young people with their apolitical attitude, their love of the good things of life, and their worry about not being left out in the race for money and success. They do not want their journeys to be burdened with the baggage of history.        
	If the Tiananmen tragedy is part of the nations historical memory, it is also a blank in the consciousness of many more of Chinas millions. Its the economy, stupid, the Chinese yuppies would tell you quite blandly, politics is out.         
	They need not believe in the governments verdict that the Tiananmen uprising was the work of a small clique of counter-revolutionaries who wanted to overthrow the socialist system and the rule of the communist party. They would remember and reassess it if the need arose at another point in history. Right now, it is a past that is not half as exciting as the present, with the countrys economic power soaring and millions tasting the good life as never before.         
	True, too many leaders of the government and the party are corrupt, but far too many people now have a stake in the countrys amazing economic success. Now is not the time to ask for a judgment and trial of the men behind Tiananmen. After all, one man who would have to face such a trial more than anyone else would not be Li Peng, then prime minister, but Deng Xiaoping himself, the architect of todays economic success story.        
	And such a trial could rehabilitate Zhao Ziyang, whose pro-democracy sympathies cost him his job as the party general secretary, and who spent the next 16 years, until his death in 2005, under house-arrest. But he did not leave the scene without a parting kick. His just-published memoir, Prisoner of the State: The Secret Journal of Zhao Ziyang, secretly collected on about thirty audio tapes during his years in confinement and smuggled out by trusted friends, must be a new thorn in the Chinese governments  and in the communist partys  flesh.        
	Night had descended over Beijing by the time my colleague and I finished our dinner. Although it was a weekday, the music bars in Beijings sleazy Sanlitun were full of fun-seekers, locals and foreigners. Street-walkers moved into the alleys off the main road, as policemen took control of major streets to avoid security risks, especially to the visiting foreigners whose numbers grew as the Olympics approached.              
	June 4 last year was like any other day in Beijing: people rushing to and from their workplaces or flooding the streets during the day, and pleasure-seekers filling the vice dens at night. Around midnight, as I drove past Tiananmen one more time that day, the huge public square was empty, except for the policemen. The flower-bedecked podium at the centre of the square proclaiming the Beijing Olympics shone brilliantly under the arc lights. It was almost the hour when the square became a killing field that fateful June night 19 years ago.

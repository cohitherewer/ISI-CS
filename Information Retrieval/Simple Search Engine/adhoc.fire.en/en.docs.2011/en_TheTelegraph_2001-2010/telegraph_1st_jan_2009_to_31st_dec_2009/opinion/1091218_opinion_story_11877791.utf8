The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Why is it so brown?
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        WHY IS IT SO BROWN?                                                                        
	Eliot did not perhaps have the Hooghly in mind when he wrote in the Four Quartets, I think that the river/ Is a strong brown god. And what follows in The Dry Salvages remains uncannily applicable to this history- and filth-laden distributary of the Ganga: the brown god is almost forgotten/ By the dweller in cities... Unhonoured, unpropitiated/ By worshippers of the machine, but waiting, watching and waiting. While the Hooghly waits and watches, people have been watching it too for a long time  and documenting what they see, visually and verbally. THE HOOGHLY: LIVING WITH OUR RIVER (Roli, Rs 2,500), with Suprotik Chatterjees colour photographs and Lakshmi Subramanians text, is one such attempt at documentation, enriched by drawings made by students of the Indian Institute of Cerebral Palsy, Calcutta, and reproductions of Thomas Daniells 18th-century engravings, among other archival documents.        
	The result is a visually layered and pleasantly informative coffee-table book that is stronger on the varied history of, and along, the Hooghly than on its present condition of dangerous pollutedness. The continual, and piously unthinking, dumping of human and industrial waste into the Hooghly  Eliots brown begins to sound dodgy at this point  has ensured that, for every 100 ml of its water, the coliform bacteria count goes above 2 lakh, when the safe-for-bathing limit is 500. This is at the Dakshineswar Ghat, rich in both holiness and heritage, and after the state has already blown around Rs 400 crore under the Ganga Action Plan. The poor Hindoo, the book quotes (but does not say from where), anxious to ensure his performance of those daily ablutions which constitute an essential part of worship, erects his hut on the margin of these polluted streams, and felicitates himself on the circumstance that exposes him to probable danger and inevitable inconvenience.         
	Chatterjees photography is nice to look at, but rather anodyne after the riverine work that has already been done by the canonical Indian photographers. A closer look at the nature of the waste and refuse polluting the Hooghly, for instance, might have been aesthetically and politically more significant and original, challenging the limits of both photography and writing. Top left is the riverside at Chandernagore, which passed between the French and the British several times as a colony since the 17th century. Top right shows three of the many children who make the river their playground and bathing site, possibly immune to the perils of coliform bacteria. Bottom right needs no identification: no photographer seems to be able to resist its clich-generating allure. Bottom left is by Biswajit Majumdar (the caption spells his surname wrong). He lives near the Hooghly and enjoys drawing, maths, reading and dancing.                          AVEEK SEN

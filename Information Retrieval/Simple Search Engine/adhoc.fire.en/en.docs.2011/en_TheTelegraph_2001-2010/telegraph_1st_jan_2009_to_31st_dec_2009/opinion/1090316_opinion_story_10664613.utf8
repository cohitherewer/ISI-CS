	Third is not good enough                  
	Sir  As rebirth rituals for the third front were taking place near Tumkur, the road opposite the office of the fronts prime mover, the Janata Dal (Secular), collapsed in Seshadripuram. This may be a portent of what is in store. The front members can have only one point in their common minimum programme, albeit unintended, which is to convince voters that the United Progressive Alliance is still their best bet.          
	The Left Front has admitted that it is not expecting to win anything close to the 68 seats it had in the outgoing Lok Sabha. And the Janata Dal (S) had only three members in Parliament. So much for the credibility of the third front. The Bharatiya Janata Party and its allies continue to tilt at windmills rather than solve the problems of India. By default, both the third front and the BJP are strengthening the case for the UPA.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
N. Narasimhan, Bangalore 

                
	Sir  The third front is going to emerge as a major power centre in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. The Congress and the BJP are in trouble, and the political situation is on the boil. Almost all political leaders are trying to come to power.           
	But is there a single leader who is really concerned about the people of this country? Is anyone thinking about eliminating poverty? Is there anyone thinking of creating jobs for young people hit by the worldwide recession? Perhaps not. Is there not a need for a party or a statesman that can really lead this country which has achievements in every field but cannot recognize its own importance?                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Shailesh Kumar, Bangalore

      
	Sir  While calling upon various political parties to form a third front, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) emphasized that it was trying to consolidate the secular forces in the country (Birth of Karat baby, with Maya push, March 13 ). Does that imply that the Congress is no longer secular? The CPI(M) should then recall its stand at the time of the installation of the Congress-led UPA government at the Centre. Then it had declared that its support to the government was based solely on the desire to save the secular ideals enshrined in the Constitution.           
	It is politics, and not secular ideals, that is dictating the choice of allies. This is evident from the fact that it is once again H.D. Deve Gowda who is the convenor of the third front. He seems to nurture hopes of reoccupying the prime ministers chair, his calculation being that in a possibly hung house, a group of eight parties will be able to return around 40-50 members to the parliament. But before that happens he will have to deal with the fact that Mayavati, inclining towards the third front, is as eager as Deve Gowda for the top job.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Arun Malankar, Mumbai 

                
	Sir  While the CPI(M) are calling on secular parties to form a third front, in Kerala, the Janata Dal and the CPI(M) are already on the warpath over seat-sharing. The CPI(M)s secular credentials have been questioned in that state because of its support to leaders like Abdul Nasser Madhani. By calling itself secular and democratic, the CPI(M) is trying to misguide people.           
	Yours faithfully,       
K. James Williams, Alappuzha, Kerala

                
	Sir  The third front is the brainchild of the CPI(M) general secretary, Prakash Karat. With Marxists on the edge in Kerala and Bengal, Karat desperately needs to flex his muscles. But all earlier experiments with the third front have failed and left in their trail economic anarchy and administrative chaos. That was inevitable, since the third front is a group of disparate regional parties, without a common economic policy or a shared base for national and international policies.           
	So far no alliance without one of the national parties, the Congress or the BJP, has been able to sustain itself. In the third front, there are as many contenders for the prime ministers chair as there are parties. Becoming prime minister is Mayavatis only agenda. Can anyone believe that J. Jayalalithaa will accept that? The prime minister issue alone is enough to break up the third front.           
	Besides, what could be common between Karat and his third front partners in policy? Karat or A.B. Bardhan would destroy the carefully built-up relationship with the United States of America and surrender Indias interests to China. And all the partners would just oppose the CPI(M)s policies. The third front would be self-contradictory and therefore dangerous for Indias future.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Tapan Dasgupta, Burdwan

                
	Sir  Indias best bet lies in voting to power coalitions led by either the BJP or the Congress. The problem with the regional parties is that they prioritize their respective states and divert attention from issues of national interest, such as foreign policy, economic reforms, health, trade, defence and diplomacy. The Lok Sabha elections are meant to put in place the government that will deal with these. Both the BJP and the Congress are close to each other on these issues, being pro-US and in favour of a liberalized economy. The only wall between the two is Hindutva.          
	The third front is a pre-poll alliance which will ultimately mount pressure on the government or blackmail it. The country has already had bitter experiences of third fronts in power. It is best that the aspirations of this third front are nipped in the bud.          
	Yours faithfully,

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | The crown in the gutter
                                                                                                                 THE CROWN IN THE GUTTER                          - In India, democracy creates its own royals        Sunanda K. Datta-Ray                                She could just pick it up                                              
	Watching continuous processions of election candidates, it occurs to me that few spectacles could be less democratic than the worlds largest democracy at work. What I gaze upon from the broken pavements of urban slums in south India are not peoples representatives wooing voters but minor potentates receiving the homage of loyal subjects.        
	The cavalcade of garlanded and tilak-marked candidates riding serenely in open pick-ups under showers of rose petals recall film depictions of Caesars triumphs. But the priest holding the laurel wreath above Caesars head in those films kept up a constant refrain of Remember you are only a man! Theres no such caveat here. The elections seem to have little bearing on the nitty-gritty of government. Voters and their representatives enter into a different compact in the West where democracy is equated with good governance. Our monarchical ethos places elected representatives above accountability.         
	This is not a uniquely Indian condition. Indonesians realized long before Suharto finally quit on May 21, 1998 that his 31-year rule would have to end for the country to emerge from economic crisis and political turmoil. But as one of his aides said at the time, How do you ask a Javanese king to step down? Suharto was not of royal or even aristocratic birth. His parents were peasants in a village without electricity or running water. But he married into a junior branch of the Sultan of Solos family and  far more to the point  reinvented himself as a Javanese monarch.               
	It stands to reason that the transformation would not have been possible without the acquiescence of ordinary Indonesians who identified power with royalty, whether in the person of their own Sultan of Yogyakarta or the colonial overlord, Queen Juliana of the Netherlands. Indians are not very different. I remember our Medinipuri cook asking in 1947 as the sun set on George VI as Emperor of India who the new king would be. Would Raja Jawaharlal or Raja Gandhiji rule India? Twenty-four years later, Karni Singh of Bikaner provided a partial answer as he thundered in the Lok Sabha against the bill abolishing princely privileges. Todays real maharajahs sit on the treasury benches, he declaimed.         
	Democracy creates its own royals, the formidable logistics of the 15th general election amounting to a mass abhishek of the called and the chosen. Like Suhartos reinvention of his role, this anointing through the ballot box is no more incongruous than the French senates law of May 18, 1804 decreeing, The government of the Republic is vested in an Emperor, who takes the title of Emperor of the French. Planning his coronation in Notre Dame cathedral as meticulously as any of his military campaigns, Napoleon picked up the so-called crown of Charlemagne (a replica that had carefully been made to look medieval) and put it on his own head. Then he crowned the kneeling Josephine, an act that the painter, David, immortalized. Dragged all the way from Rome to lend sanctity to the ceremony, Pope Pius VII was prevented from playing a more active part. Any hint of papal consent being necessary would have impinged on the supremacy of a peoples monarchy in a republic ruled by an emperor.         
	Whatever be its quality, Indias democracy survives, while parliamentary structures have collapsed in almost every other Asian country, only because of a similar anomaly  Westminsters alien participative system has come to terms with native traditions of rulership. The angavastrams draped round politicians on the stump  lotus-embossed saffron for Bharatiya Janata Party stalwarts, white bordered in the national colours with medallions portraying Sonia Gandhi and the Hand for Congress candidates  are every bit as regal as the regalia Napoleon designed for his republican empire. The public prayers and pujas with even Muslim candidates prostrating themselves at popular Hindu shrines are established royal rituals like Queen Elizabeths pre-coronation consecration in Westminster Abbey.         
	Like L.K. Advanis rath, the motorcycle outriders that precede BJP candidates and the drums and dancers serenading Congressmen cater to the craving for ceremonial with mythic overtones. Our politicians hold court rather than preside at businesslike meetings. The durbar surrounding the Congress chief who does not even need the pretence of an elective mandate would have done Frances Sun King proud. Rahul Gandhi and Narendra Modi are unapologetic crown princes, hailed as such by courtiers. If a maverick like Jayalalithaa or Mayavati ever ascends the throne, she can boast, like Napoleon, of having found the crown in the gutter.        
	Unable to understand such a synthesis, Neville Maxwell, author of Indias China War, predicted the end of Indian democracy 42 years ago. Much to the anguish of Delhis chattering classes, he wrote on the eve of the 1967 election that the great experiment of developing India within a democratic framework has failed. Indians would soon vote in the fourth  and surely last  general election. Seeing him as she toured Hyderabad House while votes were being counted, Indira Gandhi gave a twisted little smile and remarked, Watching the end of Indian democracy, Mr Maxwell? She knew, with her strong umbilical links to Bharat Mata, that Indias parliamentary system does not have to be democratic to survive. Nor do its anointed princes have to deliver to enjoy fealty. They have to provide comfort and reassurance while minions attend to public needs.         
	That is something that critics fail to take into account. The current exercise has been faulted for being overseen by an official whom an inquiry commission deemed unfit for public office because of his role during the Emergency and who would probably be the first to acknowledge his close friendship with the Nehru-Gandhi family. It can be argued that while the commissions objectivity was not above question, friendship need not stand in the way of dispassionate stewardship. The sins of omission and commission of successive governments are also blamed on the system that elects them. The International Food Policy Research Institutes 2008 Global Hunger Index ranked India 66th out of 88 countries, with serious, alarming and extremely alarming hunger levels in various states. Nearly half the children under five are stunted. Even Bangladesh fares better in school enrolment, sex parity and child mortality. Sub-Saharan Africa scores higher in some standard of living indices. The National Human Rights Commission claims that the largest number of abuses are in states that lie outside the conflict zones where some abridgment of rights may be expected. Despite Indias high growth rates, our public services are worse than in many countries without either democracy or high growth.               
	But efficiency and integrity are not the touchstones on which political mettle is tested. Members of legislative assemblies may be compared with British members of parliament whose constituencies take them to task for not building a crche or laying a drain. But Lok Sabha members are above local bread-and-butter issues. Though some hold they should be absorbed in the bigger picture, there is little sign of national causes like foreign policy, defence or education being thrashed out either.         
	Instead, the elections affirm caste solidarity, exalt xenophobic pride, promise secular stability or, in the case of the communists, some measure of radical fervour. This manifestation of the magic of the marketplace is also a great occasion for trading insults. It seems almost sacrilegious to expect more or to blame representatives for indulging in extravagance, transferring dozens of civil servants, dispensing patronage or enriching themselves.         
	Of course, there are exceptions. Everyone takes pride in the supposed political maturity of the unlettered masses and cites 1977 when the people deposed the empress who had betrayed them. But came 1980 and she was brought back in triumph, Napoleon returned from Elba. Its a process whereby the nation renews itself periodically, but since democracy doesnt generate the same expectations here as in the West, it cannot be judged and dismissed by the same yardstick.

	Death to life                  
	Sir  The right to live with dignity is enshrined in the Constitution. That said, if a person opts for death with dignity, so be it (Crossing the bar, Aug 8).           
	Scientists in the United States of America are apparently working on a genetic engineering project that can bring life to cells in laboratories. The research is considered to be path-breaking and the day is not far when science will enable man to create life artificially. If governments across the world can permit the creation of life in this manner, why should they have a problem with the concept of assisted suicide? If euthanasia  the right to die  were to be legalized, it would face stiff resistance from the orthodox sections. But the issue needs to be looked at rationally, and not with a closed mind. Death is a part of life. If a person were to choose to end his life, and if it could be done in a painless manner, he should be allowed to exercise this option. But care must be taken to ensure that this does not lead to the flourishing of suicide cults.           
	The process to end ones life must be made legal and transparent, and a person may be allowed to end his life only if his is a voluntary decision. Ideally, a person willing to die voluntarily must petition the State, which, in turn, must accept or deny his request after a careful debate. The record of his death, if permitted, must also be digitized and preserved. Assisted suicide can certainly be legalized subject to certain conditions. A new beginning is being awaited in this respect.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Euthanasia is bound to gain acceptance with the advent of materialism. Human beings have reduced themselves to pleasure-seeking entities. When their demands are not met, they are often inclined to end their lives. However, medical science, which plays a critical role in human society, should not be used to put an end to someones life.          
	In his article on assisted suicide, Sunanda K. Datta-Ray, mentions the distressing case of an unemployed youth who was afflicted with an incurable condition. He ended his life after his wife left him. Datta-Ray also writes about Diane Pretty, who was suffering from motor neuron disease, and mentions that her husband may have played a role in helping her decide to die. While we do not know for sure what Prettys husbands views are on mercy killing, we do know that Stephen Hawking, another victim of motor neuron disease, is against euthanasia. The time has come for human society to decide who is right: is it Hawking or people like Pretty and her husband?          
	Yours faithfully,

	Voice of concern          
	Sir  The Marxists distaste for impartial views is well known. Hence, the leftists criticism of Bengals governor, Gopalkrishna Gandhi, for his remark that the post-poll violence in the state must be blamed on those who can act but are not doing so does not come as a surprise. If one were to go through the governors statement carefully, one will find that he has been critical of each and every political party. Since the elections, violence has claimed the lives of supporters of every political party. The state administration, however, has acted in a partisan manner when it came to containing the disturbances.           
	The Union home minister, P. Chidambaram, recently stated that West Bengal resembles killing fields after the recent spate in violence. Those who have an idea about the goings-on will agree with him. Even earlier, the governor had described the Nandigram carnage as cold horror. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) had reacted ferociously even on that occasion, and a CPI(M) state secretariat member had advised him to resign from his post and join the Trinamul Congress. The truth of the matter is that the CPI(M) had become shaky after the drubbing it received in the recent Lok Sabha polls. The party is now taking recourse to criticizing the governor to raise the morale of its cadre. However, the barbs directed at the governor are unlikely to cut any ice with those who are in power at the Centre.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Tapan Das Gupta, Burdwan 

                
	Sir  There is absolutely nothing wrong with what the governor, Gopalkrishna Gandhi, said about the post-election violence in West Bengal. The governor is well within his rights to voice his concern about the prevailing situation in the state. Recently, the governor was met by the representatives of both the ruling dispensation and those in the Opposition who discussed with him the possible ways of bringing back peace. This is not the time for unnecessary arguments; establishing peace in the state should be the priority.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Diptimoy De, Calcutta 

                
	Parting shot          
	Sir  The Unique Identification Authority of India, with Nandan Nilekani at its head, is set to provide a unique identification number for all Indian citizens by 2011 (Infys loss is identity cards gain, June 26). The cost of this project is estimated to be Rs 1.5 lakh crore. A sum of Rs 120 crore has already been allotted in this years Union budget.           
	However, obtaining the UI number has not been made mandatory. Thus, people living in remote areas or those absent from their homes at the time of visit by the concerned officials may not be provided with such numbers. But, chances are that it will be difficult to differentiate these people from those who do not wish to acquire a UI number because they are illegal immigrants from neighbouring countries. The resultant confusion would make genuine citizens susceptible to random police checks. At the same time, making the UI mandatory is likely to result in the State intruding on the privacy of the citizens. The UI number is thus a complex issue and calls for immediate discussion.           
	Yours faithfully,

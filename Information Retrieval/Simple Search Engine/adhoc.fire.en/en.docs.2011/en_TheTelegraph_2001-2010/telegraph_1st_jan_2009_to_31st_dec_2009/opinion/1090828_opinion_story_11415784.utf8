	Islam, women and violence in Kashmir: Between India and Pakistan By Nyla Ali Khan, Tulika, Rs 395              
	This is irrefutable and, naturally, could not have been allowed to bear heavily on the mind of the reader even before he had begun. But the fact remains that of the five chapters here, only the last is exclusively devoted to what, as the title suggests (unless one reads the women and violence in it separately), is the subject of this book. A second on Lalla-Ded, Kashmirs celebrated woman Sufi poet and mystic, who, Nandy says, is the protagonist of Khans narrative, is squeezed in between a running account of Kashmirs political history dominated by Khans grandfather, Sheikh Abdullah, for a considerable part.         
	Khan has tried to focus from the margins instead of from an elitist centre, and examines her own locations of privilege while trying to understand the systems that have generated Kashmirs culture of silence. She believes that the marginalized laypeople of her land, particularly women, have not raised their voice loud enough against the wrongs to which they have been subjected to by India, Pakistan and religious fundamentalists. Unfortunately, her preoccupation with delineating Kashmirs victimhood that has been, and continues to be, measured by (more than anything else) Jawaharlal Nehrus betrayal of the faith placed in him by Abdullah in holding the promised referendum mars her effort.         
	There are a number of Jammu and Kashmirs laypeople in Khans book though. Her conversations with them and their response are reproduced here as part of the oral history through which she wants to ensure that Kashmirs past remains alive as much as its present. In using this methodology, Khan avoids referring too much to her interactions with her family members, even though she acknowledges that she drew on them no less than on her interactions with the victims of the politics of dispossession. This is, of course, in keeping with her conscious objective of not providing an elitist history. Yet, to be reminded of the long conversations she had with her grandmother, Begum Akbar Jehan Abdullah, or her parents, at specific intervals during discussions on Kashmirs momentous events, and not be told a word of what they elicited is a bit of a let down.         
	Khans conscious choice of distancing herself and her family from the narrative to prevent falling into a trap (which she does not escape altogether) is apparent elsewhere as well. She says she was present in the Kashmir valley a couple of months before the 2002 elections, which routed the National Conference. But that bit of information is all that one has of her presence in the inescapable realities of Kashmiri life. The rest of the information related to these elections is cold poll statistics. In any case, in the previous pages, she has already mentioned the reasons for the drubbing the National Conference received  being a stooge to the dispensation in New Delhi (mostly the Congress) which would prop up any party that suited its interests.         
	Her view on government-formation in the state remains consistent, even for the year 2008 when the people of the valley ignored the boycott call of the separatists, braved the cold and cast their vote. The change in the National Conferences fortune took place, she says, because it wrested back the urban vote. The rural vote still belongs to the Peoples Democratic Party and the National Conference, one gathers, continues to be a stooge because of its decision to ally with the Congress. By doing so, she insists, the party, once again, undermined the popular mandate.         
	But what do the people want? Khan is quite sure that a political package short of autonomy for the entire state would be viewed with suspicion by the Kashmiris. The people want, and deserve, a political package that should cater not to the insecurities of India and Pakistan, but one that would cater unconditionally to the needs of the ethnic and religious minorities in a land divided between the two countries, and allay their fears. By doing so, she says it will fulfil the basic conditions delineated decades ago by Sheikh Abdullah. But would it also allay the fears Abdullah had decades ago of a land sandwiched between two giants?         
	There is no doubt that Khan brings a lot of passion to her analysis of the situation in Kashmir, and to her perception of the pain that her people continue to suffer. Does she bring to light the less-known fact that the problem of Kashmir has strengthened some of the worst trends in the political cultures of India and Pakistan? This, Nandy argues, is more important than enumerating political details.         
	Yes and no. Yes, Khan shows the growth of what Nandy calls the culture of impunity in India  the unleashing of the army and the police on local populations in the name of territorial nationalism. But her preoccupation with political history does not give her enough space to deal with its fallout on women. Khan writes about their battles, within home and outside, about how the militarization of society has doubled their difficulties. She talks with women who have negotiated this battle in their own ways, and talks about others who have chosen not to fight it. But they still deserve more space than Khan has given them. After all, the memory and imagination of a woman  Lalla-Ded  are supposed to heal Kashmirs wounds, and her subversion of tradition is to pave the way for the emancipation of Kashmiri women.                    CHIROSREE BASU

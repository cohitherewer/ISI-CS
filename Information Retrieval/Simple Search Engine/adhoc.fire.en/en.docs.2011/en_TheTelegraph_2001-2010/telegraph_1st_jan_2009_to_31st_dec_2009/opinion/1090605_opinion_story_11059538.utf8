The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | The story of the birth of a regime that has blood on its hands
                                                                                                                 THE STORY OF THE BIRTH OF A REGIME THAT HAS BLOOD ON ITS HANDS                                                                        
	The State in Myanmar By Robert H. Taylor, Hurst, Rs 895        
	What would the state in Myanmar have been like if Aung San had not been assassinated on the eve of the countrys independence from Britain? How different could it have been if his daughter, Aung San Suu Kyi, had been allowed to form a government following the massive victory of her National League for Democracy in May 1990?         
	The worlds attention is drawn once again to Myanmar by the current trial of Suu Kyi who has spent 13 of the last 19 years under house arrest. To international analysts, the story of the father-daughter duo is essentially about Myanmars struggle to emerge as a modern state. And, so far, it has been a story of tragic failure.         
	The army, which has ruled the country either directly or under some political guise, however, sees it differently. It sees itself as the saviour of the state, as General Saw Mung, chairman of the State Law and Order Restoration Council, so brazenly claimed in an address to the nation, I Saved Burma, in 1989. The idea was that the state would have disintegrated or lost its sovereignty but for the army. There is nothing unique about the claim; all authoritarian regimes say so.         
	But this was soon after the formation of the SLORC, following the bloody crackdown on student protests in 1988 that killed several thousands in Yangon alone and many more in other Myanmarese cities. The army and the state in Myanmar had not faced such a challenge before. The author of this book calls it the most violent period in the urban history of Myanmar since the Second World War and the post-independence civil war.         
	Taylors book is an extended version of his The State in Burma, published in 1987. The events since 1988 would have made the original book incomplete and rather irrelevant. So Taylor adds two long chapters to update his analysis of the process of state-formation in the country.         
	The part that made up the original book still remains its greatest strength. It traces the history of the states evolution from its period of tribal and ethnic wars to the colonial experiment in political and economic unification, to the collapse into civil war and its re-emergence under Ne Win. Taylors insights into the complexities of both ideological and ethnic politics of the country, coupled with his understanding of the broad sweep of history, make his study of state-making in Myanmar one of the best in its category.         
	As for the armys role in state-formation in Myanmar, the author maintains an impersonal and dispassionate view of the contest between the army and its pro-democracy opponents. He presents the armys view of itself as the ultimate champion of national unity and interest, but suggests that the military regime cannot afford to win either legitimacy or security for itself unless it improves its human rights record.         
	The last of the new chapters that have been added to the original book discusses the new constitution on which a national referendum was held last year under controversial circumstances, and which will be the basis for another general election next year. The provisions in the constitution leave absolutely no doubt about the armys intention to continue with its control of the state and the government.         
	Two important omissions stand out even in the extended book. Most recent analyses of the state in Myanmar look closely at the role of the Buddhist clergy and monasteries. Some scholars, like Mikael Gravers, suggest that both the military and the Buddhist religious order have one thing in common  both see themselves as the custodian of Burmese tradition in statecraft as well as in social life. David Steinberg links the two institutions even closer  he argues that the military regime, though corrupt and despised, is accepted as inevitable owing to Buddhist notions of ana, awza and cetana, all of which derive from the central Buddhist doctrine of karma. To deny the army its right to hold the state together is to oppose karma.        
	The other curious omission is the role of the drug trade in not only the countrys economy but also in its security and power structure. The drug trade is closely linked to the role and nature of the army rule and to the question of the states relation to ethnicity. The army may have struck its deals in recent years with the drug lords, drastically reducing the latters power; but to ignore the influence of the trade on todays state in Myanmar is to miss an important element in the story.                     ASHIS CHAKRABARTI

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Wrong face on the jam jar
                                                                                                                 WRONG FACE ON THE JAM JAR                                  Race, colour and sexuality give rise to the most intense prejudices and the choicest language. A closer look at a few such words and where they are to be found                                             
	In November 2008, when Barack Obama was still the president-elect, the deputy chief minister of Guernsey, Bernard Flouquet, while speaking about Obamas possible election to power, joked to journalists that the Americans were looking for permission to use the sovereigns face on all their stamps and, in return, to show their appreciation, they would allow Britain to put the golliwog back on the jam jar. Before this, in July 2008, the American civil rights activist, Jesse Jackson, had said with reference to Obama on US Fox News that I want to cut his nuts off, not knowing that his comment was being picked up by a live microphone. This was because Jesse Jackson had felt that Obama had been talking down to African Americans by giving them lectures on morality.         
	It is strange that two men, separated from each other by nationality and colour  Flouquet is a white Englishman and Jackson a black American  are suddenly brought together when they express their animosity towards a coloured man who would soon become the most powerful individual in the United States of America. It is significant that both men made their respective comments in the media and while one meant it as a joke, not to be taken seriously, the other said what he said since he thought the microphone was switched off. Both are public comments, yet made somehow as asides, either to be overlooked as casual humour, or not to be heard at all.        
	It is perhaps this heady opportunity of simultaneous disclosure and concealment offered by the internet too that makes the cyberworld a place where people can freely express their darkest thoughts without being threatened with censure. It is not surprising then that such racially inflected terms as mulatto, quadroon, nigger Latina redneck and others, long banished from polite speech for reasons of political correctness, thrive on the net. Google-search any of the above terms for images, and in all probability you will find a series of pornographic pictures with the accompanying articles loudly proclaiming the true feelings of the anonymous writers about these stereotypes.        
	The Concise Oxford English Dictionary defines Latina as the feminine of Latino, who is defined as a Latin American inhabitant of the United States. This is how the Urban Dictionary on the net  which is the dictionary you wrote  defines the term: The hottest women on the face of the earth. No other woman comes close. They have tan-mocha skin, dark black hair, the best a***s and curves ever. Not to mention some seriously addictive p***y. If you search for mulatto in Google images, one of the pages will yield a photograph of Obamas white mother and himself as a child. Click on the accompanying site, and it will tell you why Obama should promote his Mulatto credentials. Obama must become, unabashedly, a Mullato The Little Mule! People love mules! and so on.         
	But perhaps most appalling is what comes up if Jew is searched for in Images. One of the sites, which calls itself the Encyclopaedia Dramatica, has Dirty F****** Jew! spelt out in bold letters between blinking Swastikas. It tells you, among other unmentionable things, How to spot a Jew and equates Jews with Niggers (both are bad news). On the other hand, if you google Nazi in Images, you will find that most of the entries are laudatory, showing valorous men in uniform.        
	If these entries, for all their hideousness, evoke nervous laughter in us, we might recall what Freud said with regard to the relation of jokes with the unconscious. For Freud, jokes help release psychic energy by doing away with the mental censors that are powerful barriers to forbidden thoughts. In this sense, the internet serves a function very close to that of jokes by acting as a platform where repressed feelings can be voiced under the ruse of anonymity. The entries prove that racism is both normal and irrational  while being inconsistent with professed beliefs, it is embraced by each of us, albeit unconsciously. To see at what myriad levels our prejudices operate, this joke from JokesPrank.com might be instructive: A little boy was learning about God in his church, and he was talking to his mother about it. She, not wanting to place prejudice in the little boys mind, sat him and said: God is not a man or a woman, and God is not black or white. To which the child responded, Well, then is God Michael Jackson?                    ANUSUA MUKHERJEE

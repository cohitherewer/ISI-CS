The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Time for some old hat
                                                                                                                 TIME FOR SOME OLD HAT                                  BONA FIDE - Malvika Singh                              
	The top leadership in the Bharatiya Janata Party seems to have lost the plot by raking up Bofors and Quattrocchi instead of aggressively proposing ideas and solutions for the many maladies that need to be resolved for India and its people. The leaders insecurity and desperation have reached farcical levels. Whoever is their tactician, he is leading the party to a weaker situation as the polls begin to come to a close. It is as though the BJPs opposition is crafting the partys strategy. Dead issues as well as rhetoric about shady deals, illegal, unexplained and undeclared money in Swiss bank accounts and suchlike have no real impact on a philosophical, patient and dignified populace. Such rhetoric is not going to help win any extra votes. In fact, the mindless criticism directed at Sonia Gandhi will possibly convert opposition votes in her favour. Her silence only aids and strengthens her persona.        
	Sharad Pawar cannot seem to extricate himself from the chronic illness that has become synonymous with his persona, the disease that can be called disloyalty or betrayal or breach of trust. He is just plain unreliable as a partner and committed to himself alone, now maybe a little more to his dearest daughter. Lalu Prasad is running scared, clearly getting a sense of the ground reality. The rising, hysterical pitch of Narendra Modi and L.K. Advani on the Gandhis, Bofors and the inability of the Congress to rule is beginning to sound like the high octave notes akin to those screeched out on the issue of Sonia Gandhi being a foreigner. The people of India, in their wisdom and traditional truth, have accepted Sonia as a bahu in their home who, when widowed, chose to stay on in her sasural and serve her people. Ordinary Indians respect her for what she is, regardless of which party or leader they may choose to vote for. That is what the BJP finds impossible to swallow.                 
	Powerful scent        
	Indians are watching a section of regional political leaders support V. Prabhakaran (an amoral, ruthless man for whom the means to an end are of no importance), who was responsible for the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi. On the other side of the coin is a national party pulling out a dead, unproven case out of its coffin 22 years later, against the same leader  Rajiv Gandhi. Indians are not foolish. They can see the desperation writ large on the words of such leaders and aspiring prime ministerial candidates. Voters, particularly the undecided ones, tend to flee from aspirants who use dead issues as political crutches. They are seen as failures, delving into the past and unable to create an aspiration for the future. Many view such politicians as dead weight, heavy and cumbersome burdens on both the polity as well as on political parties.        
	A few days later, we shall have the poll results on our television screens. Television channels will expose their biases by revealing the wins that they predicted, but will fall silent on the unexpected ones. Some anchors even become glum faced when they find their heroes failing! The expert opinionwallahs have become predictable. They speak of the United Progressive Alliance and the National Democratic Alliance instead of the Congress and the BJP. One lot says that the two national parties are going neck and neck, and the other lot states that there is a difference of 30 seats between them. Another lot is silently backing the Bahujan Samaj Party and its allies. The people know that the single largest party, if it crosses the 160-seat mark, will attract all the third- and fourth-front opportunists who will smell the heady scent of power. They will then blackmail their ally to get a berth for themselves. The same game will be played out because regional leaders have participation in the government at the Centre as their top priority.

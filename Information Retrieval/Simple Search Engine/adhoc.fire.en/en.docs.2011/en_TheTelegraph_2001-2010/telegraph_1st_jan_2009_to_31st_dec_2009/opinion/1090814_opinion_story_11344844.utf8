                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Life for money                  
	Sir  With reference to the report, Early farmer suicides (Aug 9), the government, both at the Centre and in the states, should be more proactive in preventing such cases. The government spends a sizeable amount of taxpayers money on schemes intended to help farmers financially. But the death of farmers who cannot pay their debts has not stopped. This suggests that either some loans meant for farmers are not reaching them, or that farmers are not aware of how to avail themselves of the loans, or cannot do so owing to the difficulties of paperwork, or for not possessing documents that would entitle them to such benefits.          
	In order to address this problem, the government could launch an extensive media campaign through the Doordarshan and over the radio to inform farmers in need, who could then approach the sarpanch or headman of their villages, who in turn would inform a higher functionary such as the block development officer or the branch-manager of the local government bank to expedite the process of borrowing or repaying money. The paperwork necessary for farmers to be able to borrow money from a bank should be simplified and relaxed as well. It would also be a good idea to have local non-governmental organizations and micro-financial institutions involved in the process to ensure that the money lent to farmers reaches them and is paid back.          
	A major reason why farmers commit suicide over fears of crop failure is that they borrow money from private moneylenders who charge exorbitant rates of interest. This evil practice should be stopped by the government by issuing an ordinance against it. It is time the government stopped thinking that merely throwing money at all problems would make them disappear. It should rather focus its efforts on the proper implementation of existing policies.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Closely watched game          
	Sir  The editorial, Dope for players (Aug 9), makes a fine analysis of the reluctance of some top Indian cricketers to comply with the guidelines issued by the World Anti-Doping Agency. The Indian cricketers reluctance to abide by the Wada guidelines can only bring disrepute to the game. By refusing to agree to the whereabouts clause of the Wada, which requires players to submit their travel schedules for a three-month period in advance, both the Board of Control for Cricket in India and the cricketers themselves have shown an irresponsible attitude toward the issue of drug abuse in sports. When most sportspersons around the world have agreed to the Wada norms, why should some cricketers have qualms about accepting the same citing privacy and security concerns?          
	Cricketers, too, must agree to the clause and the BCCI should cooperate with the International Cricket Council to enforce the Wada code of conduct. If Indian cricketers choose to remain adamant, their behaviour would generate needless controversy. The sports minister, M.S. Gill, has rightly advised that it is in Indias best interest that the cricketers adhere to the Wada rules. The BCCI must realize that cricket is not above other sports, and if a player like Roger Federer can accept the code, there is no reason why some cricketers should be exempted. The stringency of the code would lose its purpose if it is not followed by all.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Dilbag Rai, Chandigarh 

                
	Sir  The reservations about the whereabouts clause in the Wada norms cited by Indian players are unfounded. As responsible sportsmen playing at the highest level of the game, it is their duty to uphold the spirit of sportsmanship and set an example by unequivocally coming out against doping. As far as their privacy is concerned, given that cricketers have a hectic playing schedule throughout the year, their location is public knowledge most of the time. When they are not playing, most cricketers are tied up with sponsorship work and are very much in the media.          
	The Wada code has been adopted by over 500 sports organizations around the world, including the International Olympic Committee, and has been approved by more than 100 countries. In cricket, it is only the Indian players and the BCCI who have objected to the code. They should drop their high-handed attitude and accept the anti-doping guidelines.           
	Yours faithfully,       
J. Akshobhya, Mysore

                
	Sir  One wonders why it is only the BCCI that has asked the ICC for an independent anti-doping agency for the purpose of testing Indian cricketers, when all other cricket-playing nations have already accepted the Wada codes in spite of misgivings over the whereabouts clause. One cannot understand why such senior players as Tendulkar, Dhoni, Sehwag and others are not comfortable with the out of competition testing clause, when other sportspersons such as Abhinav Bindra see no objection. One cannot buy the BCCIs argument that Indian cricketers cannot disclose their whereabouts for reasons of security, since the schedules they submit to the Wada would not be disclosed.           
	Cricket has not been entirely free of drug abuse. The BCCI should not give the impression that it is less than committed to the issue. It will be better for cricket if Indian cricketers change their mindset and fall in line with the rules set by the Wada.           
	Yours faithfully,

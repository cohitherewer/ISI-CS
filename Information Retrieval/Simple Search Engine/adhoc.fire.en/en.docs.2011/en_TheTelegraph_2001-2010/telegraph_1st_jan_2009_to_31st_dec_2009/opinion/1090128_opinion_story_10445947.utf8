                                                                                                                 ONE HEAD                                                    
	There is a distinction between a political party and a country, even when the party is the ruling one. This may appear to be somewhat self-evident to most people, but not to the leadership of the Congress. The sudden illness of the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, showed the Congress up at its most indecisive and faction-ridden. It is understandable that the prime ministers hospitalization and operation have created a delicate situation since the country cannot possibly be left with no one attending to the top job. A further complication is the fact that the Constitution does not make provisions for an acting prime minister. But all this does not quite justify the arrangements that have now been put in place. They are full of glaring anomalies. On the one hand, the defence minister, A.K. Antony, was given the responsibility of standing in for the prime minister during the Republic Day celebrations. In other words, for that august occasion, Mr Antony became the public face of the nation, this being one aspect of prime ministerial responsibilities. But on the other hand, as far as running the government is concerned, Pranab Mukherjee, the minister for external affairs, has been given the task of taking on additional portfolios, and of chairing meetings of the cabinet and of important cabinet committees. It is difficult to comprehend the need to make such a division between these two aspects of the prime ministers job.        
	The only possible and reasonable explanation is that the Congress leadership could not make up its mind about who should be the de facto stand-in for Mr Singh during his operation and convalescence. It is obvious that a decision was taken not to vest Mr Mukherjee with the ceremonial duties of a prime minister. Yet his competence as a minister made him the first choice for running the government. Thus the atmosphere of suspicion and the need to maintain a balance of power within the party were allowed to prevail. The fact that this makes the country and its government look somewhat ridiculous was of no concern to the Congress leadership, even though the Congress proudly proclaims itself to be Indias only national party. The leadership of a country, even during an interlude, cannot be the object of ad hocism. The government of India can only have one head. The Congress, of all political parties, should know this best. Pettiness ill befits the leadership of the party that led Indias national movement.

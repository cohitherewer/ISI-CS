The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Quiet promise
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        QUIET PROMISE                                                    
	When the Union home minister, P. Chidambaram, initiated his quiet diplomacy sometime back, he seemed to be going back on a government policy stated by the prime minister  the State would have no truck with separatists in Jammu and Kashmir. Yet, the secessionists are the principal target of Mr Chidambarams diplomacy that is searching once again for the elusive consensus on the future of Kashmir within the Indian Union. The carnage in Mumbai and the bumbling ways of the National Conference government may have rekindled concerns about Kashmir. But there can be no questioning the will to find a political solution to Kashmir, nor the implicit acknowledgment on the part of the government that it would be foolhardy to ignore the moderates who abjure violence and are willing to open a dialogue with the Centre. Despite the misgivings and mistrust that have characterized such dialogue, the quiet diplomacy made a comfortable start and decent progress. There is believed to have been two rounds of secret parleys between government representatives and separatists, led primarily by the moderate Hurriyat faction of Mirwaiz Umar Farooq  who has shown grit and commitment to take the dialogue forward. Of course, there are challenges. Apart from the opposition from hardliners, particularly from Kashmirs Islamist icon, Syed Ali Shah Geelani, there has been rebellion within the Hurriyat against the talks. The assassination attempt on the moderate Hurriyat leader, Fazal Haq Qureshi, is bound to tie down the talks further by acting as a dampener and playing up the peoples fears.         
	Not just the government, but the moderate separatists too have to fight against tremendous odds to take the process further. Apart from the gun and the fear of being accused of selling out, they also have to contend with the rivalry of parties within the state that suspect the leadership of usurping their political space. It is not an easy journey. Hopefully, it will not be abandoned midway as before.

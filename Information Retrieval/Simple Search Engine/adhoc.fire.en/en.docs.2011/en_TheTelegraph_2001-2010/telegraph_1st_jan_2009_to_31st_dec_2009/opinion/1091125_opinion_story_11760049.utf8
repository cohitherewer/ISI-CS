The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Icons without Charisma
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        ICONS WITHOUT CHARISMA                                  Stephen Hugh-Jones                              
	I winced at the newspapers summary of its editorial: Tony Blair would be a charismatic figurehead  for the European Union  but.... My main objection was political: I found it grotesque that an independent Europe could even think of giving its top job to a past poodle of the White House. But I had another objection: charismatic.        
	Straight from ancient Greek, charisma is a perfectly usable word, and so is its adjective. But both are overused these days, and often misused. A man with charisma has an aura  of power, maybe, of goodness, intelligence, spirituality, maybe just personal charm  that draws people to him. What the words dont mean is simply a great guy or even more simply we approve. Gandhi had charisma by the bucketful. So does Nelson Mandela. But so did Hitler, Stalin and many other past villains. Not so Mikhail Gorbachev, great guy as I think him, and much to be approved of.        
	Thus far, The Times was right. It knows what charismatic means, and its but about Blair came for just that reason: it doesnt want a man with charisma as the EUs president. But it was mistaken, in my view, to apply the word to Blair. Whatever his past success, his present charisma in Britain is very little. Ditto in the Israeli/Arab world, where he is meant to be mediating. He stops the traffic in Washington, his admirers claim. Could be, but Britons are apt to over-rate other Britons status in America. Would he stop the traffic in India? You tell me.        
	I see these as matters of fact, not political judgment. Charismatic is cheapened by being too widely applied, as any word can be. If a flower is just red, dont call it scarlet. If soldiers are brave, dont call them all heroes (as Britains media do today for its troops in Afghanistan). Its painful to be hit with a police lathi, but it isnt torture. Charismatic has become a clich, and is losing its meaning  its charisma, Im almost tempted to say, flouting my own advice.         
	Nor is it alone. Its cousin iconic is rapidly joining it. Icon is another old Greek word, literally a likeness. In English, it has one specialized usage in precisely that sense, in an inter-Christian dispute: the Vatican says women cannot be priests, because (inter alia) no woman can be an icon of the male Christ. My anti-Catholic prejudices riposte with the first book of the Bible: God created man in his own image... male and female created he them. But lets leave that to the theologians.        
	Less precisely, we find this sense in the modern icon of computer screens: a symbol vaguely like the facility it refers to. Much older, and even now maybe better known, is the use of icon for the pictures of Jesus Christ, his mother or other saints, in Greek and Russian churches. Its this usage that has swelled into todays avalanche of icon and iconic for any and every revered, admired, popular, well-known or even merely unusual person or object in any field.        
	Sportsmen, politicians, actors, physicists, pop groups; mountains, buildings, ships, designer furniture, shoes, handbags, perfumes: anything, these days, can be called an icon. Last week I met iconic applied to a clock that overhangs Winchesters high street  a nearby city which that clock no more symbolizes, to its citizens or anyone else, than this column symbolizes The Telegraph.        
	If you must call Everest, the Taj Mahal, the Howrah Bridge, Gandhi or  Ill stretch a point  maybe even Sourav Ganguly iconic or charismatic, so be it. But those words are losing their bite. Theyre the tired journalists way out of thinking up sharper ones. Sure, we hacks often are tired and must think up a lot of words in a short time. But even we should go easy on these two. People under less pressure should simply drop them, until theyve regained some real sense. The Wordcage can aspire to be an ornament. An icon it aint.

	Unlawful activity                  
	Sir  The lawyers of the Madras High Court have disgraced themselves by taking the law into their hands. Whatever their feelings might be about Sri Lankan Tamils, how could they throw rotten eggs, chappals and stones in the high court premises simply because no action had been taken against the former Union law minister, Subramanian Swamy? Swamy had come to the court to implead himself in a case challenging the government takeover of the Natarajar temple at Chidambaram. He had not violated any law by doing so. Moreover, Swamys views on the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam have been well known for long. So why target him now?           
	The lawyers who violated the sanctity of the court must be dealt with according to the law. Otherwise, their colleagues might emulate this example. Those found guilty should be barred from practice for one year, not only in Tamil Nadu, but also elsewhere in India.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Ganesh Sovani, Thane 

                
	Sir  The outbreak of violence between lawyers of the Madras High Court and the police was unfortunate. Unfolding on the court premises, this incident revealed the two major pillars of society falling out shamefully in public. This incident has dented public faith in the police and the judiciary.                     
	Yours faithfully,        Ganesh V. Hegde, Dharwad, Karnataka               
	Sir  In the light of the recent incidents in the Madras High Court premises, the Chief Justice of India should provide guidelines as to under what circumstances the police should enter court premises or educational institutions. It is unacceptable to demand that the police should not enter either of these premises, even in emergencies. In such cases, the seriousness of the situation calls for swift action on the part of the police and there may really be no time to seek permission from the concerned authorities before intervening. In the Madras High Court incident, I believe that the police are more sinned against than sinning, as the rules and guidelines to their conduct, if they exist at all, remain vague and subject to interpretation.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
N.S. Venkataraman, Chennai

                
	Sir  It was shocking to see television footage of lawyers behaving like an unruly mob in their bid to overpower the police. Close on the heels of the ugly assault on Subramanian Swamy by a group of lawyers in the presence of judges, came this violent clash with the police. Tamil Nadu used to be a haven of peace, but this incident clearly shows that the law-and-order situation there has deteriorated over the years.           
	Yours faithfully,       
R. Sekar, Visakhapatnam 

                
	Sir  The outrageous attack on the Janata Party leader, Subramanian Swamy, seemed pre-planned. The pro-LTTE elements, which included advocates, had come prepared with rotten eggs and stones to hurl at him. The state government must not give in to the demands of these self-proclaimed protectors of Sri Lankan Tamils, and should not pardon their misdeeds. Those responsible for the mayhem in the high court premises should issue an apology for the way they treated another set of Tamils living in India.          
	Yours faithfully,      
J.S. Acharya, Hyderabad

                
	Sir  It is appalling how people, who are supposed to uphold the dignity of law, turned violent, defied the law, and fought a pitched battle with the police on the premises of the Madras High Court. These so-called lawyers have tarnished the image of their profession. Contempt of court should be invoked against the people responsible for the terrible episode in Tamil Nadu. The legal fraternity should be made to understand that it is not above the law. The erring lawyers should be given exemplary punishment for their unruly behaviour.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Dilbag Rai, Chandigarh

                
	Sir  Lawyers are known to be nyayavadhis  they argue in favour of justice. But in the Madras High Court, they broke the law. The assault on Subramanian Swamy is unpardonable. The lawyers should have kept the feelings for the Tamil cause away from the high court. Setting fire to a police station or to vehicles was certainly not the right way to express dissent. The Supreme Court should conduct an inquiry into the incident and the errant lawyers ought to be suspended. This is the least that can be done to restore public confidence in the judiciary.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Dismal record          
	Sir  The efforts on the part of the block development officer of Sainthia to make the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme a success may not be as praiseworthy as it sounds (Work at last, Feb 9). Poor people should not be coerced to stay on in their villages with the promise of work. There is every possibility that the government may betray them by denying their proper wages or curtailing the number of days of work they get. In absence of a better option, people are bound to leave home in search of work. The democratic right of peoples free movement should not be curtailed in the way it is being done in Sainthia.           
	When Rajasthan can achieve the highest national average of 100 days work, why is West Bengal left with a pitiful record? This bodes badly for a government that claims a mass base among the downtrodden. The administration lacks planning and cannot provide the people with jobs under Central schemes. This is not a failure first of its kind. Recently, West Bengal could not use the Central grant allotted for rural health development and most of the money went back, whereas states like Tamil Nadu made good use of the same funds. West Bengals Marxists rarely help the deprived. Government officials are mostly interested in pay hike  who cares if the poor are sinking into complete darkness?          
	Yours faithfully,

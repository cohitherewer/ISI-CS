	On the right side of the law                  
	Sir  It is heart-rending to read about accidents, especially in which the victims are children. They are often caused by reckless driving or poor road conditions. No one seems to care and the incidents are soon forgotten. Stricter laws and heftier fines would thwart people from causing such harm. Traffic laws are the same across the world, but in developed nations, people fear the law, and that makes them more responsible on roads. In India, accidents can be prevented if people can be taught to respect and fear the law early in life.          
	Yours faithfully,

	All in the family          
	Sir  In The winner takes all (May 29), Swapan Dasgupta rues the success of family-run parties in the recent elections. But political families have not imposed themselves on the nation, they have been legitimately elected. If Congress members agree to be controlled by a single family, and if a vast section of the electorate endorses such an arrangement, nobody should complain. Indira Gandhi was the founder of this political model and a number of politicians have emulated her example.          
	On the other side of the spectrum are the democratically-run parties whose leaders have worked their way up to reach the upper echelons. Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Sushma Swaraj, Prakash Karat and Sitaram Yechury have made it to the top without any family backing. But the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Communist Party of India (Marxist), parties in which the hand of a single family is not writ large, are now in a shambles. But the idea of democracy is not to establish royal families through the backdoor. However, one can do precious little if the electorate accepts family-run parties. In India, such families are politically established by the blessings of a sizeable section of the population. The other factor that contributes to their popularity is the media coverage they receive. In the days to come, democratically-run parties should work harder to offer a better political alternative. Or else, the people of India will have to settle for dynastic politics.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Killer smoke          
	Sir  The Indian government has celebrated No Tobacco Day on May 31 in a perfunctory manner. It has endorsed the printing of pictorial warnings on cigarette packs but only half-heartedly. The area of the cigarette pack on which the pictorial warnings are printed is a mere 40 per cent, perhaps the lowest in the world. Brazil has printed larger pictorial warnings and on both sides of the packs. The only remedy to effectively curb smoking is to impose a complete ban on the manufacture and sale of cigarettes in the country. Revenue-loss from a ban on cigarettes will be more than compensated by funds saved on tobacco-related diseases.          
	Yours faithfully,        Madhu Agrawal,Dariba, Delhi                     
	Sir  There could not be a more effective deterrent for smoking than pictorial warnings showing lungs disfigured by cancer on packets of tobacco products, that too on 40 per cent of their surface. But what about alcohol consumption? If smoking can disfigure the lungs, alcohol can ruin the liver. NGOs should work towards curbing alcohol consumption to realize the dream of a healthy society.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  I would like to thank the censor board for chopping the scene showing priests smoking in Angels amp; Demons. One fails to understand what the director was trying to convey through that scene.                    
	Yours faithfully,

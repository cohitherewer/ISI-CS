                                                                                                                 IT IS NOT DARK YET                                  Fifth Column - Gwynne Dyer                              
	Nick Griffin, the leader of the British National Party, is a soft fascist who does not rant in the 1930s style. But he came pretty close to the old style two months ago when, newly elected to the European Parliament, he called for very tough measures to stop illegal African migrants from entering the European Union by crossing the Mediterranean in boats.        
	Interviewed afterwards by the BBC, he said: Frankly, they need to sink several of those boats. The interviewer interrupted him, protesting that the EU does not murder people. I didnt say anybody should be murdered at sea, Griffin replied. I say boats should be sunk, they can throw them a life raft, and they can go back to Libya. But Europe has...to close its borders or its going to be swamped by the third world. Its standard neo-fascist rhetoric, and the people who use it are still shunned by the mainstream of European politics. But if the Copenhagen climate summit in December does not make a serious start at getting climate change under control, that may be mainstream rhetoric in Europe in 20 years time.        
	The poorer countries closer to the equator will be hit first, and worst, by global warming. As their crops die from too much heat and too little water, huge numbers of climate refugees will head north  out of Mexico and Central America to the United States of America, out of Africa and the Middle East to the European Union. Griffin-style talk will start to sound reasonable, and the southern borders of Europe and the US will become fortified zones.        
	So there is some comfort to be had from this weeks offer by Japans prime minister-elect, Yukio Hatoyama, to cut his countrys emissions to 25 per cent below the 1990 level by 2020.That is a huge advance on the previous Japanese governments offer of a 8 per cent cut by 2020. Since the EU has already adopted a target of 20 per cent emission cuts on 1990 levels by 2020, with a promise to go to 30 per cent cuts at the Copenhagen talks if other industrialized nations do the same, there now seems to be a serious offer on the table. But there is also a catch.                
	Another goal        
	The catch is that the offers by Japan and the EU both depend on other developed countries  by which they mean the US  adopting a similar target. But President Barack Obama isnt promising any cut at all on the 1990 level of US emissions. Hes just offering to get back to that level by 2020, using as an excuse the growth of US emissions during eight years of denial under the Bush administration. Both the Europeans and the Japanese know that the US is not going to offer deep cuts at Copenhagen, so it will not have to deliver on its own offers. And if the industrialized countries do not commit to really deep cuts, then rapidly developing countries like China and India will not accept even the fuzziest constraints on their own emissions.        
	So what can be accomplished at Copenhagen? Not much in terms of hard targets, probably, but the game does not end there. There is one really valuable thing that Obama can achieve at Copenhagen.The game of percentage cuts on past emissions is fundamentally stupid. To avoid the risk of runaway heating, we must never exceed an average global temperature 2 degrees centigrade higher than it was in 1990. That equates to 450 parts per million of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and we are already at 390 ppm.         
	Thats the right target, and making it official would transform the negotiating process. We would then be dealing with real numbers, and the negotiations would be about dividing up the remaining permissible emissions between the various countries. It was Barack Obama who pushed all 20 high-emitting countries into accepting 2 degrees centigrade as the never-exceed limit on global warming at the G8/G20 summit in Italy, so were already halfway there. Maybe at Copenhagen, hell drop the other shoe.

	Delayed justice                  
	Sir  It is heartening to know that justice is not always denied, although it is often delayed. The judicial verdict for the assasination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was delivered after 34 years. Meanwhile, a number of grisly political developments rocked the newborn nation, Bangladesh, after it was liberated from the oppressive Pakistani military regime (Long wait, Nov 24).          
	The slain leaders daughter, Sheikh Hasina Wajed, on coming to power, revoked the indemnity ordinance that was issued by the military regime immediately after Rahmans gruesome killing to ensure no trial of the case took place. But the ordinance was nullified once again by Wajeds successor, Begum Khaleda Zia, who supposedly had no interest in pursuing the case to its logical conclusion.          
	While in Opposition, Wajed faced multiple hazards including the heinous grenade attack on her life as she was addressing a party rally. On being re-elected, she mustered the courage to resume the trial. She is also to be credited for her determination to bring the Bangladesh Rifles jawans, accused of leading a mutiny against the State last February, to book if found guilty. Bangladeshs secular identity is perpetually under threat. The large Hindu population in the country that is not willing to leave the land of its birth despite fear and insecurity, now feels safe on Wajeds triumphant comeback. This was my experience too during a two-week visit to my birthplace at Laksam in the district of Comilla last March. I felt quite at ease there and travelled freely from one place to another.          
	I also felt that the bulk of the Bangladeshis hold Wajed in high esteem. They want peace to prevail in the country without any communal and separatist flare-ups. The editorial rightly says that the divide between the two principal parties poses the biggest challenge to this honest intent. A need for reconciliation is felt in all quarters, especially since the countrys economy is under severe strain. As in India, secessionist elements are at work to wreck democracy, peace and stability. Without a determined resistance from the government and the public, a solution to this seemingly intractable problem will, in all likelihood, continue to remain elusive.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
P.B. Saha, Calcutta

                
	Unclean chit          
	Sir  Jairam Rameshs comment that if there were a Nobel prize for filth, India would get it, is unwarranted and does not befit the post he holds, that of the minister of environment and forests (Jairam books filth Nobel, Nov 21). There is no harm in stating things the way one sees them, but Ramesh is expected to speak in an appropriate manner. He also needs to recognize that it is politicians like him who are largely responsible for this problem. Politicians have failed to promote agriculture, which has resulted in large-scale migration from rural areas to the cities. Increased settlement in urban areas has resulted in the creation of more and more slums, which in turn have been responsible for generating filth. Politicians, however, tend to support industrialists who set up polluting industries. There is seldom anyone to make sure that the law that makes it obligatory for industries to clean up their own filth is implemented.          
	Yours faithfully,      
S. Kamat, Bardez, Goa

                
	Sir  It is true that our cities are dirty, and Calcutta would top the list of the dirtiest metros. But who is responsible for this and, more importantly, what can be done to awaken the non-existent sense of hygiene among Calcuttans? It is not only the homeless who add to the existing filth, as is commonly believed, but also supposedly educated people, who do not tolerate filth in their houses, do not think twice before littering. Delhi is much cleaner because people there are more conscious of their civic duties. Calcutta, too, can become a cleaner city if only its inhabitants start acting responsibly.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Hina Murtaza, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The civic authorities should be held responsible for not keeping the streets clean. People, too, should be ashamed for their pitiable civic sense. On their part, the resident welfare associations do precious little to ensure hygienic conditions in most localities. The civic bodies must launch an awareness drive immediately to guarantee a clean and healthy India. Being the national capital, Delhi, and its satellite townships, should serve as examples for the rest of the country. School curricula must include lessons in hygiene and cleanliness. The government could perhaps give an annual award to the cleanest Indian city to encourage the public and the authorities to keep their cities tidy.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Mahesh Kapasi, New Delhi 

                
	Water woes          
	Sir  The tall claims made by the mayor of Calcutta, on the occasion of the centenary of the Tallah tank, on the water supply system in Calcutta sounded hollow. I live in the Baishnabghata-Patuli township, where the water is unfit for human use. The hardness of the water is about 10 times above the permissible limit and it is full of iron and other dissolved minerals. If tested, perhaps traces of arsenic may also be found in it. White clothes turn reddish after a few washes, we have to buy packaged drinking water, and appliances like geysers and electric kettles become defunct easily. The lack of planning in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation is obvious from the fact that it has established townships without proper infrastructure. The only silver lining is that the tenure of the mayor and his team is likely to end after a few months and one may hope for the best after that.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta

                              Reach out      
	 If you thought social networking was all about amorous overtures or idle tittle-tattle, then think again. The cyberspace is fast becoming an important destination for those aspiring to greater political glory. If LK Advani is ubiquitous on google, can Rahul Gandhi be far behind? The Congress think tank has finally woken up to the power and possibilities of the dotcom boom. The Young Gandhi may be an avid traveller, ever willing to reach out to the aam admi across vast distances, but now, with the magic of Facebook, Orkut and YouTube, he can go places far beyond the rural hinterland. The party managers have realized that it is not good enough to rely only on the common man; the leader-in-making must also woo the urban, tech-savvy electorate. To this end, executives from Google have already made a presentation before the AICC bastion, but campaign managers were not easy to please. They have asked Google to focus more closely on email and employment-related websites so that every time users type in any related search words, these portals throw up the political ads. This is serious business, and the web is a dangerous place. With elections around the corner, the party would do well without having Rahulbabas speeches find their way into seedy websites!                
	 It is not as if the Congress is the only one abuzz with new plans. At the rival camp, Sushma Swaraj continues to rack her brains in search of the ever-elusive safe seat. The latest update is that the lady has finally zeroed in on Vidisha, in Madhya Pradesh, once held by none other than the former prime minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Previously, Swaraj had set her sights on Bhopal, the state capital, only to be thwarted by Kailash Joshi, the ex-CM and BJP MP from Bhopal. Although touching 80, Joshi dug his heels in when he was asked to vacate the seat. If LK Advani, Joshi retorted, could be the prime-ministerial candidate at 81, then he, too, was fit enough to seek re-election from the safest constituency.       
	Understandably, the partys rank and file are terribly miffed by this monopoly exerted by senior leaders over the proverbial safe seats. If the seasoned hands cannot rely on their personal charm to win over voters from the difficult seats, where does that leave the rest? Isnt it going to be tougher for the poor ordinary workers to conquer the relatively unsafe ground?                             
	 Staying with Sushma Swaraj: insecurity, it seems, is stalking her these days  and not just in her hunt for a safe seat. Mention Arun Jaitley, and Sushma behenji turns red in the face, not with shame but with anger. The other day, there was heated speculation in the media while discussing the electoral prospects of the BJP, that Jaitley would be the best person to take over once the prolonged Vajpayee-Advani innings comes to a close. Not only does he have the political acumen and a strong public image, but he also strikes the right balance between the extreme and the moderate views within the party. He even appears to be a decent, well-spoken man, with a vision for a modern, progressive India. True as all this might be, whispers are inevitably doing the rounds in the corridors of 11 Ashoka Road that Jaitley himself had arranged for this self-advertisement. And at least one fuming party leader would not disagree.                            
	 From real life theatrics now on to reel life drama. A 30-minute documentary film on the life of Keshav Baliram Hedgewar, the founder of the RSS, had been commissioned by the Vajpayee government. Although considerable amount of the taxpayers money was spent on it, the film remained confined to the vaults of the films division without having a single screening. Not that it would have been a box-office hit, but it appears that the release date was mistimed a bit. By the time the film was submitted for telecast in 2005, there had already been a change of guards at the Centre. Scarcely anybody could expect a Congress-led and Left-supported coalition to promote a film on the life of a far-Right ideologue. But will the tables be turned at last? With the voters willing, the balance of power may be reversed, and the fateful film could perhaps see the light of day, come April-May.                            
	 It doesnt matter what goes on in the name of dissent in the Rajya Sabha, so long as it is done in correct English. Jaswant Singh, the Opposition leader in the Upper House, was clearly not happy with the presidents address  least of all, with its style. At the debate that followed the address, Singh waxed eloquent on how the text was riddled with syntactical and proofing errors. Since the thrust of his attack was largely on the stylistic demerits of the presidents speech, the next day a party colleague had to take up from where Singh had left off, focusing more on the content rather than the form.

	 Everybody at 24 Akbar Road remains engrossed in finding an image makeover for Rahul Gandhi. Manmohan Singhs return as the Congress prime-ministerial candidate may be the talk of the town, but Rahul Gandhi, interestingly, is going to be on all the posters, banners and publicity material. Whats more, he wont be seen in glasses in the photographs! Another party loyalist was preening himself in the limelight as well. The veteran, Mani Shankar Aiyar seems to be keen on a brand new self-fashioning. He knows too well how photogenic he is. At the launch of his new book, A Time of Transition: Rajiv Gandhi to the 21st Century, Aiyar surprised the bevy of photographers by pointing out the angle most suited to reveal his best features: Dont click me from this side, he said, From the right-hand side, I look like Johnny Walker, but if you click me from the other side, I resemble Dev Anand. No wonder the lensmen went mad with excitement.

                                                                                                                 PLAIN TRUTHS                                                     
	Even the Chinese must have known that there was no question of New Delhi reconsidering its decision to allow the Dalai Lama to visit Arunachal Pradesh next month. But by refusing to be swayed by Beijings objections to the visit, the prime minister showed that he could more than match Beijings hard-ball diplomacy. And he did so in a manner that is characteristic of Manmohan Singhs style of functioning. There was no flourish about it or any sign of unnecessary aggressiveness. Instead, he explained why Indias decision was perfectly reasonable and why China had no business to react the way it did. Even the Chinese cannot quarrel with Mr Singhs description of the Dalai Lama as a religious leader. And they know how New Delhi prevented any large-scale anti-China protests, which rocked other countries, on the eve of the Beijing Olympics. Not that India needed to please China on this; New Delhis position reflected its policy of not allowing the Tibetan refugees to use their country of exile for anti-China politics. The Chinese should take two clear messages from the prime ministers firmness  that India will not interfere with the Dalai Lamas rights as a religious leader, and that it will not compromise its territorial rights over Arunachal Pradesh.        
	However, there is no need to see Mr Singhs plainspeaking as the sign of a new trend of Beijing-bashing. He is too mature a statesman to give in to populist calls to take hawkish positions on China. This was evident in the way he played down some recent reports of Chinese incursions across the border. During his talks with the Chinese premier, Wen Jiabao, in Thailand, Mr Singh did not shirk from admitting that the two countries had some border disputes to settle. Despite Chinas problem with the Dalai Lamas visit to Arunachal Pradesh, he came up with the idea of India developing a strategic partnership with China. This clearly is the mark of a new confidence, and India will need more of this in dealing with China. Not engaging with China is not an option; taking an unnecessarily hostile line is even less so. The solution of the border dispute, both sides know, will take a long time. But that should not stop them from doing business in other areas. The prime ministers firm and confident approach should make votaries of the China threat line look pretty amateurish.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A newly minted identity
                                                                                                                 A NEWLY MINTED IDENTITY                                  THIS ABOVE ALL - Khushwant Singh                          Unanswered questions                                        
	The terrorist attack on the police academy in the outskirts of Lahore that took a heavy toll on life once again got me asking, Who are these terrorists? What motivates them to suicidal attacks? What do they hope to achieve by slaughtering innocent people? So far I have not found plausible answers to my questions. The terrorist groups go by a variety of names like al Qaida, Lashkar-e-Toiba, Jaish-e-Mohammad. Their motivators keep changing; they have no unified command. They never seem to be short of cash to buy the latest varieties of lethal weapons. The only thing they seem to have in common is  their members are young (between 20 and 30 years), illiterate or semi-literate, poor and without knowledge of the world. The vast majority of them are Muslims, and yet, they target fellow Muslims by attacking mosques when these are full, as during the Friday prayers. And still they claim to be doing all they do in the name of Islam. In the Lahore encounter both they and para-military forces, which overcame them, kept shouting God is Great  Allah-o-Akbar.        
	It is reasonable to conclude that most Muslim terrorists are from Pakistani Punjab or the tribal belts between it and Afghanistan. The government is either unwilling or unable to contend with this ever-increasing menace. What is even more alarming is that there are sizeable numbers of young Muslims living in America, Europe as well as in Muslim countries sympathizing with these radical elements, who wear skull-caps, grow beards and make their womenfolk wear head-scarves. They are opposed to modern ways of living, and hate America and Israel. They may be called Homo Islamicus or the new Islamic humans.        
	I got answers to many of my questions from the recently published Stranger to history by Aatish Taseer. Aatish is the product of mixed parentage: father, Salman Taseer, a Pakistani Muslim, currently governor of Pakistani Punjab, and mother, Tavleen Singh, an Indian Sikh and eminent journalist. The affair between the two was of brief duration. Aatish was brought up with his Sikh cousins, uncles and aunts in Delhi. When he was six years old, he first discovered he was different from his cousins. While playing with them he went to a wall to empty his bladder. His Sikh cousins joined him and glanced at his penis. One of them came back and told his uncles and aunts: Aatish ka susa nanga hai  Aatishs penis is bald. The assemblage broke into hysterical laughter. Being circumsized was the first thing that informed Aatish he was Muslim. So the voyage of discovery of Muslim identity began from England across Europe to Turkey, Iraq, Syria, Iran and Saudi Arabia to Pakistan. He learnt to go through the motions of namaaz; he went to Mecca on the lesser pilgrimage (Umra), carefully concealing the steel kada his Sikh grandmother had given him and the tattooed image of Shiva on his arm. He did not accept any religion but observed those who did, and what it did to them. In short, his conclusion is that in countries where people are free to choose their own faith and practise it in their own ways, there are fewer problems. But in countries where the governments dictate the religious rituals to be observed, people conform out of fear of punishment. They do it for outward appearances without really believing in them. Unfortunately, this happens to be so in all Muslim countries, save Turkey and perhaps Egypt.        
	Aatish Taseers book makes good reading. It is very well worded and makes you think.                
	Curious couplet                
	Reading Mirza Ghalib for the umpteenth time I got stuck with a couplet which I could not understand. It reads: Hastee hamaaree apni fanaa par daleel hai/ Yaan tak mitey keh apni kasam ham aap huey        
	Before I give my version, allow me to say a few words about the trouble I took in deciphering the lines. As is my habit, I asked my Urdu-knowing friends to enlighten me. I asked Syeda Hameed. I could not grasp what she meant. Next I asked Mushirul Hasan, vice-chancellor of Jamia Millia Islamia, and his public relations officer, Rakhshanda Jalil. She sent me a lengthy explanation of her version. Finally, I wrote to Deepak Tandon of Panchkula, who I have adopted as my literary mentor. He sent me two pages of the entire ghazal with his translation. These lines still elude my understanding. I make my own translation:                
	My life is defined by its end        
	I erased my being to this extent         
	That I became forfeit to my own existence.                
	I am not at all sure if I have got closer to what the great poet meant. I end by quoting what he had to say about charges that he was hard to understand.                
	Na sataish ki tamanna, na siley ki parvah        
	Gar nahin mere ashaar mein manee na sahi.        
	I desire not praise, for rewards         
	I dont care a bit,        
	If my verses do not have meanings,so be it.                
	Caught in cricket                
	Banta was a cricket fanatic. One day, Santa went to visit his office.        
	Santa: I see you have three trays on your desk. The first one is marked In, the second one is marked Out and the third one is marked LBW. In and Out I can understand, but what does LBW mean?        
	Banta: That is pending tray. LBW means Let the b****** wait.

	After more than 60 years of independence, can a medium-sized Indian publishing house, with a staff strength of 30 to 40 and a few small offices in the metros, survive on the strength of its own publications? Or does it still need to depend on a mix of its own and imported titles, plus some reprints and books of other publishers?         
	Lets face it: no Indian publishing house can survive on the strength of its own list, no matter how much it is identified with its own niche of publishing. There are three reasons for a publishing house to supplement its own list.        
	First, the explosion of knowledge in every field, from pre-primary school lists to universities, besides professional courses that require a wide cross-section of books. No publisher, either here or abroad, can cater to such a wide variety of interests.        
	Second, Indian publishers have not been able to commission authors to write even for the core requirements of textbooks for the the humanities and social sciences up to undergraduate levels. Where such books exist under Indian imprints, they have been printed under licence from British and American publishers.         
	Third, the best of Indian scholarship  this goes even for creative writing  has found a slot with British and American publishers. With virtually hundreds of Indian teachers in British and American universities and even a larger number of professionals working abroad, it is easy to understand why they are accepted on par with British and American authors. And Indian authors willingly go abroad because of higher royalties and advances, and better professional services.        
	Despite the fact that we have a clear advantage with lower production costs, we have to fall back on outside support because we havent been able to throw up enough original works of our own. And because we havent been able to do so, we have to get foreign titles to enrich our own lists. Besides, there are clear financial advantages for Indian publishers to opt for collaboration, either by way of straight imports or reprints under licence.         
	For finished books, all imported books have a specially reduced price that makes them affordable to the Indian market. For instance, Amartya Sens latest book, The Idea of Justice, priced at 25 in Britain, is sold for Rs 699 here  and such cases can be multiplied for practically every British and American book.         
	For reprints, the case is stronger. When an Indian publisher acts as a representative of a British or an American publisher, he gets the first right of refusal for printing a book with exclusive distribution rights for the Indian market. With considerably lower production costs here, the Indian publisher can sell the book at a rate that is even lower than the specially reduced imported prices.         
	Indigenous publishing of established books that have been tried and tested in the market here have two other advantages. First, there are no risks involved because we already know these books. Second, the Indian publisher doesnt have to go through the travails of commissioning authors, editing and then selling the book in an uncertain market.         
	Given the swings and roundabouts, we would be doing well on a 50:50 basis.       RAVI VYAS

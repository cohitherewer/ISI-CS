	The exhibition at Chitrakoot Art Gallery, Roving Eye Presents Why Woman (Nov 1-7), raised a lot of questions while not quite answering the one implicit in the title. This show of paintings and photographs on women had only five photographs, none of them identifying the photographer, and most of them so pointless that one wonders why they were included at all.        
	One photograph was a breathtakingly dull shot of three women, with their backs to the camera, photographing the Taj. It was the kind of photograph that is to be found in every family album, where the pictures have nothing but nostalgic value, and that too only for the person taking them. The next photograph in the series showed one of the three women in the previous shot, but this time the camera was focused on her rear, highlighting its none too attractive curves. The unnamed photographer is probably a mean-minded sexist who had some personal scores to settle with this poor lady.        
	The photograph of an old woman in the middle of what seemed like a flood, her arms akimbo, face contorted with indignation, was a notch above trite. The paintings were vintage, by the likes of Chintamani Kar, Jogen Choudhury and Ganesh Pyne. Kars line drawing (dated July, 1939) of a woman doing her hair was haunting. So was Pynes lady with a choker, who, with her enormous eyes and flared nostrils looked like a cross between Durga and Lamia. Most of the other paintings, by various unidentified artists, were not as praiseworthy. The majority of them were a free expression of the artists fantasies and showed women with unnatural anatomical features either wading in or rising out of water. Needless to say, their wet clothes clung to their body, and they stared coyly at the viewer.        
	Two old prints, one of Manadasundari playing a violin and the other of Kumudasundari preparing a paan, from the Kansaripara Art Studio on Kristo Das Pal Lane were rare and interesting documents. But the pick of the exhibition was obviously the pata chitra scrolls of mythologized lesbian love. The first panel showed something like an orgy involving the goddess, Chhinnamasta, who, along with her attendants, made a feast of the blood flowing out of her decapitated body. The next panels displayed two women having sex, with another woman and a dog or jackal serving as witnesses. Their lovemaking seems to have liberated the women, so that one of them becomes lady Vishnu, in the reclining pose, with a black lotus sprouting from her navel. Then again she becomes Chhinnamasta, offering her life-blood to her partner and attendants.         
	The last panel had a captivating note: Lesbian love between Kakoli-Natasha-Camellia: Kakoli representing Chinnymasta [sic], Camy-Natasha representing Dakini Hakini: 18-4, 1840 John Chip.

                                                                                                                 URGENT ACTION                                                    
	Indias first victim of swine flu is a school-going child of fourteen. This fact, together with the sequence of events that led to her death, points up the specific challenges of tackling the swine flu pandemic in India. For some reason, which the World Health Organization has not been able to fathom yet, the infection is showing up more among the young. In India, though, the picture is slightly different: schoolchildren upto their early teens seem to be most at risk. This determines both the focus of the preventive action and also the nature of the panic around the flu. Rida Sheikhs death could have been prevented if the hospital to which she had been admitted and the private laboratory to which her sample had been sent had been more scrupulous and clued in about what to do and not do. Now that the government has changed its strategy for tackling the pandemic, the risk of mismanagement is even greater. With the normal influenza season already begun, it is likely that an unmanageable number of people will be turning up at the authorized hospitals to get themselves checked or tested, and every such institution must have its action plan ready and its medical and paramedical personnel adequately trained. Decisions regarding whom to test and whom to treat at home or in the hospital will have to be taken quickly. The proper distribution of medicines and efficient testing are also important, especially since private hospitals and laboratories cannot be relied upon.        
	Indias population, its peculiar urban-rural divide, the initial symptoms being indistinguishable from those of the normal flu, all make preventive and therapeutic strategies particularly challenging to implement. Children going to school, their teachers and guardians, are especially to be targeted, but without causing undue panic. The numbers still do not call for extreme alarm. Focusing exclusively on people coming in from abroad is not going to help either. The private medical sector should be brought into the action immediately, but only after it has been brought up to the mark in terms of expertise and scruple. Work on the vaccine is also crucial, and must be expedited. If the flu spreads as rapidly as predicted by the WHO, then there is no time to lose. In Calcutta, the Infectious Diseases Hospital has to become a little less of the hell that it is now for people to report there voluntarily.

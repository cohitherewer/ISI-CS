The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | at the scene of crime
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        AT THE SCENE OF CRIME                                  Gwynne Dyer - Fifth Column                              
	The city of Copenhagen is a crime scene tonight, with the guilty men and women fleeing to the airport, said John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK, on the night of December 18. There are no targets for carbon cuts and no agreement on a legally binding treaty.        
	The guilty men included the American president, Barack Obama, and the Brazilian president, Luiz Incio Lula da Silva, who took the first planes out. Xie Zhenhua, the head of Chinas delegation, lingered behind to declare that the meeting has had a positive result, everyone should be happy. But many people are unhappy, including most of the 130 presidents and prime ministers who showed up for the conference.        
	Their countries spent two weeks struggling unsuccessfully to bridge the gulf between the rich and the poor nations over who pays to fix the eminently fixable problem of global warming. They were clear on the goal  they wanted a treaty that would hold warming to a safe level (although they could not agree on what that level was). Most of them even wanted to make it legally enforceable. The Copenhagen Accord, by contrast, was a drive-by shooting, agreed in a few hours among the United States of America, China, Brazil, India and South Africa. It contains no hard numbers for emission cuts and no deadlines. Yet, Barack Obama insisted that it was a meaningful result, because they had agreed to set a mitigation target to limit warming to no more than 2C and, importantly, to take action to meet this objective.        
	For this, 192 countries spent two weeks negotiating at Copenhagen? It was an utter waste of time. Even I knew that it was bound to end up like that. Two weeks ago, I wrote: The Copenhagen summit will certainly fail to deliver the right deal. The danger is that it will lock us into the wrong deal, and leave no political space for countries to go back and try to get it right later. Well, Copenhagen certainly didnt lock us into the wrong deal. The reason no deal was possible is because public opinion in the developed countries is still in denial about the fact that the final climate deal must be asymmetrical. Until the people grasp that, especially in the US, there will be no real progress.                
	Time runs out        
	For two centuries, the countries that are now developed got rich by burning fossil fuels, filling the atmosphere with greenhouse gases, to the point where it now has little remaining capacity to absorb carbon dioxide without tipping us into disastrous heating.        
	This means that the rapidly developing countries like China, India and Brazil will push the whole world into runaway warming if they follow the same path in growing their economies. Since they are relatively poor, however, they have been investing mainly in fossil fuels, just as the West did when it was starting to industrialize.        
	So how do we deal with this unfair history? The developed countries must cut their emissions deeply and fast, and give the developing countries enough money to grow their economies with the clean energy. Thats the deal, but most voters in the US dont understand it yet.Thats why Obama couldnt promise to cut American emissions to 20 or 25 per cent below the 1990 levels by 2020, as most other industrialized countries were offering to do. Instead, he could only offer a paltry 4 per cent  and he couldnt even guarantee that. Until Americans start to take climate change seriously, Obama will not be able to move. It is politically impossible for the Chinese to make concrete commitments until the Americans do.        
	Each year in which we dont reach an adequate climate deal is probably costing us about 50 million extra premature deaths, but thats just the current tariff. By 2015, the annual cost in lives will be going up steeply. Time is not on our side.

	The night-long Sabrang Sangeet Sammelan at Kala Mandir was the pice de rsistance of the several classical music programmes that took place in and around the city last Saturday (January 17).        
	At the outset it was announced that Sabrang Music Trust, which organizes the Sammelan had donated Rs 2,25,000 in the current financial year to Matri Sangha Janakalyan Ashram that provides life-long free medical care to aged musicians nominated by the Trust. This was acknowledged by Rupali Moulik, general secretary of the Ashram, in her address a little later.        
	The most memorable item of the programme was the final one: the 93-minute portrayal of Ahir Bhairav by the sitar player, Kushal Das. His alap and jod displayed an undivided, song-like structure with phrase after phrase growing out of each other in a well-knit, organic manner. And each phrase, graced with the continuity and sustain of the Nikhil Banerjee style, was exquisitely tooled with flowing meends that seemed to move in all possible directions: forward, reverse and obverse. In fact, at this particular recital, Kushal Das seemed to be outdoing his model in more than one way. It was like Ekalavya growing larger than Dronacharya. In certain meends he utilized more grace notes than Nikhil Banerjee had done and in others he deflected more notes than the late maestro did in any comparable context.        
	In the faster section of the jod, Kushal Dass taankari seemed to have more variety, more clarity and at times longer range than those played by Nikhil Banerjee from the 1970s till his rather early death. In fact Dass jhala work was definitely sharper, clearer and utilized more rapid strokes than Banerjees had done. Where taankari is concerned, Kushals arsenal is definitely bigger and this is not a question of only variety either. For example, he plays a familiar quadruple-deck taan with the original Enayat Khan dir dir: something even the late Ustad Vilayat Khan usually avoided.        
	The sprightly vilambit and drut teental gatkari (the second starting out in sitarkhani) had similar structural finesse and displayed excellent rhythmic figures that always retained a fetching melodic line. Subhankar Banerjees tabla accompaniment measured up excellently and he worked out intelligent replies that packed enough skill to awe both lay and knowledgeable listeners. Equally impressive were the aochar and the sitarkhani gatkari in Mishra Bhairavi played in response to the call for an encore.        
	The first recital of the Sammelan was by young Arshad Ali Khan, who sang very promising khayals in Malkauns in the style of his guru and uncle, Mashkoor Ali Khan. Then came the first dance recital I have witnessed at this programme since it re-started in the year 2000. This was a Bharatnatyam recital by the actress, Jaya Seal Ghosh (originally Jaya Seal, with the Ghosh added after her marriage to the tabla player, Bickram Ghosh). Although this was her first solo Bharatnatyam performance, the dancer displayed the poise, confidence and grace of a seasoned professional, and was backed by a group led by her guru, the well-known Thankamani Kutty.        
	The khayal duo, Rajan and Sajan Mishra, taking the stage next, committed their old (non-cognizable) artistic offence of elaborating the rare Nayaki Kanada composition, Banara mora pyar, in the manner one would do in the case of, say, Mero piya, rasiya. The normal Re ga Ma Re Sa and ga Ma ni Pa phrases that the duo used frequently are taboo in the raga form crystallized in the rare composition, notated by Pandit Bhatkhande. Their ill-structured, watered-down Jasraj-style of elaboration did not ameliorate the offence.They also sang the drut khayal, Sajan bina bhai, a companion piece of the rare vilambit, in this manner, and worse, with the sam on madhyam: a note not highlighted in any form of Nayaki Kanada. Samar Sahas power-play on the tabla was the sugar coating on the distasteful pill. However, the Bageshree tarana in rupak tala came as a relief and was packed with impressive fast sargams and aakar taankari.         
	The only thing that impressed me about the rhythm-melody ensemble titled, Tarang, conceived by the tabla player, Abhijit Banerjee, was the excellent melody lead played by Snehashish Majumdar, the mandolin player.        
	Appearing just before Kushal Das, seasoned singer, Subhra Guha, delivered her khayals in the Pandit Ratanjankar-tailored form of Kaunsi Kanada with her usual sense of proportion and presentational expertise. But I dare say the Ratanjankar drut compositon, Kahe karata mose barajori, sounds like anything but Kaunsi Kanada to my sore ears. Her thumri in Desh was excellent and the quaint dadra almost as good.

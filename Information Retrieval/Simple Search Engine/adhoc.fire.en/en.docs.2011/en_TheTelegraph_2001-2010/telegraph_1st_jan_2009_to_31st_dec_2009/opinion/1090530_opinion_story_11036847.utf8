	Survival of the fittest                
	Drik India organized an exhibition of photographs, titled Images for Change: To change where we live and how we live, to celebrate World Fair Trade Week at Gaganendra Pradarshashala (May 9-15). Curated by Nilayan Dutta, who contributed a remarkable shot of a lone woman collecting prawn seeds in the choppy waters of Matla, the small body of photographs focused on marginalized men and women who often risk their lives to earn their keep in villages and in cities. The most striking images are those of lone human beings struggling for survival  Harish Tyagis little boys engulfed by deadly sludge and sewage, Swapan Nayaks woman casting her net in the Sunderbans, Zishaan Akbar Latifs labourers and Sudharak Olwes man cleaning the sewers in Mumbai. They could be from the lowest rungs of society, but they symbolize individuals anywhere, anytime, making a bid for survival against all odds without losing their humanity. Sohrab Hura has photographed the tribals of Chhattisgarh whose habitat has been pillaged, as well as the steel mills that have come up in tribal areas of Orissa. The privations of the tribals notwithstanding, these photographs have an undeniable poetic quality. But the nonchalance of the deprived is also to be admired. Olwes old man taking the air in the middle of the train tracks in Mumbai celebrates the chutzpah of such people.

The programme was structured beautifully, and the history related to each song was narrated brilliantly by the renowned scholar, Sudhir Chakraborty. Majumdar sang 12 songs with care, and in a voice that was sharp and flexible. Among the 12 songs, five deserve special mention: Amra moly batasenere jabo, Bela boye jaye, Eso prano sakha, Ayere basanto and Aar keno ma dakchho amay.

                                                                                                                 SAY NO TO POLS                                  Should the identity of an elector who rejects all candidates and chooses not to vote be kept secret? The Supreme Court will soon deliver a judgement on the debate surrounding the negative vote, reports V. Kumara Swamy                          Matter of choice: Electoral Voting Machines may soon have a none of the above alternative                                  
	A message encouraging people to vote for nobody during elections has probably been one of the most forwarded emails by Indian Netizens in recent times. The email claims, somewhat erroneously, that under Rule 49-O of The Conduct of Election Rules, 1961, voters have the power to reject all the candidates of a particular constituency by deciding not to vote during the elections.        
	Although much of what the message says is wrong, Rule 49-O itself has been a much debated issue. In fact, the Supreme Court is soon to deliver a judgement on a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by the Peoples Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) that asks for a change in Rule 49-O.        
	The PUCL claims that the rule doesnt maintain the secrecy of an elector who decides not to vote after he signs into the polling station. The PUCL is also asking the Supreme Court to direct the government to provide none of the above (NOTA) option in voting machines so that a person has the right to reject all the candidates on the ballot.         
	A number of civil society organisations, the Election Commission (EC) and even a handful of politicians have been calling for an extension of the 49-O rule to include the NOTA option. The Election Commission, which is one of the parties named in the PIL, has sided with the PUCL on both 49-O and NOTA.        
	As it stands, rule 49-O states, If an elector, after his electoral roll number has been duly entered in the register of voters in Form 17A and has put his signature or thumb impression thereon as required under sub-rule (1) of rule 49L, decided not to record his vote, a remark to this effect shall be made against the said entry in Form 17A by the presiding officer and the signature or thumb impression of the elector shall be obtained against such remark. Form 17A is the register of the polling booth which is signed by all the electors.        
	This provision breaches the right of secrecy of a voter. Currently, if somebody decides not to vote after signing into the booth, his or her name can be accessed by everybody from a polling officer to a politician. This is a major loophole, says Sanjay Parikh, Supreme Court advocate and PUCLs lawyer. Parikh says that if the name of the person is kept secret, it could urge many more to exercise their right not to vote although it may not impact the outcome of the election.         
	Arguing on behalf of the EC, advocate Meenakshi Arora told the apex court that since the provision compelled an elector to disclose his intention, it violated his fundamental right of speech and expression. The Supreme Court has, in fact, referred the matter to a larger constitutional bench as, according to Justices B.N. Agrawal and G.S. Singhvi, it involves the interpretation of a citizens fundamental rights.         
	But the government says that it is not in favour of changing the rule. Arguing for the government, additional solicitor general Amarendra Saran told the Supreme Court recently that Indian voters had no statutory right to refrain from voting and hence there was no need to change the rules or introduce the none of the above alternative.        
	49-O was one of the hottest topics discussed at a seminar on electoral reforms in Mumbai recently. Organised by the National Election Watch (NEW), a group of more than 1,200 civil society and non-governmental organisations working on electoral and governance issues, it made the point that 49-O needed to broaden its scope. The politicians dont want any changes in the electoral rules. In fact, 49-O should be strengthened and also expanded to include NOTA, says Anil Bairwal, national co-ordinator, NEW.        
	Some observers feel that it would be a good beginning if the Supreme Court were to rule that the names of the people who exercise the not to vote option be kept secret. Although this form of a non-vote would be treated as an abstention under the current rules, it will be a way of showing dissent against candidates and the parties they are nominated by,says Bairwal.        
	49-O forms part of the rules (49A to 49-X) that were added to The Conduct of Election Rules, 1961 by the government in 1992 to deal with the introduction of electronic voting machines (EVMs). When conventional ballot papers were used, people could deface or stamp on multiple candidates or not mark them at all to make their vote invalid. But with EVMs, an elector does not have any of these options of nullifying his vote. So the only way available to him is to exercise the not to vote option.        
	This rule is merely a safety procedure so that anyone who enters a booth to vote is accounted for. The polling officer is bound to put a mark against the name of a person who doesnt want to vote to avoid confusion at the time of counting. I see nothing wrong with this, says Chander Uday Singh, a senior advocate at Mumbai High Court.        
	Nainital-based Amit Marks, who exercised the option of not to vote under rule 49-O during the 2007 Uttarakhand assembly elections, says that people can show their dissent even under the existing system. Why do we need anonymity when we are not choosing anyone? In fact, the EC should publicise this provision so that more people can make up their minds, he says.        
	Constitutional expert Subash Kashyap terms the calls for changes to 49-O and the introduction of NOTA academic and elitist suggestions that are impractical. Kashyap had looked into these issues in 2001 as the head of the panel on electoral reforms under the National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution.        
	He points out that more than 70 per cent of the candidates get elected though they may not even have got half the votes polled, with some even getting 15 per cent or less. However, they still get elected because of the first-past-the-post system followed in our country. You cant disqualify candidates merely on the basis of negative votes. If civil society wants to, it can put up its own candidates rather than resorting to these negative measures, he says.        
	Lok Sabha MP Suresh Prabhu is one of the few politicians who advocate the strengthening of Rule 49-O and the introduction of NOTA. Money and muscle power play a big role in Indian politics. Voters should have more say in who they want to elect and also have the right to reject candidates, he says.        
	Proponents of NOTA say that since it is being used in countries like France, Spain, Colombia, and Bangladesh (in its recent general elections), India could give it a try.        
	Our electoral system needs to change and if the government is unwilling, lets hope that the Supreme Court will step in, says Bairwal.        
	All eyes are now on the Supreme Court judgement that could very well change the way India votes in future elections.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | twists and turns in the tale 
                                                                                                                 TWISTS AND TURNS IN THE TALE                                   FIFTH COLUMN - GWYNNE DYER                              
	Young Iranians were back on the streets in Tehran on the night of July 20, after almost a months hiatus. They were there again on the next day, despite the fact that there were many arrests. Their numbers will probably grow this week, for we are now nearing 40 days since the regimes Basij thugs brutally crushed the first round of demonstrations.        
	In Irans Shia Muslim culture, 40 days of mourning for the dead are usually followed by public demonstrations of grief. During the revolution against the Shah in 1978-79, it was 40 days after which the crowds came out on the streets again, to be mowed down once more by the Shah s army. The cycle continued until the army, sick of killing unarmed fellow-countrymen, began to refuse the Shahs orders        
	At least 20 young demonstrators, and possibly many more, were killed by the current regimes paramilitary forces in late June. Will that old cycle of protest, killing, mourning and more protest reappear and lead to the overthrow of the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and the president, Mahmoud Ahmedinejad, whose disputed re-election he so firmly defends? Probably not, but they could still lose.        
	There will be no re-run of 1978 because todays young Iranians are strikingly different from their parents generation 30 years ago. Those crowds had little to lose except their lives, and they were driven by a fatalistic courage that accepted death almost without demur. If you are 15 or 25 or even 35 in Tehran today, you have lots to lose, and you do not want to die.        
	Like some general expecting the next war to be just like the last, I didnt understand this difference at first. But then the terrifying video clip of 26-year-old Neda Agah Soltan, shot down by a Basij sniper and dying in the street on June 21, got several million views inside Iran in 24 hours. After that, you could practically hear millions of young Iranians saying: That could be me. And they didnt want it to be, so the streets emptied.                
	Uncertain future        
	So dont expect escalating street protests to make Khamenei and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad retreat or drive them from power. However, cautious, limited, recurrent protests could be part of a more complex strategy that ultimately accomplishes the same goal, for the ruling elite itself is deeply split. That has not happened before.        
	The three reformers who now lead the opposition to Khamenei and Ahmadinejad are the three people who made most of the day-to-day decisions in Iran from the time of the revolution until only four years ago. Mir Hossein Mousavi, who ran against Ahmadinejad in this years presidential election, was the prime minister of Iran from 1981 to 1989; Ali Akbar Rafsanjani was president from 1989 to 1997; and Mohammad Khatami was president from 1997 to 2005.        
	Rafsanjani, in a sermon at Tehran University last Friday, aligned himself firmly with Mousavi, demanding an end to the media clamp-down and the release of people arrested during the protests. He also referred indirectly to the fact that he actually chairs the committee that elects the supreme leader, and can dismiss him. Khatami went further on July 21, calling for a referendum on the alleged outcome of t he election. After that the protesters re-appeared on the streets.        
	They will not sweep the regime away, and if its henchmen start killing them again, they will prudently withdraw from the streets for a while  but only to devise safer ways of making their resentment felt. Meanwhile, a parallel campaign will be waged within the ranks of the Islamic clergy, mixing fine theological points with the crassest appeals to self-interest. This will not be an epic tale of heroism and martyrdom, but a complicated and mostly obscure contest for the future of the Islamic Republic.

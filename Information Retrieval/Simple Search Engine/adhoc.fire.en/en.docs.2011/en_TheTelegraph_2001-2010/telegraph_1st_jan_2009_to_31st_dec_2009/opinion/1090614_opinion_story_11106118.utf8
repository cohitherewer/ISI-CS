	 Is this how the cookie crumbles? The Bharatiya Janata Party seems to be cracking up after its humiliating defeat, with its senior leaders passing the buck and putting one another down. Take Jaswant Singh, who, despite his victory in Darjeeling, has been hurt by the loss of his position as the leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha. With it has gone the pay and perks of a full-fledged cabinet minister, the well-appointed office and the 16 aides. Common courtesy demanded that he vacate the office upon his election to the Lower House so that the new incumbent, Arun Jaitley, could begin in earnest, but Singh hasnt relented. His anger was compounded when LK Advani appointed Sushma Swaraj as his deputy. And then there was the failure of his son, Manvendra Singh, to retain his Lok Sabha seat. The father-son duo is blaming others for the debacle, but the discerning will know that they had tried to cut down Vasundhara Raje to size. As they say, when you cut the branch on which you are perched, you are bound to fall. In the BJPs case, it is all fall down.                
	 A lunch hosted by the Congress for mediamen in the capital had a near-perfect setting. There was excellent food on the table, prepared by chefs from five-star hotels, and to top it all there was Sonia Gandhi who made it a point to move to where the scribes were at the sit-down meal. The only thing that jarred was the jal tarang, which didnt quite go with the clanging of dishes. Soon, there was another jal tarang of sorts. A brief shower brought temperatures down and made for sweeter melody. Fawning Congressmen, unerringly, attributed the change of weather to Sonia  Sonia aayi, barish laayi.                            
	 A day after the Congress made much ado over electing the first woman Speaker of the Lok Sabha, an SMS did the rounds. It went like this  So what is new about it? In every Indian house, the woman has always been the speaker.                            
	 The new minister for environment and forests, Jairam Ramesh, is said to have banned all photographs, including those of the UPA chairman, Sonia Gandhi, from being printed in advertisements released by the ministry on the occasion of World Environment Day. Only the PMs photos were allowed. In a two-page note, Ramesh even clarified that no public money was to be used for self-promotion. In case anyone got Ramesh wrong, it should be said that the directive was suspected to be a polite way of dissuading DMK ministers from doing the invariable  printing a picture of their beloved Kalaignar, M Karunanidhi.                            
	 Recently, Govinda and his family had gone to the Mumbai international airport in order to board a flight for Hong Kong to attend an award ceremony. Once there, Govinda apparently realized that he had left his passport back at home. The flight got delayed but the actor did not choose to inform the airport authorities that his staff were already rushing from Juhu to the airport to deliver the document. Even as his wife and daughter completed the formalities, Govinda is said to have spent a considerable time inside the loo to avoid the queries at the counter.                             
	 Shakeel Ahmad, former minister of state for home in the last cabinet and AICC chairman, who recently lost the elections from Madhubani in Bihar, may soon earn the Rajya Sabha seat vacated by the Delhi PCC chief, JP Agarwal. The Congress leadership is believed to be under pressure from the minorities who have been arguing that there is no Muslim representation from Delhi in Parliament. After Meira Kumars appointment as Speaker to the Parliament, there is no representation from Bihar in the council of ministers either. Since Bihar is now a serious matter for the Congress, it cannot afford to lose the chance of wooing the minorities from Lalu Prasads fold. As a result, Ahmad, whose name is also being considered for a party post in the forthcoming organizational reshuffle, is likely to make the cut.                         
	 Mani Shankar Aiyar swears by a comment that was once made by an American radio host: A true friend is someone who thinks that you are a good egg even though he knows that you are slightly cracked. In New York to attend a seminar, Aiyar was pleased to note that a couple of hundred of his friends had responded to a distress email, allegedly sent by him from a London hotel, announcing that he had misplaced his wallet, and that he needed an urgent loan. Since the hacked email was signed off with name, Mani, a friend reached with $3,500 at a prominent London hotel where Aiyar usually stays. Others called up offering e-transfer of funds. The Congressman is busy thanking them for showing concern even though he is out of power. In New Delhi, a close associate of Aiyar was heard saying that the outcome at Mayiladuthurai, from where Aiyar lost, would have been different had so much money been generated during the polls.

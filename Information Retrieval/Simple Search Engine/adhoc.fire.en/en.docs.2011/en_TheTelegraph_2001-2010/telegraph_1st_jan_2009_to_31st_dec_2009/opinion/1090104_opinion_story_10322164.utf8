	Nightmare sells                  
	Sir  The detection of Herman Rosenblats story, Angel at the Fence: The True Story of a Love that Survived, as a hoax is deeply disturbing (Holocaust memoir of love exposed as hoax, Dec 30). Unscrupulous survivors are demeaning the painful memories of the Holocaust. Moshe Peers Unforgettable Bergen-Belsen, about his multiple gas-chamber survivals at a place where not a single gas chamber existed, is such an example. Such marketing of global tragedies must stop at once.           
	Yours faithfully,         Pinaki Roy, Balurghat 
        
	Always first          
	Sir  I go to office via the E.M. Bypass every day. On December 29, on my way back from work, I reached the Science City crossing at around 7.15 pm. At this point, the traffic came to a complete halt, and the signal went red for about 15-20 minutes. An ambulance that was stuck in the jam hooted for five minutes, but none of the traffic policemen present paid it any heed. It soon transpired that some VVIP was about to pass that stretch. It took another three or four minutes for the signal to turn green after his convoy had passed. I felt helpless, not being able to do anything for the stranded ambulance.           
	How is it that in India it is more important for VIPs to reach their destinations on time than it is for the ill and the injured to reach the hospital? I hope we start asking this question soon.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Sayantani Hom, Calcutta

                
	Sir  I think the root of many of our problems lies in our VIP culture. So many decades after Independence, we still prefer to divide our countrymen into two groups: VIPs and lesser mortals. But the nation needs everybody, from the minister to the sweeper. The security forces, which are meant to guard the people, end up spending a huge chunk of their resources in protecting a handful of men. If VIPs cannot handle the risks involved in their jobs, they should not enter public life.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Back to the fold          
	Sir  How could Mamata Banerjee let Sudip Bandopadhyay return to the Trinamul Congress (Sidelined Sudip with Mamata, Dec 15)? The latter had been disloyal and joined the Congress just before the last parliamentary elections. His departure had exposed the internal squabbles of the party and thus scuttled the TMCs chances of a win. Banerjee called him a traitor then, but has taken him back gladly. Both leaders have thus indulged in terrible double standards.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Shiv Shanker Almal, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Sudip Bandopadhyay had joined the Congress after being snubbed by Mamata Banerjee in 2004 before the parliamentary elections. He was welcomed into the Congress, and was given a nomination for the polls, which he lost. But he was allowed to contest the elections in 2006 from his preferred seat. In spite of having other eligible candidates, the Congress made him secretary of its West Bengal unit, and nominated him for the post of the chairman of the assemblys public accounts committee. Thus, Bandopadhyay can be said to have shown extreme ingratitude to the Congress by selling false stories of humiliation. He may bag a TMC nomination in the coming polls, but by switching camps frequently, the leader has set a poor example.           
	Yours faithfully,

                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Violent times                  
	Sir  Indiscipline among students has become a major problem in schools and colleges. The editorial, Beyond rules (April 27), proved to be an eye-opener for many students, even for some who had been feeling disgruntled after being prevented from sitting for examinations by college authorities. At the drop of a hat, students create a commotion inside college campuses nowadays, burning effigies and shouting slogans. Such unruly behaviour disturbs those students who come to colleges with the intention to study rather than to put up meaningless shows of protest. These students would be spared the trouble if colleges follow a code of discipline.           
	Students who cook up a storm inside campuses usually have strong connections with party leaders and students committees. They break rules with impunity because they are safe in the knowledge that they will be protected by their leaders. Because such a system prevails in most of our educational institutions, even small problems often escalate into a crisis, and the police have to be called in to intervene. Our education system evidently has several loopholes, which should be taken care of before the disruptions caused by students can be tackled. Strong prohibitive action should be taken against rowdy students so that they behave themselves in future.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The decision of certain colleges to bar students from sitting for their examinations at the last moment on the pretext of inadequate attendance seems to be one of the visible effects of the terrible summer heat. The rising temperature appears to have driven college authorities crazy and goaded them into pointless acts. If they are so firm regarding the attendance of students, why do they act otherwise when it comes to applying the same rule to the teachers and professors who frequently remain absent in classes? If Newtons law that to every action there is an equal and opposite is to be taken as the truth, then students alone cannot be held responsible for missing classes. There must be some lapses on the part of the colleges too that cause the students to bunk classes. It is my observation that students attendance is particularly low in colleges operating under the Calcutta University. No one cares to look at the problem of attendance from the dual perspective of both the college and students, and the latter are blamed easily instead.           
	Lack of quality teachers and adequate infrastructure must be some of the major reasons behind the students loss of interest  after all, no one wants to sit idle in a class for hours. Student politics also has an adverse effect on the education system. Unless education is severed from politics, it cannot be rewarding for the students. College authorities should think up a way of making the existing system of education more systematic and friendlier instead of ruining the careers of students with arbitrary laws.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Shoe-bite          
	Sir  Throwing shoes at veteran politicians to humiliate them has become the latest way of gaining cheap publicity. The prime minister, Manmohan Singh, became the target of this gimmick in Ahmedabad when an engineering student flung his shoes at him to acquire five minutes of fame (Singh in Bushs shoes, April 27). Earlier, in the same month, L.K. Advani had a slipper thrown at him by a party worker. The impulse to insult senior leaders in this way is not only shameful but is also a symptom of the cultural degradation of our times. The trend gained popularity since George W. Bush ducked a pair of shoes thrown by an Iraqi journalist in Baghdad. The contagion then spread to India with Jarnail Singh hurling his shoes at P. Chidambaram to vent his ire over the 1984 anti-Sikh riots. We should give a serious thought to this infectious disease to stem it in time.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Suman Jalal, Calcutta

                
	Sir  This year, we are having too much of shoe-throwing at senior leaders campaigning for the general elections. The incidents are multiplying and people are going cerebral in their analysis, debating questions such as why shoes are thrown at Congress leaders while chappals are hurled at those of the Bharatiya Janata Party. To ensure that justice is done to the people who are splitting their hair thus, it is necessary that we have footwear-throwing competitions. Since a majority of the shoe-launchers are missing their targets, only the finalists of the competition should be authorized to throw the footwear against the offending politician. There can be discussions on the issue of whether or not it is good to ape foreigners and throw boots in protest. Should the demonstration of anger be indigenized too? In India, alternative ways can easily be found. One may, for instance, throw a pumpkin or some vegetable that the target does not like. Rotten eggs and tomatoes might be confiscated by security personnel, but a pumpkin should surely pass the test considering that it is inoffensive and difficult to throw.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  Just beside the road leading to South Point High School, one may find a quaint cane enclosure on the footpath under a gulmohur tree. A few weeks ago, a street dog gave birth to a litter in a garage nearby. She was shooed out of the garage along with her puppies and, thus, the six-week-old pups found themselves on the road. A local resident tried her best to get NGOs find a shelter for the pups, but was met with indifference. At last, she got the cane enclosure made for them. Now they are well looked-after by the people of the neighbourhood, by a schoolgirl whose priority after coming back from school is to feed the puppies, and by the local rickshawwallahs who keep a watchful eye on them. These are ordinary people but their compassion makes them extraordinary.           
	So-called animals-lovers, the crusaders for animal rights who tom-tom their concern for hapless animals, should learn a lesson in selflessness from these people. One does not need funds worth crores of rupees to protect the animals. All that is needed is a caring heart, which, I am sure, most of us do not possess. The pups are safe for the time being. But for how long will they will remain so?           
	Yours faithfully,

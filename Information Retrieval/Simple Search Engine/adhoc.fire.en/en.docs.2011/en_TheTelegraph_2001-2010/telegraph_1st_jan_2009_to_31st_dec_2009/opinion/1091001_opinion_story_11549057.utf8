                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Neglected mentors                  
	Sir  The grouse of the faculty of the Indian Institutes of Technology is primarily on two accounts: first, the revised pay structure of assistant and associate professors as proposed by the human resource development ministry, and second, the regulations guiding the appointment of professors (Pay attention, Sept 23). Any institution that is fully funded by the government has to be regulated by it. No institution, even if it is the best one, can reject the governments rules pertaining to salaries and perks. The HRD ministry, after all, is accountable to the Parliament and to the people of India.           
	Regarding the second issue, the norm is that a person with a PhD, who does not have teaching experience, should not be immediately absorbed into the system. If a person has had two years of teaching experience then he could have a one-year contract and could be consequently absorbed, but a person with no experience should be on contract for three years before being absorbed. Even in universities such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard or Stanford, it may take 10-20 years for a person to become a permanent member of the faculty. Such stipulations have not fostered an ethos of inflexible red tape in those universities. Then why should that be the case in India, as the editorial fears?          
	The HRD minister, Kapil Sibal, has rightly pointed out that tenure is not a matter of pride. Very seldom do we have a minister who knows what he is talking about. The HRD ministry has taken a correct stand with regard to the IITs. The facultys behaviour does not meet the IITs standards. It is surprising that the editorial actually supported the hunger strike by terming it both honourable and reasonable.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  It is a shame on society when teachers go on strike. The professors of the IITs and the Indian Institutes of Management who had gone on a hunger strike are the same ones who have given India the second largest pool of technical manpower in the world. These teachers have made their institutions some of the best in the world, and this is particularly true in the case of the IITs. These are also the teachers from whom the government itself seeks help and advice on technical matters. When the technical expertise of these teachers is indispensable, why should they be treated unjustly with regard to their salaries and promotions? Ideally, the government should accept their recommendations without questions. The pay packages that these teachers would allocate for themselves are sure to be rational as well as competitive.           
	Politicians and bureaucrats deciding the salaries of the IIT and IIM professors is an instance of lesser minds judging what better minds deserve. Teachers, as a class, have always been abused by the government, which continues to utilize their services. Recently, the police caned school teachers in Guwahati when they protested against low pay and difficult working conditions, and demanded provincialization of the 17,000 non-provincialized institutions in the state (Teachers caned at protest-prayer, Sept 21). Last month, the teachers in Mumbai went on strike. Teachers from various institutions have protested about their pay scales over the past few years. But it seems that these protests are falling on deaf ears, as is apparent from the insulting comments made by Kapil Sibal regarding the IIT and IIM teachers going on strike. Sibal had expressed his desire to revamp the education system of India, for which he would need the help and support of the teachers. But Sibal seems to be alienating them instead of working with them as a team.          
	In ancient times, rulers in India would bow down and touch the feet of their teachers and seek their blessings. The very effective system of the gurukul that existed back then would be presided over by the teacher, whose every word was law. But today, not only do we insult our teachers but we have also turned education into a commodity. We need to bring back the system that would help us to respect our teachers, pay them a healthy and sustaining wage, and provide them with sufficient scope to enhance their careers. We need to understand that if our teachers improve, our education system would also improve.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The hunger strike by the IIT professors is quite justified since the revised pay structure announced by the HRD ministry doles out much lower salaries than what these professors deserve. The remuneration for the directors at the IITs, the IIMs, the Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research, the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore and the National Institute of Industrial Engineering has been fixed at a meagre Rs 80,000, which is an insult to this respectable community. Considering their contribution, this amount must be increased. Otherwise, it would discourage these teachers, who mentor capable engineers and scientists for the effective growth of the country.          
	Moreover, the government must understand that salary is the only income for the IIT professors, unlike the IIM professors, who also earn through consulting assignments. Most importantly, it may not be appropriate to compare the worth of the IISc or the IIT professors with that of the IIM professors, as the subjects that the latter teach are qualitatively different from those taught by the former. History stands testimony to the fact that many entrepreneurs have attained success without going to a business school. However, it would be hard to find a scientist or an engineer who did not attend a technical institute. This is why the IIT professors demand for a pay hike is more justified than that of their counterparts in the business schools.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Merry mood
                                                                                                                 Merry mood                                                    
	Ekhon Basanta, Srabastis presentation of a medley of songs, dance and poetry at the Town Hall on February 28, was a tribute to the spirit of spring. Conceived and choreographed by Chaitali Dasgupta, the performance depicted the joyous mood of spring through melody, rhythm and verse. The evening began with Basanti hey bhubano mohini that was presented by Indrayani Mukherjee in Kathak style. Rohini Roychowdhury, a talented singer, grasped the mood of the difficult song she sung with effortless ease, while Purnima Ghosh, a veteran Manipuri dancer, enthralled the audience with her powerful performance. Ranjini Mukherjee delivered a passionate performance, Debasish Roychowdhury sounded melodious and Shounak Chatterjee sang the original classical pieces perfectly.         
	Meanwhile, Rabinandan presented Tagores Kach-o-Debjani at Sisir Mancha on February 19. The event featured Jagannath Basu and Debjani Majumder on recitation. Poly Guha and Pradipta Neogy danced with grace and confidence. The tuneful and perfectly synchronized songs played their part in making the production a success.        
	SHARMILA BASU THAKUR              
	Two for joy        
	Anonya Music presented Rabindra Sangeet Sammelan at Rabindra Sadan on March 13 and 14. On the first evening, every singer sang two songs, and the history of each song was narrated meticulously by some renowned reciters. Girimala De, Anima Chatterjee and Arin Chatterjee were very impressive, while Satabdi Acharya, Nilanjona Ghose Dastidar, Sutapa Banerjee, Madhumita Mukherjee and Koel Adhikari performed to their abilities. Aniruddha Sinha, Anita Mukherjee and Deboshree Biswas deserve special mention: Sinhas voice was clear and expressive, and both Mukherjee and Biswas sang tunefully. Aloke Roychoudhurys performance was a bit too dramatic, and Shreya Guhathakurata failed to satisfy the audiences expectations, although she did better with her second rendition.         
	Biplab Mandal (tabla), Surajit Roy (esraj) and the others who accompanied the singers were quite brilliant. One must say that they did their best to brighten up the proceedings.                    KABERI MITRA SARKAR

Manisha Jain on why the law   needs to be passed                        YOUR PLACE OR MINE?: The proposed law can go a long way in making workplaces safer for women				                                                               
	The Prevention of Sexual Harassment at the Workplace Bill, which was drafted more than three years ago, is yet to see the light of day. Welcomed by women activists, non government organisations (NGOs) and lawyers alike, the Bill is stuck in the law ministry. In fact, it has been sent to the law ministry for the nth time, supposedly for vetting and finishing touches.        
	The Supreme Court had issued guidelines for protecting women from sexual harassment at the workplace in 1997. The proposed law, if implemented, will go a long way in ensuring the security and safety of working women and will facilitate an enabling work environment for them.        
	Yet the government seems to have adopted a lackadaisical attitude towards it. The Bill is languishing in Shastri Bhavan, the building that houses the ministries of women and child development and law, with each ministry trying to pass the buck on to the other when it comes to taking a proactive step to pass the legislation.        
	For instance, Union law minister Veerappa Moily stated that he was yet to take a look at the Bill. He said that since he had not studied it, he could not say when it would be finalised. In any case, he added, we will be just preparing the draft. The Bill will be finalised by the women and child development ministry.        
	But women and child development minister Krishna Tirath has something different to say. She asserts that the Bill is soon going to be finalised and that it is being vetted by the law ministry. In fact, she does not rule out the possibility of it being introduced in the forthcoming Parliament session.        
	Curiously, though, most of the women activists and lawyers this correspondent spoke to have not seen the draft Bill for nearly two years. Moreover, there has been no meeting or any consultation held with the government and NGOs.        
	Legal experts assert that though the Supreme Court guidelines are in place, an actual law to tackle sexual harassment in the workplace is needed to deal with the problem effectively. Indira Jaising, additional solicitor general and head of Lawyers Collective, asserts that there is a real need for legislation as it would ensure a safe and secure environment for working women.        
	The Supreme Court guidelines for the prevention of sexual harassment at the workplace state that every organisation, including colleges and universities, should set up a complaints committee to address charges of sexual harassment, and that it should have a minimum of 50 per cent women members. It also directs that at least one of its members should be from an NGO or a lawyer and that the chairperson should be a woman.        
	Soon after the guidelines were issued, the National Commission for Women spearheaded a campaign to enact a law for the protection of women from sexual harassment in the workplace. After a series of consultations with NGOs, women activists and government officials, a draft Bill was finally put together in 2006, which amalgamated the apex court guidelines with additional clauses that would protect the cause of victims of sexual harassment.              
	For example, the Bill ensures that the burden of proof of innocence lies on the accused and not on the victim. Another empowering clause is that the complainant should not be penalised in any way, nor ostracised or ill-treated by her colleagues just because she had the temerity to complain against the sexual advances of a male colleague.        
	With the Bill hanging in limbo, complaints of harassment are often being dealt with in a cavalier fashion, allege activists. Says Bulbul Das, Delhi High Court lawyer, who is also a member of sexual harassment complaints committees in various organisations and Delhi University colleges, Cases of sexual harassment are not being settled in a fair and just manner. More often than not, victims are terribly afraid of seeking justice against the offender for fear of reprisals in the form of discrimination, blocked promotion, or dismissal.         
	In fact, adds Das, Members of complaints committees often exhibit a bias in favour of the accused and take a lenient view of the offence.        
	Crimes like rape, outraging the modesty of women and so on are specific offences that come under the purview of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The victim has the right to approach the police and get the accused punished. But a woman can also be harassed in subtle, covert ways. For instance, a boss may keep calling his female subordinate into his cabin or may put an arm around her shoulder. While such subtle forms of sexual harassment are not covered by any section of the Code of Criminal Procedure or the IPC, a woman could complain against it under the clauses provided for in the proposed Bill.        
	Some say that the Bill could do more. According to Das, the Delhi University guidelines on sexual harassment have a clause which stipulates that the victim will not be cross-examined during the enquiry proceedings. This is a very supportive and empowering clause which will give women the courage to go up and complain against harassment. For it often happens that a woman, when cross-examined, faces so much mental torment that she relives her earlier experience, says Das.        
	But even in its present form, the law could do wonders for women who become victims of sexual harassment in the workplace. Says Supreme Court lawyer Ruksana Choudhury, Such legislation is really needed as sexual harassment affects a womans employment, her performance at work and her avenues for promotion. The government needs to act fast and pass the law because such cases of sexual harassment in the workplace are on the rise and precious little is being done to check them.

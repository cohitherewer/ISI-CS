The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Art as an extension of activism
                                                                                                                 ART AS AN EXTENSION OF ACTIVISM                              VISUAL ARTS      Soumitra Das                                                
	It is widely known that theatreperson Saoli Mitra has for years been campaigning against SEZs, short for special economic zones. She has written extensively in newspapers against them and has tried to raise public awareness about how SEZs operate outside the purview of a states economic laws with the governments assent, and how these could be camouflaged attempts at land grab. Long before it became fashionable for artists and intellectuals of every political colour to launch movements against corporate exploitation of land and people, Mitra had written essays that sought to expose its alleged iniquity, and she still does it only for her commitment to the cause.        
	Experimenter Gallery, aided and abetted by four Mumbai-based artists, had recently turned its wrath against the wicked SEZs not through your run-of-the-mill exhibition, which generates filthy lucre, but through what the artists would like to call activism, with, needless to add, the gallery footing the bills.         
	The artists were Tushar Joag, Sharmila Samant, Justin Ponmany, Prajakta Potnis and Uday Shanbhag. Joag calls himself a public interventionist artist and has exhibited in various prestigious galleries, including the Saatchi Gallery. The same holds for Samant, who has participated in the Sydney Biennale. They are a couple, by the way. Ponmany is one of the famous Bombay Boys, whose works at one time fetched phenomenal prices. Potnis is a bright young thing who is all set to become brighter. Both husband and wife are admittedly not activists, but for them it is a learning experience, for they are not producing a saleable commodity. So they joined on Joags invitation. Their quarrel, therefore, does not seem to be with capitalists as such as, but with the source of capital. Galleries generate kosher capital but the other varieties are untouchable. Most discriminating of them.        
	The exhibition titled SEZ Who? (June 21-July 25) curated by Tushar Joag, began with five different stations inside the gallery. One of them was a mound of salt  with its connotations of Satyagraha  produced in Raigarh and Gorai Uttan, where the SEZs will come up. As the days turned to weeks, this mound gradually moved to several points in the gallery, symbolic of the peoples protest against SEZs.        
	Glass vials, neatly tagged, two stoves with kadahis from which water from the two SEZs has evaporated to leave behind salt grains, a pile of gunny sacks originally meant for food grain, and a ladder were all parts of the paraphernalia of protest. These were like props that were shifted from point to point, for various effects. The sacks, for instance, were stacked one on top of the other, installation fashion. If one wished, one could fill the empty glass vials with the salt and carry back a piece of protest. Short films on international protests against SEZs were screened for a week from July 14. Special forms were handed out to viewers for the lucky draw on July 29 for one of the art works that the artists had created collectively.        
	This was the artists strategy that was meant to subvert the practice of turning art into a commodity. What they created was an extension of activism. It turned out to be a series of telephone sets with recorded sounds of slogans being raised against SEZs that could be heard on following the instructions (pressing the right buttons) intoned mechanically by a disembodied voice  the same way that a phone banking system operates. This happened on the last day of the exhibition.        
	In the intervening period, there was much activity falling somewhere between art and activism. As the grain sacks were piled up and emptied every day, rats  symbols of those who suck dry people dependent on an agrarian economy  in various sizes, shapes and garbs appeared on the walls of the gallery (picture). The rats were arranged and rearranged day to day. A giant scarecrow, symbol of evil, began to take shape as the days passed, bit by bit, fragment by fragment, like a giant jigsaw puzzle. Both the rats and the scarecrow were sent via email by the artists. The soothing glow of spotlights helped sex up these exhibits.        
	To top it all, the artist/activists visited the villages where the SEZs were to be built to express solidarity with the victims, and there was a live interaction between the participants and a handful of visitors/enthusiasts who were present on the occasion. So everybody went home happy in the belief that they had refused to make capital out of art.

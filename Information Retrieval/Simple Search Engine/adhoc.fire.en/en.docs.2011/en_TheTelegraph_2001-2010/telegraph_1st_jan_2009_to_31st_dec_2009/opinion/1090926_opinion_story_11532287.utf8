The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A festival of tune and rhythm
                                                                                                                 A FESTIVAL OF TUNE AND RHYTHM                              Sharmila Basu Thakur      Dance                                                
	Indo Occidental Symbiosis and Academy of Indian Culture presented Shanti  an event organized in memory of Ustad Ali Akbar Khan  at Kalamandir from September 7 to 12. Eminent artists from the field of classical dance and music participated in this programme and paid their tribute to the legendary maestro. Calcutta witnessed a series of fine performances after a long time, and the organizers of Shanti must be thanked for putting up a high quality event.        
	The six-day long programme began with a striking Kuchipudi performance by Raja and Radha Reddy. These two gifted dancers (picture) commenced their recital with ganapativandana that was based on raga Hamsadhwani. The presentation was marked by precision, clarity, speed and dedication, and its most memorable element was the Krishna-Arjuna episode. Raja and Radha Reddys dance has a magical quality about it, and every pose that they struck reminded one of the sculptures engraved on temple walls. Their flawless chemistry made the duet numbers look like solo presentations at times. Their daughter, Yamini Reddy, performed parampara  the most significant purpose of Indian classical dance. The programme came to an end with tarangam  a dance number performed on a brass plate  that was presented by the three dancers. Kaushalya Reddy on the nattubhangam was splendid. Yamini Krishnamurty, a name synonymous with Bharatnatyam, enthralled the audience with her passion for rhythm and speed. She gave a special performance that comprised the elements of jatiswaram, varnam, kirtanam and the famous Tulsidas bhajan, Ramachandra Kripalu. Her students also participated in two group choreographies. Sonal Mansingh has always been known for her cerebral approach and her innovative interpretations. She began her recital with sritakamala kucha mandala, which was followed by a narration of rasas or different moods in the pala style. Madhavi Mudgal, a brilliant Odissi dancer and a senior disciple of Kelucharan Mahapatra, presented the traditional elements of Odissi with rare perfection.         
	Rashid Khan, Ajoy Chakrabarty, Shivkumar Sharma, Hariprasad Chaurasia and Jayanta Bose were some of the classical artists who featured in this programme.

	Welling, telling, gelling                     
	The spies of Warsaw (Phoenix, Rs 295) by Alan Furst is set in bleak late-Thirties Poland with Edvard Uhl as the indomitable secret agent. Arriving in Warsaw under the shadow of World War II, Uhl gets drawn into the eye of a storm. In his plebeian avatar, he is an ordinary German householder with a wife and kids, living a more-than-decent life in Breslau. Uhl is unremarkable by every account: a spy with a bulbous nose, a bushy moustache, thin legs and potbelly. Once in Warsaw, he quickly sheds his middle-aged respectability, reveals a taste for masochism, keeps a haughty mistress who goes by the name of Countess Sczelenska, and strikes clandestine deals with dangerous French and German spies. Furst is in his element in this superbly written drama that unfurls a trail of intrigue and betrayal.                        
	A Grasshoppers Pilgrimage (Rupa, Rs 150) by Manjushree Abhinav begins with a tall list of thank-yous that includes family members, the pet dog, the Muse and even the tree that gave its life to make the pages of this book. Such piety coexists with whacky humour, chick-lit oomph and beady-eyed dreams throughout the book. Although many of the characters are familiar, even clichd (hippies, sadhus, shady tourists), and the prose at the best of times uneven, one still feels like giving this novel the benefit of doubt. Despite the fictional-spiritual cocktail, the tale has an amusing and eccentric flavour.                        
	Easy Kill (Hodder, Rs 350) by Lin Anderson is a Rhona MacLeod mystery with a good old serial killer on the loose. The plot is as thickly atmospheric as it gets, starting with the murderer soliciting a young woman, finishing her off, and then burying her in a cemetery called Necropolis. As MacLeod, chief forensic for the Strathclyde Force, takes over the investigation, she discovers not one, but, as usual, two bodies. Typically, a third girl goes missing, and MacLeod makes it her mission to save her. Of course, the bad are punished and the good rewarded. A traditional no-surprises thriller, this is an entertaining read, though entirely forgettable.                        
	The Seven Secrets of Influence: Portable Power for the 21st Century (Penguin, Rs 399) by Elaina Zuker is one of those new-age treatises that teach you the unteachable: in this case, learning how to influence people. Zuker reveals an inordinate number of secrets that apparently help successful professionals capitalize on their power to influence. Most of these secrets, it turns out, can be inferred by common sense, as has been done by many ordinary mortals in their everyday lives. But portentous names and swanky jargon can put a sheen even on the most familiar ideas. The Selling/Strategist Style, for instance, asks you to use Welling (gaining rapport), Telling (articulate presentation of ideas), and Gelling (a common vision or shared purpose) to influence potential clients. One wonders how the sales-people could survive so long without the benefit of such pearls of wisdom.                                  
	The Mahabharata Re-imagined (Rupa, Rs 95) by Trisha Das is A collection of scenes from the Epic, as the subtitle claims. The characters chosen for this bold retelling are  surprise, surprise!  Draupadi, Karna, Bhisma, Kunti, and perhaps less predictably, Duryodhana and Gandhari. Wavering between translation and summary, the prose is somewhat stilted, and the recounting does not exactly bristle with originality. But such is the power of great stories that told a thousand times, they do not lose their novelty. It would be prudent to warn readers that this is not a modern recounting of certain key episodes from the ancient epic. Rather, the scenes are set in their historical context, lavishly peppered with ornate words which often read like inspired gibberish.

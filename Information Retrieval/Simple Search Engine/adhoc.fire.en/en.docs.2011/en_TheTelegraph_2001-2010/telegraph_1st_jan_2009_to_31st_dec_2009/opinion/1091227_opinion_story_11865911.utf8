	Three judges (including myself)  gathered together in May this year at a posh Edwardian hotel on Bloomsbury Street, London, to argue over a book prize  would emerge at different times to stroll about the area. All of us had glanced at our neighbour, the Socialist Bookshop, but Jane Smiley, the tallest (in every sense) among us, had noticed an air of quiet celebration in its window-displays. The effects of the crash were still reverberating in the Western world (though India had recovered more quickly than expected); and a new complex of emotions seemed to have surfaced in the bourgeois of almost every political persuasion  a mix of panic, rage, a strange, sweet Schadenfreude, a nostalgia for erstwhile simplicity, a sudden premonition of the inevitable.        
	In Calcutta, I knew, however, socialism had never gone away. Hemmed in on every side by an onward-marching, post-liberalization capitalism, compromised by its own exhaustion and self-doubt, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) was, nevertheless, still presiding over the state of West Bengal after more than thirty years  none of my fellow judges had any idea of this singular trajectory. It had, in fact, been trying madly to attract investment. And the bludgeoning way it went about doing this  snatching land from the peasantry it had once redistributed it to, giving it to Ratan Tata for his small car factory  has at long last alienated its unusually long-suffering, tolerant electorate. Just when people in the West have begun to luxuriantly fiddle with the notion of bringing back some form of socialism to their economies and lives (see the latest issue of the journal, n+1), the people of West Bengal seem finally to have made their mind up (on the evidence of several by-elections in the past few months) that theyve had enough of socialism.              
	This is not the only way in which Bengal, and Calcutta, has made it a point to be out of tune with the rest of the world. While the big cities in India have been increasingly inlaid with the textures of globalization, Calcutta resists, even while being transformed by them inescapably. New shopping malls appear near the wetlands every few months; but, while Bombay and Delhi have several flights to London every day, Calcutta has  since about eight months now  not one direct flight out to Heathrow. And thats why, of late, I have been passing through Dubai.        
	In Nehruvian India, with its envious foreign-exchange regulations, its life of parsimony and high thinking, Dubai was famous for its airport and duty-free shopping. J.G. Ballard, reflecting on Heathrow, said that surely cities in the future would be suburbs of airports, rather than airports inhabiting the suburbs of cities. Dubai, at least from the aerial vantage-point of a cabin window, appears to have been planned on this principle well before Ballard arrived at his formulation. Among Western travellers, there is a noticeable intake of breath, an air of arrested wonder, as the plane descends into the city and then the airport itself. (Compare this with the view, as the plane hovers over Calcutta, of the shattered bucolic carpet of Bengal, with its green and golden patchwork, until the colourless, frayed fabric of the city becomes increasingly visible.)         
	Two months ago, before the so-called (and oft-denied) crash in Dubais economy, I saw, rushing to catch a connecting flight, Western tourists gaping at, even photographing, the immense granite walls in the airport, with perfectly measured sheets of water cascading down them. I was reminded briefly of the Bengali proverb clearly descended from colonial modernity: Bangal ke high court dekhano  To show a Bangal the High Court. Bangal, in Bengali (as we know), means, strictly speaking, East Bengali. But we also know that regions within nations have country-specific, often prejudicial, connotations; a Northern Briton is a more edgy and impoverished national variant than the refined, well-to-do, possibly sly product of the South; while in the US, the Southerner, like the Bangal, denotes a yokel, or the opposite of a sophisticate. Bengals East, for historical reasons, was seen as agrarian, feudal and less developed in ideas and institutions, notwithstanding the fact that, ironically, a great deal of Bengali high modernism was the work of East Bengali migrants. (Londons Eastern boroughs are, in a slightly different but contiguous way, supposed to be, historically, poor, primordial and lively, and possess today, as it happens  an unforeseen modulation on that history  a substantial population of Bangals.)        
	To take a Bangal to see the High Court, then, presumably, was to confront the uncomprehending oaf with modernity and power. While watching Western tourists at Dubai airport, I reflected on how many Europeans remain Bangals at heart. Development generates its own simple but profound enchantment. I recalled my first visit to Toronto, when my wife and I were driven by a Canadian friend whom I knew from Oxford (a graduate in law) to admire an unremarkable-looking building, the Sears Tower, then the highest free-standing structure in the world. Here, invoked momentarily (and innocently) by my friend John, was the Bangal component of wonder in the beating heart of European modernity: an important  and occasionally intimidating  constituent. I say intimidating because thats what it can be, as we might remember still from the US-Iraq war, when the rhetoric of shock and awe was rehearsed constantly by the American generals, by Rumsfeld and that great Bangal, Bush, as if war were essentially a display of technology (which is probably what it is) rather than the consequence of conflict or ideology. It may have been in recognition of this that Gandhi decided to perform a subversive riff on playing the Bangal, to cultivate a different form of philistinism, when, in his autobiography, he admitted to being unmoved by the Eiffel Tower: So long as we are children we are attracted by toys.              
	As for myself (and this too may be an oafish anomaly, as I am of Bangal extraction; but it may also contain a residue of the Bangals long involvement with the shape of modernism), I go looking for old buildings and doors when I find myself in new cities. In Fribourg in Switzerland, I found versions of the specked mosaic floors we have in middle-class apartments in India; in the Palais de Bozar in Brussels there were red stone floors identical to those in my uncles (now destroyed) house in South Calcutta; and, almost everywhere in Europe, there are balconies. Again, in Europe, apartment buildings do not necessarily have the negative and minatory implications they do in Britain, but can, as in India, be a place where a genteel and yet observable (through those balconies and windows) existence unfolds. However, in Cheltenham, noticing balconies, I couldnt decide whether some memory of light among retired colonials had led to these (for England) unique additions, or whether the balconies themselves produced a special effect of light in Cheltenham. In turn, Im surprised that more Western people who visit India  or Dubai, for that matter  dont chance upon buildings, cornices, and windows that stir some buried, unlooked-for correspondence that tells them more about themselves and their histories than their guide books (which are about famous monuments) can. The South African novelist, Dan Jacobson, once told me that this was a habit of looking that migrants have: as we stopped to stare at an astonishing old bench on Hampstead Heath, he observed resignedly: The locals dont see this. A few days ago, on my way back to India, my flight via Dubai was cancelled and rerouted because of a technical glitch. I cant think  with that crash having happened before I would have changed planes again  that it will be any different from how I now imagine it.

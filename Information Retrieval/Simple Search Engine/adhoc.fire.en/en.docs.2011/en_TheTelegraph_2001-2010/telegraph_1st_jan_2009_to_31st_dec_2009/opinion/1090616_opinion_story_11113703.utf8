                                                                                                                 OMINOUS SIGNALS                                                    
	The fear of a violent death always hangs over the Imphal valley, thanks to an unending insurgency. But the cold-blooded killing of four migrant workers from West Bengal surpasses most previous acts of cruelty. These victims had nothing to do with the battle between insurgents and the security forces or the police. They had been hired to work for a construction contractor. Their desperate poverty back home must have forced them to risk their lives by choosing to work in Manipur. Their killings prove once again how insecure life is in the state both for the local people and for outsiders. And they show how incapable the state administration is of preventing such killings. This is not the first time that innocent labourers from other states have been killed in Manipur. Since February, at least 20 migrant workers have fallen to assassins bullets. Obviously, these people were too poor for their killings to prompt either a public outcry or an administrative shake-up. But these are ominous signals for all sections of the people. If such acts of terror go unchallenged and unpunished, they will make life more insecure for all in Manipur.         
	It is still unclear if any militant outfit was behind the latest killings. However, ethnic militancies in several states of the Northeast have shown signs of degenerating into xenophobic violence. It has happened in Assam, where migrant workers from Bihar have been killed from time to time. It is difficult to see what militants gain by killing poor, innocent people. Their attacks on the police and the security forces are aimed at scoring propaganda points. Killing innocent civilians can only be their strategy to spread terror. Any government that submits to this strategy is guilty of abdicating its constitutional obligations. It is absurd that the administration should sit back and expect the militancy to run out of steam. The insurgents have challenged the authority of the State and all its institutions. The State has no option but to strike back and defeat the rebels.

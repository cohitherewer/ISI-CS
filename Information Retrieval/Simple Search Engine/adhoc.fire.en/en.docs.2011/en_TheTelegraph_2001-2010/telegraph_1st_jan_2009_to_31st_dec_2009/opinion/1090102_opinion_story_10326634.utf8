	Will there be war? This question is on everyones mind and there is no answer. There cannot be an easy answer because, either way, India is caught in a frightful position. Retaliating against the attack on Mumbai, and therefore on India, would mean a meaningless war that would only help in providing fodder to reactionary forces and in creating more and more young, gullible, poor terrorists, all of whom would invade the body politik of the entire region as well as of the Western world. To remain quiet and use Western powers to negotiate would achieve nothing at all. It would enhance a tenuous, uneasy status quo that would keep India on a high alert and increase the chances of another assault to ensure that all hell breaks loose. That is the objective of these small terror outfits, which feel secure in the fact that they have the tacit support of the intelligence services and of the hawkish, nationalist army of an insecure State.        
	India has no option but to think out of the box, to throw a couple of googlies at its neighbours and at the world, particularly the United States of America. The US has, over the decades, played treacherous games in this region and beyond, and has helped create a monster that has overwhelmed us all. It now seems incapable of asserting its power to control this beast. Its administration is seen to be sending hollow signals to Pakistan, a nation that the Americans have built, armed and is thus responsible for. Traditionally, India has kept the US at a distance. That was the foreign policy stance of Congress governments of the past. Pakistan became the USs favourite State in the subcontinent. Today, America cannot control it.        
	Looking at the overall situation, from the Middle East through to South Asia and onto the Far East, it can be said that America has managed to destroy and disable cultures, which could have taken them head on. They used the poverty of civilizations, whose weaknesses colonial powers had exploited earlier.                 
	Heavy price        
	The US has begun to pay the price of its ruthless, criminal and illegal manipulation. The economic downturn and a dramatic decline in employment will debilitate America and can trigger political dissension and social anarchy, leaving the space open for mercenary groups hell-bent on inciting a different kind of anger against the State from within.        
	For us, this is the time to think and act out of the box. The old formulae have failed miserably because they were developed and introduced by condescending Western powers, which had no understanding of the ethos and culture in this part of the world. The problem is that they think they know best, and since they are economically powerful, they are ready to crack the whip. But today, they are finally vulnerable and we must start thinking for ourselves and stop acting for their sake.        
	Throw the Kashmir problem into the ring. Force the issue and ask for the Line of Control to be pronounced as the international border. Do it while the sabre-rattling is happening on both sides and before beating a retreat. Announce full autonomy for Jammu and Kashmir based on Sheikh Abdullahs plan, and never fall into the trap of splitting the state into three sections, something that has the approval of the Bharatiya Janata Party. Pull the rug out from under the feet of reactionary detractors who are aided by powers that created the monster in the first place.         
	Then, give similar autonomy to all Indian states and move towards building a true federal polity, an economically and culturally strong India. This will protect the true idea of India. We failed to nurture and develop a healthy, decentralized federal State to strengthen our multicultural realities and have fallen into this horrible quagmire.

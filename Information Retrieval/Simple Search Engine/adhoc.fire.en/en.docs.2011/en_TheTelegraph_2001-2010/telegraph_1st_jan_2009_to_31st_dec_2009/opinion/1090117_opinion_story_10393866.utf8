                                                                                                               New wonders                                    
	The exhibition, Pata  paintings of Bengal (Chitrakoot Art Gallery, Jan 5-15), was intriguing, although mostly for the wrong reasons. Despite the fact that the exhibition claimed to have Santhal Pat, Vishnupur Pat, Kalighat-type Pat and others on its list of displays, it did not care to provide captions to help the viewers identify the various types of pats or to differentiate between them. It is also strange that none of the artists whose works were on show was named. And most bafflingly, some of the pat-paintings were amateurish watercolours, which, by no stretch of imagination, could be said to be painted in the pat style.         
	There were lengthy scrolls depicting stories like the Kamale-Kamini or Sita-haran. The rectangular paintings featured Durga and her family, Shiv with his junkies, grotesque Kalis or Radha-Krishna. Some of the paintings, like that of a raja receiving alms from Annapurna or Kartik on his peacock, were in the distinctive Kalighat style. But were they imitations painted by contemporary artists or originals? If the latter is true, then the artists of antiquity must have had ageless dyes at their disposal, considering the fresh look the paintings have retained till now. A painting of Jagannath, with torn edges and cracked paint, looked old but one could not be sure whether that effect was contrived.

	An evening of Tagores music and dance was organized by the Tagoreans (London) at the G.D. Birla Sabhagar on January 3 to celebrate the 80th birth anniversary of Maya Sen as well as to felicitate her. From Sriniketan to Dartington, a composite programme of music and dance, was the name of the presentation, and it was supervised by Maya Sen. The evening proved to be an enjoyable affair, beginning with a chorus-song by the members of the group. The group also presented an enchanting choreographed performance of Aj dhaner khete roudra chhayay, in an attempt to portray Tagores vision and philosophy. Manasi Barua, Gairika Gupta, Geetali Bose and the others sang tunefully, while Alinda Barua, Anindita Sen, Purbita Mukherjee, Swapnakalpa Dasgupta and her troupe delivered an equally spirited performance. Subrata Mukherjee (keyboard), Partha Mukherjee (tabla) and Abhra Chatterjee (esraj) ably assisted the artists. The second half of the programme featured solo recitals by renowned artists such as Swagatalakshmi Dasgupta, Pramita Mullick and Jayati Ghosh.

	There has been another eruption of cheer all over India. The latest figure of growth in the gross domestic product is 7.9 per cent. That would hardly be news in a dynamic country like India, which is used to scoring success after success. But a little problem had cropped up recently. After clocking nine per cent and more for three successive quarters in 2007, growth had slipped. By the beginning of this year, it had come down to 5.8 per cent. Cheerleaders still boasted that it was the second highest growth rate in the world. They did their best not to show it, but they were worried. What if it went down further? What if it became 10th or 20th highest growth rate in the world? That was no way for a country destined to be a superpower to behave. Now they can sleep well. For India is close to eight per cent again; it cannot be long before it resumes the Chidambaram growth rate.        
	But statisticians have a favourite trick to spoil the fun of simple cheerleaders: the base effect. Is it responsible for the spectacular perking up of the growth rate? A year before the two quarters which registered the embarrassing growth of 5.8 per cent, they showed a growth of 9.3 and 8.6 per cent. With such high growth in the base, the growth rate was bound to slump. Growth had come down to 7.7 per cent in the third quarter of 2008; so the base effect has pushed up growth somewhat. And it will do so even more in the next two quarters, whose base grew at only 5.8 per cent. Cheerleaders would be quite safe if they bet on growth exceeding eight per cent, perhaps even nine per cent, in the next two quarters. After that they had better go to sleep for a while, for the base effect will be reversed, and growth will start coming down again.        
	While the Central Statistical Office cannot and should not be accused of errors of commission, it has omitted certain information in its press release, namely the growth of gross domestic expenditure. Till the middle of 2008, it used to exceed the growth of the GDP; since then it has fallen short. In the second quarter of 2009, it was only 6.7 per cent. The difference between GDP and GDE is the deficit in the balance of payments. International prices have fallen, while domestic prices have not. So people have started importing the goods that they earlier used to buy in the country. Because import prices are so much lower than domestic prices, the shift in expenditure has not blown up the payments deficit. But the impact on domestic production has been considerable. It would be wrong to say that statistics lie; they just do not tell the whole truth.

                                                                                                                 RIGHT STANCE                                                    
	It is always possible to distinguish the right to protest, or express ones feelings, from the right to disrupt the lives of other people. So, the Supreme Courts refusal, recently, to prevent some political parties in Tamil Nadu from going on a general strike makes perfect democratic sense. It is in no way inconsistent with the courts earlier, and often reiterated, stance against bandhs coming in the way of the citizens right to move about freely and go to work (their constitutional right to life and liberty). Yet, it is possible that both the media and elements within the Indian polity might misinterpret, or even wilfully misuse, the courts refusal as an endorsement of bandhs. In fact, it was in the context of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam-led alliance calling for what was virtually a bandh in Tamil Nadu, towards the end of 2007, that the Supreme Court had deemed bandhs illegal. And before this, the high courts of Kerala, Calcutta and Guwahati have all, in different contexts, ruled that bandhs are unconstitutional, making the use of direct or indirect force upon individuals, or preventing them from travelling and from going to work, tantamount to the violation of rights.        
	Even in the contexts of all these judgments, the apex courts latest stance cannot be regarded as a turnaround. Most of these rulings had made two points firmly and clearly. First, it is important to distinguish between strikes and bandhs. The former is part of a democracys legitimate right to protest, while the latter uses coercion (always founded upon the abuse of power, and therefore often violently disruptive) to make people accept the terms of somebody elses protest and bring every aspect of civic life to a standstill. Political parties in Tamil Nadu, and more legendarily in West Bengal, have always thrived on deliberately fudging this distinction, and doing this in the name of the people. So the undermining of democracy is put forward as a celebration of it. Second, the judiciary has always placed the individual above the party. What coercive bandhs violate are the rights of the individual, and there is ample evidence all over India that ordinary men, women and children deeply resent disruptions to their normal and working lives brought about by a certain brand of politics. In a civilized and modern democracy, upholding the right to express oneself freely can never be made to appear as the legitimizing of anarchy.

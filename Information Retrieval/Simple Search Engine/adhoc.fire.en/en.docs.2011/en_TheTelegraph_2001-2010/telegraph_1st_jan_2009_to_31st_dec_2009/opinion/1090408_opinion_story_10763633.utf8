	Images play an important role in the conduct of human relations and in domestic and foreign policy, and their role has grown with the mushrooming of television channels and organs of the print medium in nearly all parts of the world. It is said that one picture is worth a thousand words: scenes of Abu Ghraib and water-boarding shocked the world, and cartoons in Denmark depicting the holy prophet and one in the New York Post on the killing of a chimpanzee, alluding to Barack Obama and the stimulus legislation, have stoked racial and religious tensions. The Indian media projected images of success after Slumdog Millionaire won the Oscar with headlines like Slumgod and India Breaks Sound Barriers; they made a prestige issue out of a handful of Gandhijis possessions, and play a pivotal role in correcting abuses of authority, miscarriages of justice, and environmental neglect.         
	The media can be a potent political instrument, as during the 1980s and 1990s in Europe and in the collapse of communism when TV coverage became an actor in accelerating the pace of change. The appearance of Pakistani spokespersons in growing numbers in the international media following the lawyers revolt against Pervez Musharraf has greatly strengthened the self-confidence of civil society in that country which in turn has resulted in the government reinstating the former chief justice and revoking the ban on the Sharif brothers from contesting elections. When the genie of public emotion backed by a supportive media escapes from the bottle, it is impossible to suppress.              
	In India, the medias role as the essential fourth estate has expanded over the years, both in terms of power and coverage, aided by new technology and the communications revolution. The result is that a sentence from any section of the media has the potential to reach millions; it can correct a wrong, create a celebrity, and plant a seed of understanding. On the negative side, the media have, equally, the capacity for harm, generating misconceptions and inflaming passions.         
	The reading and viewing audience would like to conclude, and so of course would the media, that the primary role of the media is to be a communicator and an independent and authoritative conveyer of views and opinions. The media, however, face varied challenges, not least regarding their commercial imperatives. They are preparing to adapt to the even more interrelated world of the future. The distinction between local and foreign news has almost disappeared as the gap is bridged by modern technology. The terrorist attacks on Mumbai, the Taliban onslaught in Afghanistan and in Pakistan, the attack on Sri Lankan cricketers in Lahore and the mutiny of paramilitary troops in Bangladesh are therefore of a piece in the global context of the war on terror.         
	In the West, it is commonplace for political leaders to use the print media to write columns to convey their thoughts directly to the public. Barack Obama made effective use of the internet and the BlackBerry during his campaign, and top politicians welcome the opportunity of interviews and press conferences where they can elucidate their policies. The more intimately they can address the audience, the better they like it. In India, our political leaders are too reticent, and leave articulation to assorted lieutenants, most of whom are unable to speak authentically or coherently. Therefore, the political messages directed at the public, even during an election campaign, are muddled and unconvincing. The result is that the media, rather than the peoples elected representatives, lead public opinion.        
	During the attacks on Mumbai in November last year, TV channels sent images on a 24x7 basis that represented a highly courageous effort on the part of outside broadcasters. But instead of drawing praise, they came under attack from the government and other quarters for allegedly providing information on counter-terrorism operations to the terrorists through their operators.         
	In addition, by their stridency after the Mumbai attacks, media images contributed towards shattering the remaining vestiges of trust between the governments of India and Pakistan, and the peace process between India and Pakistan came to a halt, though it has not yet officially been abandoned. The media debate between India and Pakistan was acrimonious, without identifying any point of convergence where the two countries could cooperate in fighting the war against terrorism. The impulse to blame the neighbouring country at the first sign of trouble is a natural one in the sub-continent, and given the deep distrust that exists, it is understandable. But irrespective of the short-term gains of such righteous indignation, it is not a constructive way to deal with deep tensions.         
	By way of contrast, we can recall the images sent by the media on both sides of the border on the occasion of the bomb blasts on the Samjhauta Express linking Delhi and Lahore. The bombings on February 18, 2007 in two carriages filled with passengers occurred as the train neared Panipat. Sixty-eight people were killed and dozens were injured. Of the fatalities, most were Pakistanis, but the victims included some Indian civilians and military personnel guarding the train. The dominant editorial comment on both sides of the border was on the need for the continuation of the peace process, expressed in a cartoon depicting Musharraf and Manmohan Singh standing next to the burnt-out bogies, with the caption conveying that the track itself was not damaged: the unanimous opinion was that both governments should stay the course and not concede ground to terrorists.              
	After 26/11, the reaction was very different. The Indian media castigated their Pakistani counterparts for sharing the Islamabad establishments culture of duplicity and denial, and were accused in turn by the Pakistanis of warmongering and jingoism. But the mutual hostility has now given way as certain organs in Pakistan such as Geo TV and Dawn TV News earned the Indian medias grudging respect, firstly by exposing that Mohammed Ajmal Kasab is indeed a Pakistani, and later by revealing Pakistans lax security with images of the Lahore terrorists who casually made their escape from an allegedly top security area. The Indian media now note that Pakistan has gone further than ever before down the road of admitting responsibility for terrorism outside its borders.        
	The medias role, like the events they depict, cannot always be assessed in black and white. Responding becomes difficult for them in any crisis when they have to draw a fine line between national interest and the freedom of expression. They have to avoid any impression that they are embedded with the establishment, with which, however, they have necessarily to interact. They may, and undoubtedly do, yield to inconsistencies and mood swings, but in the end they help to define a situation. They need to be conscious of their social responsibility because their freedom and the diversity of their coverage provide them with great influence over both informed and misguided opinion.         
	The attempts after 26/11 by the authorities to impose regulation or self-regulation on the media were ill-advised follies. The medias role must not be interfered with, since there are far greater risks to the nation in curbing their freedom, as Indira Gandhi learned to her cost during the Emergency. In our subcontinent, where democratic institutions are feeble, a free press is the peoples last safeguard against the tyranny of the individual or the State. If the price of freedom is eternal vigilance, the price of democracy is free media, and we have to cherish that, warts and all.

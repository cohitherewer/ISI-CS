The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | why add insult to injury?
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        WHY ADD INSULT TO INJURY?                                  Malvika Singh                              
	It was only last Tuesday that I had written about the exemplary role of Governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi, and a week later, we have the unsavoury truth about Governor Narain Dutt Tiwari. Here is a politician known over the decades for his penchant for stepping beyond the bounds of dignified personal conduct. He is also known to be an individual who has held high office, and has never been made accountable for his unacceptable behaviour either by the governments he has served or by the Congress party, of which he has been a stalwart member.        
	Now that the lid has been lifted, much could tumble out of this sordid garbage bin. Till now, men and women with such skeletons in the cupboard have been protected by small-minded political operators in Delhi who got their wheeling and dealing endorsed and delivered by important personages sitting in important offices and making policies. The manipulators always threatened these old partymen with exposure  worn-out, fading tricks of the trade. Politics and governance merged with corruption and became the virus that crippled a nation which could have already been an international power to reckon with. Instead, our leaders have condoned wrongs in a bid to keep the status quo, and to maintain peace and their own comfortable cushions.        
	Whenever anyone from that privileged club has operated against the citizens by thwarting, consciously, the laws of the land and has been caught in the act and exposed in public, the other members of that club have closed ranks and protected the perpetrator of the crime. Today, the protective pillars of this edifice are getting wobbly, the veneer has begun to peel off, and the inmates have read the writing on the wall. They have accelerated the pace of filling their coffers before they are unceremoniously dropped, if only to make way for a new generation. One hopes that the political modus operandi will be dropped as well, sooner rather than later.                
	Radical action        
	I would like to put a question to the prime minister and the Congress president, both of whom have an impeccable record of probity, honesty and good practice  why is the selection of the post of governor so insulting to the people of India? Why must governors be selected for all the wrong reasons  for having been either sycophants without a mind of their own or for being men and women who can be manipulated for favours by party seniors, general secretaries and ministers? Why not identify men and women who have excelled in different fields, who have recognition and acceptance in the larger sphere, and appoint them to these positions that were once meant to be exalted and have now been reduced to sinecures? Is India bereft of good, honest, clean, intelligent people, or are those who recommend and decide completely isolated from the real and energetic India that continues to produce many bright minds? Why is it so important that governors, with the exception of Gopal Krishna Gandhi, Nikhil Kumar and J.J. Singh, should have at least one foot in the grave, be senile, frothing at the mouth or a long-retired person looking for a roof, car, flag, siren and fawning helpers?        
	It is most irksome, tiresome and humiliating to have such a personality at the helm of celebrated institutions. It is a national insult. It needs to be corrected immediately for the sake of the future generations, who are being assaulted with all that is unacceptable in civil society. We are fortunate to have a prime minister and a ruling coalition that has within its fold some extremely good and competent people. Therefore, it is imperative to take radical action now, not later. The faultline must be plugged, repaired and sanitized for the sake of India. A cleansing at many levels needs to be launched simultaneously and on a war footing.We want our leaders to lead.

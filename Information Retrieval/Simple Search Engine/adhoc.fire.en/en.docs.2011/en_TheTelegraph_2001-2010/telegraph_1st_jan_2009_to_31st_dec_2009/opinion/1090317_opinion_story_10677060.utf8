The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | licence to run amok
                                                                                                                 LICENCE TO RUN AMOK                                  MALA FIDE - MALVIKA SINGH                              
	As the election countdown begins, the decibel level on television channels has progressively risen to a virtual shriek that has ceased to abate. Naked opportunism, with not even a thin veil of modesty, walks the political ramp, while bids for the most lucrative models are being sought with big bucks. Sordid truths seem to also be the sub-plot of the larger charade being played out on the Indian stage. Greedy characters in search of a pliable leader. In all of this, India continues to be betrayed. The Congress defeats the Congress. The Bharatiya Janata Party is starting to do the same to itself. Regional parties are jockeying for their place in the sun, trying to capitalize on local issues without a clear agenda that will help them deliver the basic goods and services, which are sorely missing from our lives that are held to ransom by limited minds and selfish politics.        
	In the Congress, most veteran leaders are actively working against the Youth Congress, trying desperately to delay the passing of the baton. The images of clarity and honesty of purpose that are showing through in the emerging new structure have sent shivers down the spines of those guilty of having destroyed the integrity of the party and its democratic framework. Their modus operandi has been one where intrigue, back-stabbing and lies have undermined everything that needed to be upheld to ensure good governance and an effective transition. The same veterans insult the integrity and offices of both the president of the party and the prime minister by dignifying bad practice and corruption.        
	Who is leading the Congress into the elections? Who is the Barack Obama or the Gordon Brown or the Angela Merkel or the Advani of the party? Surely, the Congress needs to have an individual leading it, and not a collective of divisive men and women pulling in many directions, diluting whatever strengths there are in the machine.                 
	Conspiracy theory        
	One-third of the support will get wiped out in this seeming chaos triggered by personal ambitions. The fragments need to be reined in forcibly and with single-minded determination. Even the Left politburos have an individual who leads the pack! The veterans of the Congress know that if either the PM or Sonia Gandhi pulls rank and puts them in their place with no questions asked, their lucrative days of wheeling, dealing and spreading false information against each other in order to divide and rule will be over. Therefore, they will prevent this from happening at all costs.        
	Someone needs to stage a coup and restore dignity and integrity within the party, and cease listening to all the failed veterans, incapable of winning an election, who spout political bile and conspire against the few committed members of the tribe. These realities are in the public domain and discredit the party. Democratic functioning does not mean that all ought to be allowed to run amok. Internal party democracy should ensure access to information, which should facilitate keeping the old-time operators at bay, much like Indira Gandhi did in her heyday, till 1974.         
	The number game, the bizarre combinations of probable partners-in-crime, the complete lack of real political agenda, the uncaring attitude towards Indians, are all ingredients of an anarchic tragedy, symbols of which manifest themselves in our everyday lives  on the streets, at homes, in the dirty politics, and in the breakdown of civil society. At times such as this, opportunity should become the unwavering mantra, and opportunism should be discarded and buried.        
	Components of the third front have ceaselessly opposed all actions of the ruling dispensation but have not ruled in recent times. Instead of continuous disruption, they need to show us if they can rule.

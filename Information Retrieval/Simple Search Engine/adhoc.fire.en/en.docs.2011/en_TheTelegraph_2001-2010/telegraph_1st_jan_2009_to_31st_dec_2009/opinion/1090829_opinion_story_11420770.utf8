	Odissi Dancers Forum of Kolkata presented Shraddhanjali, an Odissi dance festival, at Gyan Manch on August 16. Dedicated to Kelucharan Mahapatra and Sanjukta Panigrahi, the programme featured solo performances by Nabakishore Mishra and Bichitrananda Swain from Bhubaneswar, as well as by Rina Jana and Debamitra Sengupta from Calcutta. The group presentations were by the students of senior artists of Calcutta. Unfortunately, most of the group presentations lacked imagination, and were thus a disappointment.        
	Satabdi Mullicks performance set the mood for the evening. This was followed by a group composition choreographed by Dipanwita Roy. Waves, a choreography based on Carnatic music, was a let-down, but Rina Jana (picture) delivered a spectacular performance. A gifted performer, Janas neat presentation of pallavi was based on raga Mukhari. However, she could have chosen a more innovative costume to look slimmer. Meghnad Badh, performed and choreographed by Debamitra Sengupta, was another good effort. Kaushik Sens recitation in this piece created the desired dramatic effect. The most remarkable performance came from Bichitrananda Swain and Nabakishore Mishra. Kaibartya Katha, a layered, complex composition by Mishra, impressed with its authenticity and clever execution.

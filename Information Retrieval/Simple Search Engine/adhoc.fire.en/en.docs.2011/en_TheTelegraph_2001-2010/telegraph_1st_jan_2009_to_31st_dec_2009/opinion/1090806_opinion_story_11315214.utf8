The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Prissy, dangerous, yet never quite there
                                                                                                                 PRISSY, DANGEROUS, YET NEVER QUITE THERE                                                                  
	Many of us will remember the advertisement of the Steel Authority of India that showed a diaper-clad baby waddling towards the camera. The diaper was secured with a huge steel safety pin, which justified the catchline, There is a little bit of SAIL in everybodys life. Taking the cue from the ad, one might suggest that safety pins are as ubiquitous in our lives as steel is. They may be cleverly concealed in the folds of a sari or in the inside-flap of a pillow cover, but they are there nevertheless  the light militia of a secret world invisibly performing its onerous task of keeping clothes in place, bringing order out of chaos.         
	The safety pin has an interesting history. It was discovered in 1849 by an American named Walter Hunt. But Hunts prized invention, for which he earned a princely $400, was actually a reinvention, for the safety pin has been in use in other forms for thousands of years before Hunt patented it. Prehistoric men have been known to use needles with ornamental heads to fasten their clothes. Greek and Roman women had a fascination for safety pins, which they called the fibulae. One recalls Oedipus at the awful moment of recognition, stabbing his eyes with the brooch that had fastened the gown of the dead Jocasta. As the truth stands exposed, so does Jocastas body. Although Jocasta, like her husband-son, had sinned unknowingly, she cannot, obviously, escape the miasma of evil that has engulfed Thebes. Her corpse is stripped of the dignity due to the dead by being disrobed in public. Oedipus humiliation is also extreme, but while he is exalted in his guilt, Jocasta is condemned unequivocally. In the theatre conducted by the President of the Immortals, the woman, it seems, always pays.        
	If objects had genders, then the safety pin has an unmistakable feminine quality about it. It is there and not there. It can be a prissy ornament or a dangerous weapon. (I know of girls who carry safety pins in their handbags to be used against potential molesters lurking in public vehicles.) It can lie quite innocuously on the cushion but you have to sit on it to realize its might. In its capacity to hold things together, it is closely related to the needle, which stitches and so joins edges. The needle, of course, is a peculiarly feminine instrument, associated with the image of the woman darning away, repairing holes, or designing fables on cloth with it as a man uses his pen on paper.         
	But the needle that, like a magic wand, creates beautiful patterns out of air, as it were, also draws blood. I am reminded of the wicked fairy in the Briar Rose fairytale who curses the princess by saying that on reaching adolescence, she would prick her finger on a spindle and die. As the good, white girl, Briar Rose, of course, survives the ordeal. The jab merely causes her to fall asleep, to be woken up by another, less threatening, prick  that of the handsome prince. But what happened to the wicked fairy, who was depicted as a hag in black clothes in the Ladybird book I had? She had been provoked into putting the curse on the princess because she had felt excluded when the king, Briar Roses father, had forgotten to invite her to his daughters grand birthday bash. The woman who started being left out must have felt overlooked again in the general gaiety of the marriage party at the end. Only this time, with her powers gone to waste, her isolation must have been complete. So does she sulk in the corner during the nuptials? Or does she smirk in the secret knowledge of the darkness  an inseparable part of her being  that has been injected into the fair princess with the pin-prick?         
	As the preceding ramblings prove, the safety pin, among its other utilities, also has the capability to start off a train of thought. All said and done, I like the safety pin best when it is used as a tickler. I so miss those long, lazy afternoons with Grandmother making rhythmic patterns on my itchy back with the blunt end of her safety pin until her hand slumped on my nape, signalling the time to sleep.

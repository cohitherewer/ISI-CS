The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | time to keep the faith
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        TIME TO KEEP THE FAITH                                  MALVIKA SINGH                              
	One of the most embarrassing moments of recent months was the excruciatingly shameful display of politicians assaulting each other in the Rajya Sabha. It was even more horrible to watch the unfortunate incident in the company of friends in Bhutan, a kingdom unused to such appalling behaviour, where the king and his extended family, the elected representatives, the civil service and the police conduct themselves with great dignity and treat their people with much respect. Thereafter, to hear the silly apologies from grown men  leaders who profess to deliver the goods to the exploited and forgotten, and to give them the respect and dignity they deserve  was enough to make one squirm in horror.        
	What will be the future of our democracy if our representatives are unable to conduct themselves within appropriate norms and manners? Civilized societies deserve respect, and the blatant misconduct our legislators and members of parliament indulge in, from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, is unwarranted and should be punished with a ruthless Constitutional whip. Our founding fathers could never have imagined that in a span of 60 years, some players in the Houses of Parliament, could shame our great civilization. These men and women are damaging the intellectual fibre and the intrinsic morality of a great people, and reducing us to becoming the laughing stock of the subcontinent and of the world.        
	On the one hand, we want recognition from the advanced nations, feel the need to be partners on the high-table of international policy-making, do not want to carry a third world label. Yet, our parliamentarians consistently mock the instruments of clean, democratic functioning, misuse their privileges, abuse the mechanisms that protect the freedoms in the Constitution by their immature responses to issues that do not suit their limited, short-term agendas.                
	New hope        
	It is due to these individuals as well as some others with criminal records that India, despite economic growth and achievement, stands insulted on the world stage. The time has come to reassess the privileges that are offered to those elected to govern us. The Opposition, having spent the better part of the parliamentary sessions forcing adjournments, only exposes the lacunae in the mind and soul, commitment and nationalism.        
	If the Constitution needs to be amended, so be it. A strict code of conduct must be written out clearly and in all our languages. That code must be enforced with no caveats whatsoever. The wishy-washy reprimands, followed by the equally unimpressive I am sorry that has saved these men and women from being publicly ticked off for unlawful acts, is unacceptable to honest citizens who have done nothing to deserve this crass infliction of impropriety. Their actions, within the portals of Parliament and the many Vidhan Sabhas, are against the laws of this land. They must be dealt with like all other Indians who break the law. Physical assault is a criminal act, so why should politicians be absolved after a token sorry? The time is right to reassess the perks that these men and women have lived off for years. Free housing, cars, subsidized electricity and more are not necessary for those who opt to serve India. Their service must be selfless. They have exploited the patience of their constituents, and need to urgently show their paces by bringing change now.         
	The only silver lining is that some leaders rise above this disorder and, fortunately, happen to be at the helm. Manmohan Singh and his cabinet conduct themselves with dignity and restraint, refusing to fall to any bait. The Congress president, Sonia Gandhi, the young leaders in Parliament, from the Congress, the Biju Janata Dal, and some other parties, make us proud. They have together kept the faith.

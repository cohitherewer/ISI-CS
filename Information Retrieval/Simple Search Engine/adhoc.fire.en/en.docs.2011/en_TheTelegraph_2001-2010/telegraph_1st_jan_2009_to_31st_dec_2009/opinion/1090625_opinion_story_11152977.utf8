                                                                                                                 THE OCHRE ROBE                                                    
	The fundamental dilemma of the Bharatiya Janata Party was manifest when the partys national executive met after the partys defeat in the general elections. The basic issue was, however, somewhat obfuscated by the mudslinging that went on during the meeting and prior to it. It is evident that the BJP, especially some of its prominent members, has not been able to come to terms with the setback it suffered in the elections. The accusations and the angry letters that flew around were symptoms of frustrated ambitions and the refusal to accept that defeat or victory in a general election is always a collective responsibility. The BJP leaders who went straight away into the Jaccuse mode displayed a certain amount of political immaturity. Many of them also failed to understand, despite being in the BJP for sometime, that in an organization like the BJP those who have come through the party ranks  upwards from the local shakha or the student wing  will always have priority over those who have made lateral entries into the party hierarchy from the civil service or the media.        
	The mud-raking is only on the surface that indicates the turbulence of the undertow. The party is caught in the tension between going back to its true and original colours and refashioning itself as a more inclusive party with the cover of moderate Hindutva. This tension can also be seen as an aspect of another tension: one between the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and the BJP. It is easy to understand that the BJP finds it difficult, if not impossible, to obliterate its own original birthmarks. This was evident from the opening comments of the party president, Rajnath Singh, who harped on the hardy perennials of the BJP credo: Hindutva, Ram Mandir, uniform civil code and so on. But there is a strong opinion within the BJP that believes that Hindutva is no longer a winning proposition for a party that aspires to speak for India and to rule India. L.K. Advani, undoubtedly the most important leader of the BJP today, is an advocate of this position. He has been quick to realize that the allegiance to Hindutva and to the RSS can only be a token one if the BJP is to fulfil its electoral and political ambitions. It remains to be seen if Mr Advani and his acolytes will be able to carry the party with them. For the nonce, however, the BJP has to reconcile itself to being the responsible Opposition.

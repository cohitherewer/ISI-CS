The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Take over the reins
                                                                                                                 TAKE OVER THE REINS                                  Malvika Singh                                    
	The Bharatiya Janata Party has put the building of the Ram temple on its agenda, has said that it will ensure Indias freedom from the threat of terrorism, thus hoping to win over the minority fringe of radical Hindus rather than the larger mass of Indians most of whom also appear to be Hindus! If the party has some supernatural, foolproof strategy and solution to put an end to terror attacks, it should make a bid to rule the planet! The time is appropriate to ask the BJP leaders and spokespeople how they intend to do this, what their means are towards this end. We are not clear about the promises other smaller, regional parties have put on the table but the truth is evident  the people of India have had enough of being fooled and discarded. We will get to know what is in store for the future once the results are announced on May 16.                
	Old baggage        
	The Congress, the primary, albeit diluted, national entity, had a god-given opportunity to be different from the many other dispensations, and to resurrect itself from the amorality it had descended into with the many dalals operating the many political deals rather than ensuring complete victory in the states and the delivery of clean, competent governance. In recent months, there has been a possibility of change in the grand old party, with sane and intelligent assertions emanating from Youth Congress policies. But unfortunately, with every two steps forward there are those five steps backward  steps taken by old and pass leaders carrying the heavy, redundant baggage that they are unable to dispose, and a sense of importance that they are not willing to give up. Passing the baton and then setting out to find a productive new profession are not something they are capable of doing. They have no specialization, no professional training in any discipline, which is why their intellectual level is so abysmal.        
	Omar Abdullah was right when he said that he had more executive experience than a Barack Obama and that a lack of experience was of no consequence when fighting a battle to lead a country, and that Rahul Gandhi was ready in this regard. This must have sent shivers down the spines of all those Congressmen who are incapable of anything but manipulation. Imagine a new India ruled by Omar Abdullah in Jammu and Kashmir, Sachin Pilot in Rajasthan, Jyotiraditya Scindia in Madhya Pradesh, and other elected young men and women from all parties with a Rahul Gandhi at the helm of a coalition at the Centre. It would let loose a vitality that we in India have not experienced for many decades. We need to be energized with fresh thinking and action. Tired, wrinkled, old faces and immovable bodies have brought us down the slope. We need strong-limbed politicians to climb the pinnacle of power and take over the reins.

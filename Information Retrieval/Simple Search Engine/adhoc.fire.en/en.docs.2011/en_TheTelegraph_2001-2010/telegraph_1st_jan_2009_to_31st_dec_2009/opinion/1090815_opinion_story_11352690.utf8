	For a handful of grains                  
	Sir  It is difficult to comprehend why pulses are selling for over Rs 100 per kg in the market. Even sugar is being sold at the princely sum of Rs 35 a kg. Surely, the current period of drought cannot be the reason why prices of stocks already in the shops have been be hiked? These were produced during the last season and hoarded in storehouses. Confiscating these stocks can solve the problem of inflation. If the authorities take such an action, then that could be a strong deterrent against the hoarding of essential food commodities in future.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

                
	Judgment day          
	Sir  The law minister, M. Veerappa Moily, and the Chief Justice of India, K.G. Balakrishnan, are keen on safeguarding the interests of the judges (Judges assets bill stalled, Aug 3). They are concerned about the public demanding access to the details of assets held by judges. Clause VI of the judges (declaration of assets and liabilities) bill of 2009 puts the information provided by judges about their assets and liabilities outside the purview of the Right to Information Act, thereby keeping these details away from the public. The CJI has given consent to this proposal saying that it will prevent harassment of judges by citizens disgruntled with the judiciary.           
	Even if the conduct of only a tiny section of the judiciary may be questionable, isnt an institution that is supposed to be absolutely incorruptible answerable to the public? The CJI should not worry about the accusations that people may make against judges, but should rather concentrate on restoring their faith in the judiciary. This can only be done by introducing transparency and accountability in the system. The law minister must reintroduce the bill after deleting Clause VI.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  It is only fair that all officials who have pledged to serve the public, from judges, parliamentarians and legislators to members of zilla parishads and panchayats, provide details of movable and immovable property possessed by them as well as by their family members. Their appointment should be terminated if they fail to comply.           
	These details must be updated annually and made public. A vigilance commissioner should be appointed to monitor these disclosures. If public servants wish to procure further assets, they must declare the source of their funding.           
	Yours faithfully,      
M.M. Kale, Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh

                          
	Deadly sting          
	Sir  Every year, residents of Calcutta and its adjoining areas suffer from malaria, dengue and chikungunya. But the Calcutta Municipal Corporation and the local bodies in the suburban areas hardly take specific actions to prevent these diseases. All that one notices are a few precautionary advertisements in newspapers and on billboards. The same information, without updates, is repeated year after year. Yet practical measures like spraying insecticides are not adequately taken during the monsoons, when vector-borne diseases are most common.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Abdul Hakim Khan, Calcutta

                          
	Parting shot          
	Sir  As Arabinda Ray points out, the British were more successful in keeping India together than many post-Independence leaders (An august month for thought, Aug 13). Indian politicians have mastered the art of divide and rule. It may be best if India follows the European Union model by transforming all states into independent nations, and then putting them under a loose conglomeration called the Indian Union.          
	Yours faithfully,

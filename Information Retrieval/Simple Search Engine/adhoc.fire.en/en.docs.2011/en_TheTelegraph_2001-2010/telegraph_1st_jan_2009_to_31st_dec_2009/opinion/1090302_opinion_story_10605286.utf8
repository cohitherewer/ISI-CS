The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Slump dismissed
                                                                                                                 SLUMP DISMISSED                                                    
	Both the finance secretary and the minister of state for finance have said that the precipitate fall in the growth of national income was anticipated. But it is impossible to trace a single previous statement, not just from them but also from their more seasoned seniors  P. Chidambaram, Manmohan Singh or Pranab Mukherjee  to the effect that growth in gross domestic product would fall. On the contrary, Mr Chidambaram lost credibility as he kept predicting 8 per cent growth in the face of worsening economic conditions, and had to be shunted off to the more arduous, but lower-profile, home ministry. Although his indisposition was a serious downturn for the prime minister, it saved him from making embarrassingly optimistic statements. Mr Mukherjee, who presented the interim budget in the PMs absence, was characteristically discreet. He made no unbelievable claims about future growth; he confined himself to boasting about the latest growth figure he had, which happened to be 7.1 per cent. It is just as well he spoke a fortnight before Fridays figures came out.        
	What is surprising is that Suresh Tendulkar, the new chief of the prime ministers economic council, has joined the bandwagon of cheerleaders. In his earlier, unofficial incarnation, he was known to be sober and cautious. But everyone who joins the government seems to catch the patriotic fever. Mr Tendulkar pins his faith on the huge amounts of uncovered expenditure the government has been announcing from time to time. A slump is believed to be due to a fall in total expenditure; so in Mr Tendulkars thinking, more government expenditure must revive the economy. As he sees it, surging waves of cash will soon start beating on the dancing bears of India; it is only a matter of months before they will be drowned and bulls take over. This patriotic optimism is misplaced for three reasons. First, expenditure stimulates production only while it lasts; when the splurge ceases, the economy will resume its downward course. Second, the commodity pattern of expenditure seldom matches that of surplus capacity. Insofar as money is spent on sectors not in recession, some inflation is likely. Finally, the global depression is expected to deepen further and last for some time; and the idea, so popular once amongst officials, that India was immune to global woes, is thoroughly discredited by now.         
	Thus, unfailing optimism is a sure way for an official spokesman to lose credibility; one must wonder why they all still insist on gratuitously proclaiming their unshakeable belief in coming good times. One reason may be that they feel they must stand together; the government must speak with one voice. But it need not speak at all. So the other reason must apply  namely, that the spokesmen think they can lift entrepreneurial sentiment by sounding upbeat. But they might as well save their breath, for the reality of the failing economy will inevitably drown their voices.

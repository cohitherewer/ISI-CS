	Natures fury                  
	Sir  Calcutta had a taste of natures power on May 25 when Cyclone Aila swept over the city (Whoosh! Calcutta May 25 2009: Hiss of Aila at 120 kmph, May 26). The windspeed of up to 120 kilometres per hour of Aila has resulted in a huge loss of life and damage to property. The uprooting of innumerable trees has caused significant depletion in the citys already small green canopy. Since the fallen trees have caused roadblocks in different parts of the city, panic-stricken people will now probably ask for all tall trees to be cut down lest they cause similar trouble if another storm of Ailas magnitude hits Calcutta in the future.           
	Those indifferent to environmental concerns and those with vested interests would find it an ideal opportunity to fell trees or to severely trim their branches so as to make them skeletons of their former selves. It is important to keep in mind the fact that last Mondays troubles were caused not by trees but by the cyclonic storm. Storms with such windspeed as Ailas are rare. If one discounts the Great Calcutta Cyclone of 1864 that caused 60,000 deaths, dangerous cyclones usually graze past the city without causing much harm. Concerned government departments and NGOs should ensure that trees are not felled either out of fear or with the intention of capitalizing on the cyclone.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Amit Banerjee, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The regional meteorological office at Alipore had forecast on May 23 that the monsoon this year was due in 48 hours. But it predicted the approach of Aila only a few hours before the cyclone actually hit the state. The predictions notwithstanding, the state government hardly took any precautionary measure in the coastal districts to arrest the effects of the cyclone. The irrigation department failed to monitor the dikes even after coming to know that the monsoon was in the air. The ministry of relief did not have a proper mechanism in place to disburse aid to the victims once the cyclone had hit West Bengal. Even the local administrative bodies at the block level made no real effort to evacuate people by sounding the alert at the right moment. When Aila was lashing West Bengal, the chief minister and his colleagues probably were too busy tracing the causes of their poll-defeat to take emergency steps.           
	Aila has exposed the negligence of the state government. There seems to be no exchange of information between the government and the Alipore meteorological office. The government does not have a well-equipped disaster-management team. The army is usually summoned in cases of disaster but it knows little about the demography of the flooded region. As a result, it cannot conduct rescue operations swiftly. The government also does not bother to consider the preview reports by local administrative bodies in the calamity-prone areas. It has no plan in place to replace the mud huts in these regions with pucca houses. Hundreds of people are killed when the walls and roofs of mud houses collapse. Besides, there are no relief camps in the flood-prone areas for the victims to take shelter. Last, but not least, the government has made no effort to launch agricultural insurance policies for farmers.           
	It is shameful that the government still sticks to primitive methods to control nature. Now that the cyclone has exhausted itself, the Left Front chairman, Biman Bose, has asked his comrades to raise funds for the victims. Had he asked his colleagues to form disaster-management teams instead, his effort would have been worthwhile.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  After the devastation it wrought across West Bengal, Cyclone Aila has become a household name. But how are cyclones named? Very few people seem to know the method followed in labelling cyclones. The naming of cyclones started in the early 20th century when an Australian forecaster named cyclones after politicians he disliked. During World War II, American meteorologists named them after their wives and girlfriends. Now names of cyclones are contributed by member nations of the World Meteorological Organization. The names include those of men, women and flowers. Cyclones are ranked according to their windspeed. A Category-1 storm has the lowest and a Category-5 cyclone the highest windspeed.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Subhayu Saha, Khagra, Murshidabad                    
	Sir  While Aila battered the city for six hours, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation hardly extended any help to the people. Even after repeatedly calling the CMC control room, Calcuttans received no feedback on the storm. Mamata Banerjee reported the situation to the Centre and sought help from the army and the Border Security Force. The immediate steps taken by Banerjee predict that we might get a better government if she comes to power.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Suman Jalal, Calcutta

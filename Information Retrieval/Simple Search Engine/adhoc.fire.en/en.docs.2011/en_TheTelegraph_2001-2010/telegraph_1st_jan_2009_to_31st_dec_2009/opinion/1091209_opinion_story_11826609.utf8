	Second fiddle                  
	Sir  The decision of the Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations to drop the second language paper from the must-pass list is not only detrimental to Indias rich linguistic diversity but it also goes against the tenets of school education (ICSE reform for exam edge, Dec 2). The decision clearly indicates the boards apathy towards regional languages and their importance. The move also makes it evident that the board is not concerned about developing students aptitude in their mother tongue.          
	Schools are not merely centres of learning. The aim of school education is far greater than preparing a child for competitive examinations. The argument that students find the second language an extra burden shows that these languages have been relegated to a secondary position. Is the study and development of regional languages the sole responsibility of the state boards only?          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The second language, usually a regional language, should not be accorded an inferior status in school curricula as it serves an important purpose that English cannot really serve. Regional languages are the medium through which children understand and appreciate the history and culture of the society they live in. They help students reflect on their place in society, and serve as a link between them and their roots. English, in spite of its many advantages, is still a foreign language, and linguists will perhaps agree when I say that not everything can be translated.          
	However, not for once am I underestimating the importance of learning English. I have had the privilege of being educated by teachers who instilled in me a love for the language. But I never neglected Bengali, which happened to be my second language. As a teacher, I believe that the objective of education is not to prepare students for competitive exams, but to prepare them for life. Teachers have been given the responsibility of building Indias future generations  individuals who would be proud of leading the country and have respect for its culture and tradition. The treatment meted out to the second language shows that we have allowed ourselves to be colonized again  this time through formal education.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Old wounds          
	Sir  December 3 marks the anniversary of the worst industrial disaster in the world. Commemorating the Bhopal gas tragedy has now become an annual ritual (Bhopal tragedy scientist stricken, Dec 3). The truth is that political leaders, artists, industrialists, NGOs or columnists have little time to fight for the victims of the tragedy that has claimed over 20,000 lives and affected lakhs of people over the years. Is this because the victims, unlike those at the Taj during 26/11, are the poor and the underprivileged? Why is it that politicians feel ashamed of the 1984 Sikh riots but not of the catastrophe in Bhopal?          
	It is a pity that successive governments have failed to extradite Warren Anderson, the then chairman of the Union Carbide Corporation, due to pressure from the United States of America. The painful tales of sufferings of the victims are not only shocking but they also bear evidence of the fact that the victims feel let down by their own leaders. Hopefully, the United Progressive Alliance government will take steps to bring the former chairman of Union Carbide to India, and ensure that the survivors are fully compensated.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad

                
	Sir  In a statement issued to mark 25 years of the disaster, the prime minister has promised to continue supporting the victims of the Bhopal gas tragedy. It is strange that the prime minister chose to refer to several issues related to the mishap only now. What was he doing in office for the past six years? Perhaps he was more bothered about sealing the nuclear deal with the US.          
	The head of the US-based Union Carbide is evading extradition to India for trial. Manmohan Singh has met American presidents several times during his tenure. But not once have we heard of Singh attempting to bring up this issue with the US administration. Instead, he has been content to bow to the USs pressure tactics. Manmohan Singh as well as the other leaders in the UPA should be ashamed of themselves for making rhetorical promises and opening up old wounds in the process.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  The Union environment and forests minister, Jairam Ramesh, must be congratulated for framing new rules to clean the air after 15 long years (Overnight, air is more poisonous, Nov 19). These rules impose uniform air quality standards on residential and industrial areas. One hopes that once these new rules are in place, citizens would be able to breathe cleaner air, thereby reducing the chances of contracting lung diseases. However, the track record of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government, and Mamata Banerjees indifferent attitude towards the environment, may stall this important process.          
	Yours faithfully,

                                                                                                                 DIFFICULT TIME                                                    
	Keeping an institution untouched by politics in India is a touch-and-go business. In that the Election Commission has set a remarkable example in recent times. So the chief election commissioners recommendation to the president of India to remove his colleague, the election commissioner, Navin Chawla, has had a doubly disturbing impact. It is not necessary to debate the constitutional and legal propriety of the CECs move in order to question his timing. With the Lok Sabha elections barely a couple of months away, the CEC, N. Gopalaswami, must have known that his recommendation would raise a storm of legal and constitutional wrangling, and bring out ugly political tensions. One of his responsibilities is to keep the EC free of political controversy. Mr Chawlas case is specifically political. Mr Gopalaswami has made his recommendation on the basis of his own observations: his complaint is of bias. Apparently, Mr Chawla favours the Congress. The complaint has a long history, one in which the Bharatiya Janata Party is directly involved. The BJP has been complaining about Mr Chawla since 2006, first to the then president, then to the Supreme Court, and lastly, in early 2008, to the CEC. The political flavour of the controversy cannot be wished away. It is the last thing to be desired so close to the elections.        
	It is puzzling that Mr Gopalaswami should drop his bombshell not only just before the elections but also just before he himself is due to retire, at which Mr Chawla would normally take over as CEC. The unusual nature and route of the complaint have the experts at one anothers throats. Readings of the Constitution and directions by the Supreme Court suggest a check-and-balance system that neutralizes political pressure and bias both from the CEC and from the executive, without whose advice the president cannot act. Many feel that the CEC has departed from established practice. The commissioners being co-equal, Mr Gopalaswami is also being accused of undemocratic behaviour  he apparently left his other colleague out of the decision-making. The CECs defenders claim that he must keep the EC working, and a commissioner with bias is not conducive to that. But by his timing, the CEC has put the EC under tremendous political pressure from the Opposition. It now has a new rod to beat the institution with should it choose to do so, whichever way the government decides.

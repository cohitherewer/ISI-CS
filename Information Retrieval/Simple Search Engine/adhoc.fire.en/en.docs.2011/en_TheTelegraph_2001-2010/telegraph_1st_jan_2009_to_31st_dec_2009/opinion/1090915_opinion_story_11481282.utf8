	Almost a year after the collapse of the Lehman Brothers on September 15 last year  Lehmans filing for bankruptcy triggered the virtual collapse of the global financial system  finance ministers and heads of central banks met in London last week to discuss the next steps in tackling the financial crisis and the associated global economic slowdown. The meeting, which was a precursor to the meeting of the heads of government to be held later this month in Pittsburgh, was to a large extent devoted to what can be done to prevent another global crisis from occurring.         
	The focus on prevention of another crisis is in itself a hopeful sign because it is an assertion that the worst is behind us, that the world economy is slowly climbing out of the deep recession witnessed during the course of the last year. Some macroeconomic data support this optimism. For instance, the International Monetary Fund has, in its latest World Economic Outlook update, revised upwards its forecast of economic growth during 2009-10. With the exception of the United Kingdom economy, most major countries are expected to participate in the recovery during the course of the current year itself.        
	Of course, all prudent economists are well aware that the expected economic recovery is going to be a long-drawn-out process  no one expects the global economy to grow rapidly at anything like four or five per cent even by the end of next year. All countries which were particularly hard-hit by the recession have very large levels of excess capacities in their economies with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development estimates ranging from around five per cent of potential gross domestic product in the United States of America and the Eurozone, and even higher in Japan. Any large shock can completely reverse the process of recovery. Also, the slow rate of recovery almost certainly implies that further jumps in unemployment cannot be ruled out.              
	A crucial issue in any discussion of the steps which need to be taken by groups such as the G20 is agreement about the role of the large stimulus packages undertaken by countries such as the US, China and Germany. Although there is some amount of controversy about whether such massive injection of public money was socially desirable  one school of thought being that the capitalist system needed to be punished in order to ensure that the same mistakes are not repeated in the future  there is no doubt that the recession would have been for a significantly longer duration if governments had refrained from these steps.        
	For exactly the same reason, it is important that governments continue to extend support to their beleaguered economies. Any precipitous decline would have quite disastrous consequences for the global economy. Fortunately, this is one of the issues on which there seems to have been some agreement amongst the G20 finance ministers. In a press briefing after the meeting, the UK chancellor announced that the group felt that the stimulatory policies needed to be persevered with until recovery was secured.        
	However, the sheer size of the government stimulus packages implies that they cannot be sustained for too long. Public spending has been financed through deficit financing, resulting is astronomical levels of public debt in some countries. Whether governments can finance such high levels of debt remains a cause for concern. One reason for hope is that the earlier the world economy recovers, the earlier will governments register increases in tax revenues earned on a larger income base. Nevertheless, sooner or later, governments will have to slash the stimulus packages, and it is a pity that the exit strategies were not discussed in detail.         
	Since it was the collapse of the global financial system which caused the worldwide meltdown, it is only appropriate that the G20 leaders spent much of their time discussing measures required to strengthen the financial system. Although there was some initial disagreement between different groups, the G20 finally agreed on the broad contours of a tough regulatory framework for financial institutions. The proposed framework has three main features, the most important of which is the stipulation that banks must raise more capital. This was prompted by the recognition that banks are grossly undercapitalized. The European banks in particular also face pressure to issue more shares. Currently, these banks have often met a substantial part of their existing regulatory requirements on capital buffers by issuing complicated hybrid securities. These are more like debt than equity, and are likely to suffer huge losses in the event of any systemic risk. So they offer banks very poor insurance against large losses.        
	Another component of the new regime would require banks to retain some portion of the loans they repackage and sell as asset-backed securities. This will restrain the amount of borrowing that banks undertake outside the formal banking regime, the motivation behind such restrictions being the need to reduce the overall level of risk in the financial system.              
	Quite predictably, bankers and diehard believers in the capitalist system have objected to the new regulatory regime. They argue that these restrictions will limit the level of credit that banks can advance, this in turn actually harming the prospects of fast recovery. At a more philosophical level, the banking system is viewed almost as a fulcrum of the modern capitalist system, so any effort to constrain the normal functioning of the banking system as an attack on capitalism itself.        
	However, there is no evidence  either theoretical or empirical  that an unregulated market mechanism is an ideal system. Markets work best when there is some restriction on how individual players operate in the economy. Of course, the quantum of appropriate restrictions must depend on the situation prevailing on the ground.         
	For instance, the current international scenario allows banks, particularly the large ones whose possible failure can bring down the entire financial system, to obtain cash at ridiculously low interest rates. They can then engage in risky arbitrage activities, knowing that the government will bail them out if things go wrong. So, if there are no bad shocks, then they can reap huge profits. In the event of unfavourable shocks, they can look up to the government to bail them out of trouble. The effective absence of all downside risk must surely encourage unduly large risk-taking behaviour.         
	 The absence of controls is a sure prescription for disaster. There may be scope for discussion of whether the new regulatory regime is too strict. But no one can deny the sheer necessity of putting in place a carefully constructed set of regulations governing the operation of the global financial system.

                                                                                                                 RACE RAGE                                                    
	Australia is known in India as the country of kangaroos and cricketers, and among global investors as an exporter of raw materials. Its two principal exports are coal and iron ore. But the third most important export is education. Foreign students paid AU$14 billion in fees and another AU$13 billion for goods and services in 2008. Among them, Indian students were important; 18 per cent of foreign students came from India, next only to the 24 per cent who came from China. The number of Indian students was 11,000 in 2002; by 2008 it had grown to 96,000. Australia has 14 offices all over India giving information about its educational facilities and generally selling Australian education.        
	The number of Indian students going to Australia is expected to fall sharply in 2010. The reason is violent attacks by hooligans on Indians. Australian education marketing offices in India have recorded an 80 per cent fall in student enquiries. Indians are turning away from Australian education for only one reason  that hooligans have targeted Indians. Australian streets have become unsafe for Indians; going to the cinema or a pub is becoming an invitation to be beaten up. The violent incidents have revived memories of Mohammed Hanif being victimized on completely unfounded suspicions of being a terrorist, and Harbhajan Singh being targeted by uncivilized crowds. The Cronulla riots of 2005 were directed at beach visitors whose only fault was that they looked like Arabs. Australia has acquired a reputation for being a country in which it is unwise to be non-white.        
	Australian reputation would not have sustained such rapid erosion if there had been strong Australian voices against racism. In particular, the Australian government could have taken a firm stand against anti-Indian violence. It has failed to do so. Instead of admitting and tackling the problem, the prime minister, Kevin Rudd, flatly denied that Australia was unsafe for Indian students, though later he made correct noises. Altogether, it has been difficult to avoid the impression that Australia was trying its best to avoid recognizing that it had a problem. There have also been serious questions about the quality of Australian education. The best Australian universities are as good as elsewhere. But there are also a great many fly-by-night operators who take fat fees from unsuspecting foreign students and teach them nothing. After going there, young Indians see no future in their studies. They hesitate to come back and face the humiliation among their relatives and peers. Thus they fall prey to slave drivers; and of course, Australian work regulations make sure that it is they who are in the wrong, and not their employers. So the flood of young Indians to Australian pseudo-universities has been a bad idea from the start. If it dries up because of the spreading race scandal, it will not be such a bad thing.

	Without grace or sense                  
	Sir  It was most ungracious of L.K. Advani to call Manmohan Singh the weakest prime minister in Indias history. Despite a slow start, Singh has proved his strength in no uncertain terms. His finest achievement is the nuclear deal with America. Singh is a gentleman-politician who commands the respect of his party and of the nation. Advani, though, is a politician who will go to any length to downplay the achievements of his opponents. His personal attacks on Singh are doing neither him nor his party any good.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Bitter lesson          
	Sir  The death of Rohit Kumar at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, is most shocking, but the news of medical negligence is not so  at least in West Bengal (IIT student dies, chief quits after backlash, March 23). Such things are routine in government-run hospitals, health centres, and even private nursing homes in the state.           
	Doctors need to be reminded of the oath they take before obtaining their registration. Doctors at the B.C. Roy Technology Hospital obviously forgot theirs when they treated Kumar perfunctorily and released him without diagnosing the seriousness of his injury. Trauma-related injury often turns fatal because of subdural haemorrhage that leaves no external injury marks. The doctors should have ensured that Kumars condition was stable before discharging him.           
	How can a medical set-up unfit for emergency cases be allowed in a technology hub like IIT Kharagpur? Neither the violence afterwards nor the resignation of the director is a solution to the institutes problem. While the authorities should be hauled up, the role of the students union should also be looked into. Why did it not oversee an upgrading of services in the hospital? IITs and business schools are the talent pool that provides the country with the best manpower. It is unfortunate that the government can only think of quotas for the backward castes and classes to improve electoral prospects. It is not concerned about the quality of education or the poor infrastructure of these institutions.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  I am a former student of IIT Kharagpur and I spent four years in Patel Hall from 1961 to 1965. The tragic death of Rohit Kumar reminds me of my experience at the B.C. Roy Technology Hospital. I had an attack of chickenpox and the doctor admitted me to the hospital, then housed in a smaller two-storeyed building surrounded by a large compound.           
	The second night was Kali Puja and I was running a high temperature. Only half-asleep throughout the night, I woke up feeling very thirsty. No one was around and nobody answered me. It was dead quiet. I realized that I was alone in the whole building. I crawled to the toilet to quench my thirst. Hours later, I heard some voices and three nurses came and enquired if I was alright. I did not reply. It is hard to forget and forgive such thoughtlessness.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Ashit Paladhi, Howrah 

                
	Sir  IIT Kharagpur is a premier institution. Students crave to study there and become part of its culture. What happened to Rohit Kumar is shameful for the institute. It has also brought disrepute to its authorities and its medical service. If the IITs are being sold as a brand, the least that should be done is to provide quality service. Nothing can bring back Kumar. What we can hope is that the episode makes the management aware of ground realities and that tragedies like Kumars do not happen to any other student.           
	Yours faithfully,

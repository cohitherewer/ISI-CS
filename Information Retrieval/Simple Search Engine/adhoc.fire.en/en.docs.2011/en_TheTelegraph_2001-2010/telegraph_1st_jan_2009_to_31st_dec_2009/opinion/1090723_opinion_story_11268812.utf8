The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | frisk them all
                                                                                                                 FRISK THEM ALL                                                    
	Strange fits of passion have erupted in Parliament over the frisking of a former president of India by an American airline flying out of Delhi. The Centre has show-caused the carrier, and MPs of every political hue have condemned this breach of protocol as an insult to the nation that could even be racist and communal. The only thing befitting a modern democracy about this palaver has been the insulted former presidents indifference to the whole matter. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam seems to have found the necessity of being frisked perfectly reasonable. And so should it be, as the airline itself has firmly but politely insisted. There is no reason why Indias archaic, and often obnoxious, VIP culture has to be endorsed by everybody. This is a commercial airline and the aircraft being boarded by Mr Kalam was full of ordinary people from all over the world who have no reason to share the Indian political elites officious concern for the honour of its members.         
	Safety and security ought to be the great levellers in todays world. Just as Mr Kalam would not expect to be treated differently from the other passengers in an emergency, there is no justification for exempting him, or anybody else for that matter, from standard international procedures. Indian VIPS should learn to dissociate their natural sense of privilege, and their vanities, from such matters and stop wasting their own, and the nations, time trying to make a big deal of such an incident. To see racism, religious prejudice and grievous insult in such slights to authority is to take the country back a couple of centuries towards notions of feudal prestige for which the modern world should have no time and patience. An exemption list that includes 24 people, from the Dalai Lama to the Congress president and her family (including her son-in-law), is not only absurd but also offensive. The American airline is quite right: there should be no special rules for VIPs when human lives are at stake.

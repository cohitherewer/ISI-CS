The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Dream of a university
                                                                                                                 DREAM OF A UNIVERSITY                          - Recognizing and rewarding the best cannot be an easy task        Tapas Majumdar                                                  
	The recently submitted Yash Pal committee report on higher education in India begins with a moving idea  the Idea of a University. This is so sublimely worded that I cannot resist the temptation of reproducing it in toto: A university is a place where new ideas germinate, strike roots and grow tall and sturdy. It is a unique space, which covers the entire universe of knowledge. It is a place where creative minds converge, interact with each other and construct visions of new realities. Established notions of truth are challenged in the pursuit of knowledge.        
	Somewhat anticlimactically, these beautiful lines stand in stark contrast to the committees own rather more practical suggestions made later for the real world of the state of Indias higher education. For example, the central motif of the Yash Pal committee report surfaces in the following obiter dictum:         
	It would, therefore be necessary to have a single apex body in the field of higher education which treats all knowledge areas in an integrated manner and works towards convergences with overarching regulatory powers. Only such a body would ensure that there is a live and close interaction among co-thinkers and co-workers and there is no dilution of any idea, which it has to suffer if made to traverse a bureaucratic maze (emphasis added).              
	I can sympathize with the idea of dismembering venerable bodies like the University Grants Commission and the All India Council for Technical Education that oversee our higher education today. I had once been closely associated with the former and had thereby become acquainted with some of its failings. But I am unable to convince myself that inducting Big Brother in the place of perhaps a dozen such bodies that now cover the myriad manifestations of knowledge and aptitude existing or required in modern times, would help. The proposition is plainly dangerous in a democratic State and possibly (and luckily) infeasible. It should have been clear to the committee that rushing in with an all-embracing regulator for a difficult terrain that UGC, AICTE and so on have only partly understood and often feared to tread, cannot serve the cause of the Idea of a University. It is quite inadvisable to try and concentrate the knowledge power of society in the hands of a single dispensing authority. It has been tried before in many countries with disastrous consequences and, fortunately, it failed everywhere.         
	But apart from the almost moral stand one is forced to take on the issue, one also feels disappointed to see how off the mark we have sometimes been (and I count myself among those who may not always pass the test) in our reading of the actual strength and weaknesses of the system (or lack of system) of higher education in India today. Admittedly, we often lacked that perception while sitting on these august bodies and I know the professor, Yash Pal, would readily agree with me. But much less than the combined wisdom of even these bodies (if and when they are combined) can be the wisdom lodged in a single monolith, however magnificently erected.         
	I do not stop there: much more importantly, the combined knowledge and wisdom bases of these bodies will still be much smaller than what can be tapped in any good Indian university (some still exist) endowed with a set of reasonably motivated, well-dispersed over disciplines, and internationally respected teachers and researchers. It is our misfortune that we have often failed to recognize and honour our greats before they were recognized in other countries and put in high positions of honour in the academia and elsewhere. Why could not our august committees look ahead and tell the powers that be that such people were special and needed very special treatment. Why, routinely they would fail to study what the rest of the world is doing to build up and retain high-quality knowledge power and find out comparable ways of recognizing and rewarding our best while keeping them as teachers and researchers within the higher education system?        
	Kaushik Basu has suggested something like offering higher scales of pay for recognizing the more worthy, in his comment in this column on the Yash Pal committee report. I need not elaborate on it. I would only add one piece of factual information. It is no longer the case (perhaps never was) that our best migrate because they are attracted only by very high salaries. I know at least of the London School of Economics, where they now offer higher salaries for imported youngsters from other countries (including India) as professors  salaries sometimes higher than what even the veteran professors of LSE normally get. They do not mind  why should we be aghast if that happens here? I know nothing can happen without the faculty gradually understanding and learning how to bring back the Idea of a University to our universities. The government and, of course, society at large, can certainly help by encouraging dissent and opening up channels of criticism and reconstruction in the minds of the faculty and students. But I know today the right path to rewarding quality systematically  without falling into crass elitism  will be difficult to find and more difficult to follow. The task cannot be an easy one.         
	Finally, I turn to one last point that the Yash Pal committee apparently did not consider important enough. It still remains my own hobby horse: why, how and when should our best colleges be turned into good universities? What is the place of a good college with respect to a good university it has been affiliated to or is constituent of? To go back to international comparisons, how could institutions like Trinity College at Cambridge and Cambridge University, LSE and the University of London, Balliol College and Oxford University respectively co-exist side by side and still autonomously? Was it plain good luck or good management?              
	I remember we had begun to talk of upgrading Presidency College soon after the Education Commission (1964-66) had recommended the creation of autonomous colleges. There was also talk of giving autonomy to at least some of our departments (and to some university departments themselves) in their academic relationship with the mother university. One often used to hear then that Presidency had a much better faculty in some departments than what you saw in the corresponding university departments. Some of the honourary lecturers at the university from Presidency College (Tarak Sen in English, Susobhan Sarkar in History, Bhabatosh Datta in Economics, for example) were universally regarded as among the best teachers in India in their subjects at the postgraduate level. This gave us an exciting talking-point but no authorities took notice of this phenomenon  except perhaps Calcutta University itself. This could indeed have been the main ground for the universitys sturdy opposition to Presidencys autonomy and possible secession. Perhaps Presidency is even now the jewel in Calcutta Universitys somewhat shaky crown.         
	When some differences surfaced recently around granting of full autonomy to Presidency, my kind of questions were not on the agenda. But these would remain questions to ponder over, before one takes a decision on that much larger venture: completely restructuring and overhauling the complex and mutual relationships in the college-university-UGC/AICTE/Council for Scientific and Industrial Research/the Medical Council/Bar Council system for the whole of India.

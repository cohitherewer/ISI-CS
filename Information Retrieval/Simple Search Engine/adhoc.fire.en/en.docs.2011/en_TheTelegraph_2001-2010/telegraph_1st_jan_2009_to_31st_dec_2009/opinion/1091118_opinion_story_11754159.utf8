	Q: In 2008, the promoter of our apartment complex consisting of three blocks amalgamated an adjacent plot and decided to construct another block of flats. The promoter neither informed us officially nor took any no-objection certificate from us although in our agreement it has been clearly mentioned that the complex will have only three blocks. Can the promoter build this additional block? Also, we have not been able to complete the mutation of our flats. When we approached the municipality we were told that unless we withdraw the complaint against the promoter regarding the wrongful amalgamation we would not be allowed to complete the mutation. What should we do?  
	Sougata Banerjee, Calcutta  
	A: Section 8 of the West Bengal Building (Regulation of Promotion of construction and transfer by Promoters) Act, 1993, prohibits a promoter from making any addition or alteration to a building or flat or constructing any additional structure without the consent of all the owners/purchasers. However, the complaint made by you against the promoter is subject to adjudication by the authorised officer, thus making your matter sub judice. Since the adjudication of your complaint will involve the legality of the sanction plan and the completion certificate, the mutation will have to wait till a decision is arrived at. So try and expedite the hearing to your complaint.
    
	Q:My grandfather was a member of a co-operative housing society. One of our uncles was the nominee. In 2006, my grandfather applied to the society to have that nomination cancelled and to include the names of my brother and me instead. The society wrote to him, confirming the changes. Soon after, our grandfather passed away. Recently, we leant from the district registrar of cooperative Societies that two people cannot be nominees in a cooperative society. Is there any procedure by which the name of any one of us can be registered with the society?        
	Bhupesh Kumar Chhajer, Calcutta  
	A: Though Section 79 of the West Bengal Cooperative Societies Act, 1983, relating to nominees, specifies the nomination of one person, Section 69, Clause 4 states that notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Act, a co-operative society may admit pair-wise any two persons as joint members and it may issue a single share in their joint names. So I don rsquo;t see why you and your brother cannot be admitted as joint owners. The other option is that one of you could give a declaration of no-objection in affidavit form to the other, relinquishing your rights over the membership and, thereafter, the other can apply for membership to the society.

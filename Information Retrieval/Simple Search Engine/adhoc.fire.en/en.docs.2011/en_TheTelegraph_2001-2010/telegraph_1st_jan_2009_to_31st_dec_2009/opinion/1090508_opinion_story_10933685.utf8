	Like birds of prey descending on a pile of far gone carrion, economists pounce on primary data with even marginal relevance to the phenomenon known as Indian poverty. They squabble over the definition of poverty and over methods to measure it. Learned  at least learned-looking  papers get written, critiques of the papers quickly make their appearance and are followed by sharp rejoinders.        
	Notwithstanding such intra-mural goings-on, economists will find it difficult not to reach unanimity on some basic facts concerning the state of poverty in the country. For instance, they will all go along with the suggestion that of the 710 million who make up the national electorate, around 500 million can be described as poor.         
	A significant majority of them are also either illiterate or barely able to sign their names. They are underfed; malnutrition renders them easy victims of deathly diseases. The opportunities of life, assumed as normal in democratic societies, are denied to them.         
	Yet they will vote in substantial numbers this season. They will do so because that is about the only way for them to assert their identity. They feel sovereign during the poll season, even if they exercise this sovereignty at the bidding of others. They vote for the Nehru-Gandhis because that family is to them the image of lovely royalty. They vote for the Bharatiya Janata Party because it is going to usher in the Ram Rajya. They vote for this or that denominational party because it promises to protect their religious rights, or for this or that caste or clan leader because he or she happens to be one of them and has proved the point that somebody springing from their ranks is capable of giving a bloody nose to the snooty ones. There is a kind of sense of fulfilment in all this: they may be poor but their vote counts, eminence comes visiting them at campaign time. They feel tickled by the experience. They perhaps already know in their marrow that those making yards and yards of promises while seeking their votes do not mean a thing. That, too, is a part of their total experience. The deprived and the dispossessed enjoy this brief pretence of sovereignty; once the poll day is over, the routine of grinding poverty, they know, will resume.               
	Such is the frozen format Indian elections have assumed. The bulk of those exercising their franchise are at the base; the handful belonging to the super-structure appropriates the post-poll dividends. The superstructure comprises men and women who have a permanent lease on power and authority. Their monopoly is now and then broken by an outsider who claims to mirror the aspirations of this caste, sect or minority group. He or she achieves a famous electoral victory and forces entry into the super-club of rulers. This club has one striking attribute. It is, to all accounts, a closed shop, and yet it is not. It fights hard to keep off intruders. But if someone has the competence to garner votes and barges in, prejudices are discarded and the erstwhile outsider is made to feel welcome. Variations punctuate the enactment of this particular drama. An oddball who, all of a sudden, creates a mass base for himself or herself can get liquidated through the courtesy of hired assassins, and a temporary suspension of tension ensues. Or the person threatening to mar peaceful existence is bribed heavily and persuaded to lump his ambitions. Or else someone spouting fire and brimstone gatecrashes into the arena; he or she is persuaded to succumb to the charms of dual existence: at one level, the person stays loyal to his or her constituency and offers them crumbs of benefits dispensed by the State, at another level, he or she reaches a deal with a faction of the governing elite: the latters culture becomes his or her second nature too.         
	Burgeoning prosperity at the top of the social ladder has been more than matched by aggravated discontent at the base. Discontent as such does not worry those who control the levers of power, its vocal expression does. The hokum of reservations is the standard response every time a new ethnic or caste-based social group bestirs itself. The sense of deprivation has an objective basis though. Therefore, even as economists continue to make a roaring living out of the polemics over poverty, new generations of caste or minority group leaders arrive on the scene. It has, in fact, been an impressive sequence. Leaders of backward classes have been succeeded by those from other backward classes. The Dalit tigress has made all of them pass. But there is no warranty that the story will end with her or that she too will not get tamed and incorporated as a distinguished member of the seemingly unsinkable governing class entrenched in the nations capital. Even if she falters, the historical narrative will still be inexorably on its way: a new chieftain will spring from some remote corner of the country and raise Cain on the ground that his or her people have been for eternity at the receiving end of ruthless exploitation.        
	There is little point in being dogmatic, a kink could well disturb the smoothness of this process of flexible exclusivity. Should the descendants or the original inhabitants of the country, the adivasis, who have of late begun to describe themselves as moolvasis, refuse to learn manners, the narrative might get complicated. In the Northeast, where ethnic issues reared their head much earlier than elsewhere, New Delhis establishment had honed the practice of wholesale buying of mischief-makers. It worked; yesterdays rebels became todays lapdogs. The pattern has not been much different, till now, in the tracts of Aryavarta either. The likes of Shibu Soren have for a while spit fire, some arson and some murders have taken place, but the troublesome elements have been successfully bought off in the final round.               
	A fresh flutter in the dovecotes. What marks out the Maoists currently on the rampage in the heartland of the country is their elusiveness. Why not also face the datum, 60-odd years of independence have immiserized the adivasis further. Industrial and commercial growth, mostly under private auspices, has passed them by. They have been ill-served by self-styled leaders too. Many of them are now in a foul mood. They could not care less if Maos Red Book is generally regarded everywhere as an outdated scripture. They have written their own script, and set up a network of internal communications despite their location in far-flung states. They have taken to guns and landmines as a duck takes to water: Maos invocation was to bombard the headquarters; Indias Maoists have transcreated it: their objective is to scare the daylights out of the ruling establishment.         
	This may be a temporary situation, or it may be not. The Maoists have targeted the polling booths, because, according to them, the charade of parliamentary democracy is intended to divert the moolvasi mind away from the real issues. The usurpers, who have taken their land and livelihood, deserve to be exterminated; it is only when that task has been accomplished and they have repossessed what is rightfully theirs, it would be time for reconstruction; as of now, the basic task is to spread terror, to destroy is to create.        
	This perhaps sounds wretchedly imbecilic. But you cannot demolish it by mounting counter-terror. The butcher of a policeman could apply brutal methods and get rid of Bhindranwales leftover disciples because the Khalistani rhetoric had little objective basis. This is hardly the case with the original inhabitants of this land.        
	Election time can be illusory time. The moolvasis are waiting.

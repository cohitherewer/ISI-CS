	The rapidly changing relationship between Islamabad and the Taliban poses a new danger to India. Originally created by Islamabad to advance its perceived interests in Afghanistan and Kashmir, the Taliban has now developed into a Frankensteins monster that embarrasses  but also continues to fascinate  its creator. The reluctance of Pakistans civil and military rulers to oppose the Taliban conquest of Swat and Buner has set off alarm bells around the globe. The American secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, has observed that the Pakistani government is basically abdicating to the Taliban and to the extremists, and that the deteriorating situation in nuclear-armed Pakistan poses a mortal threat to the security and safety of our country and the world. It is hardly necessary to add that the threat to neighbouring India is even more immediate.        
	For more than 50 years, the Pakistan armys tight grip on the countrys political system has bedevilled Indo-Pakistan relations. Today, we face an even greater problem  the Pakistan armys reluctance to oppose the seizure of power by religious extremists, even while half-heartedly recognizing the existential threat to the Pakistani State posed by terrorism. Militant groups now control not only the Federally Administered Tribal Areas but also large parts of the North-West Frontier Province, Baluchistan and the district of Swat. The army had created the Taliban in order to gain strategic depth in Afghanistan.         
	Recent events suggest that the actual movement is in the opposite direction: the Taliban has extended its strategic depth from across the Afghan frontier into the Pakistani heartland. Instead of vigorously opposing this advance, the military and civilian leaders of Pakistan appear to prefer an accommodation with the extremists, involving tacit power-sharing arrangements. The Pakistani State is unable to exercise effective control over increasingly large tracts of its territory. In the words of the chairman of the American joint chiefs of staff committee, Admiral Michael Mullen, Were certainly moving closer to the tipping point where Pakistan could be overtaken by extremists.               
	Few observers anticipated these developments. Until recently, most analysts drew comfort from the fact that religious extremists had always fared poorly in Pakistani elections. Indian visitors to Pakistan saw for themselves that most Pakistanis are free of religious fanaticism. On the basis of this evidence, political observers airily dismissed the possibility of Taliban rule in Pakistan. They failed to understand that religious extremists do not rely on numbers. They impose their control through force, not majority elections. A weak and divided State that is either unable or unwilling to suppress lawlessness provides ideal conditions for such extremist groups.         
	The fate of Buner provides a vivid illustration. After seizing power in Swat, the Taliban tried to extend its rule to neighbouring Buner district, killing members of the small police force opposing it. Responding to the invaders, the local people took up arms and succeeded in driving out the Taliban. However, with Islamabad playing the role of a bystander, the Taliban was able to recruit additional forces in Swat, return to Buner and terrorize the populace into accepting its rule. Having made its point, the Taliban has partially withdrawn from Buner, leaving open the option of resuming full occupation at a convenient time. Despite desperate appeals for help from the local police force, the army did not think it necessary to send in troops. Buner, it should be noted, is only about 60 miles distant from Islamabad.        
	Pakistan has long been burdened with a dysfunctional, military-dominated State that views India as a natural enemy. As a result, tension has been the characteristic feature of Indo-Pakistan relations. Ironically, the progressive weakening of the Pakistani State is likely to compound our problems.         
	We need to urgently review our Pakistan policy in light of the rapid erosion of Islamabads authority and its growing inability to control diverse militant factions. The following are some of the problems for which we have to find answers.         
	In the first place, as a result of the deteriorating security situation in Pakistan, we must anticipate increased terrorist activity from across the border. The question is not if there will be another Mumbai but when and where. It is imperative for us to raise the level of preparedness, improve collection and analysis of intelligence and strengthen our homeland defence capabilities. Since finances are not unlimited, we may have to reorder our priorities in defence planning.         
	Second, as I have argued in these columns earlier (January 29, 2009), if the Pakistan authorities are unable or unwilling to bring terrorists to justice, we should ourselves bring justice to the terrorists. We need to develop a capability as well as an institutional mechanism for covert cross-border retaliation against specific terrorist leaders and groups responsible for attacks on India. Retaliatory actions must be subject to the strictest control. It must be ensured that innocent persons are not targeted and that collateral damage is avoided. Plausible deniability is another essential requirement for clandestine retaliation.         
	After the terrorist assault on Mumbai last November, we decided to suspend the composite dialogue with Pakistan until it closes down all militant camps across the border. This was an understandable reaction, given the deep sense of outrage in all sections of Indian public opinion. However, the plain fact is that even if Islamabad were to be prepared to cut off its shadowy links with militant groups, it is no longer in a position to guarantee that these groups will not launch attacks against India. There is no evidence suggesting that the Pakistan government was responsible for the Mumbai attack, though we cannot rule out possible involvement of some individuals belonging to official agencies.               
	In the circumstances, suspension of the composite dialogue serves no long-term purpose. Progress in the dialogue promotes the national interests of both India and Pakistan. Strengthening trade and cultural ties and facilitating freer movement of people strengthen the position of the majority of Pakistani citizens who want peace in the subcontinent. Before the Pervez Musharraf regime began to totter, a great deal of progress had been made towards the resolution of the Sir Creek issue. A formal agreement could not be concluded on account of the prevailing uncertainty concerning General Musharrafs political future. A new government is in office in Islamabad, and the time will be ripe after the Indian elections to sign an agreement. Remarkable progress was also made towards an understanding on Kashmir. This also needs to be followed up.        
	Finally, we should closely study the complex links between developments in Afghanistan and Pakistan and the role of the United States of America in what Washington now describes as the Afpak area. We have a very active and effective embassy in Kabul and we also maintain a continuous dialogue with Washington. What is lacking is an institutionalized dialogue with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that would keep us abreast of its latest assessments of and plans for tackling the terrorist menace. Our distaste for contacts with military alliances was understandable during the Cold War, but makes no sense in the current situation. China and Russia, for example, have maintained a regular diplomatic dialogue with Nato for many years. There is no reason why we should not follow suit. The object would only be to seek a better understanding of events unfolding in our neighbourhood. Nato would welcome an exchange of views and information on the lines of similar dialogues with a large number of countries. This lacuna should be filled without further delay.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | bleak picture
                                                                                                                 BLEAK PICTURE                                                    
	A spectre is haunting Bengal  the spectre of bad politics and an inept administration jointly working overtime to drive away industries. The Tata Metaliks decision to shift its Rs 1,000-crore expansion project from the state to Karnataka continues the story that unfolded at Singur. As with their decision to take the Nano factory away to Gujarat, the Tatas cannot be faulted this time either. Even after the bitter lessons from Singur, the Tatas persisted with a plan to expand the countrys biggest pig-iron manufacturing unit. As in Singur, problems over land acquisition forced them to quit. The big difference with Singur is that this time, it was a foot-dragging state government, rather than Opposition politicians, that killed the project. But there is no mistaking the larger picture  the Tata Metaliks exit further darkens the states industrial horizon. If Singur and Nandigram showed how irresponsible the states Opposition could be, this one will further weaken investors confidence in the state governments competence. The consequence could be Bengals deeper slide into economic stagnation and a climate of hopelessness.        
	Governments are notorious for being slow learners. It is becoming increasingly doubtful if the Bengal government has the capacity to learn anything at all. The Tata Metaliks case shows that all the turmoil over land acquisition for industry that turned bloody at Singur and Nandigram has not really spurred the government into doing anything different. The Tata Metaliks authorities waited for nearly four years to get 500 acres of land for their proposed project. All they could get after the long wait was less than 200 acres. For all his anxiety and initiative to get new industries in the state, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee does not seem to have succeeded in having a land acquisition policy in place. Industrialists have repeatedly urged his government to create a land bank to facilitate the setting up of new industries. Worse still, Mr Bhattacharjees response to the Tata Metaliks decision suggests that he is more keen to brush aside than face the problem. This is no way to reassure either the investors or the people of the state. Mr Bhattacharjee has faced huge political challenges since Singur and Nandigram. He has done the right thing by boldly sticking to his industrialization campaign. But his government needs to learn  and work  faster.

                                                                                                                 WHAT BIRDS KNOW                                                          
	Somewhere in the course of European history, post 17th-century, man began to see himself as being distinct and superior to nature. Nature was seen as an object for man to use. This became part of universal wisdom, and the natural world was thus given an inferior status in the order of things. This, as recent theories and discoveries are tending to demonstrate, was to the detriment of man and his process of learning. A recent set of experiments with rooks suggests that these birds know that the level of water in a jar can be raised by dropping stones into the water. Aesop, the writer of fables who lived in Greece between 620 and 560 BC, had noted this in one of his stories, The Crow and the Pitcher. In the fable, the crow, unable to reach the water in the pitcher, kept dropping pieces of stone in the water till the water-level rose and the crow could reach it to drink and thus save his own life. The lesson Aesop drew from it was that little by little does the trick or that perseverance leads to success. Scientists, of course, have not gone into the truth or otherwise of Aesops conclusions, but they have shown that rooks know how to raise the level of water by dropping weights in it. Something that Aesop probably knew more than 2,000 years ago by observing nature, scientists have just discovered through experiments.        
	The discovery raises an interesting question that scientists are sure to ponder. Do rooks also know the principle that Archimedes of Syracuse (287-212 BC) discovered, legend has it in his bath, that the amount of water displaced is equal in weight to the solid object immersed in the water? Rooks may have already arrived at this principle through means that are only known to them and to other inhabitants of the natural world. Human beings are slowly beginning to acknowledge that there is much in the natural world that they are still unable to explain. How do migratory birds follow the same route every year to arrive at the same place? How do birds when they fly in formation adjust places when one of them gets tired? How do birds and animals know about the arrival of a storm when human beings have to depend on sophisticated technology like satellite imaging and so on? How is it that the stripes of each and every tiger are unique and identifiable? Observers of the natural world are struggling to explain these phenomena.        
	It is entirely possible that when man saw himself as an integral part of nature, he knew more of the secrets of the natural world. Maybe this is how Aesop knew what rooks could do to raise the water-level in a vessel. Mans alienation from nature has stopped his access to these secrets. Modern science is discovering things, some of which were previously known as a body of knowledge that is now lost. Mans rediscovery of the natural world is also a rediscovery of knowledge.

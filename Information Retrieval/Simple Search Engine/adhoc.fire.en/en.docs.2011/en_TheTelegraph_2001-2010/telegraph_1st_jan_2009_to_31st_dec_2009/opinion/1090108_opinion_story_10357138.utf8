                                                                                                                 TALKING TOUGH                                                    
	When the going gets tough, the tough get talking, and talking tough. Since the Mumbai terror attacks in November, India has done precisely that  within the country, with its neighbour and with the world powers. However, none of this has moved Pakistan any closer to acknowledging its role in the spread of terror or cracking down on terrorist outfits operating from its soil. This is probably why the prime minister of India has felt compelled to draw renewed attention to Pakistans culpability. The timing is better suited to inciting response than Indias previous attempts at netting Pakistan. In early December, the government had alleged the involvement of the ISI without placing to the public a shred of evidence. This time, Indias allegations follow the dispatch of its dossier of proofs to Pakistan and to other nations whose citizens were victims of the violence in Mumbai. The incontrovertible proof of the sophistication and precision of the Mumbai operation is supposed to convince Pakistan and the international powers of the involvement of Pakistans state apparatus, without the cooperation of which the attacks could not have taken place. However, the evidence that has altered Manmohan Singhs earlier stance (of seeing Pakistan as the victim, rather than the sponsor, of terror) may not be entirely unknown to those for whom it was meant. Expectedly, Pakistan has rubbished Mr Singhs claims as a propaganda blitz, and the United States of America might be as unmoved by these claims as it was by the previous ones made by India.        
	It is unlikely that any proof will be deemed sufficient to nail Pakistan as a global sponsor of terror, and Mr Singh knows this. Despite claiming to have enough evidence of the Pakistan armys involvement in the Kabul bombing, the US has done nothing to condemn it. Nor was the rest of the evidence gathered by the United Nations sufficient to force Pakistan to provide access to Lashkar chiefs like Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi and Zarar Shah or clamp down completely on the Jamaat-ud-Dawa. A convergence of strategic interests, not merely Pakistans, once made it possible for Pakistan to use terror as a state policy against its neighbours. Those who are part of this convergence may have changed, but the mixture of interests remains sufficiently potent to let Pakistan fob off Indias allegations against it.

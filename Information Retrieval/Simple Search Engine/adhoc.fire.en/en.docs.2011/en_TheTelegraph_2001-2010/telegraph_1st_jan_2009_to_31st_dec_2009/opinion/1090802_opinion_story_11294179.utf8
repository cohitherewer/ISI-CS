	History under hammer                  
	Sir  It is unfortunate that the house in Johannesburg where Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi lived for three years has been put up for sale as the owner could not find anyone interested in preserving it for its historical value. Recently, everyday objects once used by Gandhi had been put on auction as well. India seems to be doing precious little to protect the legacy of the Mahatma. Is it in the hope that a business tycoon like Vijay Mallya, who had earlier bought back Gandhis personal belongings, will come to the rescue yet again?          
	Yours faithfully,        R. Sekar, Visakhapatnam 
                  
	Case studies          
	Sir  The editorial, Land question (July 27), expresses just concern over the uncertainty of the proposed expansion of the ITC group in West Bengal due to non-availability of land. It is true that most of the land in the state is cultivable. However, there is no denying the fact that land has to move away from agriculture to industry, if one accepts the reality of diminishing returns from agricultural land, which make the expansion of industry inevitable. West Bengal has been riddled with a politically motivated controversy over land acquisition, making it impossible to acquire land for any purpose  be it for infrastructure or industry. Even basic projects like setting up of power plants and construction or expansion of roads and national highways had to be kept on hold because of stiff resistance from political parties. Sections of the media and the intelligentsia have also stepped in to support the resistance to land acquisition, and have swung public opinion against any such endeavour.          
	But no one seems to be concerned about the dangerous impact of such mindless, politicized opposition. Such rash acts will hinder the prospects of development in the state, and ordinary citizens will have to suffer. If Calcutta-based companies like ITC are now forced to look for land outside West Bengal, then what, one wonders, would be the prospects of industry in the state?                    
	Yours faithfully,         S. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta            
	Sir  The complexities around land acquisition in West Bengal, discussed in the editorial Land question, are fascinating. Mamata Banerjees resistance to land acquisition seemed illogical at first. But after looking carefully at what she has to say, it seems that she is not against utilizing land for industry or infrastructure, but against government interference in the process. Apparently, she supports direct negotiation between the company needing land and the landowners. In a free market economy that India is aspiring to be, this makes perfect sense. Government intervention usually involves coercion, as it tends to favour one side over the other.          
	The ITC group needs large stretches of contiguous land. But this land is in an area where ownership is fragmented. In such cases, third-party brokers may be used to negotiate with both the landowner and the buyer, and come up with a viable solution. We have used brokers for arranging marriages and trading in stocks. Why would they not be useful in negotiating a land deal? The government may, at most, regulate the business so that fraud or collusion does not occur.          
	Problems in land acquisition mostly occur due to the future price of the land being much higher than the current market price, causing landowners to feel cheated if they have to sell at current price. So, landowners should be offered a higher price. Alternately, landowners can be offered a stake in the company buying the land, enabling them to make money in future. The brokers can come up with other sweeteners as well. Unlike government intervention, there will hardly be any coercion in this case.          
	Yours faithfully,         Shyamal Pain, Missouri, US

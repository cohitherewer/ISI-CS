The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | just a little chat
                                                                                                                 JUST A LITTLE CHAT                                                          
	Four men sit drinking beer under a magnolia tree in the rose garden of a very important house in the United States of America. Two of the men are white, while the other two are different shades of black. One of the two black men is the American president. The house is his house in Washington, and he is drinking a Bud Light. A certain lightness of touch is, indeed, the point of this self-consciously informal, yet gentlemanly, chat. (The president had taken his jacket off and rolled up his sleeves.) The other black man, an eminent Harvard professor, had locked himself out of his own house recently, and when a neighbour (a white woman) saw him breaking in, she called the police. The rest is history  a live and hotly disputed one in the US. Barack Obama, in the presence of his white vice-president, had hosted in his garden what is being called a beer summit. This was to bring the professor and the policeman, accused by the professor of racially profiling him, into some sort of a civilized rapprochement. The president thought it was a friendly, thoughtful conversation. But no apologies were made, only promises of further talking and listening by the professor and the policeman, presumably without the president sitting in.        
	Racism is at once subjective and objective. It takes place inside peoples heads, in their gut-feelings and perceptions, and also outside, in actual social spaces, public or private. In both spheres, within and without, it is real, although in different ways. This is why racism is easy to sense, but often difficult to punish. And this is true of any experience of prejudice, discrimination or abuse of power that is founded on difference and inequality. Think of everyday instances of sexism, homophobia or communalism  sharply felt and reacted to, but difficult to pin down with concrete evidence, terribly crude and terribly subtle at the same time. In fact, the trap lies in the subtlety. For the victim, the subtler the offence, the more infuriating it is in its insidiousness, and hence the chances of losing ones temper even greater. To the neutral observer, if there is ever one, this makes the victims reaction always appear disproportionate to the triviality and quietness of the alleged provocation; even the use of the word, victim, begins to sound excessive and sensational. So, these are often no win situations from which it is impossible to emerge triumphant without being simultaneously perceived as vindictive, paranoid, hysterical or humourless.        
	Mr Obama is possibly in a position to understand all this better than any other American president. Hence, the studied casualness of a chat over a drink, and his insistence on the importance of keeping ones cool in these matters. Yet, he did say that the police had acted stupidly in arresting a man in his own house  an uncool word for a president to use publicly. He then added that any of us would be pretty angry in such a situation. With any other American president, who that us stood for would not have been worth wondering about.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        TREAD WITH CAUTION                                  Sumanta Sen                              
	The capture of Arabinda Rajkhowa, United Liberation Front of Asoms chief, was a major success achieved by the Indian intelligence agencies against insurgents in recent years. The success would not have come without the cooperation of the Bangladesh prime minister, and she deserves Indias gratitude for sticking to her stand that her government will not allow her country to be used by Indian rebels. In taking this stand, she has moved away from Dhakas earlier position that Bangladesh was not sheltering any Indians on the run. It is gratifying to note that Sheikh Hasina Wajed has now decided that the truth needs to be acknowledged and acted upon.        
	All this is good news. But what should be of concern is that New Delhi is preparing to hold talks with the captured Ulfa leader. In a democracy, discussion should be the only way of settling disputes, but that course of action can be adopted when both sides are wedded to democratic principles. The Ulfa, most certainly, does not believe in democracy. If it did, then for decades, it would not have gone about killing people as it waged war against the Indian State. Its aim to separate Assam from India makes it anti-national, and the Ulfa wants itself to be perceived in this manner. The organization is still alive, the arrests of Rajkhowa and his aides notwithstanding.        
	So where is the basis for any negotiation? If it is believed that a chat across the table will transform the rebel leader into a good citizen, then it can be argued that the same result may be achieved by keeping him in prison for all the crimes he has committed. Also, there is not much to negotiate with as far as Rajkhowa is concerned. Unless New Delhi believes that the demand for secession can be met half way or thereabouts.         
	What else is there to talk about? The economic problem of the state is certainly a relevant issue, but hardly one that can be taken up with somebody who had sought to undermine the sovereignty of this nation. It has been suggested by some members in the Assam assembly that the Ulfa is not only a law-and-order problem, but it also epitomizes a deeper social malaise. This is undeniably the case, but Rajkhowa and his men must answer the question whether the massacre of Assamese as well as the immigrant labourers from Bihar is the way to change society.                
	Final push        
	History should also make the protagonists wary of treating the rebels with kid gloves. In the 1980s, in Tripura, the then chief minister, Nripen Chakraborty, had thought it was a good idea to rehabilitate Bijoy Hrangkhawl  who had surrendered  overhauling the objections of his deputy, Dasarath Deb. This gave Hrangkhawl the breathing space he needed, and once he had settled his affairs in his Ambasa village, he again went underground with his wife, Linda. Right now, Rajkhowa may make the right kind of noises but where is the guarantee that all this is not the Ulfas ploy to buy the time it needs to regroup?         
	The government also cannot be unaware that there are other separatist forces in the Northeast which will be keenly watching how the Ulfa leader is dealt with. Any negotiation with Rajkhowa will only add to his stature and lend other separatists the credibility that they do not deserve.        
	When Rajkhowa was taken to a court in Guwahati, a group of people had shouted slogans in his favour. One reason for such a show of solidarity was the Ulfas promise to succeed where the Asom Gana Parishad had failed. The Ulfa will do well to ponder the fact that even though it protested against illegal immigration from Bangladesh, it had turned to the same country for help when things got too hot in Assam. As for the Centre, having got Rajkhowa, it must now deliver the death-blow to Ulfa, even at the cost of displeasing drawing room democrats in Guwahati and elsewhere.

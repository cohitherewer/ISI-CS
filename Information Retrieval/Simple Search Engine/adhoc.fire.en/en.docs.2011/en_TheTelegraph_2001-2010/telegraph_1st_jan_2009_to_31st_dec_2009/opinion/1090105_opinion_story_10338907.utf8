	A second stimulus package for the economy within less than a month may smack of panic or impetuosity, but it only reflects the political circumstances. The general election is close  so close that the government cannot present a budget. But that only means that it cannot impose or increase taxes, for which the current downturn would be an inappropriate time anyway. It can reduce taxes  which it did in the last package. It long ago discarded the tradition of making fiscal changes on one predictable day every year, and ensuring fiscal stability for the rest of the year. And with the retirement of Y.V. Reddy and transfer of P. Chidambaram, the standoff between Delhi and Mumbai on monetary policy ended, and the Reserve Bank of India became the monetary arm of the government  as it should be. But it should be because fiscal policy should be stable through the year and short-term influence on the economy should be exercised through monetary policy. If the finance minister, also currently known as prime minister, is going to change taxes and expenditure from month to month, the whole purpose of distinguishing between fiscal and monetary policy is lost. The last, residual difference is that the finance ministry gives subsidies while its banks give loans. But if loans are forgiven on the condition that their borrowers do not repay them, the distinction between loans and subsidies becomes irrelevant.        
	There is another principle from which the government has taken leave: namely, to avoid giving handouts to particular industries and firms, since it may form one arm of a corrupt deal, the other being bribes to the ruling party. This government has brazenly departed from the principle: it has given specific incentives to its own departments as well as others to buy vehicles. The vehicle industry is in dire trouble; for instance, Tata Motors December sales were almost half of what they were a year ago. Helping it may not be so bad as the governments forcing the oil companies it owns to subsidize oil products, and denying the subsidy to private refiners. It may say that it is only following the example of the American government, which is preparing to bail out American car-makers. But the United States of America does not force the Federal Bureau of Investigation to buy GM cars. The USs practice of investing in ailing firms is superior to the Indian practice of persuading all and sundry to buy more cars.        
	In a time of depression, spending becomes a virtue and fiscal rectitude a casualty. But the unholy alliance that has developed between the ruling party and particular business groups is highly disturbing. And this is only the beginning. There are plenty of businessmen in trouble. They are upset by the particular favours shown, and are queuing up to aid the ruling party in return for subsidies.

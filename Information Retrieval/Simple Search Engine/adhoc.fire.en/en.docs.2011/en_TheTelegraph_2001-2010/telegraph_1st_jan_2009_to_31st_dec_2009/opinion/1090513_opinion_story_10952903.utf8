The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Meeting a dead end
                                                                                                                 MEETING A DEAD END                          - The trilateral summit was a wake-up call for the US president        DIPLOMACY - K.P. NAYAR                          Strained alliance                                              
	Barack Obamas meetings last week with Afghanistans president, Hamid Karzai, and Pakistans president, Asif Ali Zardari, were wake-up calls for the president of the United States of America who has been in office for just a fortnight over 100 days. As Obama was getting his last-minute briefings and final talking points for the trilateral summit with Karzai and Zardari, American television channels broke into normal programming to announce a devastating US bombing raid, which, that morning, reported dozens of civilian deaths in Afghanistan. That was the moment when Obama realized, probably for the first time, that his best laid plans can be blown to smithereens by the very military of which he is the commander-in-chief.         
	The same thing had happened to George W. Bush. Only days after the entire world stopped and watched riveting pictures of Saddam Husseins mammoth statues being felled to the ground in Baghdad, the incompetence of the Pentagon caused those positive images to be replaced by scenes of chaos, the looting of treasured antiquities in Iraqi museums.         
	Bush later tried to salvage the situation and succeeded for a while in focusing attention on Saddam Husseins cruelties by bringing to the White House people whose hands had been chopped off or who were tortured. But his spin had no chance of success. Because, within days, any goodwill created by US asylum for Saddams victims was destroyed by photographs of inhuman treatment of prisoners in Abu Ghraib, treatment choreographed by the US military that brought Americas reputation to its nadir.              
	Karzai was off the hook in Washington the moment last weeks bombing of Bala Baluk villages in Farah province became an international story. Obama had hoped to be firm with Karzai in public and firmer in private about his non-performance. After all, the US vice-president, Joe Biden, whose views Obama trusts on South Asia, had flung his napkin at a dinner hosted by Karzai at the Arg-e-Shahi presidential palace in Kabul last year and walked out before repast was over, disgusted by Karzais claims that there was no corruption in Afghanistan. And Obamas secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, is on record that Karzai is presiding over a narco state...        
	But as it often happens in Washington, the bombing in Farah province became a story that took a life of its own. At the US state department  where Clinton deeply deeply regretted the loss of innocent lives with Karzai by her side  at the White House and on Capitol Hill the following day, the Afghan president suddenly became the injured party. It is now popularly believed worldwide that more than 120 civilians died in the US bombing raid, as the governor of Farah province told the media.        
	But that was not the end of story. The weekend brought reports that Nato forces fighting the Taliban had used a dreaded chemical, white phosphorous, the use of which is only allowed under international treaties to provide light or to create smokescreens for advancing armies. American military doctors have confirmed to news agencies that at least one eight-year-old Afghan girl from Kapisa province in northeastern Afghanistan, who is now at a US hospital at Bagram airbase near Kabul, is being treated for 40 per cent burns on her body caused by white phosphorous. On Tuesday, the Americans were trying to control the damage by declassifying reports that the Taliban had used white phosphorous as a weapon, but the effort may be a case of too little too late.         
	When the trilateral summit was being put together in Washington, the conventional wisdom was that it would be the end of the road for Karzai unless he made a big effort to mend his ways. But by Monday, it was Obama who had to seek the resignation of the top-most US army general in Afghanistan. The Americans have not admitted to any wrongdoing by their forces, either in Farah or in Kapisa provinces. Instead, the US defence secretary, Robert Gates, said that the general, David McKiernan, was being fired because it is time for new leadership and fresh eyes for the US military in Afghanistan.        
	That Karzai has emerged stronger from the Washington summit ought to be a reminder to Obama that notwithstanding his huge popularity abroad, there are still areas of the world where friendship with America can be the kiss of death. And some of those areas, like Afghanistan and Pakistan, are vital to US national security.        
	It is now taken for granted that because Karzai is no longer the favourite of Washington, because he is increasingly seen as standing up to the Americans on issues like the US air attacks that are killing more and more Afghans every week, he will easily win re-election as president in August. Besides, Karzai has built deft political alliances in recent months, especially with a string of local and tribal leaders who are equally opposed to Washington.        
	This is something the government which assumes power in New Delhi after the Lok Sabha elections has to consider. Both the National Democratic Alliance and the United Progressive Alliance governments in India have been at ease with Karzai. But after his coming re-election in August, Karzai will need much more support from New Delhi as he tries to emerge from Washingtons shadow and become a leader in his own right and an independent player in Afghanistans complex politics.        
	While Karzai and Obama have no illusions about each other, and know where they stand in their mutual dealings, the Obama administration is a long way from getting its act together on Pakistan. There is nothing new in the Army General Headquarters in Rawalpindi seeming to fulfil Washingtons wishes every time something important takes place in the White House or in the US state department that involves Pakistan.         
	For several years from 2002, General Pervez Musharraf perfected the art of killing or capturing a high-value al Qaida target a few days before he or any high-level delegation from his junta travelled to the US. Inevitably, the Bush administration praised Musharraf as a valuable ally in the fight against terrorism and the pressure was off his back during his meetings in Washington. Simultaneously, Musharraf managed to squeeze the Americans as much as he could for money and military hardware, using as equity his pretence as a committed counter-terrorist crusader.              
	So there is nothing new in the Pakistan militarys current offensive against extremists in Swat or Buner that was similarly timed to secure a free pass for Zardari in the corridors of the Obama administration. Those who believe that the Army General Headquarters in Rawalpindi will persevere this time against the militants because Pakistans civilian population has turned against the Taliban are being taken for a ride by the establishments in Islamabad and Rawalpindi, who are only trying a variation of what Musharraf did to fool the outside world about Pakistans commitment to comprehensively fight terrorism.        
	The truth of the matter is that the continuing threat from militancy to Pakistans civil society suits the army. The establishment in Islamabad has enjoyed the fruits of American aid for over five decades, and it is constantly devising new ways to ensure the continued flow of that aid whenever the Americans get wise to its double-dealing. The army and the ruling class in Pakistan now see the threat to Pakistans government from militant Islam as yet another opportunity to squeeze the Americans for more aid  both civilian and military. The bigger the militant threat to Pakistan appears to be, viewed from the White House, the Pentagon and the Central Intelligence Agency headquarters in Langley, the better the chances of more US assistance flowing into that country in the name of fighting terrorism.        
	It was clear at the end of the Obama-Zardari summit that the new administration had learned nothing from the disastrous experiments by Bush in dealing with Pakistan, which has only slipped further and deeper into chaos as a failing State. Unfortunately, in India too, demands are being made even before the formation of the next government that it should not wait to start talks with Pakistan. Nothing will be gained by falling into a trap of starting a dialogue with Islamabad which cannot lead anywhere.

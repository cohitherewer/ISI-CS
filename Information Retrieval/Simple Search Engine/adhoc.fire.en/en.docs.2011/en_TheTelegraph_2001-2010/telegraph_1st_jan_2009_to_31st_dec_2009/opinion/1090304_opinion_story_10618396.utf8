	The current crisis in the global economy has some unique aspects. First, it is veritably global in nature, affecting all the major economies, whether industrialized, emerging or developing. The American, European and Japanese economies are in recession, all at the same time. For long, the Japanese economy, the worlds second largest, was in recession, but the impact was cushioned by good American growth rates and modest European ones. Such cushioning is not available now within the industrialized North.        
	Second, unlike in the past when solutions to such crises were found within the tight circle of the industrialized economies, represented by the G-7 or G-8, this time the emerging economies, especially China and India, who are predicted to grow at 6 to 7 per cent still, are expected to help mitigate the severity of the downturn, even though their share of the global economy is still much inferior to the combined share of the United States of America, Europe and Japan. As against this, Chinas holds almost two trillion dollars of foreign exchange reserves, a large part of which is invested in US securities. Its role, therefore, in injecting critically needed liquidity into the global system, besides providing a safety net to the US economy, is most important.         
	Both China and India are still not members of the G-8, no longer recognized as an adequate grouping for addressing global economic issues. This is why the US convened a broader G-20 summit in Washington in December last year. This format is likely to endure, with the next G-20 meeting in London on April 2 expected to seriously address the issue of reforming the global financial architecture, including international oversight over national regulators, the operation of tax havens and the role of a national currency like the US dollar as the principal international reserve currency.               
	Third, the depth of the crisis has not been fully plumbed yet. Neither the Bush administrations $800 billion bail-out nor Obamas $780 billion stimulus package has worked. With CitiBank, Bank of America and AIG continuing to post huge losses, the US government is faced with the highly unpalatable decision of nationalizing them. Britains Gordon Brown, much applauded initially for having quickly nationalized collapsing banks, is now under fire for some questionable decisions. His government is now proposing to guarantee toxic assets of British banks to the tune of 500 billion. Unfortunately, the volume of toxic paper floating within the global financial system is not known.         
	The French government has announced a rescue package for its car manufacturers to prevent job losses and ensure that future capacity expansion is in France itself and not elsewhere within the European Union, raising concerns about protectionist policies as governments face hard choices pitting commitment to open markets against protecting national economies. The aim of bailouts and stimulus packages is to shore up those sectors of the economy most affected, restore consumer confidence, provide liquidity, encourage the banks to lend, protect employment and so on. However, because of the overall uncertainties ahead, public confidence is low and the market sentiment remains fragile.         
	Fourth, the source of the crisis is the country that has been the biggest protagonist internationally of good governance, transparency, and sound financial management, besides being the strongest votary of free markets and entrepreneurial initiative. In a sense, US hegemony since the Nineties allowed its financial sector to do the kind of free-wheeling it has done in pursuit of egregious profits and bonuses for financial managers and corporate heads. Globalization and the toxic effects of the pervasive culture of greed spread the contagion to Europe too.        
	Fifth, it is not only that sentiments against globalization itself are now hardening as affected countries try to protect local manufacturing and jobs from foreign competition, it is the risk-taking, market oriented, minimally regulated model of the Anglo-Saxon type of capitalism that is being questioned. That market mechanisms, regulatory bodies, rating agencies, auditors, etc should have all failed has dissipated the aura of the market economy. The public mandate for governmental intervention, decried earlier as counterproductive, has grown. Barack Obamas step to cap the annual remuneration of the CEOs of bailed-out corporations to only half a million dollars testifies to public revulsion at the manner in which the corporate sector has handled its system of incentives, unmindful of social consequences .        
	The global economic crisis is rearranging the international diplomatic chequerboard. For Obama, of foremost concern is the domestic agenda relating to energy, healthcare and education as well as the economic crisis gripping the country. His February 25 speech to the Congress was overwhelmingly devoted to these themes, with only passing references to foreign policy, including terrorism. Unilateralism is no longer feasible policy. If the situation in northern Iraq deteriorates, his time-table of withdrawal may get delayed. The US wants Europe to assume more military responsibility for stabilizing Afghanistan, but it is unlikely that Europe, reeling under recession and lacking the stomach for casualties, will comply. Iran has obtained additional breathing space with Obama, not only because of his willingness to countenance negotiations with it, but also because the US lacks the financial and military means to open a third front in the region.         
	If the secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, has made her first foreign visit to Asia, beginning with China, it is in recognition of Chinas enormous financial clout in the present situation and mounting US-China interdependence. On the other hand, Chinas own vulnerabilities have been exposed by the current crisis as export markets have shrunk, with major domestic consequences. Nevertheless, China can consolidate its position in various parts of the globe using its sovereign fund for strategic investments in a cash-starved global environment.              
	In the last eight years, Vladimir Putin restored the writ of the Russian state and rebuilt the economy on the back of skyrocketing oil prices. This gave Russia confidence to act more forcefully on the international stage. Now that oil prices as well as commodity or raw material prices have plummeted, the Russian economy is under pressure and the governments capacity to reform and diversify it becomes more difficult, affecting the countrys growing international stature. This is balanced, of course, by reduced US capacity to dominate others, progress towards multi-polarity, the need for Europe to respect Russian sensitivities because of growing dependence on Russian gas and US search for alternative routes of supply to Afghanistan through Russia and Central Asia, giving the Russian leadership bargaining leverage. It is unlikely that the Nato summit of April 3 will sharpen the confrontation with Russia.        
	Indias rise to global status was on the strength of its high growth rates, not its political or military muscle. The global economic crisis has set back Indian ambitions. Some high profile take-overs of foreign companies by Indian groups, trumpeting Indias rise, have now turned sour. Obamas February 25 speech refers to tax penalties on US firms off-shoring jobs, which would adversely affect a burgeoning sector of the Indian economy. Because of these developments, as well as the compulsions of the USs Pakistan-Afghanistan policies, the euphoria surrounding the India-US relationship may well subside.

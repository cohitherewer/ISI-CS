The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Oh, what a perfect day
                                                                                                                 OH, WHAT A PERFECT DAY                          - A soiled Shakespearean hero on a London bus        The Thin Edge - Ruchir Joshi                          London, June 10                                              
	Precisely because it is such a straight town in so many ways, when London throws up a surreal day it seems that much more fantastical. Order disintegrates more easily in cities such as Calcutta or Paris. These and certain other cities seem like natural habitats for chaos, for dancing or rioting in the streets, whereas London is as fixed and locked as Frankfurt or Tokyo. Not that it hasnt seen some fun in recent times: there were the massive G8 protests that I narrowly missed when I got here in April, before that there was the terrible 7/7, which I also missed, and before that there were the huge anti-war demonstrations preceding the Iraq disaster, from which we can rewind all the way back to the famous poll-tax riots of 1990 that meant the recycling smelter for a certain Iron Lady. However, June 10 this year was different.         
	This last Wednesday began for me with a small panic; it was the beginning of the 48-hour tube strike and as the day opened it became clear that the strike was serious and effective, that  despite rival unions struggling to keep some trains running  the Underground had more or less been taken out. Sods law had it that this was the day we had booked to take two protesting teenagers to see an afternoon performance of Hamlet in central London, after which there were the competing demands of a concert which was east-ish and a literary party in the near-west. Normally, with the tubes running, this would have not been insurmountable: one could have done the play, had a coffee, sent the kids home and chosen either the concert (by the fantastic Susheela Raman) or the charms of literary hobnobbing. Today, it was going to be crazy, but one didnt realize just how crazy.               
	Taking an early and very packed bus we got to the theatre well in time. The Wyndham is one of those really steep theatres and our seats were in the gods, so high we were almost behind a bank of spots. Where I sat with my younger son we also had a beautiful brass stair-rail, just at his eyeline when he looked down at the stage. It would have been a challenge in any case, but with this vantage point I could tell it was going to be a very long Hamlet, Jude Law or no Jude Law, binoculars or no binocs.         
	No surprises, when the curtain lifted we were presented with a very, very professional package of sets, lights, music and acting. The play was in modern dress and the set reflected that, all greyish squares within greyish squares, with different blocks shifting quite simply but ingeniously to lay out the darkening Denmark of the various scenes. The actors showed reasonable ownership of the language and were very proficiently passionate in their leather jackets and biker boots and such, (the oldies in business suits and Gertrude in a tasteful, wealthy, modern society ladys outfits). The text, as always, was great but the enactment lost me after a while: there was an absence, especially in Jude Laws performance in the first couple of acts, of the sense of danger that Peter Brook says every powerful actor must exude. I watched the play, but I also watched my younger son watching his first, full, grown-up Shakespeare play.         
	As verbal joust followed poetic millefuille, as the suits and leather jackets danced their dance, my son leaned over to me and whispered Why arent they doing the whole thing in English? I thought Shakespeare was English! I realized with a slight shock that a 12-year-old Londoner who has devoured The Catcher in the Rye and who was currently deep into The Godfather was unable to grasp Shakespearean English. The relief-making thing was that the gang of American senior high school students sitting next to us were getting it, laughing at the right moments; my older son, sitting behind me, was also getting it and fully engaged with the play. I remembered how opaque Shakespeare had first seemed when Id opened The Merchant of Venice at 14 and I relaxed back into being critical of the play. After a while, I realized what the problem was: everyone, the director, the actors, the designers, were all being a bit gingerly with the text, even as they tried to do modern things with the look of it, something which always leads to theatre-death.         
	Things got slightly better after the interval and my bored child seemed to wake up as the bloodletting action picked up pace. By the time the inevitable tragic end arrived he had his eyes glued to the small pair of binoculars. I left the theatre marvelling at the beauty of Hamlet, the Victorian architecture of the theatre and how beautifully it had been preserved, the efficacy of the sound system and the radio mikes on the actors that brought every whisper, every half-sigh to us right up at the back. But I also left disappointed that this cast and crew of highly talented professionals had not managed to surprise me.                
	**********              
	If, inside, I had Shakespeare, outside, on the streets, there was a mass spectacle that would have pleased Antonin Artaud. Walking down Oxford Street during the evening rush hour, I saw that Calcutta had been transplanted in London: one side of the street, heading east, was a drugged snake of jammed traffic; on the side I was, (heading west), was a nearly empty road but with small villages of people massed around the bus stops, their expressions varying from weary to panicky; on my side of the street there had obviously been no bus-like creature for a very long time, clearly the things were caught in a massive snarl elsewhere and unable to reach the centre of the known universe. This was not a protest, this was not a riot, this was the public quietly massing for Gordon Browns political funeral.         
	Suddenly it came to me again  the full power of Shakespeare. Brown had survived the week despite most of his important ministers resigning; hed said he was determined to hang on and do what was right; everyone was calling him delusional; Birnam wood was moving. I realized, as I passed bus stop after hopeless bus stop that it was Brown, who was the proper, tragic Shakespearean king, to whom one could attach parts of Macbeth, Lear, Julius Caesar and yes, Claudius, he of the limed soul, he whose words fly up and whose thoughts remain below. Compared to this man, Blair was like a wide-grinning joker who happens to commit all the crimes and then gets away on sheer luck.              
	Once I figured out which bus to catch to my literary party, I stood my ground at a bus stop across from Selfridges department store. I needed the 94 to Holland Park and soon enough one came along. It was packed, having hoovered up passengers from all the bus stops Id walked past thinking about Brown and Shakespeare. I tried to move towards the first bus but it seemed everyone else at the stop, all hundred of them, also needed the 94. As people began to stuff themselves into the first bus, some of us saw a second 94 pull up. There was a mad scramble away from the first bus and towards the second. Being a veteran of the L9 and the 48 in Calcutta, in India, I would probably have made the second bus, but here I still had my local British decorum switched on: you wait in queue, you dont push, you let others go first, eventually your turn will come, dont behave like an animal. As I made for the second bus, the hordes just trampled over me and I realized with not a little satisfaction that people everywhere behave the same when they are deprived or in fear of deprivation. The next 94 came along in 10 minutes and this time I pretended I was at Park Street-Chowringhee trying to get on a Lake Gardens mini; I was second on to the bus, I was one of the four people who got a seat. I felt like a soiled Shakespearean hero, a good man who has been forced to commit a bad deed, but only for about two minutes.         
	Within one hour, the bus had reached my destination, the distance which normally takes 30 minutes. Within one hour and 10 minutes I was standing in a beautiful, huge, private garden, drinking an ex-poet laureates excellent sherry, discussing human rights in Libya. It felt just like a trip from Park Street crossing to a mansion in Alipur.

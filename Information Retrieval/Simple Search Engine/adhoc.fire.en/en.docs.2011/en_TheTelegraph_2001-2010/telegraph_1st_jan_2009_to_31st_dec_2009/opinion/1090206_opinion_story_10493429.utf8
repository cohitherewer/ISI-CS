	Loyalty is no one-way traffic in the world of publishing. Publishers remain loyal to their priced authors. Writers owe their loyalty to publishers since the latter introduce them to readers and support them through the lean years of writers block. Authors reciprocate publishers faith chiefly because they want the latter to spend lavishly on the promotion and sale of books. Yet, this partnership splits: writers move on to new publishers and publishers dump authors claiming that the latter have run out of themes.         
	The trust between authors and publishers vanishes more quickly now because a lot of money has come into publishing. But is money the only factor that makes a writer desert a publisher who helped him in the years of poor sale? Money certainly plays a major role in inducing writers to switch sides. The world of publishing today is mostly interested in commerce and commercial productions.         
	Just bear two facts in mind. First, the most successful books in recent times have been commissioned by publishers on subjects that they thought would have a market; these books did not crop up solely at the authors initiative. Publishers now approach authors with proposals of writing books, give them deadlines and pay them in advance. Because of the growing competition in the market and the American or British tie-ups of Indias English language publishers, these proposals are lucrative, and hence are difficult to turn down. Second, the lure of money surpasses authors loyalty to publishers. Authors can earn more by selling the rights of translation, or of adaptation into films and soaps. Ironically, authors get these proposals because of their association with big publishers.        
	However, money comes for only the few big players. There are hundreds of amateur and not-so-popular authors who depend on annual royalty which is too paltry to live on. These authors constitute the silent majority of a publishers list. Do they also switch sides? Given a chance, they would happily do so. But they are too marginalized to be commissioned to write books  at least not now when quick return is the core of commercial success.         
	But a bigger question is whether this constant shift of writers and publishers affect the image of a publishing house. It does. In the absence of good authors, it may have to publish books for the mass market of entertainment. Also, the new publisher, who has bought out writers and editors ,wants his returns as quickly as possible. So he endorses titles that have an entertainment-value. As a result, publishing becomes a mere branch of the entertainment world.         
	Crime, glamour and sex reign supreme. Serious literature tapers off with the sale of a few thousand copies. Writers and editors easily fall in line if they get a fat sum. To each his own is the new principle for everyone in the book world  writers, editors, publishers and distributors.

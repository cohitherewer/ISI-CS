The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | beyond the boundary
                                                                                                                 BEYOND THE BOUNDARY                                                          
	Cricket, it has now become clichd to assert, is one of the two things that unify India. The other being Bollywood movies. Without even going into the substance of the claim, there is no denying that the English summer game has become the game for all seasons in India. Cricket and cricketers have a huge following at the locations where the big matches are played, and television has enlarged that. One inevitable result of this popularity is the pouring in of money from sponsors, advertisers and from TV channels that buy the rights to telecast matches. All these factors have made the Indian Premier League the worlds richest cricket tournament. Sport, astute business sense and skilled marketing have combined to make the IPL tournament a virtual bonanza for all who are involved in the game  players, spectators, the promoters and so on. Unfortunately, the IPL schedule has hit the hurdle of the third phenomenon that brings all Indians together  the forthcoming general elections.        
	The main factor behind the problem that has arisen leading to the IPL having to rethink its schedule is the tremendous popularity of cricket itself. A cricket match in any city of India brings together thousands of people at the venue  in a city like Calcutta, with two favourite teams playing, the attendance could soar to more than a hundred thousand. This involves, at the best of times, a security and a law and order problem. Under the present circumstances, with India being a principal target of terrorism, and after cricketers in Pakistan have been attacked, the question of providing security to the players and the spectators has acquired a new urgency. This security cover can only be provided by the government, either by the state government or the Centre, with inputs being given by the various intelligence agencies. This cover cannot be provided because the existing schedule of the IPL clashes with the timetable of the five-phase elections to the Lok Sabha. Elections in India also demand a massive operation on the part of the security forces. The latter cannot be spared for a cricket event, no matter how popular.        
	This appears to be a simple point which, however, is not being grasped by some people. The IPL, held under the auspices of the Board of Control for Cricket in India, does not carry the imprimatur of the Indian State. The general elections do carry that stamp; in fact, the elections make the Indian State possible under the existing Constitution. The government of India is thus bound to provide security first to the elections, before any other event. The issue of security is far too important to be compromised. If there is any lapse in security during the IPL matches, no one anywhere in the world will blame the BCCI for it. All condemnation will be directed towards the government of India. Neither security nor elections is an object of play. Cricket is.

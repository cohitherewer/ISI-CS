The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Illusions, issues and interests
                                                                                                                 ILLUSIONS, ISSUES AND INTERESTS                                  Controversies and cheap tricks have obscured the truly pressing concerns in the run-up to the general elections, writes Satrujit Banerjee                          Get the picture right                                  
	It has been one big tamasha ever since the dates for the general elections were announced more than six weeks back, and there is certainly no dearth in variety. Sanjay Dutt kept us on tenterhooks for a while. Will he, wont he, campaign for the Congress Party? No, came the answer after an agonizing 48 hours. Before we could digest the enormity of this decision, that wizard of Indian politics, Amar Singh, who, by some genealogical quirk is the very own brother to filmstars in dire financial or legal problems, broke the news before an expectant nation that Dutt will, after all, be campaigning for his party. Then the duo kept us on tenterhooks for a while as they worked the courts to allow Dutt to contest the elections. It reached the Supreme Court, which did us no favour by making us wait for a full five days before ruling that Dutt could not contest. This one really kept us clued-in for a while.        
	Then, we spent a whole week on the third front and guess who didnt come to dinner. Missing was a critical footnote  that in a democracy, there is no bar on the number of fronts that political parties wish to form. True enough, now we have the fourth front! For a quick rundown as to why no more fronts will be formed, one has to refer to a response by the no-nonsense boss of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, J. Jayalalithaa. When quizzed about her prospective post-election alliances, she said, A good politician rules out nothing, something we knew all along but were afraid to say aloud. Cynics are now debating whether this latest utterance should replace the strange bedfellows bit as the signature quote on political behaviour, while others keep asking what, then, does a bad politician do?              
	If these did not get you into the spirit of the tamasha, how about Mulayam Singh Yadavs No English, no computers? Before we could debate the consequences of such a major step and somewhat ruin his gung-ho spirit, he beat a hasty retreat. In between, Narendra Modi threw in a budhiya-gudiya remark, which was promptly labelled sexist, and it silenced him. Manmohan Singh also brought his bit to the table by announcing that independent candidates are spoilers, which had south Mumbais elite highly indignant, as one of their own, an accomplished female ex-banker, is contesting the seat as an independent. Should they have retorted with Adlai Stevensons An independent is a guy who wants to take the politics out of politics and silenced him? Then there is the jaadu ki jhappi (magical hug and kiss) that Sanjay Dutt has allegedly offered to the stoic Mayavati who reciprocated with an FIR! Somewhere in between, we had a two-day seminar on television channels on how good a prime minister Rahul Gandhi would make. Among prominent proponents were Priyanka Vadra, along with several well-groomed Congress spokespersons, who, from their diction and flawless line of reasoning, appeared to be successful lawyers in their other life when out of power.         
	The ground rules have been laid, and you can expect more of the same till the last date of voting, that is May 13. Out of bounds for this election are issues arising out of the fact that according to one report, even after a decade of galloping economic growth, child malnutrition rates are worse here than in many sub-Saharan African countries, and they stand out as a paradox in a proud democracy. The same report mentions that India remained home to more than a fourth of the worlds hungry  230 million people in all  and that the latest Global Hunger Index described hunger in Madhya Pradesh, a destitute state in central India, as extremely alarming, ranking the state somewhere between Chad and Ethiopia.         
	A Goldman Sachs report last year projected that by circa 2050, Indias economy is likely to be the largest in the world, surpassing China and the United States of America, even on dollar terms. The reasoning behind this conclusion is that Chinas growth rate will suffer after a couple of decades because of the shortage of labour arising out of their one-child policy, while in Indias case, cheap labour will continue to be available because increase in population will go on unabated. What the report does not state is that even if the prediction did materialize, India may still not feature among the top 100 countries in per capita income  a statistic much more vital than the gross domestic product  and might still lead the world, as it does now, in having the largest number of people living below poverty line, the largest number of childbirth deaths, the largest number of infant deaths, the largest number without access to potable water and, by a distance, the largest number of illiterates. Not to speak of high unemployment, which is at the root of the source of cheap labour. Is this picture too grim? Not if you take into consideration the trend of these numbers after a decade of unprecedented growth.              
	Government figures reveal Maoist violence in more than 150 districts throughout the country. Breakdown of law and order on such a magnitude does not happen in areas of relative prosperity. There has to be perceptible economic growth in these districts. Insurrections in Kashmir and the Northeast have continued unabated ever since Independence. Is there a road map? Would the Sachar Committees observations on the plight of Muslims be addressed?        
	Indias vulnerability against Islamic militancy has been demonstrated repeatedly over the last few years, culminating in the 26/11 attack in Mumbai. The most glaring lapse on the part of the government in connection with this attack is that even after five months, it is yet to name or apprehend the local conspirators without whose active co-operation such a meticulously planned operation would not have been possible. Failure to do so is raising eyebrows even in friendly countries, which are wondering if the government is doing this on purpose, out of its fear that this inability will become an election agenda, or if this is simply inefficient investigation. To add insult to injury, the home minister made it clear that he cannot guarantee security measures for both the elections and the Indian Premier League matches. Enough to mull over for an election? Not in this edition. We are chalta hai Indians, remember?

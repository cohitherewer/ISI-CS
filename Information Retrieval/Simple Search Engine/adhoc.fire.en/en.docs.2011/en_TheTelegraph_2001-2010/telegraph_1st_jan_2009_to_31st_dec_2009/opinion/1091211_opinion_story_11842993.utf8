	The Limits of Influence:  America rsquo;s Role in Kashmir
  By Howard B. Schaffer,  Viking, Rs 499
    
	In his 36 years with the American foreign service, Howard B. Schaffer has been ambassador to Bangladesh (1984-87), as well as political counsellor in India (1977-79) and Pakistan (1974-77). His generally balanced account of Americas role in Kashmir makes for a valuable work since there is a surprising lack of studies focusing on this aspect of American foreign policy. Schaffer provides a straightforward narrative from an American perspective, which does not mean that he speaks on behalf of his country, but rather that he has merely viewed the problem through the US end of the prism. This working principle has not stopped Schaffer from making conjectures about Indian or Pakistani points of view or from taking sides once in a while. He tends to come across as less charitably disposed towards India and more considerate towards Pakistan.  
	Until recently, the United States of Americas attitude to India and Pakistan had been similar to Schaffers. Jawaharlal Nehrus non-aligned policies and closeness to the Soviet Union in the Fifties and Sixties had disturbed Eisenhower, perturbed Kennedy, and annoyed Lyndon Johnson. In the Sixties, when Vietnam became the centre of US foreign policy, Kashmir was obscured for a while, but flared up once again with the war between East and West Pakistan in 1971. The Nixon administration, which had inherited the feelings of Indo-US acrimony, supported West Pakistan in that war.        
	Yet there has been an unspoken consensus in all US administrations since 1948 when the Kashmir dispute was first taken to the United Nations  that India is the bigger, and more enduring, regional power in South Asia. Except for a brief period in the Seventies, India has had a full-fledged democracy, something that remains elusive even in present-day Pakistan. Pakistan has been blighted by military coups, martial-law regimes and a long-standing collusion between its army and intelligence agencies. Yet, in spite of its pitiable human-rights record, Pakistan has consistently remained Americas most allied ally in Asia, whereas India has been pulled up repeatedly for transgressions in Kashmir. Although India cannot be absolved of its share of mischief-making, Pakistans support for terrorism across the border and inside India has been more than evident: the attacks on Srinagar airport (by Lashkar-e-Toiba) in 1991, on the Red Fort in 2000, on the Indian Parliament in 2001, the Mumbai train blasts in 2006, the 26/11 attacks last year examples abound.        
	So Americas role in Kashmir, thanks to its close ties with Pakistan, has been less than salutary. If anything, Pakistans determined intransigence has often embarrassed the US. The US has masked its awkwardness in anti-India rhetoric, blaming Indias intractable stance since Maharaja Hari Singh acceded Jammu and Kashmir to the Union of India during the British-mediated partition of the subcontinent.        
	The reasons offered by Pakistan, India and the Valley Muslims (who demand autonomy for themselves, which is perceived by Pakistan as the first step towards their eventually becoming part of its own territory) have been forceful and in their own, often twisted, ways valid. So the entire history of the Kashmir controversy, till date, has been a diplomatic seesaw, punctuated by sporadic military action, and even threats of a nuclear war, among the various parties with virtually no progress towards a credible resolution. In Schaffers testimony, Kashmir comes across as a chronicle of a failure foretold. Ever since the Americans stole what was till the Forties a British show (decolonized South Asia), Kashmir had been the albatross that subsequent US administrations have either tried to dispense with or put away in cold storage. The only exception was John F. Kennedys administration, which, impelled by a genuine concern to restructure its relationships in South Asia, had tried to intervene in Kashmir. It was the first time a US government had formally acknowledged, if not articulated, the primacy of improving ties with India and becoming wary of Pakistans ulterior motives. From the day the US started supplying economic and military aid to Pakistan, its ally in the Cold War, Pakistan had misused these resources to fund jihadi activities. It took the fall of the twin towers for the US to realize the extent to which it had been empowering Indias most dangerous neighbour for years.        
	JFK made it a crucial duty of his administration to win India over while maintaining reasonably friendly ties with Pakistan. In 1962, he took on the unenviable task of mediating between the two countries. Bilateral negotiations started in Rawalpindi, under the watchful eyes of John Galbraith. By the time the third round of talks was being held in Karachi in February 1963, the Indian and Pakistani proposals for the division of the kingdom had become so preposterous that Galbraith wryly recalled predictions that the Indian line would run through Damascus and the Pakistani line just short of Tokyo.        
	Galbraiths bleak humour sums up the prevailing sense of an impasse familiar to generations of US negotiators. Initially, the US made the predictable mistake of trying out the same tactics on both Pakistan and India. While the promise of economic aid extracted tolerable conduct from Pakistan, the same carrot did not always work with India. John Foster Dulles, a seasoned cold warrior, was so frustrated by Indias unshakeable position on Kashmir that he called Nehrus foreign policy immoral.        
	Since 9/11, Americas attitude to India has undergone a sea change. Not only has India become a vital ally in Americas War on Terror, but also a useful tool to blackmail its other South Asian partner in the fight against Islamic fundamentalism. A warming of Indo-US relations post-2001, reinforced by the signing of a civilian nuclear deal, made Pakistan pull a long face. In the final years of George W. Bushs presidency, there was a palpable frostiness between the US and Pakistan as Pervez Musharrafs misrule went from bad to worse. Now Barack Obama has put greater pressure on Pakistan to clean up its act by making it a stakeholder in its exit plan from Afghanistan. Yet, without a Kashmir resolution, South and Central Asia can never become stable. It is a pity that Schaffer stops with Obama becoming the president-elect. Had he waited a bit longer, we would have had a fuller view on one of the most enduring border disputes in the world.

                                                                                                                 STRANGE PROMISE                                                    
	Leaders getting hot under the collar as the elections approach is an understandable phenomenon. But elections are no reason for a senior leader to lose his power of reasoning. And to immortalize that astonishing loss in the party manifesto before going to the polls is particularly foolhardy. But Mulayam Singh Yadav has done all of these, promising his electorate that if a government is formed with the help of the Samajwadi Party, it will work against education in English and the use of computers. The best excuse for the Samajwadi Party would be that its rivalry with the Bahujan Samaj Party  and the acute dislike Mr Yadav and Ms Mayavati feel for each other  have assailed Mr Yadavs common sense. If the Samajwadi Party thinks that offering no English and no computers is a viable electoral plank opposed to Ms Mayavatis more English-medium education and greater computerization, it has lost all sense of reality. Who are the voters it has in mind? Increasingly larger segments of the population, whether in Uttar Pradesh or elsewhere, are exhibiting a desire for some English for their children. Even West Bengal, foremost in the country in throwing away the excellent basis of knowledge in English it had, has been forced to recognize the need to learn the language early in school to make children fit for competitive situations. People are eminently more sensible than politicians. Also, acquiring computer skills has become the aspiration  again a very practical one  of young people in the remotest villages.        
	Mr Yadavs smug emphasis on the use of national and regional languages in place of English in public spaces exposes further silliness. Hindi, which in UP may seem to be the only language, is  with English  one of Indias many national languages. Besides, vast swathes of Indias population will not speak Hindi. And computers cause lay-offs only in a Stone Age system; computerization increases efficiency and distributes skills and knowledge faster and more widely. More people become more employable in a computer-driven culture. Efforts to moderate the extreme statements in the manifesto have led Mr Yadav to purer nonsense. Offices with employees talking in a variety of languages without a word of one being understood by another and then making erroneous notings in files by hand may be Mr Yadavs idea of paradise; few are likely to join him in it.

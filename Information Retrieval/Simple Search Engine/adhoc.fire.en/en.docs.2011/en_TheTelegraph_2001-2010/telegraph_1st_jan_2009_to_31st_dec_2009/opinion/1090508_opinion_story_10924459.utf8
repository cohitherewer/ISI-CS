	Exit clause                  
	Sir  Nepal is now as famous for the Mount Everest as for its great Maoist movement led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal (better known as Prachanda). A year since Nepal became a republic, and he its prime minister, Prachanda has resigned following the crisis triggered by the sacking of the army chief, Rukmagat Katuwal, who had the support of the president, Ram Baran Yadav (Veil off Prachanda army trick, May 6). The fact that the prime minister and the president came from different ideological backgrounds seems to have landed the government in a fix. Prachanda has enhanced the office of prime minister by tendering his resignation. The army chiefs action  bypassing the prime minister and reporting directly to the president  was certainly not in keeping with the principle of parliamentary democracy. India should prevail upon all parties in Nepal to iron out their differences and save the fledgling parliamentary democracy from sinking altogether.           
	Yours faithfully,       
R. Sekar, Visakhapatnam 

                
	Sir  Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the first Maoist prime minister of Nepal, resigned after indirectly blaming India, and casting himself in the role of a martyr who refused to bow before foreign powers. If Dahal truly means what he said while relinquishing office  that he was doing this for the sake of democracy and peace in Nepal  then he and the Maoists should desist from doing anything that might lead to instability. By darkly hinting at the interference by India, he has not done the Maoists or Nepal any favour. Having failed to work with other parties, he should now let the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist-Leninist) and the Nepali Congress form an alternative government.           
	Yours faithfully,      
K.S. Jayatheertha, Bangalore

      
	Sir  Political crisis in neighbouring Nepal sounds like trouble for India, as the pro-China Maoists may again turn to anarchy after their supremos resignation from the post of prime minister. All over the world, most countries with a democratic mode of governance have landed in trouble. The United Nations ought to draft a model democratic system after studying the examples of various countries that can then be followed internationally.          
	Yours faithfully,      
S.C. Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi 

                
	Sir  India may have had a hand in Prachandas resignation, but this move has been in the best interests of both Nepal and India. Had Prachanda continued as the prime minister, the extremists would have joined the Nepal Army, and that would have been disastrous for India. Maoists have seldom given up a chance to create trouble for India.          
	Yours faithfully,       
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Indias own long term interests would be best served only if peace and progress prevail among its neighbours. In almost every nation around us, negative forces are ruling the roost, the latest being Nepal, where Prachanda, himself the instrument of historic changes, sacked the army chief before himself resigning as the prime minister. Nepal now joins Pakistan, Afghanistan, Myanmar, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka as a country where development and the security of ordinary people are at a great risk. Of course, China already has a track record of taking on India militarily.           
	India has been steadily enfeebled by swarms of self-seeking politicians and a corrupt bureaucracy, whose only aim is to exploit the poor for self-advancement. Such unbridled selfishness has reduced India to the pitiable status of a raging cauldron  a cauldron that is now perched within a circle of blazing cauldrons.          
	Yours faithfully,      
N. Narasimhan, Bangalore

                
	Unseemly sight          
	Sir  In recent times, several ghastly hoardings have been put all over the city. These are, ostensibly, campaign materials of major political parties in West Bengal for the Lok Sabha elections. These flex posters depict human beings who have been brutally killed. Most of these victims have been reduced to a mass of scarred, burnt flesh by rival political parties. While the Trinamul Congress displayed the gutted remains of Tapasi Malik of Singur, the ruling party showed several images of bodies battered by their political opponents.           
	Admittedly, Indian politicians are extremely deft at influencing the public to grab valuable votes. But this time, it seems, they have crossed all limits of decency and humanity by cashing on the misfortunes of hapless individuals. This surely shows up the desperation among political parties. Did these insensible politicians ever spare a thought on how these visuals of cruelty and inhumanity might affect children, ailing persons and the common people? Have they ever thought that these images are exposing the vacuousness of their own ideologies and principles  if they ever had any?          
	It is bleakly ironic how these wretched people, both in life and in death, have remained pawns in the hands of political parties. Such hideous hoardings must be banned at once by the administration, and strong action taken against the offenders.          
	Yours faithfully,

	The House of Wittgenstein: A Family at War 
  By Alexander Waugh, Bloomsbury, Rs 1,295        
	Vienna before the First World War belonged still to the ancien rgime. Under the Habsburgs, it had become the musical capital of Europe. In reality, as Alexander Waugh notes in this book, it was a city of paradoxes. Its grace and charm were contrasted to its poverty. The city associated with the Blue Danube waltz could never quite forget that the piece was written a few weeks after the military debacle that ended the Habsburg hegemony over the German-speaking lands. It was this paradox and contradiction that were perhaps reflected in the house of Wittgenstein, where genius and morbidity came together. It is the rather mad history of that family that Waugh recounts in this book with some poignancy.        
	The family produced two geniuses from the same generation  Paul, who became a concert pianist even after he had lost his right arm in the great war; and Ludwig, arguably the greatest philosopher of the 20th century. But there were others who did not make it to the pages of history but were phenomenally talented.        
	The wealth of the Wittgensteins originated with Karl who was the youngest of the three sons of Hermann, a man of solid middle-class background who dealt in wool and bought inefficient farms only to sell them after making them profitable. He was a patron of music, and one of his protgs was Joseph Joachim, whom he sent to Mendelssohn to study with. Hermanns eldest daughter, Clara, studied music with Brahms. Music was part of the Wittgenstein DNA.        
	Karl escaped from the family and Vienna and arrived in New York with nothing except his violin. He worked in various capacities in the US and returned to Vienna after two years following a reconciliation with his father. He trained at the Technical Institute and used this training to dominate the steel industry of the Habsburg Empire and to build a huge fortune.        
	His wife, Leopoldine, was musically gifted. She had taken piano lessons from the Hungarian composer, Karl Goldmark. She played gracefully, could sight-read almost anything and transpose effortlessly from one key to another. Completely dominated by her husband, she discovered in music the only mode of communicating with her children. Her eldest son, Hans, went missing in the US, where he had gone to escape from his fathers tyranny. Another son, Rudi, committed suicide in his twenties, and another son, Kurt, shot himself so that he was not taken prisoner on the Italian front.        
	Waugh tells the story of this family, and quite understandably, the spotlight is on the two geniuses  Paul and Ludwig. But Waugh has also unearthed an enormous amount of detail about the other characters about whom little was previously known. The vicissitudes of the Wittgensteins move from the grandeur of their palatial home in Vienna  where musical concerts were an almost everyday occurrence  to the horrors of prison camps in Siberia, where Paul struggled to come to terms with the loss of one arm and taught himself to play with his left hand by drawing a piano keyboard on a wooden crate with a piece of charcoal. Ludwig fought his inner demons all his life and he repudiated his familys wealth. Tucked away into all this is also the story of the attempt to save priceless art and music from the Nazis.        
	It is difficult to explain the fate of the Wittgensteins. Waugh does not try. Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Letters to Editor
                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Hell on earth                  
	Sir  I congratulate The Telegraph for publishing the editorial, Childrens ward (Feb 12). The images that the editorial conjures up  cockroaches crawling all over the bodies of children, nibbling at their insides, gnawing out eyes  are shocking beyond words. Since such things can happen to living human beings, to helpless infants, and that too in government hospitals, I am really ashamed to be a part of this society. The reaction of the concerned authorities to the monstrous incidents made me cringe even more. Rephrasing a famous quote, one may well say, If there is hell on earth, it is here, it is here! The leaders of all political parties, especially of West Bengal, should have this editorial as compulsory reading before breakfast everyday.           
	Yours faithfully,      
A.K. Singh, Ranchi

                
	Sir  The reality of West (read Waste) Bengal has been revealed by the editorial, Childrens ward. The news that cockroaches had attacked a newborn baby in our prestigious Nilratan Sarkar Medical College Hospital should open our eyes to the inhuman conditions that prevail in our medical institutions. However, this is not a rare case. Such incidents are happening every other day in rural hospitals and health centres. Medical teams there behave as nastily as their counterparts in city hospitals with the patients. Hospital employees, who are always safe in the protection of workers unions, have ruined the lofty values of the medical profession. And our political leaders  ever-busy with elections and meetings  have chosen to keep their eyes shut to the reality.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Supriyo Joardar, Ranchi 

      
	Sir  The abysmal state of healthcare in West Bengal is a perpetual cause of concern for the people, especially those who depend solely upon government hospitals for their treatment. On the one hand, healthcare here has become too politicized to function freely. On the other, ineptitude and corruption of the medical staff have jeopardized the entire system. The Telegraph has pointed out the callousness of hospital employees a number of times, but the reports have hardly had any effect. On the contrary, only a few days back, the Union external affairs minister, Pranab Mukherjee, heaped praise on the chief minister of West Bengal, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, for his supposed attempts to revive the states health sector. Yet, in 2007, when Mukherjee had been injured in a road accident in Nadia, he had to be airlifted to Calcutta and then to the countrys top army hospital in Delhi for proper treatment because the Shaktinagar district hospital, where he had been first admitted, was ill equipped. After recuperating, he did not bother to look into the condition of rural health centres, which do not to have the means to handle emergencies. He could easily have made arrangements for improving their infrastructure, but did nothing.           
	Potentially dangerous animals like dogs and cats roam freely in the emergency wards of government hospitals. The security guards choose not to act because they claim that chasing hospital pets is not their job. The hospital superintendents usually feign ignorance of such facts or say that they do not know whom to blame for the lapses. It is only when medical officers arrive on visits that the authorities suddenly become overzealous in putting the hospital in order. Patients are given due care as long as the supervising team is there. Once the officers leave, everything is back to square one again. If someone visits the gynaecological or the paediatric ward of the Burdwan Medical College and Hospital on any normal working day, the smell is sure to make him feel sick.           
	Apart from rats, cockroaches or cats, mosquitoes are also a menace in these hospitals. Patients are not allowed to use mosquito repellents because they emit phosphine, which is harmful even for healthy men. My daughter, who is in the last lap of her medical internship and is attached to the casualty block of a hospital, complains regularly of mosquito-bites. She is not sure whether pest-control routines are conducted in the hospitals at all. Close to the chest medicine ward where my daughter works is the emergency ward, where patients have to endure assaults from cockroaches and mosquitoes even while battling for their lives.           
	I remember that at my office in Calcutta, it was difficult to find a single mosquito or cockroach in spite of the fact that there were heaps of files in the rooms. This was obviously because pest-control operations took place regularly, and those entrusted with the job did not neglect their duty. If our health minister fixes the blame for the lapses on the officials and transfers them to remote village hospitals as punishment postings, then the right message will be sent to the people concerned, and things might improve in future.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Subhankar Mukherjee, Burdwan

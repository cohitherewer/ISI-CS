	 The lauh purush has often described Manmohan Singh as a weak prime minister, but it seems some in his party do not share this view. Recently, a BJP leader quoted an article by a famous columnist to assert that the humble Singh has outsmarted his more fancied rivals in public life. The article, written last July, pointed out that Singh has never hesitated to take up seemingly low positions to advance his career. Indeed, when he had moved from the Delhi School of Economics to the commerce ministry, many termed it as an absurd exchange. Yet, six years later, Singh went on to become secretary to the government of India, the RBI governor five years after that, the finance minister and, in 2004, the prime minister. Some, like the BJP man, think that the PMs humility and unassuming ways may have actually helped him pip his rivals to the post. The meek, it seems, inherit the earth but will the lauh purush agree?                
	 Some Congressmen are so inspired by the PM that they want others to follow his example. The PM isnt contesting the polls and a few partymen are demanding that other leaders should also be exempted from the contest. P. Chidambaram is contesting the Shivganga seat, and his supporters were heard arguing that he should be allowed to focus on the crucial job at hand instead of being burdened with tasks such as nursing constituencies or campaigning. At a meeting to discuss party nominations from Tamil Nadu, Chidambaram agreed readily to contest, but mentioned in the passing that there was no dearth of suitable candidates. The Congress, eager to put the best foot forward, would have none of it (although the party hasnt forced the PM on a rethink). Poor Chidambaram must be wondering that some men have all the luck.                            
	 On the other side of the fence, Arun Jaitley, the intelligent man that he is, made news channels eat humble pie, well almost. Throughout the year, national and regional news channels compete with each other by offering concessional rates to get a greater share of the corporate advertisement pie. But come elections, political parties complain that foes turn friends, and the channels, clearly aware that politicians need the media to sell their ware to the voters at this time, form a cartel to hike up advertisement rates.      
	Jaitley, who is also in charge of the Bharatiya Janata Partys media campaign, thought that he would be able to beat the news channels at their own game. Early on in the BJP campaign, Jaitley booked prime-time slots on entertainment channels, thereby forcing the news channels to woo him for the same ads. His deft move ensured that the cartel was broken. But only half the battle was won as a disappointed Jaitley noted that the advertisement rates remained higher than in normal times.                             
	 The Congresss Rita Bahuguna Joshi, the grapevine has it, is unwilling to take on her heavyweight rivals in the prestigious Lucknow seat. There are reasons for Joshis reluctance. The Congress has not won Lucknow since 1984, and Joshi, the daughter of the legendary H.N. Bahuguna, has never won an assembly or Lok Sabha poll. But Sonia Gandhi is doing her best to lift Joshis spirits. She has instructed her party leaders campaigning in Uttar Pradesh to include Lucknow in their campaign itinerary. Even the aviation rules in Lucknow seem to have come to the beleaguered UPCC chiefs aid. As per the norms, helicopters are not allowed to land in the city after 5 pm, so netas first reach Lucknow and then take a chopper to visit their respective constituencies. They return to Lucknow by the appointed hour to take the flight back to Delhi which leaves at 8 in the evening. Keeping the timings in mind, Madam has instructed her soldiers to devote the hours in between flights to brighten the chances for Joshis victory. Congress workers are wondering whether the time is sufficient enough to see Joshi through.                                     
	 The ties between the Congresss Mahabal Mishra and the BJPs Murli Manohar Joshi are likely to improve! Apart from their caste, they now share the same agency to handle public relations. Apparently, Mishra decided to hire the firm after it was recommended to him by a close relative of Joshis. It has been reported that the Uttaranchal government has also hired the same agency on Joshis recommendation, although the BJP unit of Varanasi, from where Joshi is contesting the elections, is supposedly unhappy with him for forcing the agency on them. Is it time for the agency to step in, once again, to improve their relations?                          
	 Post-Jarnail Singh, the Congress seems to be on a mission to shoo out pesky scribes. Two muscular men from the Congress Sewa Dal have been posted permanently to protect the AICC speaker during the regular briefing sessions at 24 Akbar Road. The tough-looking men keep their eyes trained on the correspondents, rather than on their leaders who are busy speaking on the podium. The mere hint of movement on the part a scribe makes the guards shift their gaze in double quick time towards the mans feet.      
	So are Congress leaders spending their days in fear of yet another missile? There has been no official word on this but the AICC spokesperson, Abhishek Manu Singhvi, admitted as much when someone suggested to him that the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, ought to make an appearance to address the media.      
	He is not sure of your shoes, Singhvi is supposed to have retorted, leaving the man and his colleagues equally flummoxed.

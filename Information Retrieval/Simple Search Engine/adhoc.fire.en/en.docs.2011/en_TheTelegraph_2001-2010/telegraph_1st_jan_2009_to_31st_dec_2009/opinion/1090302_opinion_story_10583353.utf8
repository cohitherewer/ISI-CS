The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Maverick, anyone?
                                                                                                                     MAVERICK, ANYONE?                      - The fight against terror in the subcontinent is useful to the US        Ashok Mitra                                                        
	Swat is a metaphor, but a metaphor representing a harsh reality: parts of Pakistan are already Taliban territory. Another metaphor has, however, failed to attract any worthwhile attention, even though it reflects, at least for the subcontinent, an equally harsh reality.         
	Indias vote-on-account budget has not been taken seriously, and for honest good reasons. Forget its income side, even its expenditure accounts are by and large an imaginary exercise; the new government, to be installed three months hence, is going to rework both the arithmetic and the priorities. And yet, one particular proposal in the interim budget is bound to be considered sacrosanct; the new regime would not dare tinker with it. The item is defence outlay. In the light of the grave event that is now ponderously described as 26/11, the outgoing government has suggested an increase in defence expenditure by as much as Rs 40,000 crore, that is, by 35 per cent over the year. Nobody, whether in Parliament or outside, has expressed concern over this inordinately large rise in defence outlay. Discretion is the better part of valour. Whoever questions the rationale of fortifying the countrys defence network so as to cope effectively with the menace of global terror would run the risk of his or her patriotic credentials coming under close scrutiny.         
	Indias formal recognition thus of 26/11 as a watershed in the nations affairs signals a major gain for the American administration. The Indian government had already prided itself as a strategic partner of the United States of America. It has taken a further step forward, its explicit endorsement of the American point of view that the Taliban  along with its various associates such as the Lashkar-e-Toiba  is as much Indias sworn enemy as of the US; henceforth it is a global war for India too, a common global war against a common enemy.              
	The American administration can claim to have squeezed out of the developments taking place in the wake of 26/11 another substantial victory. It has persuaded Pakistans ruling circles, including the army brass, to admit, even if obliquely, that they are no longer in full territorial control of their country. In the circumstances, they are ready to bury the hatchet with the Indian establishment and join in a grand alliance with the US and India to put down the pestilential enemy, the Taliban. Pay to the devil the credit that is its due: the US administration was in a state of transition during these weeks; that did not prevent it from a most deft handling of the situation. It went to relentless counselling sessions with both Indian and Pakistan authorities, finally convincing both parties to let bygones be bygones, from now on they are going to fight unitedly to destroy the demon of global terror, represented, at this particular moment and in this particular region, by the Taliban.        
	It needed some doing. Pride is everybodys prerogative. For Pakistans ruling politicians, enjoying a democratic mandate, it must have been an excruciatingly devastating experience to be cajoled into agreeing of the fact of their not being in effective charge of many parts of their country. For the Indian authorities too, it was a delicate decision to agree to suspend the season of belligerence, the Lok Sabha polls are proximate enough and political adversaries could have attempted to condemn the tacit understanding reached with Pakistan as an unjustifiable climbdown injurious to the nations dignity. American diplomacy triumphed once more; what a relief, the Bharatiya Janata Party leaders chose to play along. The BJP actually can have no mental reservations in joining the concordat against global terror. It has its pet theory about saboteurs at home, and the kith and kin of these saboteurs across the border. If, along with the Taliban, the LeT too could be given a bloody nose, Kashmir, in the reckoning of the BJP, would be safe for India.         
	This grand arrangement between the Indian and Pakistani establishments, under the benign overlordship of the Americans, has other ramifications as well. The US is passing through trying financial times. The Obama administration has its hands full even as it tries to ride out the economic crisis; resources have to be harnessed and carefully disbursed with the object of saving the nation from the prospect of an economic downslide that would equal, or even surpass, the Great Depression of the 1930s. It would be thankful for whatever help, big or small, its strategic partners might provide. It would suit its interests if, while its own defence budget is kept on leash, strategic partners like India and Pakistan raised their defence spending. A gesture of this nature on their part would not only ensure the satisfactory conduct of the war against the Taliban, it would offer some subsidiary advantages as well.        
	For instance, Indias defence spending has always had a high import content; the bulk of the proposed increase in its defence outlay is bound to help the military-industrial complex in the US gain some extra breathing time. Indias politicians need not feel unhappy either; when international arms dealers sign contracts, it is standard practice for them to set aside a commission of 10 per cent or thereabouts for the parties offering the contracts. The issue of H1-B visas should not be allowed to intrude into this happy picture. It would also be lse majest to ask how that alien outfit, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, could acquire the right to grill Indian citizens right on Indian soil.              
	Everything falls to its place and the outcome might be certified as a genuine non-zero-sum game. Difficulty arises only when likely developments over the longer run are taken into account. Iraq remains a disaster. In Afghanistan, despite fresh infusion of American troops, the puppet regime of President Hamid Karzai has a tenuous toehold in Kabul, and nowhere beyond. Things are deteriorating so fast in Pakistan that Islamabads reign could soon be reduced to less than nominal, not only in the North West Frontier Province and Balochistan, but over sizeable segments of Punjab too; Saudi money, made generously available to important mosque functionaries, might not be able to stem the Taliban tide for long. And if Pakistan remains wobbly, the no-mans land between the Taliban and those arraigned against it  the so-called international community united against global terror  could simply disappear. Or, rather, the no-mans land could shift steadily eastward and penetrate well into the territory of India. That apart, the warriors who have joined together to fight global terror deserve to be forgiven if they occasionally mix up their text and target what some people describe as Islamic terror; that kind of mishap could set in motion untoward reactions. To forget the fact that, of all countries in the world, India commands the largest Muslim population and their sentiments and susceptibilities are to be shown due respect in all seasons, would be a major catastrophe.         
	It would be fatuous to suggest to decision-makers in New Delhi that they should look before they leap. But is it too much for this nation to expect at least some candour from those who aspire to lead it? Is there not even one political maverick who, defying the wrath of the patriotic lobby, would dare to expose the goings-on as what these truly are: eradicating poverty, malnutrition and illiteracy is no longer at the top of our agenda; fighting the Taliban, as loyal subservient of the hegemonic power, is. The proposed rise in defence spending in the vote-on-account budget is one-and-a-half times the total annual outlay for the nations rural employment guarantee programme.

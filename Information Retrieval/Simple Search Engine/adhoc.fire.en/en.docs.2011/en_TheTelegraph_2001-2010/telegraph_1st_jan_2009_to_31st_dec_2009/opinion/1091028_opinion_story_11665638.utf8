	The world may be a smaller place, but the twain still do not meet. Certainly not with the language, as the very sophisticated Naveen Patnaik, the chief minister of Odisha, ne Orissa, learnt to his chagrin. The sound and, one dares to add, the fury of Eastern languages have no immediate equivalents in English. The founder of Pakistan simplified the problem, as with other issues in his life, by replacing the letter Z with the letter J. Across the border, the other father of the nation still bears the cross since the Roman alphabets do recognize the nasal sound. The pundits solved this by using science: elaborate diacritical marks that are of no use in practical life. Thus, many distortions in the way Indian names and words are written and pronounced in English have been sought to be addressed in many different ways. Most have sought to invoke national pride: Chennai for Madras or Mumbai for Bombay. As in everything else, Bengal confounded the issue worst by replacing the C of Calcutta with a K. And nobody has found out why the rulers in Patna still persist with Bihar instead of the more correct Vihar. One does not have to be an adherent of Hindutva to discover that Mr Patnaik is no ordinary politician. Anybody else would have named the state Kalinga. But that would have been obvious and therefore ordinary. Mr Patnaik has chosen phonetics over politics. His government has put forward the proposal that the name of the state should now be written as Odisha. This is nearest to the correct rendering without using diacritical marks: a dot under the d. Mr Patnaik has suggested a phonetical correction. He has killed a political bird with wile and wisdom.         
	There is a larger, and perhaps more profound, point. The decision will force some people at least to think about the nature of language and of transliteration. It cannot be denied that the Oriental languages  or the non-Roman ones, as they are known as in the trade  succeed in conveying a wider range of sounds. The number of alphabets in Sanskrit that convey the various sounds of the letter S is an example of this. It is too optimistic to even think that the West will break out of its straitjacket of 26 alphabets. Thus, the problems of transliteration from Indian languages to English  and more generally from non-Roman to Roman languages  will continue to haunt the purist. Mr Patnaik has taken the right direction without falling into the trap of the popular rhetoric. He deserves a pat on the back.

	Q: Our father has filed an eviction suit against our eldest brother and his family, asking them to vacate our residential property. The case is sub-judice at the moment. What can he do now to legally ensure that his eldest son cannot stake a claim to the property after his death? As of now, there is no will or any other instrument regarding the disposal of the property.        
	Subhasish Dutta, Calcutta                
	A: If your father does not desire that his eldest son should inherit his property, it is extremely important for him to make a will ensuring that the same is registered. Then, after your fathers demise, it will become difficult for your brother to challenge that will.              
	Q:I am staying in a house rented by my parents since 1956. My father expired in 2005. My mother is now staying with my elder brother in another state. I am living in the house with my family. I have been paying rent without default but no rent receipt has been issued to me since my fathers death. I do not have any other dwelling. Can I be evicted by the landlord?        
	Name Withheld                
	A: Though you have inherited the tenancy of your father, as per the West Bengal Premises Tenancy Act, you are entitled to remain in the premises for only five years after the demise of your father. That you are not being issued a rent receipt is a serious matter and it may go against you when your landlord files a suit for eviction against you.         
	Q:Our company had taken the first floor of a house on rent for use as an office. After we vacated the premises, the landlady refused to refund the security deposit, citing damages to the floor. She refuses to accept any normal wear and tear, as this was not mentioned in our agreement. We have not paid rent for two months, thereby adjusting a part of the deposit. For the balance, we sent a notice of arbitration (as per the agreement) by registered post but the landlady has not received it. What are our options now?        
	R.R. Pattanayak, via e-mail                
	A: If there is a clause in your agreement that the security deposit could be adjusted in lieu of any damage to the rented premises or against the rent, then your landlady is within her rights to adjust the same. But in the absence of any such clause you can claim the refund of the security deposit. In that case, since you have already sent her a notice of arbitration, you can go ahead with the proceedings of arbitration claiming the security deposit.

	It is significant that as Europe celebrates the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, another long-standing plan for unification has finally come into force. The Treaty of Lisbon that was signed in 2007 to restructure the workings of the European Union has been ratified by all the member-states after prolonged, and often stormy, negotiations. It had been hoped that a treaty like this would not only make the EU more democratic but also make its inner workings more transparent. Noble as the intention sounds, it was notoriously difficult to get all parties to agree to it. It is a rather adventurous dream to bring all of Europe under a common umbrella. The age-old tension of bigger, and more prosperous, nations becoming supremacist and dominating the smaller states survives in this day and age. Debates over the legitimacy of including culturally disparate nations like Turkey in the EU have revealed deep-seated racial apprehensions. Add to this the skewed ideological axis of Europe, and a politically coherent EU appears to be wishful thinking.        
	It is not surprising therefore that the passing of the Treaty of Lisbon has put a fresh challenge before its architects. The immediate task now is to choose the president of the European Council and a representative for foreign policy, who would preferably be someone with a lot of experience and clout. Tony Blair has been suggested as the ideal candidate for the first position, while David Miliband is a favourite for the second one. The matter, thus put, looks simple and obvious. However, that is not to be so. Mr Blairs role in the Iraq war and his Labour origins have disqualified him. There is a strong hint that the foreign policy expert should be chosen from one of the less hegemonic nations. So, beyond the question of capabilities, political affiliation and nationality have become all important in determining the choice. Ironically, this all-out squabbling goes on to emphasize the tenuousness of the idea of a united Europe. Treaties do look good in theory but can be notoriously difficult to execute.

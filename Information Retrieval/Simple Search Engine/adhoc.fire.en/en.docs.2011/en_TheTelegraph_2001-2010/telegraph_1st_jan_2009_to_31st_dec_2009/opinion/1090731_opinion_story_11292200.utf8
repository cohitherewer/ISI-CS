	Smoke alarm                  
	Sir  It seems that the state government always finds a ploy to delay the implementation of court orders. This is evident from the present debate over the number of old vehicles to be taken off the roads from August 1 (Before ban, a number riddle, July 26). The state transport department, the city police and the public vehicles department are not being able to reach a consensus on this subject.          
	Even if the ban is implemented before the number of errant vehicles has been finalized, its efficacy in reducing pollution will be limited. This is because most of the polluting vehicles plying Calcuttas streets are either unregistered or have false papers to hoodwink the law-enforcement authorities.          
	The state government has done almost nothing ever since the high court directed it to ban vehicles that are over 15 years old. If the government had been serious about the ban, then action to phase out the vehicles should have started earlier, in keeping with the recommendations of the Bhure Lal committee.           
	Are the police and the state transport department adequately equipped to deal with the task of taking off the polluting vehicles? It remains to be seen how the state government tackles the violence that may break out when the ban is put into place. In all probability, it is the public that will bear the brunt of the inconveniences caused by an inept government.          
	Yours faithfully,        Prabhakar Bhattacharya, Ichapore, North 24 Parganas              
	Sir  The transport minister, Subhas Chakraborty, needs to be congratulated for not yielding to the transport unions efforts to buy time from the judiciary and so delay the phasing out of old commercial vehicles. These unions have long enjoyed the Centre of Indian Trade Unions protection, and have been flouting the laws with abandon.          
	Pollution test centres have hardly been able to maintain their credibility as a number of smoke-belching vehicles wield pollution-clearance certificates. They are as much to blame as the transport operators for the pollution. The pollution control department should carry out random checks on vehicles. If there is any irregularity, the test centres should be pulled up. Drivers of public vehicles should also be made aware of the danger they are exposing themselves and the commuters to.          
	A few days back, the government and the Opposition led by the Trinamul Congress got together in an effort to foil the high court directive without a care for the citizens health. It is ridiculous that ramshackle vehicles should constitute the backbone of a citys transport system. It was last year that the court had directed the state government to phase out the old vehicles. The government was reluctant to enforce the ban and cited the Lok Sabha elections as an excuse. Now the elections are over but the government is yet to act.           
	So far the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the Citu had indulged the transport operators by accommodating all their misdeeds for the sake of votes. And now the government finds the operators impossible to control. Many of them think that they can blackmail the government into allowing them to run the dilapidated vehicles.           
	The task of phasing out the vehicles would have been easier if the public vehicles department had stuck to strict parameters for declaring a vehicle roadworthy. Unfortunately, in West Bengal, the corrupt administration, in collusion with the trade unions, has always tended to overlook irregularities.           
	The government should not back out even if transport unions threaten to strike again. At the same time, quotations from new transport operators may be invited to start the process of replacing the junk vehicles.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Subhankar Mukherjee, Borehat, Burdwan              
	Sir  The cartoon of the judge hammering the head of the transport minister, Subhas Chakraborty, was appropriate, and humourous too (Do it now, says court, July 25). All these years, the chief minister and his ineffective transport minister have neglected the fundamental right of Calcuttans to breathe pollution-free air. One hopes that due weight will now be given to the Calcutta High Courts ruling on this matter.           
	Yours faithfully,       
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

                
	Parting shot          
	Sir  The Delhi Metro Railway Corporation has at last taken action against Gammon India, the contractor that built the defective girder whose collapse killed six workers (Blacklist notice to Gammon, July 30). The decision to blacklist Gammon India was a wise one. But it should be recalled that the faulty pillars were cast in front of the DMRC engineers. Punishing the contractor cannot absolve the DMRC of blame.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Kunal Das, Haldia

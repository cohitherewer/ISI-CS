	Pretty sane   
	A man was killed by another while both were admitted to a jail hospital. The accused had been admitted there as he was found to be murmuring to himself like a lunatic. Section 84 of the Indian Penal Code provides that an act committed by a person of unsound mind is not an offence as he is not capable of appreciating its nature. But the plea of the accused that he was of unsound mind was discarded and the trial court convicted him. The Bombay High Court upheld the judgement and the accused went to the Supreme Court. Dismissing the appeal, the latter held that partial delusion did not establish unsoundness of mind. It added that since the evidence of doctors stated that the accused was not mentally ill at the time of murder, his acquittal was not justified. (Siddhapal Kamala Yadav vs State of Maharashtra)  
	Too young        
	 The Foreign Liquor Rules (Kerala) prohibits the granting of liquor licence to any establishment located within a certain distance from educational institutions. A hotel was refused liquor licence on the grounds that a medical college mens hostel was located within the prohibited area. The hotel filed a writ petition, stating that the mens hostel was not an educational instit-ution. It also challenged the method of measuring the distance. A single bench of the Kerala High Court, however, held that the hostel was part of an educa-tional institution. But it also directed that the distance be measured once more. When the hotel appealed to the division bench, it held that since the inmates were students, the hostel should also be treated as an educational institution and be kept away from a place that serves liquor. (State of Kerala vs Vijaya Kumar)        
	Voice of reason              
	 In a murder case, the accused were sentenced to life imprisonment in a lower court. The Madras High Court directed the acquittal of the accused as it doubted the evidence of the witnesses. The incident had occurred in darkness and the witnesses claimed to have heard the voices of the accused. The state challenged the order of acquittal. Dismissing the appeal, the Supreme Court held that since the accused were unknown to the witnesses, they could not have identified the accused by voice alone.

	SOLON

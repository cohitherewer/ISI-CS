The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | not the lefts cloth
                                                                                                                 NOT THE LEFTS CLOTH                                                          
	Handloom and khadi are now chic. There was a time when, under the inspiration of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, they were the weapons of the weak against imperialist exploitation and industrialism. Gandhi invoked khadi as a way of life to project his vision of individual self-sufficiency and also to hit at British business interests. It was his unique riposte to the British destruction of Indian handicrafts, especially of the cotton spinning and weaving industry. The charkha or spinning wheel became the symbol of Indian nationalism. This was consistent with Gandhis overall ideology, which was against the process of modernization and wanted to hark back to the self-sufficient village republics of ancient India. But when communists raise the banner for khadi, it comes as a complete surprise. The ideology of communism is closely linked to the Enlightenment vision of progress. In this march of progress, capitalism or industrialization marked a significant advance on the pre-capitalist forces of production.         
	Karl Marx and communists after him have hailed the triumphs of technology as instruments that unshackled the relations of production. Thus, while Marx noted the destruction of the pre-capitalist cotton industry of India under the impact of British rule, he did believe that British rule was the unconscious tool of history, which brought India out of many years of stagnation. It is difficult to see Marx and his followers as advocates of khadi.        
	In India, everything acquires the character of a hybrid. Communists have come to be influenced by traditional notions of tyaga or sacrifice and by Gandhian ideas of austerity and simplicity. Thus, the Left Front government in West Bengal is organizing a fashion show in Calcutta to show-case khadi and the handloom industry. It is being said that this show, in which well-known fashion designers are expected to participate, will provide a fillip to khadi, which is now dying. The whole project is fraught with contradictions. Why should those who swear by communism promote khadi and speak on behalf of the handloom industry? Is it because the Left has failed to mobilize large-scale industries in West Bengal? If this is the reason, then the enthusiasm for khadi is no more than an afterthought, and worth nothing in terms of sincerity. Khadi has merely descended to being another item in the populist menu card.        
	The other contradiction lies in the fact that khadi today is a rich mans commodity. It is expensive, and therefore a niche product. It is not something that champions of the poor should promote. It is thus clear that in more ways than one the communists in West Bengal have started running down the wrong alley. Nothing will be achieved by the proposed fashion show. It will go down as yet another failed gimmick of the Left in West Bengal. The Left can ill afford another failure.

                                                                                                                 SEEN TO BE JUST AND FAIR                              The system of appointment to the higher judiciary in India needs a change, writes Sankar Sen, and alternatives have long been proposed                                                
	Recently, the Union law minister, H.R. Bhardwaj, while criticizing the present collegium system of judicial appointments, said that the judiciary, in its bid to retain its supremacy, tried to rewrite the law through the Supreme Court judgment in 1993. That had given them powers to appoint and transfer judges. According to him, merit has been ignored under the collegium system.         
	Article 124 of the Constitution vests the power of appointment of the Chief Justice of India and the judges of the Supreme Court in the president. The president shall make the appointment after consultation with the judges of the Supreme Court and of the high courts in the states that she deems necessary. The provision speaks of after consultation and not in consultation. In the case of the appointment of a judge other than the CJI, the chief justice will always be consulted. The appointment of high court judges is also made by the president after consultation with the CJI and the governor of the state.               
	From 1950, appointments of judges by governments have been broadly based on the recommendations of chief justices of the Supreme Court and the high courts, although in law, as then understood, power lay with the government in matters of appointment, except during the Emergency. It was rare for any appointment to be made without the chief justices concurrence.         
	S.P. Guptas case (known as the First Judges Case) dealt with the appointment of high court judges. The court by majority ruled that Article 217(1) of the Constitution places all the three constitutional functionaries on the same pedestal and there was no primacy given to the CJI. But this did not deal with the appointment of Supreme Court judges. In the Second Judges Case, in 1993, the Supreme Court ruled that the recommendation of the CJI, along with four of his seniormost colleagues, is final and the executive is bound to accept it. The court further held that the opinion of the chief justice (which means the opinion of the collegium) is determinative and binding of the president. According to one former CJI, the new meaning given by the Supreme Court amounts to virtually rewriting the relevant constitutional provisions. The new construction makes the Supreme Court and the high courts undemocratic. Even some of the former CJIs, who believed in giving power exclusively to judges, have revised their opinion in favour of the national judicial council.         
	In Britain, appointments of judges are made by the Lord Chancellor, who is the head of the judiciary and also a cabinet member. Nobody had questioned the independence of the British judiciary. But now voices expressing apprehension have been raised and an inquiry by the Bar Council of England headed by Iain Glidewell, a former Lord Chief Justice of Appeals, concluded that it was politically unacceptable for a member of the government to continue to appoint high ranking judges and recommended that an independent appointment board take over that role. In Great Britain now, the chairman of the judicial appointment commission, which selects candidates for judicial office, is headed by a layperson, according to British law.        
	In South Africa, under the new constitution, there is a judicial commission for the appointment of judges. The law minister is formally consulted and he does make comments on the appointees and recommendees of the judiciary that are considered with due respect and attention. In the United States of America, candidates aspiring to be judges of the federal court are grilled by the senate committee. The judiciary has no role in this. In Canada, the prime minister, in consultation with the justice minister, selects the federal court chief justice, and an independent judicial advisory committee selects the other judges.         
	A transparent procedure of selection has to be devised so that selected judges can command public confidence. The Malimath committee recommended that a set of guidelines be evolved regarding the relevant qualifications and attributes of character necessary to be a good judge, and also indicated the material from which this can be inferred. This may ensure that favouritism does not influence the selection. The committee said that it is more concerned about ensuring quality in appointment rather than who makes the appointment.               
	There is need for a national judicial commission. Matters connected with the appointments and misdemeanors of the higher judiciary should be dealt with by an independent body using transparent means instead of an unsatisfactory mechanism shrouded in secrecy. The national commission to review the Constitution strongly advised that a national judicial council be established. It proposed a national judicial commission comprising the CJI, the seniormost judge of the Supreme Court, the Union minister for law and justice and one eminent person nominated by the president after consulting the chief justice.         
	But the judges (inquiry) bill, introduced by the law minister two years ago, provides statutory teeth to the judiciarys controversial in-house procedure. By proposing a national judicial commission consisting of only serving judges, he has acceded to the judiciarys claim that processes ensuring accountability would compromise judicial independence. The fact remains that many of the corruption scandals in the judiciary can be traced to the secretive process of appointing judges. It is wrong to infer that the independence of judges requires that none but judges should deal with appointments, removal and so on.         
	The prime minister has said that the time has come for introspection regarding judges appointments for there is no doubt that the reputation of those who sit in judgment does shape our view of the judicial system. It is necessary to rethink the creation of the all India judicial service. In 1958, the first law commission suggested the constitution of an all India judicial service. The idea was that bright young law graduates successful in an all-India competitive examination should constitute the cadre and, after the prescribed training, would be posted in different states. This all-India service would then be the source of appointments to the higher judiciary on the basis of proven merit.

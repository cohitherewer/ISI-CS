The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | lost their shirt
                                                                                                                 LOST THEIR SHIRT                                                    
	Hydra-headed monsters sprout as many names as heads. Although the administrations of both the South Goa and North Goa districts have banned the Sri Ram Sena, right-wing passion is visible and active. It just operates under another name. A Russian woman in Mapusa became the target of the Hindu Janajagruti Samiti, which has been protesting against what it perceives as insults to Indian culture. Apparently, the Russian tourist had offended its aggressively righteous sentiments by wearing a T-shirt with Om inscribed on it. The HJS is protesting against shops selling T-shirts with images of deities or religious inscriptions on them.        
	It is not just the ignorant aggression of right-wing thugs, with whichever name they choose to decorate themselves, that is becoming increasingly common, but it is also the confused reaction of the representatives of the State that is alarming. This incident, for example, was not full-blown, organized, lawless violence against a community, as happened in Orissa not so long ago against Christians, while the police and administration sat idle. It was simply a tourist wearing a T-shirt. What is shocking is that the police brought her to the station upon complaints from the HJS, something they were surely not entitled to do. If this was for her protection, then other steps had to be taken. The incident fizzled out because neither side pressed charges. The startled tourist may just have wanted to leave the country fast. But if the HJS had made an official complaint, what would the police have done? Any diktat that goes in the combined name of majority religion and Indian culture somehow cannot be ignored. A state that depends largely on tourism for its prosperity, and has already banned one right-wing group, is yet willing to let its tourists go in order to appease a few thugs.

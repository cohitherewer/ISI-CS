                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        GOING DOWN                                                    
	If the developing countries start sharing responsibility, however differentially, for the fate of the planet, then the growth of Indian cities would have a special role to play in this change in attitude. And in this, transport management would have a great deal to do with cutting emissions. Calcuttas readiness to deal with this change is expectedly inadequate. Two kinds of civic indifference and mismanagement are the most obvious examples of this. First, the citys inability to rise above politics and corruption in order to get rid of old, polluting vehicles. Second, the increasingly dismal and dangerous condition of what, from the mid-Eighties, used to be the citys pride: the Metro Railway. Most recently, the imminent collapse of the entire ticketing system in the Metro has become symbolic of how poorly maintained and managed the whole show has been for a long time. Here too, as in many other spheres of dysfunctionality in the city, apathy and an acute lack of foresight are the main causes of deterioration. In terms of how it is run and maintained, how safe it makes commuters feel, and what it looks like, the Metro has become the grim underbelly of the citys civic identity  in spite of its recent, and much celebrated, expansion. In fact, it was the expansion that showed up how unfit the system had become to deal with every aspect of the increased reach and load.        
	Obstacles and delays are built into the history of the Metro, with the idea conceived in 1949 and operations beginning in 1984. So it is no surprise that the early warnings of the ticketing system going wrong were ignored, and even in a state of near collapse, the bureaucracy does not envisage a solution before July 2010. Meanwhile, the inconveniences mount and the dangers escalate. The underground is turning into some sort of a dank, uncertain and perilous underworld where only Tarkovskian stalkers, instead of 21st-century travellers, would feel at home.

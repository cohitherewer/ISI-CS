The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | The long wait for deliverance
                                                                                                                 THE LONG WAIT FOR DELIVERANCE                              THEATRE      Ananda Lal                                                
	After having lapsed into suspended animation for six years, Calcutta Performers has staged a comeback to Bengali theatre with a thoughtful production on family ties. The title of Surya Sens Bablu Kakhan Asbe? raises expectations of Waiting for Godot; almost every character in the dramatis personae asks this question, or variations of it, during the course of the play and the eagerly anticipated Bablu never turns up, until the very end, at which point his impending arrival appears to become reality. Consequently, we feel a sense of elation, even though we never get to see Bablu, compared to the complete uncertainty and sense of void in Godot.        
	Bablu is the youngest son of a retired widower who lives by himself in a town outside Calcutta, all his three sons and a daughter working elsewhere. Bablu has a reputation as the most considerate of the siblings, keeping in touch with the others, helping them whenever required, sorting out any problems  virtually a symbol of ideal humanity, perhaps even divinity. In contrast to what we hear of him, everyone else in the family seems selfish or flawed. The father, suffering from indifferent health, has called his children to him, presumably to settle the complicated matter of inheritance. One by one they come home, gradually revealing their interrelationships.        
	We encounter domestic dysfunction and neglect of parents quite regularly in Bengali theatre, commonly in the form of sentimentality or melodrama. Here, the director, Tamal Roy Chowdhury, carefully avoids these clichs, underplaying tensions and himself acting a father in control not only of his physical faculties but also of his wit. The first half, as he banters in English and Bengali with his doctor friend, a caregiver and his cook, has an airy and natural appeal. Despite the obvious situational parallel, we can hardly accept him as a contemporary King Lear.        
	Communication failure is much more noticeable in the next generation. The oldest son (Partha Mukhopadhyay) sounds shrewdly calculating. His wealthy wife (Sahana Sen) dominates him. The middle son (Debottam Majumdar), when drunk, spouts unpleasant home truths. The daughter (Nayana Palit) hides her unsavoury activities from the others. And a few flashbacks show us their devoted mother (Rumki Chattopadhyay) who favoured her eldest. All perform their roles credibly, except for Sudeshna Bandyopadhyay, whose bearing and saris look too sophisticated to make her believable as the nurse.

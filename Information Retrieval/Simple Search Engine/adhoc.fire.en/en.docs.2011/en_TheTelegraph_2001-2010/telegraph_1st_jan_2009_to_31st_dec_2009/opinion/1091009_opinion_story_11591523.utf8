	Misrule looks the same all over the world. A few years ago, a military-general-turned-president in Pakistan, in a desperate bid to retain his executive power, had sacked the nations supreme court bench, along with the chief justice, and suspended the constitution. After running the country in the spirit of a wayward cowboy for some time, the man was removed from the high chair through electoral defeat. The picture in the enlightened West, which swears by liberty, human rights and democracy, does not look much better. Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, may not be the leader of his national army, but he is a business tycoon  and that goes a long way towards securing unlimited power in an under-educated country like Italy. Mr Berlusconi has so far singlehandedly determined what citizens of his country should watch on television (undermining the judiciarys intervention at times). So, as with North Koreans or Thais, Italians too have been served a steady dose of propaganda by Mr Berlusconis centre-right party. They have been asked to admire the exalted motto of their prime minister  God, the motherland and the family  although a series of sex scandals, criminal cases and financial irregularities leave little reason for adulation. This state of affairs is not all that surprising: this is, after all, the land of Mussolini, a notorious womanizer and autocrat.        
	But at last Mr Berlusconis brazen confidence seems to have been somewhat shaken. Italys apex court has stripped him of immunity from prosecution (Mr Berlusconi had passed this law himself on coming to power). This is indeed a historic ruling. Not only does it uphold the equality of all Italian citizens before the constitution, but it also encourages absolute transparency and fairness in governance. India, where executive heads continue to enjoy many constitutional safeguards, and is presently in turmoil over the judges assets declaration, should take heed.

                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Losing shine                  
	Sir  Sunanda K. Datta-Rays article, No longer steel (April 4), brilliantly analyses how bureaucrats are slowly but surely drifting towards politics. Those who remain in service get plum postings once they become the yesmen of ministers. Neera Yadav, with the corruption cases hanging over her head, had to resign. Otherwise, she would have had to face an inquiry by the Central Bureau of Investigation.           
	Gautam Goswamis case is perhaps the most unfortunate. He was an extraordinarily brilliant officer, but had to toe the line of Sadhu Yadav, the brother-in-law of the former chief minister of Bihar, Lalu Prasad. Certain decisions Goswami had been forced to take because of Yadav went against him. He was jailed, only to be reinstated a short time before his untimely death. All this is taking India closer to a constitutional breakdown, which is bound to have its effect on the economic growth of the nation.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  I wonder what Sunanda K. Datta-Ray wants to prove in No longer steel. It is perhaps his idiosyncrasy that makes Datta-Ray expect that while people from all other vocations get on with their acts of impropriety, bureaucrats should remain paragons of virtue. We live in a country where politicians raise money on their birthdays, armymen receive kickbacks, police play marriage counsellors, teachers victimize students for refusing to take tuition from them (Pass tag for failed duo, April 1) and lawyers act as if they are above the law. Yet, we cannot bear to think that bureaucrats can show the traits of average Indians.           
	We should be thankful that there is at least a mechanism to bring errant bureaucrats to justice, unlike the other sectors, such as the media. Recently, there have been outrageous instances of impropriety in the media and yet no eyebrows were raised. In his article, No children to devour (Jan 10), Datta-Ray audaciously commented that Nandigram and Singur are only the latest instances of mobs overriding good sense. He forgot that in a democracy one needs to keep faith in the people and the system. Does he think that the people of Nandigram and Singur, who voted against the ruling Left indicating their rejection of its industrialization drive, are all idiots?           
	Datta-Ray has little understanding of the polity. Otherwise he would have displayed a better understanding of the issue instead of calling bureaucrats mercenaries. Institutions like the Election Commission are still run by bureaucrats and continue to win laurels for efficiency.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sharp shooter           
	Sir  Sivathanu Pillais tryst with the BrahMos has brought a new vigour to the missile project of the Defence Research and Development Organization and given an extra edge to the armed forces. The report, Missile Man pierces army apathy (April 4) is an eye opener to the state of affairs in the defence ministry. Were scientists of the DRDO actually apprehensive about the success of the BrahMos-II or were there other compulsions at work as well?           
	For quite some time the army has been trying to procure Tomahawks or its equivalent, and high level teams are reported to be already on a shopping spree. It is obvious that the army top brass has lost faith in the DRDO scientists because of the tardy progress of their research programmes related to defence hardware. The security scenario in the subcontinent is changing fast and there is no doubt that the DRDO has been unable to keep pace with the technological demands of the armed forces. Limited resources and political apathy have often had their part to play in this. Had it not been for Pillais tireless perseverance, the BrahMos-II too would have been dumped and the country would have had to spend millions in foreign currency in the name of national security but to the benefit of middlemen.           
	The Indian army is said to have finally settled for this supersonic land cruise missile after being overawed by its capability. However, the Indian navy is yet to make one of its submarines available to test the underwater version of the BrahMos-II. This shows that Pillai may still face roadblocks before his brainchild is finally inducted into the countrys weaponry. Nevertheless, Pillai should not be denied the accolades he deserves for adding a new dimension to modern warfare by giving a conventional warhead a nuclear destructive capability minus its adverse effects. His achievement is bound to put Indias neighbours under caution.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  Although Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited offers broadband at a cheap rate, the quality of its service is very poor. I have a Rs 500 combo plan, under which I am given 1.5 GB broadband usage at 2 MBs per second, and 175 free calls a month. I am also offered unlimited night-time surfing from 2.00 am to 8.00 am. But these are in name only because on most days the broadband link is either unavailable during night or else the download speed is so low that it takes hours to download even sample files.There have been many occasions when I got up early in the morning just to download softwares but ended up doing nothing. All our complaints have fallen on deaf ears. The BSNL employees do not seem to be bothered about these problems. When BSNL is trying to compete with private companies, it should realize that merely providing new offers would not attract customers. It needs to upgrade its infrastructure and ensure quality service.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Kumar Abhishek, Jamshedpur

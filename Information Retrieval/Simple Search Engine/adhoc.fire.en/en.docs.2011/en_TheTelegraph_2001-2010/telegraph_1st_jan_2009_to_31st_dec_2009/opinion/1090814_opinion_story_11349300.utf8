	The history of the making of New Delhi is safely stored in the vaults in London, writes Pramod Kapoor, who has provided the concept and visual research for NEW DELHI: MAKING OF A CAPITAL (Roli, Rs 1,975) by Malvika Singh and Rudrangshu Mukherjee. This is a serious, but handsomely designed, work of history that brings together a wealth of hitherto unpublished photographs, seminal historical documents (official papers, architectural plans and drawings as well as private correspondence) and clippings from the British and Indian media to present the richly layered story of the planning and building of Indias capital city. The central paradox of modern Delhi  that it embodies imperial power and munificence as well as democracy at its most spectacularly complex  becomes, therefore, a way of understanding the origins of Indian modernity in the early decades of the 20th century.    
	Mukherjees essay looks at the circumstances that led to the shifting of the imperial capital from Calcutta to Delhi in 1911. This was not only a strategic move, prompted by what the rulers had learnt about the ruled from the experience of the revolt of 1857 and the partition of Bengal, but also a symbolic one that cunningly established a vital continuity between the Mughal and the British empires. The story of the eclipse of Calcutta is thus inextricable from that of the emergence of Delhi. Bengali opinion about this degradation of Calcutta, wrote The Times, is marked by ominous reservations. Malvika Singh infuses her lively survey of the actual planners, architects and builders (British as well as Indian) with a Dilliwalis long and passionate involvement with, and attachment to, her city. Her account of how each element of the imperial plan evolved leads to a robust critique of Delhis keepers today and their indifference to notions of urban conservation. (This is also why Delhis history remains better preserved in the vaults in London than in the Indian archives.)        
	They are very, very different, wrote the architect, Edwin Lutyens, about the Indians he was sent to survey before planning a capital for them, and my ultra wide sympathy with them cannot admit them on the same plane as myself.... The very ether of their planes is different from ours and for one or the other to leave his plane is unclean and unforgivable. And his wife, Emily, while motoring around the tombs in the Durbar site saw wonderful things full of strange ideas and stranger ghosts.

In top right, a motorcar and a bullock cart are framed together near the enclosure around the fountains at the edge of the Great Place. Bottom right shows the massive rocks of Raisina Hill that had to be blasted to build the houses of government.                
	Malvika Singh is a columnist for The Telegraph, of which Rudrangshu Mukherjee is the editor, editorial pages.

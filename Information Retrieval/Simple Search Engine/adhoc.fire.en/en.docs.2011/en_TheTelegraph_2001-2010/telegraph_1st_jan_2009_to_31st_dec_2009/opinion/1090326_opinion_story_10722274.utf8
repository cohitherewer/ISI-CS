                                                                                                                 NOTHING NEW                                                    
	Bengal has long been home to lost causes and discarded ideas. The long reign of the communists in the state is the most significant political example of this. Mamata Banerjee now wants to carry on that tradition. She has been trying for nearly a decade to dislodge the communists from power. But her partys manifesto for the coming Lok Sabha elections shows how hopelessly she is trapped by the rhetoric of her rivals. If this newspaper described it as Comrade Mamatas communist manifesto, it was because it was impossible to characterize it in any other way and do justice to it. The manifesto was for the parliamentary elections, which will give the country the next government at the Centre. The policies Ms Banerjees party would like that government to follow are fundamentally similar to those traditionally advocated by the Left. In essence, these are the old socialist policies that are now generally accepted as the reason for the lost decades in Indias economic development. These archaic policies put the State sector first in everything  agriculture, industry, healthcare and education  and banished capital and private entrepreneurship to the periphery. The result was there for all to see: a wasteful and inefficient public sector and the so-called Hindu rate of growth. Ms Banerjees manifesto ignores the changes that now mark the Indian economy. Worse, it is a call to return to the failed socialist experiments.         
	True, an election manifesto is often no more than that. Its only aim is to help the party garner votes. Ms Banerjees party is not alone in using the election manifesto to pander to populist sentiments and make unrealistic pledges. She has a more important reason for doing so. She obviously thinks that stealing the Lefts thunder could be a good election strategy. But communists now aggressively woo capital, especially in Bengal and Kerala where they run the governments. Anti-capitalism no longer wins elections, even in communist-ruled states. Ms Banerjees manifesto, too, may not enthuse Bengals voters about her economic agenda. If anything, it will raise suspicions about her approach to the states economic development. Released on the day the Nano car was launched in Mumbai, the manifesto actually has revived memories of her anti-industrialization campaign over the past two years. It is not just bad economics, it is also bad poll propaganda.

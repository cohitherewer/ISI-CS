                                                                                                                 GROWING PAINS                                                     
	A rising nation inspires both admiration and suspicion. If it happens to be a dictatorship, fear and distrust far outweigh other sentiments. That pretty much seems to be the free worlds response to the rise of New China, as it celebrates the 60th anniversary of its founding. Not even the worst critics of Chinas communist rulers would deny them credit for its stunning economic success. Since Deng Xiaoping unshackled Chinas economy in 1978, it has seen perhaps the most dramatic scale of wealth creation in human history. Even by conservative estimates, some 400 million people have been lifted from abject poverty in these three decades. The countrys foreign exchange reserve today stands above one trillion dollars. Chinas holdings of American treasury bonds, the largest by any country, are over $800 billion. Yet, Chinas rulers are an insecure lot, as the massive security drill in Beijing for the National Day celebrations shows. For all their lip service to social harmony, they know how economic injustices and the repressive political system have together created deep fissures within Chinese society. Economic inequality in China is now among the worst in the world. So is corruption among the government  and party  officials. The anger at the system shows not only in periodic ethnic violence in Tibet and Xinjiang, but also in endless agrarian and industrial disputes.         
	It is this absence of freedom and the rule of law that makes the world wary of Chinas rise. It is denounced as a currency manipulator and a violator of intellectual property rights and other norms of fair trade. The boom in its economic growth has also seen Chinas pollution record rise dramatically. According to a World Bank estimate, the country is home to 16 of the 20 most polluted cities in the world. Last year, its greenhouse gas emissions surpassed those of the United States of America. Far worse, however, is the worlds worry over Chinas military ability and policy. Its economic growth has taken it to remote corners of the world in search of resources. But its search for strategic allies has seen China make clandestine deals with rogue states such as Pakistan, Iran, North Korea and Sudan. No wonder some policymakers in India can never forget the China threat. The rulers in Beijing must realize that a rising nation cannot win the worlds trust unless it earns the trust of its immediate neighbours.

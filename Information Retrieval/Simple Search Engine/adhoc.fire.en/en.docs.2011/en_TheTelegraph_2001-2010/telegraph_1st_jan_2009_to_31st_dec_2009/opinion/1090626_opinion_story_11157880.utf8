	Exchanges between India and Pakistan have often followed Newtons law  every action is met with an equal and opposite reaction. So it is not surprising that the news of arrest warrants being issued by India for the suspects of 26/11 should be met with news from Pakistan of the mercy petition of Sarabjit Singh being dismissed, for a second time, by the countrys supreme court. The last was made possible by the persistent absence of the defence lawyer, Rana Abdul Hamid, at the time of hearing. Mr Hamid was, allegedly, involved in another case assigned to him by the government, one which ended the same day the verdict was delivered. Evidently, the concern  prevention of the conflict of time and interests of the counsels  which prompted India to remove Mohammed Ajmal Kasabs previous lawyer from the case, is not shared by Pakistan.        
	The supreme court verdict on Mr Sarabjit Singhs petition against the death sentence does not damage his case any more than the acrimonious relations between India and Pakistan already have. Perhaps nothing can be more unfortunate than the course of justice and human lives being determined by the thaw and resurgence in the ties between nations. But that is how the peculiar trajectory of Mr Sarabjit Singhs case, and that of so many others in Pakistans and Indias prisons, seems to have been scripted. Mr Sarabjit Singh was convicted for the 1990 serial blasts in Pakistan and given the death sentence  appealed against in 2003 and 2006  by an anti-terrorism court, whose procedure has not been above question. Yet each time bilateral ties seemed to improve, the man and his family have found reason for hope. Hopes were highest when Pakistan released Kashmir Singh, another Indian convicted of spying, as power changed hands in the country last year. But the presumed lack of appropriate response from India, alongside the subsequent Mumbai attacks, appears to have spoilt Mr Sarabjit Singhs chances. His execution has been stayed for the time being (the supreme court verdict does not change that), but his chances of freedom will depend on the bargain Pakistan is able to strike with India on the latters treatment of suspects who are Pakistan nationals. Meanwhile, without consular access or proper legal aid, prisoners on both sides will remain victims of the whims of the men who manage the nations.

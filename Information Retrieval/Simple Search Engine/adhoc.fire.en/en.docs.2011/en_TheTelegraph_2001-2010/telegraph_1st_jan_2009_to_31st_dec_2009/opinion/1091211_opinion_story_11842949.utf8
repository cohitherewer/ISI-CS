	The Rest is Noise: Listening to the twentieth Century By Alex Ross, Picador, $18        
	When it came out in America, The Rest Is Noise had critics and readers humming enthusiastically. To this day, the paperback edition sits comfortably on New York bookstore tables among more recent publications  a fact that speaks of the vigour of classical music, but also of the delight of the 591-page-long exploration of Western composition in the 20th century. Faithful to his subtitle, Listening to the Twentieth Century, Alex Ross, The New Yorkers music critic, lends a thrilling soundtrack to a complicated and fractured one hundred years.        
	Reading the book is like entering a concert hall and waiting for the performance to begin. Ross makes us pay as close attention to the composition as to the tuning, when the oboe halts the cacophony of instruments rehearsing on their own and orders them to align themselves to its A. Ross imposes himself as the able conductor, confident, as John Cage observed, that noise is only noise when we choose to ignore it; once we start listening, it becomes something else. In his symphony of history, musical theory, anecdotes, and formal analyses, the main characters (the composers) are seen more often at the drawing table than in the orchestra pit, save for a handful of musical scandals wonderfully rendered here, the most celebrated being the first performance of Igor Stravinskys Rite of Spring in Paris in 1913  a revolution that also inspired jazz musicians and made black prodigies like Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong and Charlie Parker, who were denied Carnegie Hall on racial prejudice, the young Mahlers of Harlem with little to gain by going downtown.        
	The book begins with a scandal that never was: Richard Strausss audacious Salome, which opened in Vienna in 1906 and was an instant success. But Ross is not discouraged by the dramatic possibilities of this near-certain brawl evaporating into consensus. Rather, he turns to the audience: on this historic evening, he spots Giacomo Puccini, Gustav Mahler, Arnold Schoenberg, possibly Adolf Hitler, and the fictional Adrian Leverkhn of Doktor Faustus, invited by Thomas Mann in his tale of a composer in league with the devil.        
	The ghosts of Doktor Faustus and Gustav Mahler remain present throughout the journey: Faustus as a forewarning, Mahler as the transcending figure. A rival and friend of Strauss and briefly the New York Philharmonic star, Mahler, who died at the age of 50 in 1911, is the timeless visionary inspiration with an exceptional ability to dramatize his inner life, who contested Sibeliuss rigid formalism and declared, The symphony must be like the world. It must be all embracing.        
	Ross nods to Der Mahler and dives deep into the noise of the times he describes. In Weimars Berlin, where music told deeper truths about human society, composers like Kurt Weill and Hanns Eisler kept their windows open and their ears close to the ground. This exercise in empathy is particularly remarkable when addressing the 20th centurys darkest hours. Loath to judge Strauss for his collaboration with Hitler, or Shostakovitch and Prokofiev for theirs with Stalin, as they struggled to maintain their poise as the world spun around them, Ross reminds us of the terrifying morass of the time as he untangles the composers motivations from their doubts. The power of music seeped through every crack: music was played in Auschwitz; Shostakovitch performed his legendary Leningrad Symphony on the Russian front, for which a few soldier-musicians died of hunger; Messiaen created his Quartet for the End of Time at the prison camp, Stalag VIIIA. Meanwhile, before Hitler fretted about conductor Wilhelm Furtwnglers bunker to shelter him from the bombs, a prodigious bunch of composers and conductors had the foresight to get out of Europe and embark for America, most of them landing in Los Angeles. There they would lend their talents to cinema, and soon an actress could hardly serve a cup of coffee without having fifty Max Steiner strings swoop in to assist her. Thus we find Schoenberg, Stravinsky, Eisler, Rachmaninoff, Hindemith and Bartk listening to Shostakovitchs Leningrad Symphony broadcast under the peaceful Hollywood sun.        
	If composition was never to be the same thereafter, it was also because of Schoenbergs invention of twelve-tone music before the wars in 1906. While Strauss wrote to Alma Mahler that Schoenberg would be better off shoveling snow than scribbling on music paper, Ross reassures us that if we find the chromatic scale, unsettling if revolutionary, to be agony for the ears (with its 479,001,600 permutations, according to Ross), that is purely physiological: studies have demonstrated that certain intervals attack the nerve endings while others have a calming effect. But Ross is committed to making the reader go beyond personal taste, beyond what will delight one group and give a headache to the other. He suggests we consider Alban Berg the way in which we think of those paintings by Turner and Monet in which familiar forms are buried under layers of impasto paint. A man of his time, Ross has brilliantly set up a therestisnoise.com website: a giant audio guide where one can easily navigate across musical illustrations, which also shed light on Rosss formal analysis of a score.        
	The irreverent Pierre Boulez conceded that in the Fifties we did not take sufficiently into account the way music is perceived by the listener. Hailed today as one of the greatest conductors, he must have made his peace with the listeners. The Schoenberg school, determined never to look back, found disciples in Berg, Boulez, Glass, Cage and Reich. They in turn handed it over to the Beatles or the Velvet Underground, whose psychedelic and electronic experimentations gave rise to Tom Waits, Lou Reed, David Bowie and Bob Dylan.        
	To those who did look back, Ross devotes marvellous chapters. The one on Benjamin Britten is as moving and melancholy as a Caspar David Friedrich painting. The one on John Adams  defusing any doubts one might have had about the future of the borderless and continuous landscape that is classical music  offers one of the more hopeful (and musical) poetic flares of the book: working in his Mahlerian cabana in Northern California, John Adams stares at the floor, cupping his chin in his hand. Then he goes back to work, chipping away at the silence of everything that remains to be composed.

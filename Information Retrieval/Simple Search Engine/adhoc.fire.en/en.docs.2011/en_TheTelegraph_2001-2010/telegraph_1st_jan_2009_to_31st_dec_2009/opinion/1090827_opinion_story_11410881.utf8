The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Salvaging the protocol
                                                                                                                 SALVAGING THE PROTOCOL                          - Over climate change, the battle lines are clearly drawn					 					      BHASKAR DUTTA                                                      
	The red carpet was certainly rolled out for Hillary Clinton during her recent visit to India. She was fted, wined and dined, so much so that there were some caustic queries about whether we had moved back in time to the colonial era. But one man stood out in the midst of this sycophancy. Jairam Ramesh, the state environment and forests minister, told her very bluntly that there is simply no case for the pressure faced by India to reduce carbon emissions since India was amongst the worlds lowest emitters on a per capita basis.        
	Ramesh was, of course, reiterating the official position of China, India and other developing countries on the issue of climate change and how best to coordinate the international communitys response to the increasing levels of carbon emission. Every country recognizes that something needs to be done because there has been a sharp acceleration in aggregate carbon emissions during the last decade  the increase in emissions has been 3 per cent since 2000, compared to just 1.1 per cent during the 1990s. Unfortunately, there is no consensus at all about how to control emission.         
	The battle lines are very clearly drawn between the developed and the developing countries. The former group point out that they are now using both increasingly energy-efficient technology and cleaner sources of energy such as electricity. This has enabled them to effect significant reductions in emission. Some of the greener countries have also set very ambitious goals  for instance, the United Kingdom targeted a 20 per cent reduction of carbon emission from 1990 levels by 2010. Although this target will not be achieved, the mere stipulation of an ambitious target is taken to be a sign of good intentions. The developed countries also contend that emission levels have been rising very sharply in the developing countries.               
	The main culprit has been China. The rapid growth of the Chinese economy, combined with its continued dependence on coal-fired power stations (particularly in the interior provinces), has ensured that China has now earned the dubious distinction of being the biggest emitter in the world  it dethroned the United States of America from this position in 2006. Emission levels in India have also been rising, and for pretty much the same reasons. What is more discouraging is that both countries seem likely to continue with their dependence on coal, although this is the dirtiest fuel.        
	Of course, the developing countries are not without their own ammunition. They contend, with more than a little justification, that it is the past actions of the developed countries which have brought about the degradation in the worlds environment. Over three-fourths of the cumulative anthropogenic carbon dioxide has still come from the developed countries. Also, the focus on aggregate emissions by individual countries is clearly not appropriate because it gives a misleading picture. The larger and more densely populated countries are bound to emit more carbon. Perhaps a more accurate picture is provided by comparisons of per capita emission levels. This comparison of per capita emission levels gives a completely different perspective. It turns out that the per capita emission level in China is only a quarter of that in the US.        
	Fortunately, the fight against climate change is not completely lost. Environment ministers and officials of almost 200 countries will meet in Copenhagen in early December in the hope that they can agree on a new treaty to replace the Kyoto protocol, the first phase of which expires in 2012. The main aim of the Copenhagen summit will be to hammer out an agreement on how to share the burden of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Climate scientists estimate that by 2050, the world must cut emission levels by 80 per cent, compared with 1990 levels, in order to ensure that global warming does not exceed two degrees centigrade.         
	Given the sheer magnitude of this task, it is clear that all the major countries will have to reduce emission levels  there is no way in which the aggregate emission levels can be reduced to required levels unless China, and to a lesser extent India, also cut back on emissions. This is, of course, a very costly exercise  the main reason why we use coal is because alternative sources of energy are several times more expensive. India simply cannot afford to foot the entire bill involved in exploiting, say, solar energy. The huge subsidies involved will essentially imply that the government will have to make drastic cuts in social-welfare spending and other development expenditures.        
	That is why several developing countries have been arguing that the developed countries must subsidize the costs incurred by the developing countries in reducing emissions. One school argues for this on welfare grounds  since all countries will benefit if global emission levels are slashed, it is the richer countries that must pay the bulk of the costs.               
	A more sophisticated argument puts forth the case that the developed countries have essentially outsourced carbon emissions to developing countries. That is, the emissions emanating from China are a consequence of the huge quantities of carbon-intensive manufacturing taking place in China for buyers in the West. Western consumers benefit since the goods imported from China and other developing countries are significantly cheaper than what these goods would have cost if they had been produced in the developed world. Why should the entire burden rest on the producers of these goods? Why should consumers not share the burden? There is more than a grain of truth in this argument, though perhaps it ignores the fact that the outsourcing of carbon emissions also benefits the developing countries through the creation of more jobs.        
	Some Western economists do acknowledge that the developed world must not only reduce their own emissions, but also provide incentives to the developing countries to cut emissions. Of course, there are also the hawks who rave and rant about the need to impose stiff penalties in the form of trade sanctions against those developing countries which do not cap carbon emissions. What is going to be crucial is the official American position. George W. Bush almost singlehandedly scuttled the Kyoto protocol. Fortunately, there seems to be a sea change in the attitude of the Obama administration. The US seems determined to implement stiff emission targets for the US economy. Perhaps, it can also be persuaded to subsidize the developing countries if they cap emissions.

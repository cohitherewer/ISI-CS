The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | To see the political future in the present
                                                                                                                 TO SEE THE POLITICAL FUTURE IN THE PRESENT                                  In spite of their unreliability and their high costs, prediction polls remain a favourite with the media and the people, writes Shiloo Chattopadhyay                          Facts and figures                                  
	Politicians hate facing any kind of poll  real or imaginary. They can do very little about the first or the second  polls to predict election results, they feel, are an unnecessary evil. They can neither ignore the results. Nor can they take cognizance of them publicly. The conflict translates into an expression of irritation.         
	What is their grouse? The results of these polls are unreliable. That they are. The outcome of prediction polls can be, and often is, inaccurate. If they were infallible, then there would be a strong case for using prediction polls to elect members of parliament rather than the hugely expensive one through the electronic voting machines.         
	On the other hand, despite their fallibility, election after election, media-owners are spending their hard-earned money on such polls. Election polling is not cheap. A round of national polling could easily set one back by a crore. In these days of recession and global meltdown, a national television channel would have had to spend crores on multiple rounds of these polls. Why this madness? It could simply be that the viewers love it. They do not bear any grudge if the polls do not come true. It is fast food for them  material of immediate consumption and zero hangover. Prediction polls are thus safe bets as programming content.         
	There is a more serious reason for the continuing popularity of prediction polls. On prime-time television, the politician may lambaste the findings of such a poll. He is, however, rarely confident enough to put forward an alternative figure. True, the political parties have their own estimates. The fear is that they are contaminated by the bias of the party. Journalists are the other group that know. Many of them argue that their assessments are often qualitative  necessarily judgmental and based on limited exposure to a beat rather than the big picture. So, the viewer may well feel that nobody really knows any better  the poll results are as good as any other. And the viewer tends to accept them as not wholly reliable but an honest and unbiased attempt to predict, much like the way he receives a weather forecast.         
	Prediction polls are thus faced with two extreme reactions  unthinking acceptance by the ordinary people and an equally cursory rejection by the politicians. They have not had the privilege of any serious debate. For instance, a question that has rarely been asked is whether prediction polling can become more accurate. Indeed, the situation is quite the opposite. No polling agency has shared in detail how a prediction poll is designed and executed. And, as we know, lack of familiarity often breeds suspicion.         
	Prediction polls come in two flavours  opinion polls and exit polls. Opinion polls are done before the elections. Interviews take place in respondents homes like any other sample survey. Exit polls, on the other hand, are conducted on the day of the election. The interaction with voters happen on the street, in a dummy booth created for the purpose. Both these exercises involve a fairly elaborate method of sampling  a process through which one reduces the risk of representing the views of many by talking to only a few.               
	The procedure starts with the selection of constituencies  very few prediction polls can cover all of them. The starting point is usually a state. The constituencies in a state are further grouped into smaller clusters or swing zones on the basis of their past electoral behaviour. From a swing zone, one constituency (chosen randomly with the help of a random number table) is usually covered in the poll.         
	The next task is to select voters who will be interviewed. This is done by first choosing three to four assembly constituencies from the seven or more that constitute a parliamentary area. Within an assembly constituency, a certain number of polling booths are chosen randomly. Randomly chosen (from the electoral rolls) addresses near a selected booth are used as starting points from where an interviewer commences his search for voters.         
	The interviewer has very little latitude about who he interviews. The starting point is prescribed. From there, he always moves to his right (called the right-hand rule  an arbitrary but hugely effective control procedure) and knocks on every alternate or third or fifth household depending on the spread required by the sample design. Within a household also the interviewer has a set procedure to choose one respondent amongst the eligible voters in a home. The polling agency usually has a multilayered control system to ensure that the interviewer does this as per the procedure laid down.         
	The voter is asked, in main, two simple questions who will you vote for? And who did you vote for the last time? What the pollster takes out from these two questions are not the straight answers but how many voted for a different party this time compared to the last election. Every party will have some arrivals and some departures. The net percentage is what is called the swing  in favour or against. The pollster now has a swing figure for each contesting party.               
	This swing he applies to the votes polled by a party in the previous election. The percentage gets augmented if the swing is positive, and is eroded if the swing is away from it. That is the result that is forecast of a constituency. The swing figure obtained from the constituency covered in the poll is applied to the past results of each of the other constituencies in the same swing zone. The rest is simple aggregation. Exceptions are made for atypical constituencies  an Amethi or a Darjeeling. They are handled specially and individually.         
	One of the oft heard criticisms about prediction polling is this: how can one predict the behaviour of 710 million voters by interviewing only 71 thousand of them? Obviously, interviewing 71 lakh voters instead will improve the accuracy. Apart from agreeing to that, no one really knows how many is good enough. It really does not depend on the size of the universe. That a national study for India will need more sample size than one for Italy is well known. That the Indian study will need more sample size than the Chinese one, because of higher heterogeneity of demographics, is, however, not as well appreciated. Most crucially, to answer how many are needed for the Indian study is really difficult. The issue is not 71 thousand versus 71 lakh. The more intelligent question is  how best can one choose these 71 thousand so that their views come closer to the millions who are not spoken to?         
	Statistical sampling methods have been devised to act as an insurance against bias  deliberate or unconscious. More importantly, they are also useful in combating ignorance about the character of the universe being studied. In the case of prediction polling, it is impossible for a soap and shampoo researcher to know the political nuances that exist in the various nooks and corners of the country. So he needs to rely on statistical sampling to avoid blunders. This does not necessarily result in the best possible sample. It merely guarantees against the worst possible sample.         
	The road to higher precision in a prediction poll is more informed sampling. Creation of swing zones, for instance, is at the very root of the accuracy of prediction polling. So are the choices of assembly constituencies and booths in them. This is where the politician, the journalist and the pollster can cooperate. The journalist and the politician have the knowledge. The pollster has the objectivity. It could create a very efficient and effective research design.               
	The moot point is why do all this? Good enough TRPs are already being produced. The real reason is greed. This collective designing of the poll by the leader, the reporter and the pollster could be done live. It could be a curtain-raiser programme before the next election.         
	Imagine watching intending MPs and seasoned correspondents jointly choosing booths in a constituency to predict the results. The polling agency then goes out and collects the swing data in the chosen booths. The swing analysis is done live on television, so is the derivation of the outcome, and the viewer gets to see every step. Indeed, such a programme can become yet another blockbuster reality show. It is not as utopian as it sounds. Politics is serious entertainment. We consume it.

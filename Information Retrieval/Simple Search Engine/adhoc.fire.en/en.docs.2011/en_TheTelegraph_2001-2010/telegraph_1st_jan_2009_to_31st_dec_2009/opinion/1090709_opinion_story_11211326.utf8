                                                                                                                 THUS CAPITAL                                                    
	What do they know of India, who only Delhi know? The question is not rhetorical. On the contrary, it is grounded in reality, and an unpleasant one at that. Indias capital always plays host to the really big events  like the Asian Games or the Commonwealth Games  and this is then made the pretext of pouring in enormous funds for developing and sprucing up the city. All other cities of the country, big and small, are starved of resources. The Asiad in 1982 changed the face of Delhi  cynics say that it transformed Delhi from an overgrown village into a city. The forthcoming Commonwealth Games, for which the Union budget for 2009-10 has made an allocation of Rs 3,000 crore, will see major developments that may make Indias capital into a world-class city of which all Indians will be asked to be proud. There is no harm in improving Indias capital, but when it is always done at the cost of the other cities, then the discrimination somewhat darkens the halo of pride.        
	The question that looms over the apparent discrimination is why Delhi should hog all the major international events. In Germany, the Olympics could be held in Munich; in the United States of America, they were held in Los Angeles. But in India, everything tends to get concentrated in Delhi. This is not a coincidence but a design. Apart from the other major cities like Mumbai, Chennai and Calcutta, there are other state capitals that could easily host major events and be helped with a huge infusion of Central funds. This would lead to the development of a large number of cities rather than one booming capital city. The development of state capitals would inevitably lead to the transformation of the hinterland of the particular city, if not of the entire state. The economic and social impact of such an enterprise would perhaps be greater than concentrating on just the countrys capital city. Surely, more modern and world-class cities will be a better source of national pride than one flourishing city that stands out in the midst of general deprivation. The point that Delhi hogs the limelight is not new. The redoubtable Mani Shankar Aiyar  often thought of in the corridors of power as incorrigible  had made the point. It had no takers. People who wield power in Lutyens Delhi have a propensity to think that India stops where the Ring Road begins.

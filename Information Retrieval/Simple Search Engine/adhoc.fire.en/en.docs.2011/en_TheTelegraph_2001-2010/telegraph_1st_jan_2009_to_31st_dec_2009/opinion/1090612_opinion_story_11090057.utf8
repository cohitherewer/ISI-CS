	Why yetis dont like pine forests        
	THE HOTEL AT THE END OF THE WORLD (Penguin, Rs 350) by Parismita Singh is a graphic novel with a title that brings to mind Neil Gaimans cult classic, Worlds End, which is part of his Sandman series. Whereas Gaimans unforgettable work wedded rivetting plots with equally stunning images, Singhs work, alas, is pictorially dull, and duller still in its storyline. The pen-and-ink visuals, which look badly smudged, are eminently forgettable, while the plot, if there is one, leads nowhere. Typically, Singh begins with a trope that is by now not only over-used but also hackneyed. A group of characters, each of them appropriately cranky, meet at the hotel at the end of the world. It does not take them long to start swapping stories, and no surprise, the tales are as weird as their tellers. Sadly, Singhs characters are neither much of an oddball nor are their testimonies all that strange. It takes a genius of Gaimans stature to turn an age-old literary form like the story-cycle into something rich and strange. Else, the outcome could be rather disastrous: neither novelistic nor graphic enough.                          
	THE lazy conman and other stories (Penguin, Rs 250) by Ajit Baral is a delightful collection of Folktales from Nepal. Like folktales from all over the world, the stories gathered here derive from a rich oral tradition. Typical characters like the clever wife or the wily fox appear here as well, but the regional inflections in themes are also evident. From these tales you would be able to learn Why Yetis Dont Like Pine Forests or even be entertained by the antics of Dhon Cholecha, the Miracle Ewe. The volume not only comes with an excellent introduction by the author, but the fine black-and-white illustrations by Durga Baral also place the stories in a human context.                        
	DIARY OF A JETSETTING CALL GIRL (Harper Perennial, Rs 295) by Tracy Quan follows two hugely bestselling novels  Diary of a Manhattan Call Girl and Diary of a Married Call Girl  by the same author. Going by the titles, if you expect sleaze then you will get plenty of it in Quans work. But what takes you by surprise is a Woody Allenesque sense of humour and a fondness for repartee. Nancy Chan is a high-class Manhattan call girl leading a truly unconventional life: not only does she have a constant influx of rich clients in her life, but also a married and increasingly suspicious husband. Things become even more complicated when one of her regulars, Milt, asks her out on a vacation in France, and Nancy starts having erotic dreams of Milts enigmatic cook, Duncan. Quite a heady cocktail no doubt, only one wishes the book were a little shorter than its nearly 250 pages.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | To amuse, not awe
                                                                                                                 TO AMUSE, NOT AWE                                  VISUAL ARTS - Somak Ghoshal                                                  
	I want [my art] to flourish (so to say) in a cloud of unknowing, K.G. Subramanyan explains in an interview, when asked about the process of his work. For a centipede like me to start counting my legs is suicidal, he elaborates in that distinctly witty yet acerbic manner of his, It will freeze me into inaction. It would be useful to keep these remarks in mind when you go to see Subramanyans Recent Works, showing concurrently at three city galleries (The Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre, Akar Prakar and Akriti Art Gallery, until July 19). The phrase, cloud of unknowing, is the ideal frame through which to look at Subramanyans imagery. It instantly conjures up that drifting restlessness which typically characterizes the traffic between the earthy and the ethereal in Subramanyans work. Then again, it is the artists self-description as an unselfconscious centipede that, more than anything, helps one make sense of the alarming profusion of paintings spread across the three galleries. There is indeed a self-forgetful frenzy about Subramanyans creativity  as if he is indulging in a Dionysian ritual that revels, quite unapologetically, in an endless proliferation of images.        
	The result of this outburst of artistic energy could tell badly on the viewers. And feeling somewhat dazed by the thickly-packed gallery walls is only one difficulty they have to deal with. Had some of this work gone beyond the now-familiar signature style of the artist, there would have been reason to engage with it anew. But although the innumerable paintings and prints and the occasional sculptures sprawled across this vast exhibition always please the eye, they do not inspire much more than bemused appreciation. Nothing to put your heart at peril, no cause for shock, awe or even wonder. If anything, much of what is on display seems to have been recycled from the artists earlier Seagull show some time back.        
	What this monotony implies is hard to say. Does it mean that the artist is now truly besotted with his favourite motif  the demon-slaying, many-handed goddess  to the exclusion of nearly all else? Or are these really his earlier works that have been pulled out of cold storage and packaged under that convenient label of recent works? Yet, there was plenty to admire in Subramanyans style until it became the signature style. A master of understatement, Subramanyan synthesized the best of European high modernism and the indigenous ethos of Santiniketan and Baroda to arrive at a visual language that was typically allusive, and all the more appealing for that. Picassos lines, the elegant brushstroke of Nandalal Bose, and the bold colours and broken forms of Benodebehari Mukherjee came together in a quiet harmony in Subramanyan. If this deep awareness of art history brought a sense of adventure into Subramanyans work, then it was his mastery of various media that gave the products of his imagination their excellence. One look at the terracotta mural displayed at Seagull is enough to gauge the skill and sophistication that went into its making. The painted head made of fibre glass becomes another striking digression from the sameness of the acrylics and the sketches, while the exquisite reverse paintings on mylar sheet stand out for their shimmering colours and texture.        
	Subramanyans artistry remains unquestionable: if anything, his work is a little too perfect, to the extent of appearing prettified and anodyne at times. By his own admission, his work has been variously classified as abstract, literary, decorative, witty, sensuous, celebrative, misogynic. This is a reasonably catholic description for the work of an artist immersed in teaching, talking about, and making art. But Subramanyans best work is no doubt in the humoresque mode, using gentle caricature, poking fun at lifes little ironies and forever engaged and amused by the battle of the sexes. The drawings in watercolour and wax pencil bear out the fullness of his sly curiosity. A girl with a jilted look on her face sits perched on a table, her flaming pudendum exposed, as a man with a sheepish grin stands in front of her as if apologizing for his flaccid member. Elsewhere, eroticism becomes charged by another kind of kinkiness as a naked woman seems to slap her equally naked, though abjectly helpless, lover.        
	Similar dramas are played out in the paintings in gouache on handmade paper or in the acrylics. The comic potentials inherent in the figure of the intrepid blue-stocking become a vital cornerstone of Subramanyans work. Fiery feminists, as Subramanyan once said, could discard bras with ease but could not discard breasts. So biology becomes destiny. Which is why the angry goddess in pursuit of the demon cannot help being overshadowed by her sexy curves and full breasts. Instead of feeling fearful of her, viewers are titillated by a frivolous voyeurism. But there is no fun in being a Peeping Tom if the object of ones interest is strewn all over the place. Too many variations on self-same themes pall on the eye, and one misses a sense of conflict, that necessary dissonance, which can excite the mind and make it uneasy. At 85, K.G. Subramanyan has undoubtedly made himself a part of the pantheon of Indian artists, but the hall of fame seems to have also extracted its peculiar price.

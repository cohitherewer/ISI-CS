	The Bible: A biography 
  By Karen Armstrong,
  Grove, $9.75
    That the Bible should feature in a series called Books that Changed the World goes without saying. The blurb of this book informs readers that the Bible has been translated into over 2,000 languages, and is the spiritual guide for one out of every three people in the world. What is equally important is that people who are not looking for any kind of spiritual guidance or inspiration are avid readers of the Bible. They read it for sheer literary enjoyment. One doesnt have to be a Christian or a deeply religious person to appreciate the 23rd Psalm or the first verse of the gospel of St John.        
	Karen Armstrong is qualified to write a book on the Bible. In her youth, she had trained to be a nun; she is a formidable scholar of religion who has an open mind and is never too devout or too iconoclastic. She also has the rare gift of writing clearly and simply on matters of great complexity.        
	In this book, she begins by reminding her readers of the inherent inadequacy of language. There is always something that is left unsaid, and this underlines the transcendence that characterizes human experience. This, she says, has affected the way the Bible has been read since for both Jews and Christians it represents the Word of God. For centuries, interpretation or exegesis has been an essential part of the way Jews and Christians have read the Bible. In fact, from the very beginning, exegesis has been an integral part of the reading of the Bible and exegetes have freely revised the texts that they inherited and have given them different meanings. Armstrong writes, The Bible proved that it was holy because people continually discovered fresh ways to interpret it and found that this difficult, ancient set of documents cast light on documents that their authors could never have imagined.        
	Armstrong then moves to the various exegeses of the Bible, beginning with the earliest time, circa 8th century BC, when an attempt was made to reconstruct a coherent narrative from the multifarious traditions of Israel and Judah. These became a part of the Old Testament and, of course, of the Hebrew Bible. But at the time when they were written, they were still not scripture. This happened when these texts became the Torah around 398 BC.        
	Armstrong narrates this process of transformation and adds to it the making of the gospels. The process of scripture-making was, however, still not complete. She traces the ways in which the early Christian fathers and Jewish scholars kept on interpreting the texts, modifying and enriching them. There was an ongoing debate right up to the time of Martin Luther and the Reformation.        
	All this makes it a densely packed book. But it is not difficult to read. It is also obvious that Armstrong has distilled an enormous amount of scholarship to make this book comprehensible and accessible to the intelligent layman. It is difficult to think of a better commentary on the Holy Book.

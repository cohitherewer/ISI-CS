The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | March is the loveliest month
                                                                                                                 MARCH IS THE LOVELIEST MONTH                              This Above All- Khushwant Singh      
	There are authors whom I find tedious reading no matter on what they write. Some of them make it to the top of bestseller lists, win coveted awards and are lionized by literary circles. I do my best to read their new works and abandon them halfway, simply to confirm my bias against them. On the other hand, there are also authors whom, no matter what they write  novels, short stories, biographies or travelogues  I find unputdownable. In this category, my latest addition is M.G. Vassanji. I first read his novel, The Gunny Sack, and was charmed by it. Next, I read his latest novel, The Assassins Song, about the anti-Muslim pogroms in Gujarat. This book confirmed my opinion that Vassanji is a good storyteller. His latest offering is a travelogue, A Place Within: Rediscovering India. It has re-confirmed my opinion that whatever Vassanji writes makes good reading.        
	First, a few words about the author. He is an Ismaili Khoja whose Gujarati grandfathers on either side migrated to Dar es Salaam in East Africa where he was born. The Gunny Sack is about his community that is a harmonious blend of Islam and Hindu traditions. Even their names are part-Muslim, part-Hindu. When Kenya gained its independence, Vassanji moved to England and then to Canada. He lives in Toronto with his wife and two sons, now all Canadian citizens.        
	Vassanji first visited India in January 1993; it was the beginning of his rediscovery of the land of his ancestors. He had the advantage of speaking Gujarati (Kutch style), Hindi and English. He travelled the length and breadth of the country from the Simla to Kerala, from Calcutta to the Gulf of Cambay, visiting historical sites, temples, mosques, and the houses in which his great grandparents had lived. He made copious notes, read all he could about the places he visited, and met and befriended people from different walks of life. I was one of them. He had read what I had written about him and wanted to thank me. Unfortunately, among my guests was an ill-mannered lady who hogged his attention and all we could exchange were greetings and goodbyes. The next time he came, I took care not to invite the lady.        
	The great merit of Vassanjis travelogue is that Indian readers would also be able to rediscover their own country. He tells us about the people of India, their history, customs, and their peculiarities. His characters come alive, his depictions of rural landscapes, congested cities and squalor become personal experiences. A Place Within: Rediscovering India makes more absorbing reading than Jawaharlal Nehrus Discovery of India because it is, in fact, a rediscovery, and written by one who wields a gifted pen.                
	Fiery red                          New life       
	This years Holi was about the most colourless and quiet among those I have lived through. It was also chilly. There was time when I looked forward to Holi. Ahead of time, I amassed an ammunition of gulaal, pichkarees and a plastic bucket to be filled with coloured water on Holi day. My brothers and I set out soon after sunrise to paint the town red. During school years, our venue used to be Lala Raghubir Singh Jains mansion in Kashmere Gate.         
	There were 30 to 40 boys, girls and elders. Since it was free-for-all, Holi was the one day in the year when we could take liberties with girls, smearing their cheeks with gulaal, and not-so-accidentally, brushing their wet bosoms with our elbows. After a couple of hours in colourful indulgence, we had a shower, got into fresh clothes and sat in lines on the lawn to be served a bhojan of hot poories, aalu subzi and soojee ka halwa. We returned home very tired and very happy. All that is history.        
	For the last 10 years or so, I celebrate Holi sitting out in my back garden, admiring the beauty of the latest love in my life, my kusum tree. I planted it some 15 years ago. Now it is over 60 feet tall. Most of the year, it has a thick cluster of broad green leaves to screen a variety of birds that come for shelter  crows, babblers, barbets, bulbuls, doves and many others. They prefer this tree to the mango, which also has thick, dark green leaves; I havent found out why. My love for the kusum is roused in February when it begins to shed its leaves. At first, one or two at a time. Then the tempo increases: the leaves come down by the dozens. If there is a gust of wind, it becomes a shower of leaves and the ground below a rough carpet of dried leaves.        
	By Holi, most of the tree is stripped to its bare branches with only a few clusters of yellow leaves clinging on to life. Just about the same time, new leaves begin to sprout. Much to my surprise and joy, this time they first appeared at the top, which I had to have hacked off at the behest of the people living above my flat. They are of a fiery red colour and glow like live embers when the sun comes up. Then more appear at the end of the branches. For a few days, the tree looks like a pyramid ablaze, with flames rising to the skies. I sit mesmerized for hours gazing at it because I cant recall seeing anything more beautiful. In its own mysterious way, kusum also tells me the story of life, death and rebirth. It occurred to me that the colour of re-generation is red. At Holi time, the flame-of-the-forest, simul (silk cotton) and coral also come into flower. All of them are of deep red colour. It is natures way of celebrating the festival of colours with its own brand of gulaal made of red leaves and flowers.

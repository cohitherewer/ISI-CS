The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | At the end of the Day
                                                                                                                 AT THE END OF THE DAY                                  Bona Fide - MALVIKA SINGH                              
	Sometimes one wonders if the turmoil we see around us is there because, having reached the bottom of the pit, a correction is pushing itself into the public space, confronting the status quo on corrupt practices, exclusive, exploitative governance and plain malfunction. Wherever you look, the scene leaves much to be desired. Trains are filthy, the new buses already look as though they have been to battle and back, the taxis rattle and smell of stale sweat, streets are potholed and sidewalks are littered with rotting muck. The ineptitude of civil service agencies is overwhelming, governments are in denial, and all this is topped by arrogant babus and pompous politicians desperately trying to shield and protect their ivory towers.        
	The attempts of party spokespeople to defend the indefensible are fast taking the form of a tragicomedy. Parliamentarians and bureaucrats are gradually facing the brunt of the citizens anger over the formers freebies and endless perks without the delivery of goods and services. In turn, these rulers of India are feeling threatened by the demand that they vacate their cushy, secure government accommodations set on many acres of garden, give up their subsidized electricity, their free gardeners and drivers, the use of official cars for private work, their constant defence of their continuing failures, repetitive explanations for things not happening according to plan, and much more. Watching the players enact this final scene, an endgame in a manner of speaking, one hopes to see that flicker of light on the distant horizon that may lead us out of this suffocating morass.        
	Whether it is the political and bureaucratic state of denial about the reality of the gameplan of our neighbours, the putrid nonsenses uttered by men and women who have failed to govern with transparency, to ensure the dignity of everyday living for all Indians, or the endorsing of corrupt deals and the turning of a blind eye when politicians break the laws of this land with impunity, Indians stand bewildered and ashamed by what their nation is being put through. A small band of people has managed to hold a great civilization to ransom as it feathers its own nest, and disconnects itself, each passing moment, from the truth and reality on the ground.                
	Club class        
	The time has come for the press, particularly the electronic media, to ask their political guests straight and hard questions. Call in Pranab Mukherjee and ask him why he needs to live in a palatial house when all he does there is sleep at night. The politicians and bureaucrats have large offices with endless unnecessary staff, starting with peons who carry their briefcases for them and then sit outside the door gossiping and politicking, to personal assistants, deputy secretaries, joint, assistant and full-time secretaries, all of whom have their secretaries, and at the end of the day, the backlog is humungous. They entertain officially in five-star hotels or at Hyderabad House. Why then is valuable real estate being put at their disposal? All parliamentarians should move into apartment blocks within a gated and secure area along with all their gun-toting protectors, and thus free our city and streets from the overarching arrogance of power.        
	Many garages and servants quarters (I am surprised that the holier-than-thou general secretaries are not appalled by that description) in these sprawling premises are rented out to tradespeople who then are compelled to work free for the master of the house, who doesnt even observe the minimum wage rule instituted by the government he or she serves. They make the law with one hand and break it with the other. Ministers should pay personally for their upgrade to club class. When that happens, we shall be talking business.

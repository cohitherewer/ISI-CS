                                                                                                                 LEARNING IN BLUNDERLAND                                                                  
	History is a tentative creature. Although its claims over the past is absolute, it is founded on something as fragile and pliable as the human memory. This inherent doubleness often turns history into a matter of clever retelling. The mind may choose to play up one version of events against another by browsing through the debris of remembrance: selecting, deleting, emending its myriad bits and pieces. The obvious beneficiaries of this mode of history-writing are nation-states keen on perpetuating self-serving national histories that would suitably vindicate their nationalist agendas.        
	There is a trace of juvenile arrogance about this enterprise. It is as if a truant child is trying to pass off a shoddily put-together jigsaw puzzle as an epitome of perfection. You are simply expected to ignore the missing pieces and nod your approval even as the imperfections are staring you in the face. While indulging a child is one thing, it is quite another to shut your eyes to such importunate and unfair designs imposed on you by the State. You have to be especially discerning about the kind of historical baggage the State is trying to burden you with.         
	History, after all, is not just about knowing where you come from, but more sinisterly, it is about being told which way you ought to go. So, every time the government of a nation rewrites school textbooks to suit its own ideology and vision of the past, a great many voices are raised against such wanton distortions of truth. However, the more worrisome aspect, and logical consequence, of tweaking facts remains less apparent. If children in Indian schools are told about the glowing legacy of Hinduism and the trail of destruction left behind by the foreigners (who are almost always Muslim), then what kind of a skewed sense of national identity and destiny is being fed to them? In the process, not only are communal differences perpetuated, but the minds of the children are also vitiated with parochial, chauvinistic and xenophobic ideas. Children are schooled into accepting the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sanghs grand dream of transforming India into a Hindu State as historical inevitability.        
	Using history as a political tool to advance personal interests has an ancient provenance. Virgils Aeneid, an imaginative re-telling of Roman history, ends by hailing the golden age that would culminate in the reign of Augustus  who, known as Octavian before he became emperor, was also the poets close friend. Closer home and nearer time, history textbooks, written under the aegis of the National Council of Education Research and Training, were revised, first between 1977-80 (under the supervision of the Janata Party), and later between 1998-2004 (under the Bharatiya Janata Party) to suggest that Indias incredibly composite culture can be traced back to an exclusively Hindu beginning. The foreigners (the Aryans were conveniently excluded from this category) were construed as destroyers who had either integrated with the mainstream of Hindu life (like Jains, Sikhs and Buddhists) or have remained belligerently aloof (mostly Muslims, and less so, the Christians). There was blanket denial of crucial motives explaining the devastation wreaked by the Mughals. Mahmud Ghaznis invasion of the temple of Somnath (which inspired L.K. Advanis infamous rath yatra three centuries later) was made out to be a vengeful jihad, with little mention of Mahmuds ulterior motives of looting and plunder.        
	Under the United Progressive Alliance government, passages once removed or tampered with have been restored. What once looked like stray, unmotivated atrocities have been put in a social and economic context. If these contexts do not justify what happened, they at least begin to explain something. However, teaching history with the help of textbooks prescribed by the State is no mean challenge.         
	Almost every political party in power is tempted to co-opt the teachers as well as the learners into its distinctive ideological fold. Such a desire for intellectual control may be tacitly abetted by a national council supervising the teaching of as complex a subject as history.        
	Since the teaching of history is not divorced from the lived realities and exigencies of the present, it is essential to convey a balanced picture without provoking young people to locate themselves on either extremes of the political divide. Yet, it is also crucial to distinguish between the good and the evil unequivocally. How else would it be possible to inculcate even the vestiges of a humanist ethos among children whose daily lives are marked by the scars of history? Think of children in Gujarat, or in the Middle East, Rwanda or Darfur, of Jewish children living in Germany and Asian children attending British schools. History is a curious mix of black, white and grey areas  and each of these should be allowed to exist autonomously.        
	In a vast country like India, it is also vitally important to engage with the immediate realities of children living in the farthest corners of the nation. Can the same sense of nationhood be instilled in children going to school in Delhi or Mumbai as in their peers studying in the Northeast? In the 1990s, more than 90 per cent of students in Ladakh failed their Class X board examinations because they could not follow the medium of instruction (English and Urdu) and because their textbooks talked of rainforests, mangroves, rabbits, peacocks, oceans and customs remote from the lives they led in this cold desert in Jammu and Kashmir. In the next few years, the ambitiously named Operation New Hope introduced yaks, apricots, cranes and cheese into the books. The newly updated books are now supposed to include geopolitical issues unique to Ladakh, such as the regions place in the Silk Route, its links with Lhasa, and so on.        
	One wonders if revisions like these would also open the can of worms that is Kashmir before these children. How would the NCERT help these children make sense of, if not come to terms with, their lives, shadowed by terror and violence every day? What picture of the Indian nation, with its grand claims to unity in diversity, would be painted for them in the classrooms?        
	History  to borrow from the only interesting bit in Arun Shouries response to the Jaswant Singh fiasco  could indeed be a Blunderland. And it is presided over by not one but many Cheshire Cats  each trying to lead you down a path of its own liking.                          SOMAK GHOSHAL

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | art and violence
                                                                                                                 ART AND VIOLENCE                                                          
	In spite of being famously poor, Calcutta has the lowest rate of homicide among the worlds cities. Could this be because of its love of books, theatre and conversation? Amartya Sen has raised this question in a speech at the London Book Fair, and has gone on to not answer it conclusively for the lack of empirical investigations. But the question challenges the notion that poverty drives people to violent crime, while also asking whether culture might have a role to play in making people less prone to killing one another. This could raise two further questions, the implications of which are rather more disturbing than the issues raised by Mr Sen. First, is Calcutta really all that cultured? Or is it that when one is talking about Calcutta being a particularly cultured city, one is actually talking about its self-image rather than an objective reality? And second, do books and the arts necessarily make better  that is, less violent  human beings?        
	It does not take a great deal to question the City of Books myth. Calcuttas boi para, College Street, is lined with rows of bookshops that now sell very little apart from students texts, guide-books and various aids to competitive public examinations. And anybody familiar with proper bookshops in the other Indian cities (especially Delhi) will not hesitate to describe Calcuttas upmarket bookshops as the most boring in the country. Most of them are little more than outdated coffee-tables, run by people who are clueless about the state of the art in any area of interest for which genuine book-lovers come to a bookshop. Besides, an abiding love for Proust, Kafka, art cinema and theatre seems to have left the chief minister quite unperturbed about the peculiarly Calcuttan crime of killing people slowly with lethal air and water, infernal hospitals and murderously driven public transport. The theatre at the state-owned Academy of Fine Arts lies in a state of dilapidation matched only by that of the citys most venerable libraries and archives.        
	History has repeatedly shown that the greatest achievements in art can co-exist with, and even justify or inspire, the most inhuman excesses in organized crime  homicide on a sublime scale. Think of Renaissance Europe, 19th-century Russia and, uniquely, Nazi Germany. Hitler has left behind a personal library of around 16,000 volumes, including first editions of the works of philosophers, historians, poets, playwrights and novelists. He put Don Quixote, Robinson Crusoe, Uncle Toms Cabin and Gullivers Travels among the classics. On his shelves, Shakespeares works rubbed shoulders with Henry Fords The International Jew: The Worlds Foremost Problem and a handbook on the poison gas marketed as Zyklon B. Coming from a voracious reader who finished a book per night, his words form a darker counterpoint to more reassuring thoughts on the gift of culture: I take what I need from books.

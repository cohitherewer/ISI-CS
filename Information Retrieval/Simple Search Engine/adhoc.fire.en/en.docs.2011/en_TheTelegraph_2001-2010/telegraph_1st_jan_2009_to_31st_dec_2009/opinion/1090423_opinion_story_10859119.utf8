The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A parochial election?
                                                                                                                 A PAROCHIAL ELECTION?                          - To imagine that the election is driven by local issues is silly					 					      Mukul Kesavan                                                      
	One of the recurring themes of election commentary has been the observation that the current Lok Sabha elections are best seen as the aggregate of two dozen and more provincial elections. The reason people say this is obvious: since N.T. Rama Rao swept Andhra Pradesh in 1983, provincial parties have gained ground steadily, winning more and more seats in provincial assemblies and in Parliament, with the exception of the 1984 Lok Sabha election, which was an aberration, following as it did the assassination of Indira Gandhi and the anti-Sikh pogroms.        
	The Congress has seen its provincial leaders break away to form independent parties: Sharad Pawar of the Nationalist Congress Party and Mamata Banerjee of the Trinamul Congress are the two obvious examples, but even Congressmen who are seen as pillars of the party today have experimented with regional politics. For example, the home minister, P. Chidambaram, and the party spokesperson, Jayanthi Natarajan, used to be part of a breakaway party called the Tamil Maanila Congress.        
	The last party to win more than two hundred seats in Parliament was the Congress in 1991, when it won 226 seats. Since then, pan-Indian parties have struggled to rack up even a hundred and fifty seats, and have been forced to build precarious coalitions shored up by regional parties. Much ink has been used up on the politics of coalition and the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party have been praised or blamed for their attitude towards the new coalition dharma.              
	The forecasts for this election differ in detail but they all seem agreed that the Congress and the BJP together will win around half the 542 seats in Parliament. Does the parochialization of national elections imply a future where coalitions at the Centre are wholly driven by provincial considerations? And if that happens, wont people begin to wonder what the larger entity, India, is for? Or is the provincialization of politics a healthy sign, a sign that people are beginning to value performance over abstract rhetoric about Hindutva or secularism?        
	These questions are premature. Its worth pointing out that the third largest formation in the current Lok Sabha is the Left Front. The Left Front is a national, not a provincial, grouping. Its strength may well be confined to its provincial strongholds in Kerala and West Bengal, but it contests elections all over India and its stance on questions of policy remains pan-Indian and internationalist in an almost doctrinaire way. Ask Manmohan Singh.        
	The other fact to remember is that the Bahujan Samaj Party is running candidates in some five hundred seats in these Lok Sabha elections. The main pan-Indian parties, the Congress and the BJP, are contesting fewer seats than Mayavatis party. And while the cynicism of the BSP in these matters is legendary (its candidates are generally self-financing and they often have little or no ideological attachment to the party), it is undeniable that Kanshi Ram intended the BSP to be a national party from the time he conceived of it. It has fought and won elections in Rajasthan, Punjab and Madhya Pradesh, and in places like Vidarbha in Maharashtra, its presence has significantly damaged the electoral performance of other parties like the Congress.        
	In this Lok Sabha election, according to some forecasts, the BSP could win as many as 40 seats. To see this as a victory for regionalism would be a mistake: whether you like its politics or not, the BSP is not a parochial party. Like the BJP and the Congress, it is playing a pan-Indian game. It has much more in common with the Congress than it does with genuinely provincial players like the Rashtriya Janata Dal or the Samajwadi Party or the Janata Dal (United) who, despite their rhetoric, are entirely confined to the politics of specific regions. Theoretically, the BSP has a pan-Indian constituency because Dalits, like Brahmins, are found everywhere in India. The barriers of language and culture may undo Mayavatis strategy of building an all-India politics with a Dalit vanguard leading an opportunistic coalition of castes and communities, but the scale of her ambition is subcontinental.        
	Related to the idea of a provincialized politics is the notion that the current election isnt animated by large, nationally significant issues. The implication is that caste fractions, local developmental issues and bread-and-butter politics that ought to be the business of municipal or local elections have taken over the general election and diminished it.        
	The first phase of these elections should have demonstrated the patronizing absurdity of that idea. In this phase, large parts of the North-east, Chhattisgarh, Vidarbha and Telangana went to the polls. Issues central to Indias continued existence as a democratic nation-state were being tested in these elections. These elections are, in part, plebiscites on the legitimacy of insurrectionary violence (Naxalite and Maoist groups have a strong presence in the so-called Red Corridor from Nepal to Chhattisgarh), the acceptability of state-sponsored vigilantism (the Salwa Judum was created in Chhattisgarh to deal summarily with Naxalites) and the acceptable human costs of economic modernization (dozens of farmers have committed suicide in Vidarbha); these are pivotal issues on which the future of India will turn, not just the careers of local politicians.              
	If the turnout of voters doesnt drop in Maoist areas, that can be counted as a victory for electoral democracy. If state-sponsored vigilantism in the shape of the Salwa Judum, invented by the Congress and embraced by the BJP, finds endorsement in these elections and encourages these parties to fight insurgencies elsewhere with paid vigilantes, the idea of the rule of law will have suffered a massive defeat. If Telangana votes for politicians committed to the separation of that region from Andhra Pradesh, we might learn something about the validity of language as the basis of political identity.        
	To imagine that these are local or provincial issues is silly. That so much political commentary should take this view tells us something about the way in which the election as breaking news simplifies and flattens out our democracys great rite of passage. Personifying a billion people the better to take their electoral temperature or to measure a national mood swing is a useful and entertaining way of forecasting seats won and seats lost, but its an unreliable guide to the conflicts, the solidarities, the suffering, the passion and the ambition that come together at election time to give us our representatives.

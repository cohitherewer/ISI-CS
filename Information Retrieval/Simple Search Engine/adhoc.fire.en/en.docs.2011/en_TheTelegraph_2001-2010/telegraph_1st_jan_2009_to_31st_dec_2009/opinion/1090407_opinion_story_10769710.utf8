The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | For a bigger slice of the sky
                                                                                                                 FOR A BIGGER SLICE OF THE SKY                                  UP, UP AND AWAY      The Bangalore air show was a spectacular success despite a few snags                                                   
	Aero India 2009, the air show held at the Yelahanka air force station in Bangalore, proved that aviation in India has come of age. Twenty-six nations and more than 500 companies participated in the event. Yet the show did not touch international standards.        
	Air shows around the world have a standard four-sector spectrum. The first is the static display of aircraft at the parking bay. Second is the stalls put up by the various participants, mostly equipment manufacturers. The third consists of chalets of prominent manufacturers and the host countrys government ministries which give the guests and visitors a chance to wine and dine in air-conditioned comfort. Finally, there is flying display by participating aircraft.        
	In Bangalore, one could only see the fighter pilots of foreign air forces and Indias frontline flying machines. Also present were ministers, bureaucrats and other VIPs who tried hard to make their presence felt.         
	Unfortunately, at such a high profile event, the civilian ruled over the uniformed air warriors in their own backyard. Paranoia about a potential terror attack meant that scores of people were left searching for the right source to gain access.        
	The list of participants among foreign aircraft manufacturers was impressive: Finmeccanica, Turbomeca and Alenia Aeronautica (Italy), SAAB (Sweden), EADS, DIEHL (Germany), Snecma, Thales and Dassault Aviation (France), the Russian Aircraft Corporation and the United Aircraft Corporation (Russia), Rolls Royce (UK), Elbit Systems, Israel Aerospace Industries and Rafael (Israel). From the Western hemisphere came Lockheed Martin, General Electric, Raytheon, Bell Helicopter, Sikorsky, Northrop Grumman and Boeing.        
	Air shows in India stand divided between civil air shows and military ones. It all began with the first civil aviation show in Hyderabad in October 2008. Organized, supported and sponsored by the ministry of civil aviation, the old airport in Hyderabad saw the arrival of small rotorcraft, business jets and the mighty Airbus-380. Military aircraft were conspicuous by their absence. Thus, is one stroke, the unity of an air show cracked, resulting in divided loyalties and expensive investment. It must also be remembered that reputed air shows, such as the ones in Farnborough, Paris, Dubai and Singapore have not broken an air exhibition into two separate venues.        
	In fact, some air warriors complained bitterly about the absence of civil aircraft at the event. Nevertheless, the absence of the civilian version of the Airbus and the Boeing was more than compensated by the six foreign bidders for the 126 medium-multi role combat aircraft of the Indian air force. The US F-16 and F/A-18 Super Hornet, Russian MiG-35 and the Eurofighter flew with gusto and were a sight to watch. Aero India 2009 can take pride in the fact that a number of international participants turned up despite the economic downturn. The Indian arms bazaar will be approximately worth 50 billion dollars by 2020. Seen in this light, aircraft manufacturers can take solace in the fact that a single company did not get a slice of the pie on its own. The companies came in large numbers and spent crores, but with the Indian political upheaval looming large, there was no way in which a large order for aircraft could be placed.        
	The Bangalore air show did not witness major tie- ups. The excitement was missing too. The only redeeming feature was the spectacular formation flight of the much-maligned Indian light combat aircraft, Tejas. That is no mean achievement in a market afflicted with economic ills.                           ABHIJIT BHATTACHARYYA

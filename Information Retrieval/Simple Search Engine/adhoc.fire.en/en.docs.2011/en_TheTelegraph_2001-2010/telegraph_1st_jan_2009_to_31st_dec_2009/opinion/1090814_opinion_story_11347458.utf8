	The Help
   By Kathryn Stockett, Penguin, Rs 599        
	On December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks, the African American civil rights activist, declined to give up her seat for a white passenger on a public bus while travelling through Montgomery, Alabama. Outraged by her conduct, the whites caused her to be arrested and convicted for violating laws that literally kept coloured people in their place. In a string of events leading from the Montgomery Bus Boycott organized by African Americans to protest against discriminations in public vehicles, Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his legendary I have a dream speech in front of the Lincoln Memorial in 1963 to mark the end of the Civil Rights March.        
	When Kathryn Stocketts novel opens in August 1962, in Jackson, Mississippi, coloured people are still very much the outsiders in their own land. Their ghettoization is ensured by the John Crow laws, which were passed by the southern states of America after the Civil War to disempower the newly freed slaves by denying them equal opportunities. In Jackson, segregation is the order of the day, and a series of codes, written and unwritten, controls the lives of the domestic helps who are the subjects of Stocketts novel. The paranoia over coloured maids takes strange forms. White mistresses would entrust them with the responsibilities of running the households and even of bringing up their children, but would not share the bathrooms with them for reasons of hygiene.         
	The Help is an unusual novel in more ways than one. For one, its author is a white woman who speaks in the voices of the coloured maids, Aibleen and Minny, in two-thirds of the novel. The third voice is that of the tall, unattractive blue-stocking, Miss Skeeter, who writes a novel called Help, in which coloured domestics narrate their experience of working for white mistresses. Stocketts novel takes shape as Skeeter interviews the coloured maids of Jackson and documents their stories. The authors purpose can be seen to merge with that of Skeeter as the latter reflects on her books aim  For women to realize, We are just two people. Not that much separates us. Not nearly as much as Id thought. The Help is as much a novel about orality as it is about writing. It seeks to mimic the speaking voice of the coloured maids themselves, thus creating a language that enacts the speakers struggle to strip it of the racial codes informing it. When the sassy Minny is shocked by the kindness of her employer, Miss Celia Foote, who attacks a man with a poker to save her maid, Minny says, Suddenly I realize I ought to thank her, but truly, Ive got no words to draw from. This is a brand-new invention weve come up with. (Miss Footes kindness, here, is also a sense of shared human-ness or kind-ness as J.M. Coetzees eponymous heroine, Elizabeth Costello, would say.) It is telling that while Minny has a wide range of cuss words in her repertoire to describe the white women she has worked with, she does not possess the language to describe Miss Footes spontaneous gesture.        
	By trailing the coloured maids out of their employers houses into public places (where they had restricted access), into the coloured churches, and then into their own homes, Stockett deconstructs the Mammy figure made famous by Aunt Chloe of Uncle Toms Cabin, who knew no household other than her mistresss and served it with single-minded devotion. Stocketts fifty-something Aibleen recalls Gone with the Winds Mammy, but the similarity only serves to emphasize her difference. Aibleen loves the white children in her care, but knows that something turned inside her the day her 24-year-old son, Treelore, was crushed under the wheels of a tractor. A bitter seed was planted inside me. And I just didnt feel so accepting anymore, she says. Aibleen plays by the rules while on duty, but keenly feels their unfairness. She exacts her revenge on the white employers by agreeing to tell her side of the story and by inspiring her co-workers to do so as well. In her canniness, Aibleen is actually more reminiscent of Hattie McDaniel, who played Mammy in Gone with the Wind. Hattie is said to have defended herself against criticisms that she perpetuated the Mammy stereotype by replying, Why should I complain about making seven thousand dollars a week playing a maid? If I didnt, Id be making seven dollars a week actually being one.        
	The Help has an interesting afterword, Too little, too late, where the author talks about her family maid, Demetrie, who raised her after her parents divorced when Stockett was six. Demetrie used to warn her white charges about the trials of cotton-picking, which she used to do as a child  For days I picked and picked. And then I looked down and my skin had bubbled up. I showed my mama. None a us ever seen sunburn on a black person before. That was for white people! It is this tone of easy acceptance of difference, which still registers a hurt in its very casualness, that is to be heard in voices of the maids in Stocketts novel. Like Demetrie, Aibleen and Minny speak pidgin English, which can get as dignified or as naughty as the educated voice of Skeeter. In its unpretentious style, its peculiar brand of humour, and in its cheekiness, The Help becomes a tribute to Demetrie and to the thousands like her who were trapped in the shadows of the white mind.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | eight monkeys
                                                                                                                 EIGHT MONKEYS                                                    
	Everything is political  even little monkeys. The idea of a zoo feels distinctly archaic these days, giving off more than a whiff of political incorrectness. So the neglect and mismanagement that have become chronic to the Calcutta zoo often come across as less shocking than they should be, although no less sad and cruel for being so. Yet, the zoo does make news every now and then, and for bizarre reasons  two people mauled by a tiger after trying to put a garland round its neck, chimpanzees breaking out of their cage, a giraffe fatally entangled in overhead wire and now, eight stolen monkeys. Professionals (prison guards or private security-men) sleeping through their watch with unfortunate consequences have also been heard of recently in West Bengal. The monkey-stealing is possibly part of a similar scenario. Two private guards employed by the Alipore zoo have been arrested, and its director suspended; an inquiry is on into the theft, and the alleged mix of laxity and collusion in the guards is yet to be proven. But the episode is as much a reminder of the zoo being part of a thriving illegal trade in animals as of the zoos generally miserable state. The sorriness of it all becomes more than a little absurd with two political parties fitting the zoo up with loudspeakers and hoardings in order to protest against the stealing of the marmosets, breaking some rules and traumatizing the animals in the process. But this too is typically Bengal.        
	If there must be a zoo in Calcutta, then those who run it and the Central Zoo Authority must put their heads together and think through its raison dtre. Otherwise, it would be difficult to rescue the place from being derecognized by the CZA, a fate that could have befallen it more than once. A zoo still has a significant role to play in the conservation of threatened species, and that role, quite apart from the zoos touristic and entertainment value, should be taken seriously. Many important cities of the world, including a few Indian ones, have well-maintained zoos that do not exude a tragic air as does the one in Calcutta. Zoos have evolved with the times, and a heartlessly circus-like display of wildlife is no more the purpose of zoos in the modern world. If the Alipore zoo fails to overcome inertia and corruption, then it would be difficult for it to justify its own existence to those who genuinely care for animals.

    After a couple got divorced by mutual consent, the permanent custody of their child was awarded to the mother. The husband remarried and the wife too got married again. Subsequently, the man wrote to his former wife, stating that his parents were anxious to see their grandchild. The wife replied that since the father had no visiting rights, it could not be extended to the grandparents. This led to a round of litigation, including a move to appoint the man rsquo;s parents as guardians. The Madras High Court held that the mother rsquo;s remarriage was not a ground for denying custody, especially since the father had also remarried. The court said that there was no justification in appointing the paternal grandparents as guardians as long as the parents were alive. (Chandrasekaran V.

    A man took a part of a certain premises on rent for residential purpose and another part for a non-residential one. Later, the landlord filed a petition for eviction, arguing that the tenant had ceased to occupy the tenanted area and that both the premises had been locked for a year. As the tenant partially lost the case in the rent controller rsquo;s court, he appealed before the lower appellate court. Dismissing the petition, the court held that a single eviction petition could not take care of two tenancies. However, when the landlord challenged the order in the Andhra Pradesh High Court, it held that a single petition could be allowed under the circumstances. (Ch.

    The married sister of a man who died in a road accident sought compensation under the Motor Vehicles Act. She was the lone surviving legal representative of the victim. The insurance company opposed the sister rsquo;s claim, stating that the married sister was not entitled to compensation as she was not a dependent legal heir. Relying on earlier judgements, the Andhra Pradesh High Court held that though a married sister was a ldquo;legal representative rdquo;, she was not entitled to compensation under the Motor Vehicles Act as she was not a ldquo;dependent legal heir rdquo;.

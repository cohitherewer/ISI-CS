                                                                                                                 HOPE IN DIFFERENCE                          - To keep his promise, Obama cannot afford many compromises        Diplomacy - K.P. Nayar                          Hour of approval                                              
	Walking along Washingtons Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House yesterday, it felt as if I was back in 1977. In March 1977, I experienced firsthand the joy of being liberated. The Emergency imposed by Indira Gandhi had ended. I felt free after 21 months. The atmosphere on Capitol Hill yesterday was similar.        
	Not just on Capitol Hill. On Saturday, I watched Barack Obama and Joe Biden alight from a train in Baltimore in minus nine degrees Celsius and approach a crowd that was larger than what many American presidents have had for their swearing-in on the Capitol. Just before the president-elect and the vice-president-elect mounted the stage, one of the local leaders holding the fort spoke about George W. Bush leaving the White House. A roar of approval went up from the crowd.        
	On Monday night, a network anchor broadcasting live from the sprawling National Mall in front of the Capitol had breaking news: the departing vice-president, Dick Cheney, had injured his back while moving boxes in his new home in Virginia. He would attend Obamas swearing-in as president, but would be in a wheelchair. The anchor was stunned by the sympathy for Cheney. A crowd that was within earshot of the anchor erupted in sheer joy at the news of Cheneys back injury and temporary handicap.        
	On Monday last week, 15,000 volunteers for Obamas swearing-in were having a rehearsal in Washington and one of trainers made a remark about a drill to be undertaken when Bush departs the White House for good. The volunteers stopped what they were doing and clapped in eager anticipation.        
	The final days of the Bush administration will be remembered for scenes like this among a people who viewed yesterday as the end of a dark era that lasted eight years  the transfer of power from an occupant of the White House whom history will probably judge as the worst president of America.              
	A few months shy of a quarter century ago, in his address to the nation after taking over from Watergate-tainted Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, the only man in the history of the United States of America to occupy the White House without having been elected by the people as either vice president or president, said: My fellow Americans, our long national nightmare is over. In 1933, Franklin Roosevelt told the American people that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.        
	By voting for Obama in November, the people of America asserted the truth in Roosevelts statement. Bush and his diabolical vice-president ruled by fear  fear of terrorists, fear of Muslims, fear of brown skin, fear of Middle Eastern looks, fear of Hispanic immigrants, fear of foreign languages, fear of each other, fear of their own shadows.        
	During the presidential election campaign last year, Republicans, especially their vice-presidential candidate, Sarah Palin, and the core of the American right, tried unsuccessfully to recast that fear in the image of Obama, who did not look like them and had a middle name, Hussein. However, the economic crisis that hurt all Americans  white, black, Asian and Hispanic  changed the poll agenda. It changed the nature of fear among voters in the US: by November 2008, the majority of Americans feared those who were in charge of the economy for the last eight years much more than a black man who promised hope and change.        
	The mood in Washington is already changing to one that is reminiscent of the 1977 post-Emergency Shah Commission revelations. Last week, Susan Crawford became the first US official to admit in public that for the Bush administration, torture was official policy. What makes Crawfords admission cathartic is that she is a lifelong Republican, who served as general counsel for the US army during Ronald Reagans presidency and was inspector-general at the Pentagon when Dick Cheney was secretary of defence.        
	Like many of those who made sensational revelations before the Shah Commission, Crawford last week revealed techniques of torture that were used against detainees by the military in Guantanamo. But unlike many of those in authority who went along with what Sanjay Gandhi wanted, Crawford did stand up for the law behind closed doors. As the seniormost Bush official with the responsibility for bringing Guantanamo detainees to trial, she said no to the show trials when she found out about the methods used on the detainees to extract information from them.        
	There will be more such revelations in Washington in the coming weeks and months about how the Bush administration, which sought a permanent Republican majority in the Congress and in the White House, subverted the law and the constitution and risked Americas reputation as the worlds oldest democracy. But Obama is unlikely to make the mistake that Morarji Desai made 32 years ago and engage in any witch-hunt against the previous administration. At least not for now. That job may eventually be left to the incoming attorney general, Eric Holder.        
	If the hundreds of thousands of Americans who have been singing, dancing and partying non-stop in Washington from last weekend saw yesterdays change of guard at the White House as the end of a long nightmare, in reality, it was cold comfort for Obama. He inherits a nightmare of a different kind that is already touching the lives of all Americans irrespective of their colour, beliefs or material well-being: the economic meltdown.        
	Those who live in the Washington area are relatively immune to the economic disaster that is stalking America. In every country, the government is usually the last institution to go down and it will be the same in Washington as the US faces a crisis that is potentially more serious than the Great Depression 80 years ago.        
	But even in this national capital area, the chill winds of recession are beginning to be felt. A few weeks ago, it was brought home to me that to have my car serviced by a manufacturers dealer, I now have to drive nearly 30 kilometres. Until several of the automobile dealerships  some three decades old and thriving until a year ago  closed down recently, I had merely eight kms to drive to get to a dealers service facility.              
	Last week, the shop which I patronized for eight years for all my electronics purchases, from computers to telephones, went bankrupt. It was no ordinary shop. It was a chain with 567 retail outlets all over America and suddenly 34,000 people, including at least a few thousand Indians, lost their livelihood.         
	I shall miss Pushparajan Arokiasamy, who had his name changed by the management to Charles because few Americans could have pronounced his Tamilian name. In a country where most shop assistants know next to nothing about the products they sell, Arokiasamy was a genius. He actually knew what he was dealing in.        
	Two months ago, the chain of stores where I buy my household goods also went bankrupt. In all, 64,318 companies went into bankruptcy last year. It has been the worst year in terms of bankruptcy filings since 2005.        
	A desperate nation, looking for straws to be pulled out of the surging waters of economic mismanagement, is banking on Obama to bail it out. Sadly, the new president has not begun well.         
	In 1991, when Indias economy was in the doldrums, the incoming P.V. Narasimha Rao governments great asset was a finance minister in Manmohan Singh, who was above suspicion. The US needs a financial manager now whose probity cannot be questioned by anyone, anywhere.         
	Unfortunately for Obama, his choice as the next treasury secretary, Timothy Geithner, who spent part of his childhood in New Friends Colony and went to school in New Delhi, has turned out to be a tax cheat. Obama would have been better off disowning him and withdrawing him from consideration for his cabinet.         
	Because he did not do so, he is already a prisoner of the Wall Street cabal that brought about the current financial crisis. The compromise over Geithner may not be Obamas last one as president. If he succumbs to other similar measures of expediency, Washington would have changed Obama instead of the other way round, a campaign promise he made two years ago.

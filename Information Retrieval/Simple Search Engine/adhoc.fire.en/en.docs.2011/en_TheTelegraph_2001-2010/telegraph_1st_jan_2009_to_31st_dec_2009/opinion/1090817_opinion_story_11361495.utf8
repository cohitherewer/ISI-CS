	 ldquo;They have the watches, but we have the time, rdquo; say the Taliban commanders in Afghanistan, and it rsquo;s perfectly true. The election on August 20 is not going to change that. The foreign forces mdash; American, Canadian and European mdash; are well-trained, well-equipped troops who can inflict casualties on amateur Taliban fighters at a ratio of ten-to-one, or worse. But the Taliban have an endless flow of fresh fighters, and much popular support among the Pashtuns of the south and south-east mdash; not to mention all the time in the world.  
	The Taliban are almost exclusively Pashtuns, so it was really the Pashtuns, 40 per cent of the population and traditionally Afghanistans dominant ethnic group, who were driven from power by the United States of America in 2001. They are fighting foreign, non-Muslim invaders, and the government the foreigners had put in is corrupt, incompetent and mostly non-Pashtun. Why wouldnt the Taliban have support among the Pashtuns?  
	Afghanistans president, Hamid Karzai, is a Pashtun, because the US understood that it needed a Pashtun figurehead. The regimes most powerful people, however, are non-Pashtun warlords from the various ethnic minorities of the north and centre: Tajiks, Uzbeks and Hazaras.        
	Now we are asked to believe that an election will restore confidence in the government. It is nonsense: this election has no more relevance than the ones that the US used to stage in Vietnam.         
	Unless bribery, blackmail and threats no longer work in Afghanistan, Karzai is going to win. He isnt even bothering to run a conventional campaign: he bailed himself out of a televised debate with the other presidential candidates at the last moment, and leaves it to them to hold election rallies in provincial towns. He has made his deals with the warlords and the traditional, ethnic and tribal power-brokers, and is counting on them to deliver victory.                
	Trust deficit        
	Karzai and the US are shackled to the warlords because those were the allies that the US recruited to fight the Taliban in 2001. The Taliban, being exclusively Pashtun, never controlled all of the country: Tajik, Hazara and Uzbek militias continued to hold out all across the north. So the US made deals with their leaders, showered them with weapons and money, and helped them into power instead. It made good sense militarily, but it meant that the non-Pashtun warlords would dominate the post-Taliban government. They dont live in the hills any more, but in the wealthy Kabul neighbourhood of Sherpar. Two of them, Mohammad Qasim Fahim, a key Tajik warlord, and Karim Khalili, a Hazara warlord, are Karzais choices as vice-presidents.        
	The Wests government in Kabul is not going to get any better, given its origins. It will stay on for four more years and by the end of that time all the Western countries, which had sent their troops to Afghanistan, will be ready to bring them home. What will happen then?        
	Nothing particularly dramatic. Afghanistan was invaded in revenge for 9/11, but the US could have played it differently from the start. Immediately after 9/11, a thousand-strong shura (congress) of Muslim clerics in Kabul declared its sympathy with the dead Americans and voted to expel Osama bin Laden and al Qaida from the country. Western rhetoric insists that the hills of Afghanistan are directly connected to the streets of Manhattan, London and Toronto. But no Afghan, not even any member of the Taliban, was involved in the planning or execution of 9/11, nor in the later, lesser attacks elsewhere in the West. Nor would the Taliban sweep back into power if all Western troops left Afghanistan tomorrow.        
	Everybody who dies in this conflict is dying for nothing, because it will not change what happens when the foreign troops finally go home. As they eventually will.

	Incredibly not India                
	It was difficult to recognize India in the gaudily painted canvases of the Russian artist, Elena Fedorovskaya (Images of India, Rabindranath Tagore Centre, ICCR, March 30 to April 5). And this in spite of the fact that there were the ubiquitous cows, Harijans, historical monuments, the Kovalam beach and poverty with which India has been associated. The sense of the uncanny in the paintings probably had something to do with the fact that all the landscapes were strangely depopulated. With a few people scattered here and there even in such places as the ghats of Varanasi, the streets of Lucknow or the villages of Uttar Pradesh, Fedorovskayas India seemed more like that of the early 19th century than of the 21st.         
	While the oils somehow made up for their lack of life with the richness of tint, the pastels were truly pathetic. Paintings such as Outskirts of Kolkata or A temple in Kulu Valley were childish at their best and awful at their worst. In the painting, Small street in Mumbai, an imperfect use of the vanishing point had skewed the perspective.         
	The only redeeming feature of the exhibition was the portraits. While still playing within the boundaries of stereotypes, portraits of the servant girl from Madras, of Aarti or of the Harijani with child were more than ordinary. The expression on the subjects faces told the story of an India that is more than a summation of clichs.

	New faces        
	Ananda Shankar Centre for Performing Arts presented Metamorphosis, mapping the evolution and flowering of some budding talents into dancers and choreographers (Rabindra Sadan, March 20). The entire programme showcased ten items choreographed by the young students of the institution along with Tanusree Shankar, the guiding spirit of the centre. The programme began with Maitree, choreographed by Tanusree, where six dancers expressed their love and friendship for each other. This piece was a tribute to women, and appealed much to the audience.         
	Nabanna was an invocation of spring. The colours, melody and joyous mood of nature were depicted beautifully in the choreography by Chaitali Banerjee, Nandi Roy and Sulagna Sarkar. The well-synchronized and agile movements of the dancers were lively and enjoyable.        
	In this present state of anxiety and aggression, it is only by divine grace we can look forward to a life of hope and peace. Set to the melodious tune by Debajyoti Mishra, Rita Kundu sketched an engaging and confident piece.         
	The concluding presentation of the evening, I Believe, struck a positive note, by invoking a world devoid of uncertainty, fear and terror. A suitable musical score by A.R. Rahman helped the choreographer to bring out the significance of this number. The opportunity given to these young aspiring dancers by their prestigious institution to exercise their imagination and come up with their own compositions was extremely praiseworthy.

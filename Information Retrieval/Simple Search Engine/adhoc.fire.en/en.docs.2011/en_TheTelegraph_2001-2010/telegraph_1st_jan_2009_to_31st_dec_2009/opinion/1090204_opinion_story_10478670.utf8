The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | high and dry
                                                                                                                 HIGH AND DRY                                                    
	Calcutta seems to be growing into an unhealthy and dangerous city. And the problems are with resources as basic, and as vital, as air and water. As they wait to see what happens in March (when the next deadline for the removal of two-stroke autos come up), Calcuttans and the citys keepers have been confronted with another, equally grave problem  an alarming drop in groundwater levels in the city and its suburbs. There is no reason for the government and the municipality to be surprised about either of these crises. They have been building up to this critical level for years, but without any noticeable change in the nature or degree of awareness or political will in the way they are being addressed. There have been, for instance, no public statements from the government as to what is being done to create the infrastructure that would enable the meeting of the two-stroke deadline in March. In the case of falling groundwater levels, the perils are many and well-known  the risk of the ground caving in, dangerous levels of contamination in the water (arsenic, fluorides, salinity), acute depletion of groundwater resulting in severe scarcity. All these symptoms have been present in various areas of the city, affecting thousands of people, for decades. But nothing definite has been done to arrest the declining level in a concerted way. Besides, this is not just an urban or suburban problem. Rural Bengal is affected too, through a combination of the building boom and intensive agriculture.        
	What the situation indicates is a persistent lack of a vision on the part of the authorities that would take the question of development beyond the purely cosmetic dimensions of indiscriminate construction (apartments, flyovers, shopping malls). What does it mean for a city to grow, to become more developed? Most people in the government and in the municipalities are insufficiently qualified or motivated to answer this fundamental question, and to act on their understanding of its implications. It is not enough to talk half-heartedly and semi-ignorantly about alternative water sources, rainwater harvesting and the restoration of waterbodies. The mix of ignorance, callousness and corruption has created a long history of inaction and apathy that calls for a more drastic and comprehensive programme of action.

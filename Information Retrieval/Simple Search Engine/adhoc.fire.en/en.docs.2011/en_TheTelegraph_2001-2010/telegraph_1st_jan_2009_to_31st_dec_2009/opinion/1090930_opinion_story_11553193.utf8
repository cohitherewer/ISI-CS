	To translate dharma as religion is to reduce the range and elusiveness of the Sanskrit word to a narrowness that is both dull and dangerous. But to move in the other direction, restoring to religion the breadth and subtlety of dharma in its epic sense, is to put the conduct of everyday life on a par with ritual and theology. Religious practice then becomes as much a question of existence as of faith. And because no man is an island, existence is always co-existence  living peacefully and meaningfully with others, especially with the otherness of others. Something remarkable has been happening in Orissas Baleshwar every year during the Durga Puja, Eid and Muharram, although the people there see it as part of their normal lives. Local Muslims actively participate in a number of Durga Pujas in the district, and occupy important posts in the puja committees. This is not just tokenism, they take part in many of the rituals, apart from organizing the fundraising, worship, feasts and other events. And these are all practising Muslims, who are just as involved in their own festivals and observances. Similarly, Hindus take part in the Eid and Muharram celebrations and, more important, in the organizing of these celebrations. The secretary and the president of two important puja committees in Baleshwar are Muslim; they are also respected members of their neghbourhoods, looked upon as community leaders by Hindus and Muslims alike. In all this, there is an overriding sense of naturalness. Nobody makes a great deal of these things, and during each festival this sort of cooperation is taken to be the obvious way of getting things done and of having fun.        
	The violent convergence of religion and politics that shook Orissas Kandhamal district is what makes this natural spirit of festive coexistence in Baleshwar appear remarkable to most Indians. But religious syncretism, in every possible combination, is a very old tradition in the Indian subcontinent, although Indians today have to remind themselves of these traditions rather too frequently and self-consciously to counter the other narratives of bigotry and sectarianism that often make these happier stories look positively utopian. In a country that calls itself secular, the relationship between communities in Baleshwar should be normal rather than exceptional.

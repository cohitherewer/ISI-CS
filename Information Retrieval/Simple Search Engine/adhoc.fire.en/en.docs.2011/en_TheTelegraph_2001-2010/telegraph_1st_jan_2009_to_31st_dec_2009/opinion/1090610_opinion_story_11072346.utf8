The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | whos mr none?

	Your wordcager had an unlikely pleasure the other day: a visit from a Calcutta admirer. Of this column, I mean, with his charming wife and their two sons, aged 11 and 15: an Urdu/Bengali/English-speaking household that puts to shame the monoglottal ones of my own country (and me, who in 30 months at a  granted, English-speaking, but Indian-staffed  Mumbai newspaper office got little further in any vernacular than achcha and ek, do, teen, char, panch).        
	Yet one word was missing from the vocabulary of this multilingual family, one that youd expect in any of their languages. The two boys had no surname. Their father had not wanted the family to appear somehow his possessions, he told us. Hed asked his wife, after they married, to stick to her own surname; and when the sons were born he had them registered simply by their given names. My first thought was: how on earth did he get this noble idea past Indian bureaucracy? I know that some Tamils dont inherit family names, and that other Indians may opt for only a single name, like Mayavati. But middle-class Bengali Muslims?        
	On firmer ground, I wondered how Western bureaucracy would react, or had. The lads father must have defeated Britains sharp-toothed visa system, or they couldnt have reached London. But what about Americas razor-wire? Imagine filling in, on some electronic minefield, a first name unknown to most Americans except as that of one of Saddam Husseins sons  and then being unable at all to fill in the box demanding your family name (except maybe with none, which would probably have you for ever classified as that menace to homeland security, Mr None).        
	From there I began to think of names as words. Theyre often the most significant words their owner will ever use. And the family name, usually, is a key part of them.                
	Family labels        
	In most of the West, that name is simply whatever your fathers was  until, if you are a woman, you marry and adopt your husbands instead. Not everywhere though. Most Spaniards have two surnames. The first is their fathers (ie, his first surname); the second their mothers (ie, her first, derived from her father). So Pedro Gomez may in full be Pedro Gomez Covas, his mother being a Covas. And if he fancies his second surname, he may use it: Spains prime minister, Jos Luis Rodrguez Zapatero, uses Zapatero, not Rodrguez. Nor do Spanish wives take their husbands surname, though they may add it with a hyphen to their own.        
	Most Icelanders have no surname. Jon and Arnas son, Olaf, is Olaf Jonsson, and daughter Helga is Helga Jonsdottir  though she may opt for Helga Arnadottir. That ancient system was once widespread. In Britain, it has left surnames like Peterson and Richardson, or the cognate Peters (of Peter) and Richards. We backward Welsh were much given to this, with surnames like Jones (ie, Johns), Evans, Roberts and Williams, or, using the Welsh ap (ie, son of), names like Pritchard (ap Richard) and Probert.        
	These Western surnames reveal ones country, usually, maybe ones region, but little else. Many Jewish names are simply German ones. Many names come from old trades: Farmer, Smith, Cooper, Thatcher. Zapatero and the German Schumacher are both shoemakers. But, though few aristocrats have these down-to-earth names, nowhere do they reveal ones place in society. Names are just family labels.        
	How unlike India, where surnames can proclaim your region, religion, caste, maybe even occupation. These arent labels, theyre adjectives. (How do they fare in old age? Names are the first words we aged Westerners forget.) Not always helpful adjectives: maybe young Udai and Momin are better off without one.

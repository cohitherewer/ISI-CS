                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	A fair price to pay                  
	Sir  It is common for industrialists to acquire land at throwaway prices that they do not, or only partially, utilize. There have been instances where land taken in the name of industry has been used for real estate, fetching windfall profit at the cost of the land-losers. When governments acquire land, the owners lose their livelihood and the country loses a share of its agricultural produce. It is important that those who take over the land compensate the owners for the loss, as per the Reserve Bank of Indias price index for farm products, for the next 50 years.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sour grapes          
	Sir  It is difficult to understand why the Shiv Sena has put the blame for its defeat in the state polls on the Marathi manoos. The Sena chief, Bal Thackeray, in his editorial in the party publication, Saamna, blamed the ungrateful people of Mumbai for betraying his party. This accusation is not valid. It seems that Thackeray and his party do not want to introspect. They simply blame the people. Actually, it is not the Marathi manoos but Thackeray himself who is to be blamed for the condition of his party. He criticizes the Nehru-Gandhi clan, but could not resist giving the leadership of the Sena to his own son, Uddhav Thackeray, when Raj Thackeray is the more dynamic of the two. This was a grave mistake made by the Sena chief and the root cause of the partys debacle in the current election.           
	Moreover, what has Bal Thackeray done for the Marathi manoos in the past four decades? I see no reason why the Marathi people should be held responsible for the defeat of the Shiv Sena when the common man himself is merely keen on getting his day-to-day problems sorted out. He is not interested in the politics of hatred of either the Shiv Sena or the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The Bharatiya Janata Party has complained about dysfunctional electronic voting machines after the declaration of the results of the recent round of elections (BJP hit, Oct 24). This is a clear case of the sour grapes mindset. It is seen that when parties complain about EVMs, it generally means that they are regretting not being able to use their muscle power to capture booths that influence electoral outcomes.          
	With the EVMs, India has a legitimate and foolproof process of conducting elections in a fair manner. In fact, the Election Commissions EVM development teams at Bharat Electronics Limited and Electronics Corporation of India Limited should be awarded the Bharat Ratna.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Guilt trip          
	Sir  It is both astonishing and disappointing to know that Andre Agassi had used a recreation crystal methamphetamine drug in 1997 (Agassi reveals his drugs shame, Oct 29). He confesses in his autobiography that he had lied to the tennis authorities when he failed the dope test. How did the examiners of the Association of Tennis Professionals clear him when he told them that he had accidentally drunk soda spiked with the recreational drug? Why was he not subjected to a proper medical examination? Why was the association lenient towards him?          
	Agassis performance in 1997 dwindled and he was ranked 141st. He subsequently finished at the top in 1999. This raises doubt as to whether he continued to use the recreational drug for a long time. The matter needs to be probed. Agassi should be stripped off the US Open title of 1999. Those found guilty of showing him leniency should be taken to task.           
	 Yours faithfully,

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Rebuilding a ravaged land
                                                                                                                 REBUILDING A RAVAGED LAND                              Samantak Das                                    
	A colleague and friend, Sujit Mandal, had his home on Bali island in the Sunderbans, washed away by Cyclone Aila. Sujit and I, along with other colleagues, students and friends made the first of several trips to the Sunderbans, post-Aila, on May 28. What follows is based on what we learnt on these trips.        
	The State machinery essentially failed the people of the Sunderbans immediately before and after Aila, although it seems to have recovered somewhat since then. Even when the cyclone was well-documented a full day before it struck, no effort seems to have been made to warn villagers about it. Up to May 29, the only relief that had reached the hamlet of some 1,500-odd people where we went was a single 50-kg sack of chinre. For weeks afterwards, much of the relief material was going to just a few places, located close to the riverbanks, leaving many others, located further inland, untouched.        
	Ordinary people responded to the cyclone with alacrity, generosity and passion. For over a month, trucks, vans, and private vehicles stretched for over a kilometre, every day, waiting to take relief materials to the cyclone-affected. Sadly, there was no attempt on the part of the State to coordinate such efforts and ensure that the provisions reached areas most in need. This could have been done quite easily by setting up a camp at each of the take-off points from where one has to get on to a boat to reach the islands of the Sunderbans. All such a camp needed was a map and up-to-date reports on the status of relief reaching (or not reaching) the islands. Mobile telephones were working during and after Aila, so such information was hardly difficult to obtain. In the absence of any guidance, many groups who had come loaded with relief (food, clothes, medicines, tarpaulins, water and so on) simply asked the people hanging around the ghats where they ought to go. Disaster touts took full advantage of this and asked people to leave relief material with them, which they later sold, making huge profits in the process. Others who made easy money from the cyclone include transporters, of boats or auto-rickshaws, quacks (charging thousands of rupees for providing cheap, readily-available medicines and saline drips) and, of course, moneylenders. Food, clothes and medicines were plentifully available in towns like Gosaba and Basanti, a day or two after Aila. Those who could not afford to buy these had already fallen into the moneylenders debt-trap.        
	On our first trip, we met a family where the eldest childs boi-khata, the only things that had dried sufficiently to be used as kindling, were being lit as fuel to cook gruel for the two youngest children. We realized it would be more fruitful to direct our limited resources towards replenishing the books that the students had lost. We concentrated on a single school in Bali, and were able to provide its 1,600-odd students with books, pens, pencils and so on.        
	Time after time, we saw sections of the dams left untouched (or nearly so) while others had been largely destroyed. In every case, those parts left untouched had an outer protective layer of mangroves between them and the river. And wherever dams had broken there was the conspicuous absence of mangroves. The money promised by the Central government for repairing dams will, we fear, be used to make concrete structures, likely to prove far less effective as a barrier than mangroves. The sustainable solution to the problems of the Sunderbans has to be found not in steel-and-concrete engineering but in ecologically sound methods of working in harmony with the local flora and conditions of existence.        
	The people of the Sunderbans are facing a severe food crisis as no rice is likely to be grown there for the next three or four years, because the paddy fields have been salinated by the cyclone. Such saline land cannot support high-yielding varieties of paddy, with their Green Revolution protocol of using insecticides, pesticides, chemical fertilizers and irrigation by fresh water. There once were local varieties of saline-water-friendly rice there, remembered fondly by older cultivators. Varieties like nona bakra, sada gentu, kalo gentu, srabanti saal and Hamilton saal can not only grow in saline water, but also require no chemical inputs to thrive. Government policy should be geared towards reviving these folk rice varieties on an urgent basis. As for power, the answer lies not in setting up fossil-fuel-based power plants but in utilizing the potential for solar and wind power generation that the Sunderbans possess. Instead of depleting groundwater by digging tube-wells at random, locals should be encouraged to practise rainwater harvesting. Part of a long-term plan for managing disasters like Aila should be the building of storm-proof housing, using local materials. But ugly, and ultimately ineffective, steel and concrete shoeboxes are likely to be erected instead of using local materials and knowledge to rebuild homes.        
	After such knowledge, what forgiveness?       (The author teaches Comparative Literature at Jadavpur University, Calcutta)

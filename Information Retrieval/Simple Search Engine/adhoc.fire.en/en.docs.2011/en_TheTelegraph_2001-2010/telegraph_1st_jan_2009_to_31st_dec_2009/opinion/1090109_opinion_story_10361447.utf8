                                                                                                                 SUNLIGHT ON THE GARDEN                                                            
	Rahoul B. Singh dedicates his GARDENS OF DELIGHT: INDIAN GARDENS THROUGH THE AGES (Roli, Rs 1,295) to that unsung hero of landscape and garden design, the gardener or maali, who toils selflessly in the summer sun to give us those delightful landscapes. Singh is an architect as well as a historian of architecture. So he combines practical experience, art history, and aesthetic theory and philosophy with the political history of India to write this substantial and copiously illustrated book.        
	Gardening, for Singh, is the taming of a landscape: Historically used as a political tool to ratify ones social position, or to establish an umbilical link with history, in as much as a means to cultivate herbal medicines or for the sheer sensory pleasures that one can derive from them, gardens have and continue to play a variety of roles. A history of public and private gardens in India will have to strike a balance between concepts, allegories and iconographies of the patterning of land in religion, art, literature and mythology on the one hand, and on the other, the political, imperial, colonial and contemporary uses of the garden that leave different kinds of marking on the land. As with Singhs book, this also becomes a history of book-illustration, painting, cartography and photography  of different ways of representing depth, height and perspective in two dimensions, and therefore of encoding cultural memory. Inevitably, what unfolds as well is the story of power and wealth. Singh brings together a wide range of reading and pictorial illustration (the photographs are of variable quality and sometimes incompletely captioned). Also, the pictures tend to run parallel to the writing, calling for a tighter interweaving of the verbal and the visual. After looking at a beautiful or intriguing picture, one found oneself looking in vain for some commentary on it in the text  a commentary that Singh seems eminently capable of providing. Occasionally, his sentences are more maze than garden, and could have done with a bit of pruning and planning. This book is rich with ideas that needed a firmer chronological backbone and a clearer illustrative line.

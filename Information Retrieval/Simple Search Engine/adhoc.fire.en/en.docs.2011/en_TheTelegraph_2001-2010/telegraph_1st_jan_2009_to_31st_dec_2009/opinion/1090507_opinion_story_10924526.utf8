The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | The truth about business schools
                                                                                                                 THE TRUTH ABOUT BUSINESS SCHOOLS                                  Commentarao - S.L. Rao                           An incomplete education                                        
	India is yet to engage in the debate about the relevance of management education. This debate is now widespread in the United States of America and in the United Kingdom. It was initiated by Sumantra Ghoshal, who died young but after a career in Indian Oil and a brilliant PhD in the US. He was also a scholar with a global reputation in teaching and researching at INSEAD and then at the London Business School. His last article probably has made management academics introspect as to who is responsible for the Greed is Good mindset of those who hold masters of business administration degrees in the world.         
	Ghoshals argument was that the collapse of companies like Worldcom and Enron, to which we can add the collapse in recent months of many American and British banks and financial institutions and of Satyam in India, was due to the culture of greed. People rate the quality of management schools not by the record of scholarship of their faculty but by their job placement record and by the levels of salaries paid to the young graduates. If bright young people are taught to value themselves in purely monetary terms, they cannot be blamed for focusing only on handsome remunerations when they head large corporations.               
	This article is not about the values taught by management education. That needs correction if India is to avoid going the way of the American enterprise system. Entrepreneurship in the US is not a result of formal management education as it is also not in India. Entrepreneurs have evolved from need, ambition, seeing opportunity where others saw difficulties, anticipating needs and meeting them. Management education teaches tools, techniques, skills and context, not leadership, or how to build and get most out of teams. It does what any good educational programme must do, which is to observe the environment, teach analytical skills and discover data, information and earlier experiences in published literature from which students can find applications to their problems.        
	Indians have learnt through experience, with interfering governments in a command and control economy till 1991, to anticipate government policies and find ways to make them favourable to their needs. The Birlas, Jindals, Goenkas, Ambanis and many others have, over the years, built vast industrial empires in this way. More recently, information technology entrepreneurs took advantage of a favourable opportunity in the global market before the government could interfere to control it.         
	All of them followed some simple rules in building their businesses. Understanding and tracking the environment are essential to any successful business. Hindustan Unilever anticipated liberalization many years before 1991, and identified a slew of companies that it wanted to take over when it was possible to do so. It did, and acquired leaders in select product areas in quick succession  Kissan packaged food products, Kwality Ice Cream, Modern Bread, and Brooke Bond  to give them a commanding position in the foods business in India. Similarly, when the recession was on the horizon, companies that built cash piles were able to acquire businesses at low prices. They had begun to tighten their costs control and improve productivity when they anticipated a slowdown in the economy.         
	In 1992, when the National Council for Applied Economic Research showed that the poor also constituted a large and profitable market, few companies got the message that designing products for the poor did not mean giving cheap commodities, but providing functional ones at affordable prices. Todays recession has made companies see the potential of rural and small-town markets among the poor. The development of consumption in these markets will itself lead to improvement in the income and living standards of the poor.         
	Tracking social trends is essential for any top manager. If Hero Honda is thriving in the two-wheeler market, it is because the company anticipated the demand for personal transportation in a rural India that was receiving vast investments in rural infrastructure. If Pepsi worldwide is on a growth path compared to others, it is because the chief executive officer (an Indian) spotted the trend that people were realizing that changed food habits could lead to better health. She took the company into sports drinks, non-carbonated beverages and less transfats in processed food products to control obesity and cholesterol.         
	A few years ago, Sony and other Japanese firms were preferred over others in wrist watches, entertainment products and white goods. This is no longer true in India. Here, Korean companies like LG and Samsung have replaced their Japanese counterparts. The irony is that the Korean companies were originally assemblers of the same Japanese products but they learnt to produce quality products with better design. By putting Indian executives in charge, the Koreans had undisturbed labour relations and improved productivity.               
	Companies that ignore the global concern over rapid climate change will not be as successful as those that dont. Energy efficient processes, products and their designs, recycling water, pollution control, re-using heat generated during production for the co-generation of energy and so on will give better costs and also make consumers perceive such companies in a friendly way. Going for large scale production in plants and creating, rather than merely exploiting, existing market sizes have made Reliance companies successful. Another management lesson that does not need classrooms is to plan execution so that it is achieved fast.         
	Businesses that try to imitate what has worked in other countries or convert the promoters hobby into a business might also be buying trouble. Airlines cannot be thought of without adequate airports. Apart from the cost of capital, airlines need sensibly priced aviation fuel, fast turnaround time of airplanes, affordable terminal costs, and airport charges that are competitive. When these conditions do not exist, such as in India, airlines lose money. When someone without an understanding of the implications of the absence of these conditions starts a low-cost airline, he is bound to fail.         
	Management education is just another kind of education. Successful businesses can be created without it, as they have been by many over the years. The value systems that management education inculcates in its students are not in the interest of nation-building. Other disciplines in education might provide more acceptable values.

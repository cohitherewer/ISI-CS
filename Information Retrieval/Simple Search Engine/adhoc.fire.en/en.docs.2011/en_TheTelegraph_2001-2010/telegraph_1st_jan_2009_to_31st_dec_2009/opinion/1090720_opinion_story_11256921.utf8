	The people of West Bengal now have yet another reason to flock to state-run hospitals. A few days ago, the minister for health and rural development, Surjya Kanta Mishra, had declared that government hospitals remain perpetually overcrowded because of the exemplary service they deliver. That, according to Mr Mishra, explains the everyday reality of two or more patients to a bed, or dozens suffering in silence on squalid hospital floors. The quality of healthcare is such that people do not hesitate to put their lives at peril to access it. They dont seem to mind the resident strays who have made it a habit to nibble on newborn babies, or the merrily cavorting roaches and rats, or even the lack of basic medical equipment. (Isnt it curious that state government employees were promised subsidized treatment at private hospitals as a pre-election sop?) The state healthcare department has now resolved to improve its already high levels of excellence by increasing the amount of money allotted to feed each patient in government hospitals. Soon, gone would be the days when patients complained of rotten eggs, stale fish, watery milk or pebbly rice. The princely sum of Rs 43.06 would be now set aside to feed each adult (instead of the earlier Rs 22.37) while a child would get Rs 21.53 worth of food compared to the previous average of Rs 16-18.        
	Like all quick-fix measures, this too smacks of hare-brained thinking from its very inception. The entire plan seems to exist only at the level of an idea, however well-meaning it might be. There is no attempt to understand how, why and at what stage things went so horribly wrong. Would an increase in the daily food budget be good enough to ensure quality control? Is there a system to make erring suppliers morally accountable? Who is going to ensure that the right amount of food is reaching every patient? Or, for that matter, that those who cook these meals and distribute them adhere to basic standards of hygiene?

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | An experiment in truth
                                                                                                                 AN EXPERIMENT IN TRUTH                              Theatre

	Rudraprasad Senguptas Bengali adaptation of Luigi Pirandellos play, Six Characters in Search of an Author, directed by Ajitesh Bandyopadhyay, premiered at Muktangan in 1961. Its success was a significant boost to the then upcoming group Nandikar. But after some revival shows in 1983, the play dropped out of the local circuit till Ananda Lal and Jadavpur University Department of English (JUDE) presented it in English. The latest show was hosted by the Italian consulate at Gyan Manch this April.         
	When this play premiered in Rome, there had been a riot because the audience felt they had been cheated with something that was not really theatre and was amoral. But over the years, the audiences outlook has changed. Thanks to experimental theatre of all kinds, and the constant bombardment of news of sexual exploitation, the shock and surprise have worn thin.         
	Yet, perhaps it is because of the time lapse that one is drawn to the other aspects of the work which may have been lost in the initial surprise. Beyond the swiftly oscillating moods and queries on identity, social compulsion, moral values, reality and fiction, life and art, one feels a presence more strongly: the presence of the poet whom Pirandello describes in the 1925 preface to the play as one who secretly watches the experiment from a distance and, at the same time, is busy creating his own play with and by the experiment.         
	The student actors may have been too young for their roles, but one has to commend their talent in all departments of production. Prakriti Dutta Mukherjee (picture) gave a splendid performance as Stepdaughter. Unlike Nandikars life-like sex worker, the JUDE Stepdaughter is true to the authors description  dashing, almost impudently beautiful. The Father (played by Saravanan Mani), insolent son (Soumya Subhra Guha) and Mother (Sangeetha Gangadharan) also fit the bill. The mask-like make-up for the Boy and the Child accentuates the unreality of these half-sketched characters. But it is Madame Pace (Sahana Bhose) who remains unforgettable. Wearing the fantastic get-up of a cartoon character, complete with a brightly coloured wig, Pace (whom Nandikar had replaced with Banwarilal) appears suddenly like a miracle. This appearance was for Pirandello a highpoint when the poets fantasy is seen in its act of creation and there is a break, a sudden change in the level of reality of the scene.         
	Ananda Lal deserves praise for the stirring performances by JUDE. Six Characters is sixteenth in the JUDE series of annual performances. Pirandello follows a long line of playwrights like Euripides, Kalidasa, Shakespeare, Brecht, Ionesco and Pinter. It would be heartening if other educational institutions take the cue.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A modest success
                                                                                                                 A MODEST SUCCESS                          - India missed cashing in on the goodwill Hillary brought to it        Diplomacy - K.P. Nayar                                                        
	Hillary Clintons three-day visit to India will go down in the annals of Indo-US relations as a classic example of how the United Progressive Alliance government scored a self-goal: much like the ham-handed Indo-Pakistan summit in Egypt and the Group of Eight meeting in Italy.        
	Not since Andrei Gromyko of the Soviet Union in the 1960s and the eventful 70s has India had a foreign interlocutor as accommodating as Clinton  with the possible exception of Dawa Tsering, who somewhat matched Gromyko in the number of years he served as Bhutans foreign minister. Clinton came to India to be loved, and to be seen back among her people on American TV screens as being loved: as the original mover of relations between India and the United States of America to their current heights during her landmark trip to India as First Lady in 1995. This was a trip for which she pored over notes and photographs of a similar visit to New Delhi by Jacqueline Kennedy in 1962.        
	She was unlike any other official visitor from the US in recent times  and certainly unlike any other female visitor on State business. Clintons words and deeds in Mumbai and New Delhi, for instance, were a world apart from those of Carla Hills, the first woman appointed by President George H.W. Bush to his cabinet in 1988. As the first woman US trade representative, Hills went to New Delhi primarily to pull up Indian leaders for keeping their economy closed  then  and for providing leadership to the third world in the Uruguay Round trade negotiations that led to the creation of the World Trade Organization.        
	Clintons immediate predecessor, Condoleezza Rice, told one thing in private to leaders in New Delhi and another in public. She used Americas relationship with India to advance her profile in the US and her personal standing in the White House, where she had been exposed as having no grip on anything except the Soviet Union, which had ceased to exist by the time she was ready to take up big jobs in Washington.              
	Clintons visit was, therefore, tailor-made for India to make a big splash in the US, where the country has suffered an erosion in its profile and is much less the flavour of the season since Barack Obama became US president. Indias image and its standing in the US are clearly slipping, compared to the good times the country had during the eight years that George W. Bush was US president. Take, for example, a sampling of articles on India in the American media in the run-up to Clintons visit.        
	Strobe Talbott, president of the Brookings Institution in Washington, is a close associate of Clinton and her husband: as deputy secretary of state in Bill Clintons administration, he led the most comprehensive strategic dialogue with India after Atal Bihari Vajpayees government conducted nuclear tests in 1998. Talbott wrote in Financial Times two days before Clinton left for Mumbai, reflecting the Obama administrations hope that Indias Congress party-led government, now that it has been returned to power with an increased mandate, will join the US in tightening the verification authorities of the International Atomic Energy Agency, accelerating negotiations to stop the production of fissile material (the stuff at the core of nuclear warheads) and bringing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty into force.        
	Or take an editorial in The New York Times on the day Clinton emplaned for Mumbai. India wants to be seen as a major world power. For that to happen, it will have to drop its pretensions to non-alignment and stake out strong and constructive positions. President Obama and Mrs Clinton say they consider India a vital partner in building a stable world. Now they have to encourage India to behave like one.        
	As Clinton left India for Thailand, the clear impression was that wherever the government  be it the Union government in New Delhi or the Maharashtra government in Mumbai  was involved, India defeated itself and lost a chance to bolster the countrys standing in the US or to significantly advance Indian interests vis--vis the US.        
	Clinton invested considerable personal effort in preparing her itinerary in India  especially her unusual two-day stay in Mumbai to meet the citys corporate leaders and poor women who are trying to lift themselves out of the tough grind of life, before moving to New Delhi for textbook meetings with ministers. For many of her predecessors, such as Rice, Madeleine Albright or Warren Christopher, the end of their four-year term as secretary of state also marked the end of their life in high-profile public office. Clinton knows that 2012 will not be the end of her public life or that of her husband. She is looking for continued support from the increasingly wealthy Indian American community in her future political endeavours, and the time she spent in Mumbai was a long-term investment towards that objective.        
	Clintons interest in getting India to sign the end-use monitoring agreement for defence acquisitions was as much motivated by policy as by the desire of her friend, Ratan Tata, to enter the Indian defence production market with US collaboration, for which the end-use pact is a pre-requisite. Clintons association with Tata Consultancy Services during her years as a US senator from New York has, in fact, been so controversial that Obamas camp criticized her during the Democratic presidential primaries as a supporter of the Tata effort in her state as a leading outsourcer of American jobs.        
	It was Clintons hope that her activities in Mumbai would be beamed back into American drawing rooms through weekend TV programmes with the right mixture of Indian colour, poverty tourism such as the Rs 44,000 she spent at a shop run by the Self-Employed Womens Association and the twin prospects of Indian corporate investment in the US and creation of American jobs through exports and infrastructure investment in India. Because of the clumsiness of the Maharashtra government, however, the images that went back to the US were of the high-handedness of the Mumbai police in preventing an old woman near the SEWA shop from visiting her ailing son or of a father in the city who could not take his six year-old daughter to school. These images fed into the stereotype of a third world country unable to do business with America on equal terms, a notion that India has been trying to live down in recent years.              
	In New Delhi, it was worse although Clinton was there for only one full day. On Mondays ABC programme, Good Morning America, everything the host said about Clinton had to do with how the minister of state for environment, Jairam Ramesh, had taken issue with the Americans over Indias greenhouse gas emissions. It was a proverbial case of cutting off the nose to spite the face because the real target of Rameshs outburst at the meeting with Clinton was Shyam Saran, the prime ministers special envoy on climate change, with whom the minister is engaged in a furious turf war in the run-up to the climate change conference in Copenhagen in December. Clinton maturely refused to join issue with Ramesh, but instead, went along with his rationale, once again demonstrating that she was not in New Delhi to lecture the Indians.        
	The unnecessary mess that protocol officials in New Delhi created by scheduling a meeting with Sonia Gandhi for Sunday, cancelling it and then rescheduling it for Monday, would only have served to remind Clinton of a similar incident in Washington, which the secretary of state would have loved to forget. When Sonia was in the US in June 2001, the Indian embassy in Washington advised the cancellation of their meeting on the churlish ground that Bush had by then come to power and would take offence at a meeting between Clinton and Sonia.        
	It is a tribute to Clintons talent in setting her agenda that notwithstanding these and other Indian gaffes, the visit was a modest success. India missed an opportunity to cash in on the goodwill that she brought to Mumbai and New Delhi, which would have stood the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, in good stead when he visits the US later this year.

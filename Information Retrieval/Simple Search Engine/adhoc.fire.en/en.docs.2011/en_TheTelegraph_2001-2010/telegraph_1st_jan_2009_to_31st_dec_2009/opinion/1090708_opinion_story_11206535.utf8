The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | wrong campus
                                                                                                                 WRONG CAMPUS                                                    
	There is a yawning gap between a proposal and its acceptance and implementation. The finance minister, Pranab Mukherjee, has assured sceptics that the idea of establishing a campus of the Aligarh Muslim University in Murshidabad was mooted by the highest decision-making body of the AMU. But the Union government accepted the idea and fleshed it out, and Mr Mukherjee allocated Rs 25 crore this year to establish the infrastructure for the campus. In a strange convergence of views between the government of India and the government of West Bengal, the latter welcomed the proposal. There are no realistic grounds to support and welcome the setting-up of a campus of the AMU in Murshidabad. The reasons behind the idea are communal and therefore dangerous. Murshidabad is a Muslim-dominated district, and it is being assumed very glibly that a Muslim university will be best placed to spread higher education in the area. It is not unfair to suspect that the proposal is driven by the desire to please the Muslims. What should actually be done for furthering the cause of education in Murshidabad is exactly the opposite of starting a campus of a Muslim university. The process of educating the Muslims of the district about a world beyond Islam should begin immediately. There are very good strategic reasons for starting such a process in a district that shares a porous border with Bangladesh and is therefore particularly vulnerable to infiltration.        
	What is utterly incomprehensible is the choice of AMU. The desire to educate the people of Murshidabad, Muslim or not, is perfectly understandable. For this purpose, a new university could easily be set up in the district. Or a university like Visva-Bharati could be asked to set up a campus there. If Visva-Bharati did not meet the governments high standards of excellence, Jawaharlal Nehru University could be asked. The argument that the proposal came from AMU and therefore was accepted is ludicrous. AMU is not known for its pursuit of all-round excellence. Except for its contribution to Mughal history, made about three decades ago, very little emanating from AMU merits the adjective, excellent. The university once supported Partition and has been known for harbouring communal ideas. West Bengal, true to its tradition, should be kept free of both Muslim and Hindu universities.

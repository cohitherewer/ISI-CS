                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        GENES AND LIFE                                                    
	Human beings, like other forms of life, are mapped and coded in many complex and inscrutable ways. Among these, genes pose one of the greatest challenges to human self-knowledge and to thinking about the past and the future of mankind. Recently in India, two kinds of work with genes seem to have come to a head, putting Indian geneticists and the institutions they work for in the international community of genetic research. First, a consortium of Asian scientists, coordinated by the Genome Institute of Singapore, has analysed variations in genetic sequences from almost 2,000 people representing 70-odd populations from across Asia, to work out a sort of genetic pan-Asianism, although it would be hasty to conclude from this that all eastern Asian populations had roots in India. But through a peculiar combination of discovering what is shared and what is diverse, this kind of genetic research into the human past and into patterns of migration can radically change notions of race and ethnicity, dispelling myths of purity as well as difference. On another scale, scientists at the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology and the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research claim to have successfully mapped the human genome sequence for the first time in India, thereby joining  a bit late in the day  a club of five nations. The benefits of this are more directly medical, from predicting diseases in individuals to advanced forms of treatment.        
	As with all such highly specialized and immensely expensive forms of knowledge, transparency, accountability and ethics remain a serious concern here. To make its most esoteric findings intelligible to ordinary people is a special responsibility of scientific research  in this case, more so, since this is knowledge that alters the understanding of life, death and human well-being. Predicting disease is both a comforting and an alarming idea  think of how, for instance, it might affect criteria for eligibility to health insurance. Also, seeing genes as destiny, the primary cause of why people are who and what they are, may endorse a particularly dangerous form of biological determinism. From cancer to criminality, genes cannot be the easy, scientific answer to the complexities of human behaviour or the simple solution to human ills. Geneticists should ensure that the right kind of information is transmitted to lay people about the nature of genes.

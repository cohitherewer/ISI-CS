	Is it really chaos or a fog of deception? The passage of the West Bengal health regulatory authority bill in the assembly has struck both the Opposition and the partners of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) dumb. The bill, proposed a year ago and changed according to the recommendations of the standing committee, was being resisted by the Forward Bloc and other Left Front partners because it would send the wrong signals to the rural population just before the assembly elections. The bill legalizes the sending of rural health practitioners, holders of a three-year diploma, instead of doctors, to government health centres in villages. Left Front allies argue that villagers would feel they were being fobbed off with an inferior medical service. The Opposition has been protesting that half-doctors would further endanger the villagers health. The monitoring necessary to ensure the quality of the diploma training and the limits of the rural practice is a distant dream. A government that cannot even monitor its urban and suburban hospitals, or get doctors to attend to their duties in villages, would make a hash of ensuring that its rural practitioners practise nothing more than first aid, elementary treatment according to given instructions, and only minor surgery  terrifying thought  and write birth and death certificates. Or that they do not call themselves doctors.        
	All such niceties were done away with when the minister for health, Surjya Kanta Mishra, pushed through the bill in an assembly emptied of the Opposition as well as of most Left Front partners, and, stranger still, after the CPI(M) had announced through the person of its state secretary, Biman Bose, that the bill would be sent first to a select committee. Mr Mishra said that he had not known about this decision  there was at least a two-and-a-half hour gap between Mr Boses statement and Mr Mishras final spurt of decisiveness  and also that the bill could not be sent to the select committee at the stage it was in. Perhaps the party does not talk to its ministers. Or perhaps it does not bother to discuss issues that affect the lives of people so nearly. It just violates all norms to push through a bill even if it is resisted by its own partners, and then celebrates democratic rule. It is a neat little trick, and the CPI(M) has had lots of time to perfect it. Time spent in making the healthcare system work would have been wasted.

	From despair to delicacies              
	VENUS CROSSING (Penguin, Rs 275) by Kalpana Swaminathan is an excellent collection of short stories that bear the unmistakable mark of the authors training as a surgeon in more than one way. To begin with, the stuff of these tales is the foul rag and bone shop of the body, laid bare in unsparing detail. Further, Swaminathan employs language with a clinical precision, chiselling away at emotions to arrive at perfect metaphors. Euthanasia, a surreal tale of a marriage gone horribly wrong, keeps the reader on tenterhooks about the fate of its protagonists till the end. Terminally ill characters appear in most of the stories, which makes them morbid no doubt but there are always moments of redemption, often achieved through the subtle mastery of language. In The Arrangement, an unnamed lady, dying of cancer, wakes up in an indigo blaze of pain. The passage then goes on to speculate on a full spectrum of colour-coded pains inching slowly towards the inevitable  death, which is purple, the soft dark purple of velvet. Almost black. In another harrowing tale, Incident at Abu Ghraib, a girl is deeply upset when her mother claims to have understood why Lynndie England, the notorious US marine, got herself photographed abusing prisoners of war. Apart from the twists typical to her genre, Swaminathan offers a profound insight into the labyrinthine alleys of the human psyche. Even as she writes about death and decay with an astonishing, and unsqueamish, facility (Patrick White and J.M. Coetzee lurk behind Swaminathans prose), there is nothing cheaply sensational about her work.                                
	THE ESSENTIAL MARATHI COOKBOOK (Penguin, Rs 350) by Kaumudi Marath compiles over 250 recipes that are not only supposed to capture the flavours of Maharashtra but also promise to be user-friendly at a time when home-cooked food is becoming a rarity in many urban households. Coming from a food historian based in the US but grounded in her tradition, this is a comprehensive volume with a fair mix of vegetarian and non-vegetarian delicacies. From something as basic as phulkas to the exotic bangdyachi koshimbir, or dried mackerel salad, gourmets can try out a range of dishes, sinful as well as nutritious. In case you wish to find out the history of certain styles of cooking, the logic behind the processes, or the calorific value, you would be benefited by the Introduction, which gives a fairly detailed account of all these aspects of Maharashtrian cuisine. It also charts out the historical influences that have shaped Maharashtrian taste buds.

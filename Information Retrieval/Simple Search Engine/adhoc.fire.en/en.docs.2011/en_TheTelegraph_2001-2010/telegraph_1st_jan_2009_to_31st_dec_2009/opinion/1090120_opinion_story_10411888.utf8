                                                                                                                 MAN OF COLOUR                                                    
	A black man will enter the White House as president for the first time today. As he lifts his hand to take oath, Barack Obama, while he rejoices at the fulfilment of dreams that his presidency epitomizes for all Afro-American people, will also be forced to think about the immediate legacy he is receiving. The shoes of George W. Bush are not easy ones to step into. This is not because Mr Bush was a charismatic president who was popular and successful, but because he leaves behind a complex and tangled inheritance. No president of the United States of America, in recent memory, has demitted office with the country in the stranglehold of an unprecedented economic crisis whose duration and turns no one can fathom. Mr Bush also leaves the nation in a mess vis--vis Iraq, a country that he invaded with no provocation. In West Asia, where Israel found in Mr Bush a very trustworthy friend, the cycle of violence continues. In South Asia, where he embraced India in very special ties of friendship, the US is unable to adequately help India in its battle against terrorism that originates in Pakistan, the long-term ally of the US. These are bits of Mr Bushs legacy that Mr Obama will find tough to negotiate, especially if he is to honour his commitment to change. What he will remain thankful for to his predecessor is the fact that Mr Bush made the US a safer place after September 11, 2001.        
	Mr Obama, in the course of a remarkable life, has gone through many turning points. He perhaps faces the most important one today afternoon in Washington DC. After he formally assumes office, there will be more attention paid to what he does than on what he says. People in the US, and elsewhere in the world, will expect his powerful rhetoric to be backed by powerful action. It is difficult to predict how Mr Obama will use the power that he will enjoy. From the time he won his election till today, when he will take office, the problems of the outgoing presidency have multiplied. There is the growing fear that despite the overarching promise of change, regarding Israel, Mr Obama will stay on the policy tracks laid down by Mr Bush.        
	There are other areas of domestic policy in which expectations from Mr Obama are very high. Many believe that he will reduce healthcare costs and cut taxes. There is also the expectation that State intervention, by way of increased public spending, will become the reigning economic doctrine to resurrect the economy. Mr Obama, a man known to be articulate in his views, has not expressed himself on these matters. The protocol alibi that the US can only have one president at a time will no longer be valid from the afternoon of January 20, 2009. Mr Obama has a nation to refashion, a destiny to reclaim for his people. The burden is awesome.

                                                                                                               DIARY
                  
	 If Mayavati has failed to put the right price on Dalit dignity, so has Rita Bahuguna Joshi. Her comment about the Dalit chief minister has scuppered the Congresss attempt to woo UPs Dalits and rubbed the community the wrong way. The Congresss laboured defence of Joshi made it obvious that the party isnt going to forgive her for her remark anytime soon. Regrets about her tasteless remark have come from Sonia and Rahul Gandhi, but Joshi seems to have found an unlikely defender in Digvijay Singh. The AICC gen-sec was so charged up with the idea of defending Joshi that he was even planning to travel to Moradabad till the party high command shot down the plan. Congressmen have found Diggy Rajas hawkish stand against Mayavati somewhat intriguing. As the Madhya Pradesh CM, Singh had conscientiously tried to keep the BSP chief in good humour, and even tried to implement a Dalit agenda, much to the annoyance of the upper castes in MP who have, till date, not gone back to supporting the Congress. Now then, is Diggy betting on the wrong horse?                
	 Another Congress strategy seems to be in peril. Although the party could not resist the induction of tainted ministers like A Raja into the cabinet, it tried its best to offset the damage. It appointed Sachin Pilot as minister of state in the telecommunications ministry, possibly to keep a tab on Raja. But the rift between Pilot and Raja is now such that both ministers no longer attend any programme together. Meanwhile, the government has appointed an empowered GoM for the 3G spectrum headed by the finance minister. Time for daggers to be drawn.                            
	 A woman journalist fainted during the PMs return flight from Egypt. Bizarre as it may sound, this was the fourth incident in which a scribe has fallen ill in the prime ministers presence. One journo suffered a heart attack during a meeting with Manmohan Singh while another had suffered an epileptic fit while the PM was speaking at a party forum in Nainital some years ago.                            
	 The Communist Party of India (Marxist) still makes news, but for the wrong reasons. This time, it has to do with the infighting in Kerala. The Kerala CM, VS Achuthanandan, has been shown the exit route from the politburo, although he retains his chair in the government. Achuthanandan is one of the few surviving founding members of the party, and the CPI(M), scarred by its recent treatment of another senior party leader who presided over the Lok Sabha, doesnt seem willing to risk infamy again. But Karat believes, and so does the party, that much of the Kerala mess is the handiwork of the Congress. As proof, it has cited Achuthanandans recent meeting with a principal secretary of the PMO. Nothing much seems to have come of it, but the Lefts suspicions have got stronger. The party is keen on pressurizing Achuthanandan so that he quits his chair. That way, the partys hands will be clean, and, of course, it will still be in the news.                            
	 Mumbai is getting ready for two big bashes in August. One is an AICC session, planned to present Rahul Gandhi as the victor of the 2009 elections. The Congress also intends to kickstart its campaign for the Maharashtra assembly polls in this manner. The other event  a chintan shivir  is being organized by the Bharatiya Janata Party, the Congresss principal rival. Unlike the upbeat Congress, the BJP wants to focus on intra-party feuds and to nail Arun Shourie, Yashwant Sinha and Jaswant Singh who are making news at the expense of the party.                            
	 Some blame it on the stars. But the Telengana Rashtriya Samiti is citing vaastu as the reason behind the debacle in the recent Lok Sabha elections. The partys leaders vouch that its poor showing has nothing to do with the TRSs waning popularity or its loss of credibility. According to these wise men, things were fine for the TRS till it operated from its rented offices at Jaladrushyam near Tank Bund and from MLA colony in Banjara Hills.       
	The partys troubles began when it moved into the Telengana Bhavan, which resembles the White House. The building has on it the shadow of a huge temple right behind it. According to vaastu shastra, the shadow of a temple or hill on any structure brings ill luck. More reason for the TRS to continue with its search for a new address?              
	Footnote
      
	 Didi and dada from Bengal get along quite famously. When Pranab Mukherjee was busy responding to budget related queries, Mamata Banerjee is reported to have been busy sketching. Sitting at the rear end of the Lok Sabha, Banerjee drew six sketches and then distributed it among the Trinamul faithful. It was not clear what the minister drew, but the smile on the faces of the MPs said a lot. The other day, however, Banerjee called on the FM in Parliament, and that prompted the canteenwallahs to put in their best. The snacks were so good that Pranabda quietly tucked into one alur chop after another. Didis favourite chef from Bengal is supposed to have been brought to Delhi to train the railways catering staff. Delhi has gone a long way to accommodate Mamata. Pranabda, however, was not willing to oblige her when she demanded he waive the service tax on the railways. Thus far and no further?

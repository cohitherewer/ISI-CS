	 Are paths already being laid to bring the prodigal son back to the family? No? But the first bricks are well in place if this story about the Jaswant Singh saga is anything to go by. Singh, it is being said, is guilty not of what he has written in his latest book, but of allowing his publishers and the media to kick up a huge controversy in the belief that it would help boost sales . He has done it before  as when he wrote about a CIA mole being in the PV Narasimha Rao government in a previous book  and got away with it. Hence the attempt to pull it through this time as well. Questions are being raised about whether the publicity blitz did justice to the actual contents of the book. In the book, it is now said, Singh has made no effort to absolve the pipe-smoking, ham-eating MA Jinnah for the partition. All he does is partly blame the obduracy of the Congressmen in general, and of Jawaharlal Nehru in particular, to politically accommodate Jinnah. Have the sanghis jumped the gun then? Well, they can still say that they did not read between the lines.          
	 The Assam governor, Syed Sibtey Razi, is on a sticky wicket. When Razi was in the Ranchi Raj Bhavan, some members of his personal staff allegedly indulged in acts of omission and commission. While they were being investigated, Razi was shifted to Assam. Now a section of the UPA wants Razi to quit so that the Congress can take a high moral ground in election-bound Jharkhand. But Razi, who hails from Amethi, is reluctant to step down. During his recent visit to the capital, he asked his well-wishers to plead his case with the Congress leadership. Razis line of defence is premised on the fate of another tainted governor  if ND Tiwari, facing a paternity row, can take cover in constitutional immunity, why not him?                            
	 An M.Phil in Development Economics, educated in Trinity College, Cambridge, but a farmer by profession. Guess who? None other than Rahul Gandhi, Congress general-secretary and the yet unmarried son of the late Rajiv and Sonia Gandhi. That is how the information goes in the official website of the Lok Sabha. Looks like Rahuls closeness to the have-nots of UP has finally had its desired effect.                            
	 Lalu Prasad has become vegetarian again, and the debacle in the last elections is said to have something to do with it. He had become shakahari on the instructions of Lord Shankar, who appeared to Lalu in a dream at the time he was in jail for the fodder scam. That bad phase over, Lalu apparently went back to a non-veg diet. But no more of it, now that he needs Lord Shankars blessings once again to come back on track.                            
	 24 Akbar Road is getting a fresh coat after a gap of three years, but the recession seems to have hit the ruling party badly. The white-wash job is being done only on the exteriors. The inner walls will continue to nest flies and lizards, courtesy AICCs treasurer, Motilal Vora, who took a few draconian measures. Take, for instance, the ban on chai-paani served to the guests. Vora is said to have acted after the discovery of a scam of sorts when disproportionately more tea and cold drinks were being consumed compared to the number of visitors. Predictably, Vora has disappointed many. One of them was heard wondering aloud about who footed the bill for Voras obsessive habit of chewing paan.                             
	 Although recuperating in a Singapore hospital, the Samajwadi Party general-secretary, Amar Singh, has his eyes and ears glued to the domestic political scene. To the extent that recently he addressed a party meeting in Agra through video conferencing. But it is not all work for Amar, given that his extended family is with him as well. Apparently, Amitabh Bachchan has been spotted frequently, shopping or jogging in the vicinity. In the evenings, at the plush service apartment where the Bachchans are staying, Big B is said to be spending time reading out poems of his father, Harivansh Rai Bachchan.

	 When it comes to her son, or to animal rights, Maneka Gandhi does not mince words. She was recently at loggerheads with the mayor of Bareilly, who also happens to be the wife of a local Congress MP. The mayor is said to have ordered for the forceful removal of monkeys from the town and their subsequent deportment to a nearby forest. But Maneka, whose Lok Sabha seat, Aonla, includes some parts of Bareilly, is mightily agitated. She even met the mayor, Supriya Aron, to seek a better deal for the monkeys. Maneka reportedly demanded that if the monkeys had to be evicted, they would have to be taken away in pairs. Aron was aghast. She wondered how the local municipal officials could identify monkey-couples. What if a monkey was out with a good friend, who was romantically involved with another monkey? Last heard, such trivial talk has left Maneka fuming.

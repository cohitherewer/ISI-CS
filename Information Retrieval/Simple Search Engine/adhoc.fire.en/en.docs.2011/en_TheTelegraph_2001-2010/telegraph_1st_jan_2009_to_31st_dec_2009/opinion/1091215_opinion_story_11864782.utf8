	It need not be a bad policy to take one step forward and two steps back. The political crisis in Andhra Pradesh should be a warning to New Delhi to step back and ponder the issue of statehood demands. The stir for a separate state in the Darjeeling hills will test the negotiating skills of both New Delhi and Calcutta much more than demands for separate states elsewhere in India. Darjeelings geopolitical importance demands that both the Centre and the West Bengal government deal with the stir with caution and prudence. The statehood demand has been the prime mover of Darjeelings politics for several decades. The current agitation by the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha, though, is refreshingly different in form from the violent ways of the Gorkha National Liberation Front in the 1980s. But the two movements also have much in common. Both reflected the peoples aspiration for a separate state. And both led to a complete collapse of administration in the hills. Also, as during the GNLFs movement, normal life is disrupted again in the hills. If the people of Darjeeling feel that their political and economic aspirations have been neglected, no government can afford to dismiss such sentiments.         
	But the demand for a separate state, in Darjeeling as in other places, is not entirely about development issues. Identity politics has much to do with it. This makes New Delhis task a very complicated one. Smaller states may be a better idea in terms of administrative advantages. But social and economic indicators from the new states such as Jharkhand, Uttaranchal and Chhattisgarh do not indicate major success stories. Most statehood demands now are based on the premise of differences in identity and culture. Compared to the complexities that this involves, the linguistic division of states was a much simpler matter. Politicians in Bengal who rarely agree on anything are unanimous in their opposition to a partition of West Bengal. But this is no substitute for a workable strategy to resolve the issues in Darjeeling. The Centres interlocutor for the talks with the GJM cannot act like the states politicians. New Delhi and Calcutta have to seriously examine why the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council failed to meet the peoples aspiration. In taking a call on Darjeeling, they cannot afford to ignore the historical context of Himalayan politics.

                                                                                                                 THE ELECTORAL PROCESS                          - Why the Indian general elections are without historical parallel					 					      ANDR BTEILLE                                                       
	The general elections in India attract attention throughout the world. If India enjoys the reputation of being the largest democracy in the world, it is due in no small measure to the fact that it is able to hold regular elections to its Parliament and its assemblies that are reasonably free and fair. When the first general elections were held in 1951-52, not everyone believed that the exercise would be successful or sustainable. But the sceptics have been confounded, and the country is getting ready for a new round of elections.        
	In their scope and scale, Indias general elections are without historical parallel. The sheer size and diversity of the population make the task of planning, organizing and conducting the elections a daunting exercise. The Indian electorate is not only very large and diverse, but it is also highly dispersed, and no section of the population, no matter how remote or inaccessible, can be left out of the electoral process. The Election Commission has been rightly commended for undertaking and accomplishing successfully a monumental exercise with remarkable skill, ingenuity and stamina, while ensuring that the process remains open and transparent. Some praise is due also to the voters who have braved inclement weather and threats of violence in order to exercise their franchise.               
	The significance of universal adult franchise in a deeply hierarchical society has been underlined by students of society and politics in India for a long time. M.N. Srinivas, who was a close observer of the national scene since the time of Independence, said, One wonders if the framers of the Constitution, moved as they undoubtedly were by egalitarian ideals, had any inkling of the profound force they were unleashing in Indian polity and society through opting for adult franchise. After saying that Indians were living in a revolution, he added, Its symbol is not the gun but the ballot box.         
	The general elections bring out the best in our public life, but they also bring out the worst in it. Here I would like to focus not so much on the outcome of the elections as on the electoral process itself. The elections provide the occasion for people from all walks of life to express themselves openly and without inhibition. The ballot itself may be secret, but the campaign that precedes it is open. If the test of democracy is that it enables citizens to express a diversity of opinions, this has by now become an established practice. The freedom of expression and association enshrined in the Constitution takes a concrete form at the time of the general elections. The run-up to the elections is long, and the voting itself is spread over several weeks. All this provides ample time for ordinary voters to discuss the virtues and defects of the various parties and their candidates.         
	The electoral process brings the mighty to the doorsteps of the humble. It creates a kind of social levelling whose symbolic significance cannot be denied. The Indian voter, no matter how lowly his social station, has learnt to exercise his choice, and no candidate, no matter how exalted his political standing, can take the voters choice for granted. Voters in India can be wilful, intractable and unpredictable, and woe betide the candidate who fails to keep them in humour. Voter turnout at the general elections has been uneven, but it has generally been on the high side. Many have commented on the festive atmosphere that prevails on election day, particularly in the rural areas and among the poorer folk.         
	The electoral process also creates bitterness and animosity, and perhaps the bitterness and animosity last longer and go deeper than the euphoria and the good cheer. Election campaigns have become increasingly strident and vicious: and that too is now a part of our democracy. Hate speeches have become so common during elections that it is difficult to assign responsibility for them to any particular party or segment of the political spectrum. The EC has a model code of conduct, but that does not prevent candidates from trading the most outrageous allegations against each other. Here it is difficult to judge whether the electronic media make things better or worse by their relentless, not to say obsessive, preoccupation with the allegations of misconduct made by rival candidates against each other.         
	Hate speeches are directed not only against individuals but also against communities. The hostility between castes and communities that lies buried inside society is quickened to new life during the election campaigns, which provide almost unlimited scope for such expressions. It is true that the EC does its best to keep matters under control. But our campaign managers are bold as well as artful. They know how to keep within the code of conduct, and when they can risk going beyond it.         
	On a recent visit to Mumbai, I made the acquaintance of a driver who comes from the town of Mangalore and bears a Christian name. I tried to draw him into a discussion of the recent communal disturbances in his part of the world, but he remained reticent. I told him that everybody knew that the Christians were being targeted, and I wanted to know why. He then lowered his guard and said that it was election time, and people had to do these things in order to secure votes. People are increasingly acquiescent of bad behaviour by politicians at the time of elections.               
	A more spectacular example of what I have in mind is the speech recently made at an election rally in Pilibhit by Varun Gandhi. What is remarkable about the speech is not simply its vehemence, but the extent to which it was carried. People tell me that he is genteel, polite and soft-spoken on ordinary social occasions. But once he got on to the campaign platform and sensed that he had his audience in his palm, he began to roar like a lion.         
	His own party vacillated between turning its back on him and making a martyr out of him, and in the end decided on the second course. If Varun Gandhi wins the Pilibhit seat, as he might conceivably do, his victory will increase the temptation to make hate speeches for mobilizing electoral support.         
	It is far from my intention to maintain that there is any inevitability about the electoral process being used for inflaming passions for or against particular communities or sections of society. But that is the turn things have taken in recent years. It was not like that in 1951-52, at the time of the first general elections. What has happened between then and now is the steady advance of identity politics over all other kinds of politics in India. Nobody can seriously expect that identity politics will vanish from the Indian scene or even that appeals to the loyalties of caste and community at election time will come to an end. But as long as all issues are subordinated to the articulation of the grievances of particular caste and particular communities, albeit in the name of equity and justice, the electoral process will continue to move in the direction in which it was set off about twenty years ago.

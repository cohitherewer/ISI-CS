	Lakshmi and Saraswati never inhabit the same house. This lovely, wise, slightly fatalistic Bengali saying  how old it is is worth speculating about  sums up a fair amount of the mood and trajectory of Bengali modernity. I have no clear memory of Saraswati Puja from my childhood, although the glittering, crowded, somewhat tacky suburban Durga Pujas in Bombay were an annual and anticipated observance; but I do recall the saying issuing as a ruminative aphorism from my mother when I was about 10 years old, and could just begin to make sense of it.        
	It bears the curious, forbearing mark of indulgence that distinguishes the Hindus relationship to his or her gods: a withdrawal of judgment, a suppression of condemnation. Why, after all, could Lakshmi and Saraswati not live in the same house, when it would have made things so much easier? We  the petitioners  wont go there, however; any more than a retired Bengali grandfather would ask his son to come back from California to look after him. A strange protectiveness, traditionally, characterizes the Hindus love for his deities; it is, for instance, what makes the transference of the worshipper during the Durga Pujas from son and supplicant at the beginning of the festivities to notional, grieving father (as the visit to the paternal home comes to an end) both simple and logical. We dont comprehend our deities behaviour any more than we do our childrens; but we do know our emotions are implicated in their movements and disappearances, and so were willing to give them a fair amount of leeway. We are, in other words, as bound to them by maya, the law of illusory, indefatigable attraction and desire, as we are to anything else.              
	Of course, our household in Bombay was visibly blessed by Lakshmi, especially in comparison to the magical (to me as a child) houses in Shillong, Silchar, and even Calcutta, where different generations of relatives lived. Lakshmi may not have been worshipped in our apartment, but she was present among the company furniture in Cumballa Hill, and later in Malabar Hill and Cuffe Parade. What my mother meant, I suppose, was that people far less educated than my father  the people generically called businessmen  had, under the taxation regime and the flourishing, parallel black economy of those decades, greater wealth than he could ever aspire to. She was also expressing, through the saying, a typically Bengali ambivalence about entrepreneurship.        
	This ambivalence has agitated and shaped Bengali bhadralok history in the form of what one might provisionally call the Mannian turn  Mann, who had meticulously observed, in Europe, the transition from bourgeois order to daydreaming and the imagination, the courtship of Lakshmi to the pull of Saraswati, in works like Buddenbrooks and Tonio Krger. This movement, in Bengal, is enacted everywhere from the 19th century onwards, most intriguingly in the family of the Tagores, the irrevocable unmooring of one part of that family from orthodoxy, its emergence, with Dwarkanath, into modern-day savvy entrepreneurship, and the momentous turn later towards speculative thought with Debendranath, and then, with Rabindranath and his brothers, towards the arts  towards the laconic veena-playing goddess  before its dissolution into ordinariness. The arc of these oscillations determine my fathers life as well; born to a rich zamindari East Bengali family, his decision to pursue higher studies and his arrival at Scottish Church College in Calcutta in the Forties to study English literature could be explained by the ascent of Saraswati in his world of possibilities; the resolve later to change course, to travel to London in 1949 to take professional exams in taxation and accountancy might imply Lakshmis reassertion in his destiny  although the regime of exams he took, the kind of work he did, the letters after his name, the fact that he was a bourgeois corporate professional rather than a businessman, singled him out, in my mothers mind and in the minds of many others, as equally a progeny of Saraswatis as he was an adherent of Lakshmis. For Saraswati herself, at some point in history, had been domesticated by the Bengali upper middle class  both literally, as a brass figurine in the drawing room, and, more powerfully, as a metaphor for its own proprietorial but, in the end, ambiguous relationship with learning. All forms of examination-endorsed and institutional knowledge, management and finance included, would come to be her domain. Surely the gradations of meanings and nuances attached to these deities in the Bengali imagination tell us as much about the itinerary of this bourgeoisie, the arrival and vanishing of this population of men in white dhutis and black suits, as does Macaulays grandiosely prophetic statement about his wish to create a class who may be interpreters ... Indian in blood and colour, but English in taste, in opinions, in morals and in intellect?        
	Im speaking, of course, of a time when the wealth available to the Bengali middle and upper classes was relatively limited, and certainly not guaranteed for all time: when Lakshmi, with the same mixture of indulgence and the faintest hint of reproach I mentioned earlier, was still called chanchala: the restive, fickle one. Evidence of her restiveness, her inability to abide in location or with one family for long, as well as the Mann-like self-destructive tenure of the Bengali bourgeoisie, can be found in the stories of companies like Martin Burn, and in the properties or old mansions on Elgin Road or in Ballygunge that are replaced monthly by new buildings. Im referring to a history, then, whose features were formed before Hinduisms jubilant embrace of the inevitability of the free market in the wise, immovable figure of Ganesh: chanchala belongs to a more inflected age, and she is, for all her charm, informed by middle-class self-doubt and uncertainty.              
	Even as a child visiting this city, I was aware of the particular investment families had made in Saraswati, in exam results and tutorial classes  in the odd resonance of the words bhalo chhele, and, in special cases, jewel. I, with my workaday marks, was no jewel; but, in Bombay, it didnt seem to matter as much  we were more oppressed by sports and sex. It was only after I was 16, I think (such were the allocations of my vacations), that I witnessed an actual Saraswati Puja in Calcutta, with its perfume of khoi and bananas, and its weird domestic comedy of textbooks piled before the deity, and thin, distracted children laughing and submitting to her exercise books filled with the invocation, Om Saraswatyai namah. Later, Id see those same children  or those whod once been like them  grown up and settled in some American suburb, elements of the familiar but publicized diaspora. Very little of Saraswatis silent attentiveness, or her recondite interests, seemed to reside in these, her worshippers. Such encounters crystallized for me what Id sense early on: that the Bengali fascination with the serene musical sister had long been a mildly calculating one, a route to her restless sibling without clearly admitting  to others but most crucially to themselves  that this route was being pursued. This explained the peculiar vocabulary of the Bengalis: why, for instance, qualifications was used where education should be  for instance, X has excellent qualifications, where one should say, X has had an excellent education; as if learning and knowledge were, in the end, subordinate to eligibility.

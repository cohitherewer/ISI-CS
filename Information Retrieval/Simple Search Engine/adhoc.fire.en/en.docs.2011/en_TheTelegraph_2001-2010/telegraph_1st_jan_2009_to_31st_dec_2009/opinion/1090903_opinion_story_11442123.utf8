	An event in April does not, ordinarily, make news in August without reason. Pakistan has perhaps rightly guessed why news of the missile tests it conducted earlier this year should be hitting the headlines now, only a month away from a crucial session of the American Congress. Allegations of Pakistan modifying anti-ship Harpoon missiles  sold to it by the United States of America  to make them capable of land attacks against India could be aimed at undoing its months-long orchestrated effort at pushing the US to release the bounty of $7.5 billion. For one, such modification would establish that Pakistan is still channelling resources to an arms build-up, thereby prioritizing defence over development (for which money is being claimed). The second, and more damaging part, would be the incontrovertible proof that Pakistan is continuing to bite the hand that is feeding it. For this is no longer Pakistans surreptitious remodelling of Chinese or Korean missiles that the world, and the US, had learnt to accept. This is cocking a snook at the superpower which had steadfastly supported an ally despite the double standards Pakistan repeatedly displayed in the course of the war on terror. The sentiments this can arouse in the US are being feared. Even if these sentiments do not, ultimately, hold up aid, they could force the Barack Obama administration into committing itself to more stringent control of the money than heretofore. Naturally, Pakistan is trying its best to control the damage. It has already agreed to a supervision of its Harpoon arsenal. In the next few days, this pliancy may translate itself into more attention to the war against the Taliban which it is already now in two minds about fighting.         
	It should be quite clear to India that it is witnessing a series of manoeuvres in the battle of wills between two allies. As in so many earlier tussles, this too may end in much mutual back-patting between the US and Pakistan. For a war-ready nation like India, which has just indigenously manufactured its own nuclear submarine, a twisted Harpoon should not be too much to worry about. What should be worrying are the skewed rules in the game of accountability that the US and its ally continue to engage India in. Will the subcontinent be freed of terror if the US continues to mollycoddle a belligerent Pakistan and Pakistan continues to show its muscles while talking peace with India?

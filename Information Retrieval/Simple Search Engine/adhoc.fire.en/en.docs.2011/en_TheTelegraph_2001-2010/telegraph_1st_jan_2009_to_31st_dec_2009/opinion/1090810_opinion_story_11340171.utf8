The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Empty Houses
                                                                                                                 EMPTY HOUSES                                                    
	The chief minister of Uttar Pradesh seems to be suffering from the unkindness of strangers. While the world and his wife are ready to vilify Ms Mayavati for self-aggrandizement, no one bothers to accept the benefits she is doling out, at great cost, to the poor. One thousand flats for workers, to be given free of cost, built within a year of her announcement of one lakh free housing for the poor, are going a-begging for occupants. The flats are in Noida and Greater Noida, and the Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority, which is meant to submit a completion report to the state government by August 15, has not received a single application for the flats in spite of extending the last date for applications twice. Ms Mayavatis efficiency lies in apportioning accountability. In this case, district magistrates responsible for receiving applications and allotting the flats will be accountable if the flats go empty.        
	But they may be too frightened to be truthful. Ms Mayavatis plan suffers from a common flaw of many noble governmental plans: an alienation from the really needy. The flats have been built in an area where construction workers are nomadic; they make their living by moving from site to site. Every group of workers has its special conditions and needs  there is no point in deciding on an overall solution to a problem not understood and not researched. Obviously, in this case, providing houses will not address the fundamental issue of the target groups necessary rootlessness. Besides, to apply for any benefit from the government, people need cards  BPL cards, ration cards and so on. A large section of the poor do not have these. It is useless to offer them houses, or cheap railway tickets, or cheap rice, unless the more basic issues have been addressed first. What is needed is proper study and a nuanced understanding of the many different conditions under which different segments of the unorganized population conduct their lives in different regions. Till politicians have time for that, very little will change.

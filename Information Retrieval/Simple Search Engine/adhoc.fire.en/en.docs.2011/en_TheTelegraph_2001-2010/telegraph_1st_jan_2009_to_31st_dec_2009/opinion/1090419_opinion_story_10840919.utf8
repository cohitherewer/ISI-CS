The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Western border tensions
                                                                                                                 WESTERN BORDER TENSIONS                          - Changing mores of immigration officers        The Thin Edge - Ruchir Joshi                                                        
	The immigration officer at Heathrows Terminal 2 is a young man, very polite, mildly chatty even, but I know hes doing his job and checking me out. He has my three joined passports open in his hands and hes riffling through them, smelling the complex bouquet of all the different visas Ive collected over the last decade and a half. What kind of writing is it that you do, sir? I tell him what kind of writing I do. Novel? Really? What was your first novel about? I give him a brief synopsis of the novel, the title, and the name of the UK publisher. He asks, and I describe what sort of journalism I write. He listens, nods, stamps a corner of a page and smiles as he hands back the passport. Ill look out for the novel, sir, have a good trip! I thank him back and Im on my way to the luggage belts. The whole thing takes about three minutes, pleasantries included.         
	The young Saudi couple standing at the adjoining counter arent so lucky. Ive been watching them from long before my turn, and they look as though they are in for it. The officer interrogating them has a completely different tone of voice and he interrupts them whenever they speak. He is polite but unswerving in his toughness: why are they here? Students? To study what? English? Why English? Why do you want to study English, madam? Before madam finishes her answer, he turns to the young man and asks him  and you sir, why do you want to study English? I will need to see the following the officer recites a list of documents. The woman, whose English is clearly the one less in need of studying, starts to produce the papers from her bag but the officer is relentless. When the Saudi government pays for a student they also send he tells them what else he requires. This goes on through the time several others approach and pass through adjoining immigration desks and its still going on when I walk away.               
	Through a mixture of good fortune and some perseverance, I have now reached a stage where arriving at a European or an American airport is not such a big deal but I clearly remember the time when it was a daunting prospect. Those were the days when my passport was thin, underfed with visas, and the weight of having to prove my bona fides was that much heavier. The air around the immigration desks of Fortress Europa and Fort Amerika hung thick with the conviction that each and every third world passenger trying to get in had no better prospect in life than to immediately slime into some illegal labour-gutter in the nether parts of whichever paradisiacal economy the gate-keepers were charged with protecting. The paperwork you always had to carry ran into whole files: hotel reservations, train reservations, return flight reservations; letters of invitation, details of the inviters bank accounts, political leanings and sexual proclivities; the naked innards of your own financial wherewithal, bank accounts, deeds of ownership of house or land that proved you needed to return, affidavits from parents that their only son would not stay away from home for more than the specified period, etc etc, etc. When your turn came at the desk, the questioning was almost always aggressively rude, insulting, repetitive and lengthy. I remember many times feeling deeply soiled walking away from the immigration counters to the luggage belts, the pleasure of arrival, the anticipation of meeting friends or lovers, all in the end defeated by the disbelieving stare, the braying queries and the smug conviction of the official that I was a pitiable supplicant and he or she the absolute master of my fate.         
	Unless the person meeting you at the airport was a desi, it was almost impossible to explain the feeling of anger and hatred welling up inside.         
	Looking back at that time, I realize a few things. One, it is entirely likely that people of my class (brought up at least with huge cultural privileges, if not financial ones) were more affected by having to run this humiliating gauntlet than others who had already had the experience of being treated like garbage by their own society; it was like being dunked into a vat of subalternity  a shock each time, despite the pretensions to intellectuality and radicalism that people like myself carried. Second, the system of this welcoming dunk hasnt changed much for most travellers from the South, its just that there is less interest in giving someone a working over if its clear from their passports and demeanour that they have entered Paradise many times before and gone back home within the time specified in the visas, and that theyve done so without setting up any terrorist networks. Three, just as my passport in those days was thin and poor so did I come from a country of thin and needy people; now the teeming mass of poor Indians has, in the perception of the West, a membrane around them of less emaciated beings who in a sense protect the West from the deluge; unlike people from some other countries, Indians arent taking crazy risks with their lives to get into the North-by-North-Western world, so somebody is clearly managing things over there; people like myself are seen as being part of this managing, prophylactic layer and are therefore a tad less unwelcome: Youre alright mate, youre a politician/businessman/scientist/artist/sportsman and you obviously have something going back over there where you come from, so its okay for you to come in. Added to this is And even if one or two of you wiggle in and stay behind its okay, because we can always use someone of your skills. Our society wont be threatened, not the way it would be by another naan-bread maker or t-shirt seller.              
	If I allow myself to think of myself only as an Indian, and that too an Indian of a certain class, all this can be very happy-making: Look how authoritatively, with what supreme nonchalance, I can saunter through the dementor-portals of the Upperworld! But if I spread the fragile, unreliable wings of my sense of identity any wider  South Asian, of-the-South, not-of-the West  then I am in deep trouble at the Passport Control of self-respect. If I think of myself as a little more than an Indian, it suddenly becomes clear I come from an open-ended region, a place where clearly defined (and therefore clearly erasable) borders have limited play, where the border climbs into hilly, rain-drenched indefinition on the east, and where, on the west, another mess of mountains pulls into itself a whole cats cradle of borders and swallows them; borders spread out from India like water from buckets spilt in different directions. Equally, I come from a region where borders have a habit of popping up like new weeds, in places where they have no business to be, central India, Swat, Baluchistan, Jaffna.         
	I look at the sign at Heathrow which proclaims UK Border and I look at the snake of arrivals, many of their faces tense, many of them snapping at their children as the kids try and play a game in the maze of ropes, some faces already wearing a mask of anticipatory sorrow as they check and re-check their landing cards, (it will be a sadness to pass through and it will be a tragedy if they are rejected) and I remind myself that I am from the place where, for over a month, millions will trek to do a puja, a finger-vidhi at the moving temples of the voting booth. Even though Im not a believer in the State, post-Westphalian or post-McMahon, I realize that the reason I dont share this Western-fortress border-tension any more is because, through good fortune more than perseverance, I come from a place to which Im quite happy to return.

	Gods very own country              
	Sacred Kerala: A spiritual pilgrimage (Penguin, Rs 275) by Dominique-Sila Khan, according to K.P. Ramanunnis foreword, is a thumping affirmation of the assertion that love can indeed overcome all differences. Understandably then, the authors unshakeable faith in the powers of affection makes her perceive Kerala  a state whose religious life is intense, vibrant and varied  as a perfect example of religious tolerance and peaceful coexistence despite the occasional clashes between faiths. The encounters with a myriad people recounted by the author seem to strengthen her notion that despite the divisive attempts, the Malayalis have managed to stick to their age-old tradition of shared, participatory religious beliefs and practices. Although richly anecdotal  there are engaging descriptions of Keralas many religious shrines  the book offers only a cosmetic analysis of the rising incidents of communal strife, thereby downplaying the threat that it poses to Keralas social and religious life. Dominique-Sila Khan is also inexplicably silent on how the State often colludes with institutions of faith to stifle a people and their rights.                        
	Cappuccino Dusk (HarperCollins, Rs 295) by Kankana Basu was longlisted for the Man Asian Literary Prize in 2007, and it chronicles the lives of people who couldnt have been more different from one another. It begins with a train journey: the Banerjees, with their prized belongings that include gripe water, antiseptic creams and mosquito nets, are shifting from Calcutta to Bombay, a journey which unknowing to them then would change their lives forever. The new city brings closures as well as the promise of new beginnings. The father dies pining for his real home, while his wife and children undergo a Kafkaesque metamorphosis. In Mumbai, more people join the brood: a boy poet, a floundering Shaivite cousin, an orthodox elderly relative, a scribe and a cartoonist. As a result, ties are forged and broken, desires kindled and snuffed out, even as the protagonists find themselves propelled towards unexpected and uncomfortable territories.                                 
	Media Ethics: Truth, Fairness and objectivity (Oxford, Rs 245) by Paranjoy Guha Thakurta is an important book which would be immensely useful to students of journalism and to working journalists. While recognizing the fact that journalists occupy a special position because their roles and functions influence the masses, Guha Thakurta cautions that they need to subscribe to a code of ethics in the course of their professional duties. Truth, objectivity and privacy are some of the issues that are dwelt on at length and critical areas such as libel, obscenity and plagiarism are also discussed, along with laws that bind the media. Professional journalists will find the chapter on sting journalism of particular interest as the accompanying case studies show the blurring of the thin line that separates the public from the private. Students interested in pursuing a career in journalism would also benefit from the chapter-end review questions and exercises.                        
	Speak with power and confidence (Sterling, Rs 299) by Patrick Collins provides tested ideas for becoming a more powerful communicator. Collins not only suggests ways to conquer ones fear of public speaking but he also provides other useful tips: sending the right nonverbal signals or gaining an imposing voice, he argues, sharpens ones communication skills. Collins also promises that the guidelines would help tongue-tied men and women deliver crisp sales presentations, do well in job interviews and even become effective witnesses at trials.

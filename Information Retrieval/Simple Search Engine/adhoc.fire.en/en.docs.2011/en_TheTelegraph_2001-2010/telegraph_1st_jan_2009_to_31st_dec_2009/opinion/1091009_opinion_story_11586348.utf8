	The Wish Maker By Ali Sethi, Penguin, Rs 499        
	If you have been a teenager in Nineties India, and were bedazzled by the nascent charms of satellite television, chances of your having fond memories of the American television series, The Wonder Years, are reasonably high. Set in the turbulent Sixties, its plot revolved around the lives of some schoolkids growing up in the shadow of the Vietnam War. The protagonist, Kevin Arnold, was a wide-eyed boy. His best friend was the geeky Paul, and biggest crush, Winnie Cooper. A delightful comedy about the highs and lows of adolescence, The Wonder Years captured the essence of an era through the quietly observant eyes of the adult Kevin, looking back on his early life with a restrained nostalgia.        
	Something similar happens in Ali Sethis first novel. Zaki Shirazi, the 19-year-old narrator, is visiting his family in Lahore from America (where he attends a liberal arts college) on the occasion of his cousins wedding. Although Zaki is not exactly the prodigal son, he has returned nursing obscure hurts and cherishing flickering memories of the days of yore. His eyes are startled by the changes that have accrued over the life he had left behind. But, instead of wallowing in wistfulness and melancholy, Zaki tells an absorbing tale, sparkling with intimate, and often eccentric, details about his extended family.        
	The chief delight of this book is the dispassionate tone in which Zaki tells his story. The similarities between Zaki and Kevin are noticeable. Both of them are loners. While Kevins father had been a veteran of the Korean War, Sami Shirazi, Zakis father, was a pilot with the air force, and had died in a crash a few months before Zaki was born. Kevins mother, Norma, a liberal feminist, appears to be a kindred spirit of Zakis mother, Zakia, a feisty journalist and activist. So one feels pleasantly validated when Zaki finally confesses (on page 160) that as a schoolboy in Pakistan his favourite programme was The Wonder Years.         
	In spite of a happy enough ending, Sethis novel is not a feel-good work. There are far too many grey clouds that keep swirling around the lives of his dramatis personae. Although a great many of the 400 pages of this book are filled with conversations, some of the most intense moments are born out of what remains unspoken. At times, the profusion of chattering voices may strike you as a bit mundane, but it is only as you turn the last page that you begin to realize how the teeming voices have grown inside your head and acquired a life surpassing their fictional limits: many of us have known cranky teachers like Zakis arthritic old English teacher, who carried a ruler for discipline and shouted Dont behave! when the class was rowdy. Zakis maternal grandfather, Papu, is also familiar. A later-day Mr Bennet, Papu is in the habit of breaking into Ogden-Nash-like limericks at dinnertime to bully his grandson: Zaki Zaki Strong and Able/ Take Your Elbows off the Table/ This is Not a Horses Stable/ But a First-Class Dining Table.        
	Although Zaki has a more or less privileged upbringing (his class is too rich to be poor, too poor to be rich), he is haunted by his absent father, and feels neglected by his workaholic mother. His closest companion is his cousin, Samar Api, growing up in the same house with him, but emotionally more volatile than the fatherless boy. Zaki becomes the still centre of Samars life, a source of unconditional love and allegiance, ever willing to absorb all her anxieties and disappointments. Until the time Samar is forcibly taken away by her mother to live with her, Zaki remains the mirror into which she looks from time to time to assuage her distress. Even when she sets out on a wild goose chase for her love-interest, Jamal, Zaki, the old faithful, follows close on her heels. Ever compliant with Samars craziest schemes, and with a propensity to follow her everywhere, Zaki is the perfect little lamb to Samar  although he is far from innocent.        
	Samars absolute dependence on Zaki to help her carry out her romantic adventures tellingly reveals the gender disparities that remain entrenched in a conservative society: it is alright for 14-year-olds to smoke publicly and drive flashy cars but dangerous for young girls to step out unaccompanied. Boys will be boys, and they better behave that way, but girls must be all things nice. So Samar and Zaki, unable to fit into these roles, become misfits early on. The emotional costs, it seems, are higher for Zaki, who is only semi-successful at making friends with boys of his age. While Samar hangs out with Tara Tanvir, a femme fatale (the girl with a rep), Zaki keeps an awkward distance from the easy bonhomie of boys. He feels lost in the company of his cousins, Isa and Moosa, who, although barely a head taller than he is, are seasoned drinkers and smokers, both driving showy cars and watching X-rated films. Things are no better at school, where Zaki ends up with the Mad Hatter of the class, Kazim, gifted painter and giver of inventive names: he calls the English teacher, Alto (after the car), while Dr Qazi with his henna-dyed beard was Ginger Spice.        
	The episodic structure of Sethis novel owes to works like Middlemarch (from which he borrows the epigraph), and its meandering journey across generations harks back to Thomas Manns Buddenbrooks. Although Sethis touch is lighter, he covers vast stretches of time, from Zakis Daadis life before the Partition and his mothers avant-garde years in Lahore, to Benazir Bhuttos rise and fall, followed by the coming of Nawaz Sharif, and finally, Zakis own life in Musharrafs Pakistan. The portraits that Sethi leaves us are finely-sculpted, intimate, breathing human passions. Curiously, it is Zaki himself who remains the most enigmatic of them all. His erotic life is charged with oddities  a boyhood encounter with Mazri, the son of a servant; his college roommate tells him, pointing at the bunk-bed they have to share, Top, bottom, whatever your call. But the adult Zaki never loses his air of inscrutability. He remains the most preciously guarded secret of his own story.                          SOMAK GHOSHAL

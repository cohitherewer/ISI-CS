The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Celebrating autumn
                                                                                                                 CELEBRATING AUTUMN                                                          
	Autumn may be Bengals favourite season, but the oeuvre of Bengals favourite bard shows a distinct preference for monsoon and spring. There are, however, more autumn songs in the Gitabitan than could be accommodated in an evenings programme. Shantiniketan Puratani presented a bunch of them at the Birla Academy on September 22. Some of the songs were accompanied by dance, performed by Purnima Ghosh and her students. With Shantiniketan, one associates a spontaneous and unselfconscious style of singing. This was in evidence in most of the songs, and, coupled with the dances, they conjured up the milieu of an impromptu celebration of autumn.The choral songs were afflicted by a familiar lack of coordination among the singers. Even so, Amra bendhechhi kaasher guchho and Shiuli phool, shiuli phool were pleasing to the ears. There were at least four solo dances, but all of them were performed to choral songs, which were not the best of their kind. Of the solo offerings, Amalo dhabalo pale legechhe, Hridaye chhile jege, Sharato alor kamalo-bone and Alor amalo kamalokhani deserve mention. One would have had no reservations about praising the rendition of Esho sharater amalomohima and Kar banshi nishibhore (both sung by the same artist), had the singer not made a habit of splitting words in the most infelicitous way. One is aware that in Tagores lifetime, this was not considered a grave offence, but it has since been acknowledged that split words tarnish the spirit of Rabindrasangeet.    
	Subtle style        
	Prerna Centre for Performing Arts presented an evening of dance at Gyan Manch on September 18. Conceived and choreographed by Luna Poddar, a senior Kathak dancer, the programme featured various Kathak numbers and a dance-drama, Selfish Giant, which was performed by the students of the institution. The first half began with a vandana, and was followed by some aesthetically conceived items. Poddars effortless grace and restrained approach deserve praise. Anubhuti, a solo presentation, was subtle and demonstrated her mastery over this art form. Sargam, based on raga Malkosh, was enjoyable because of its crisp footwork. Accompanied by some exquisite music, this rhythmic presentation was a joy to watch. The artists confidence and spontaneity only added to its brilliance. The presentation was proof of Poddars elegant style.

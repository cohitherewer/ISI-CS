  - Prudent and selective use of aerial firepower can put an end to the Maoist threat 					 
										      SHOCK AND AWE                                                
	India has used its air forces firepower in conjunction with the army with telling, if not decisive, effect in the past. The serious situations, bordering on armed revolt, incursion and secession, in the Northeast and in Jammu and Kashmir merited such a strategy. The political decisions must have been difficult to take. What must have helped was that after a certain stage the army was doing the bulk of the fighting and the situations had turned into quasi-wars. Moreover, time was running out.        
	Once the political decisions were taken, the go-aheads given and the overall guidelines spelt out, the air force and the army were left pretty much to do their own joint planning and execution. Air force firepower was used most astutely to avoid unnecessary collateral damage. I state this from first-hand experience, observation and knowledge.        
	Not using the air forces firepower at the time, to my mind, would have been disastrous. Merely using the Indian Air Force in logistics, communication, surveillance and casualty evacuation wasnt paying dividends. As it was revealed once peace and order were restored, aerial firepower could not have been used more opportunely. Airpower, along with the armys ground action, possibly shortened the conflict and nipped in the bud what was rapidly turning into a serious challenge to Indias integrity. In a way, it also served as a punishing lesson to the then and future separatists, without estranging the populace.        
	The Maoist menace of today is vastly different, both in character and content as also in its origins and geographical areas of operation. The nature and extent of media coverage, too, have changed since the insurrections of the 1960s. However, revisiting those air operations and then carefully extrapolating all that information to the Maoist problem may be useful given the current debate on the possible use of airpower. Repeated denunciations of the use of airpower without the benefit of hindsight could well embolden the Maoist cadre.        
	Air force firepower has unique elements of surprise, speed, devastation as well as a psychological impact. Be it the insurgencies and incursions of the 1960s or the Kargil operation in 1999, it has been in the very nature of aerial firepower to strike awe and fear into the hearts of highly motivated opponents. It lends itself eminently for prudent and selective use in anti-Maoist operations.        
	Taking a hasty public stand against the use of air firepower in keeping with the rhetoric of human rights organizations would be an ill-advised step. One wonders whether the question of human rights violation arises at all, given the fact that such groups have repeatedly shown utter contempt for the lives of government employees and police personnel. Those who think routine security measures or development initiatives alone will deliver the results are seriously mistaken.        
	Aerial firepower and the political processes that aim to address the crucial socio-economic issues underlying the Maoist movement are not mutually exclusive. It is also not my suggestion that the stick precede the carrot. Often, there may not be enough time but there will always be enough space for the two approaches to be mixed judiciously. If the Maoist ideologues are convinced that such a two-track approach is indeed being adopted, it may not end the insurgency by itself but such a measure will arguably hasten the end of the bloodshed.

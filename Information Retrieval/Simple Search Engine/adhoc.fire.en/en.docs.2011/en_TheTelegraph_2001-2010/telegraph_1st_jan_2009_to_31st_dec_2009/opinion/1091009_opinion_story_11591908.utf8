	Rick Gekoski is a former academic with a D.Phil in English from the University of Oxford. He gave up his academic job to become a dealer in rare books and manuscripts. He is also a passionate reader, and this book brings together his reflections on some of the books that he has read and has been influenced by at various phases of his life. The term, bibliomemoir, is his own coinage but the genre is not an unknown one. Alberto Manguel, Diana Athill and Anne Fadiman have all excelled in this kind of writing about books and reading. The only difference between them and Gekoski is that the latter, in keeping with the conventions of writing memoirs, follows a strict chronological line while writing about books and the impact they had on his intellectual development.        
	After 25 years of marriage, Gekoski and his wife went through an acrimonious divorce. One fallout of this was that his wife kept their house and its contents. Gekoski was shocked when his wife claimed that this included his books  a library built up over the years, consisting of books read, marked and annotated. Gekoski initially felt numb with shock, as if a part of him had been sawed away from him. But after a few months, he felt a sense of release. He felt unencumbered. With this came the realization that more than the possession of books, what mattered was reading: [it] has always mattered to me. I cant not do it, any more than I can stop eating or breathing. I cant stop reading without feeling anxious, and extinguished. I read, therefore I am. He felt that the books could not actually be taken away from him. They were inside him, part of him. He was constituted by the books he had read. Many, if not all, avid readers and book lovers will find in Geksoki a kindred soul.        
	Reading T.S. Eliots The Waste Land, he began to understand how to appreciate the poem; it was necessary to get oneself a different set of lenses and critical tools than those that he had acquired in his adolescence. It required that one re-schooled oneself in the very art of reading. And to do that you had to learn, too, how not to read.        
	From the US, he came up to Merton College in Oxford to read for D.Phil in English. This use of the word, read, was a revelation to him. He discovered Yeats. But it was not poetry alone that held him. He was influenced by Descartes and Hume and even A.J. Ayer. His reading, as he reveals, was varied and often odd. But looking back he discerns a pattern. He believes with Freud that nothing happens without a reason. Reading, Gekoski tells his readers, how we learn to attach ourselves to ourselves, and to others, and to the world. We are made and continually transformed by what, and how, we read.

	Difficult proposition    
	Sir  While referring to the recent resolution in the Gujarat assembly to make voting compulsory for local bodies, the chief election commissioner, Navin Chawla, stated that it will not be practical to make voting compulsory in India. Surely, there are ways to improve the voting-percentage in the country other than this (Nod for must-vote bill, Dec 20).          
	During elections, many people avoid casting their votes because they do not like any of the contestants who are in the fray. The best way to improve voters turnout is to provide for the voters the option of none-to-vote. Steps must also be taken to increase awareness about such an option among voters as well as among those manning the polling-booths. Moreover, the identity of the voter who exercises this particular option must not be disclosed. It might also be a good idea to introduce incentives for voters to motivate people to visit polling booths during elections. Voting slips can be issued to those coming to caste their vote. The slip-holders should be entitled to nominal tax rebates or concessions while purchasing admission and registration forms in educational institutions. These measures might help increase the number of voters in the country.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The bill passed by the Gujarat assembly to make voting mandatory in local elections is neither viable, nor desirable. There are a number of reasons why people refrain from casting their vote. In India, voters exercise their franchise under conditions that are far from ideal.For instance, they are asked to elect one out of many tainted candidates. Also, elections are far from free and fair here, as most political parties nominate candidates who have a criminal background. In the recently concluded polls in Maharashtra, Haryana and Arunachal Pradesh, a number of the contestants who have emerged victorious are facing criminal charges. This is not a good sign for our democracy. People with criminal backgrounds must not be allowed to contest. For that to happen, the existing rules must be changed.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Unequal citizens          
	Sir  The situation of women in West Bengal is quite alarming (Far from a healthy state, Nov 29). This, in a state that is known to respect women and where the leader of the main Opposition party is a woman. The state ranks seventh when it comes to minor marriages  53.9 per cent of the women in Bengal marry before they are 18. Bengali women have always been encouraged to do well in all walks of life, including their careers. I was also shocked to learn that sexual violence in the state is three times higher than the national average. It is a matter of shame that the state government has been unable to check the rise in cases of domestic violence, eve-teasing and molestation to improve womens lives in the state.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Unlike in Bengal where women continue to suffer in silence, women in Manipur have come to the forefront to solve some of the problems they face. They have taken to organizing torchlight vigils in order to keep a tab on social ills such as drunkenness and drug-abuse. On some occasions, they have also formed human walls to prevent the armed forces from arresting innocent people on the suspicion of being insurgents. In contrast to women in some other parts of the country, these women are courageous enough to face police lathis, sit on hunger strikes and even go to jail for a cause they believe in.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Make it simple          
	Sir  In Science and the layman (Dec 14), S.L. Rao lucidly explains how scientists and decision-makers confuse ordinary people. Scientists, despite their individual brilliance, are actually constrained by their dependence on funds and infrastructure which are provided by decision-makers from a different field. At a time when neither scientists nor decision-makers have brought clarity to issues, what we need are social scientists who can tell the people about the latest inventions and their application in the real world. These thinkers often quarrel among themselves, but they also open our minds to important debates. Political scientists should also guide the decision-makers, but their observations should be made public in a manner so that they are understood by laymen.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
R. Subhranshu, Chandernagore, Hooghly

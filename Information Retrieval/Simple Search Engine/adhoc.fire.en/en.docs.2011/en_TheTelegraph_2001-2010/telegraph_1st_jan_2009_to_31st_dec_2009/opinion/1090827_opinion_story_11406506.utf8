	Hostile neighbours                  
	Sir  In Time to get real (Aug 4), Brijesh D. Jayal misses two important points while explaining why Pakistan has gone one up on India in international diplomacy. First, Islamabad s statecraft has always been superior to that of New Delhis. In international relations, for instance, Pakistans closeness to the United States of America on the one hand and China on the other hand  not forgetting its efforts to improve its relations with Moscow of late  is proof of this. Besides, Pakistan is an important member of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference, and has managed to build a good working relationship with Bangladesh by putting behind the bitter memories of the debacle of 1971. It is evident that the West prefers to side with Pakistan vis--vis India in matters related to diplomacy. Second, to the Indian netas, the security of their vote banks is of much greater concern than national security. After every terrorist attack in this country, the people of India sulk for a while, complain about the attacks to the world at large and then things slowly get back to normal. This has been the situation for some two decades, ever since Zia-ul-Haq launched a successful war of attrition on a hapless India. Moreover, Indian leaders have steadfastly refused to implement counter-terrorism measures recommended by the intelligence agencies and by the army.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The mandate of an elected government is to establish friendly ties with its neighbours through diplomacy for peace and prosperity. But the army as an institution is trained to guard the borders. Hence, it considers neighbouring countries as potential enemies. Indias well entrenched democratic structure enables it to extend its hand of friendship towards Pakistan. But army-dominated Pakistan compels the feeble civilian government to toe a different line. At present, India has two options: it should either emulate the ways of the Pakistan army or be a model for the civilian administration in that country. Brijesh D. Jayal is right in saying that, Its time to get real and accept that the Pakistan army and the ISI are committed to a silent war, and unless the internal structure within Pakistan changes, India is at a grave risk. The Indian prime minister seems to be pressing for a shift in Pakistans internal political dynamics by giving due importance to its civilian government. India, and not Pakistan, is considered a soft state for the joint statement at Sharm el-Sheikh, the Shimla agreement and the unconditional release of soldiers after the Bangladesh War. It would be interesting to see where the two countries stand after a few decades.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Second best          
	Sir  The Australian cricket team has hit a new low after losing the Ashes (Ricky: Want to return in 13, Aug 25). The team had once dominated the world of cricket. But after this defeat, it has lost its status of the number one Test side. This time, the English team deserved to win, and the Australians paid the price for their overconfidence. The Australian captain, Ricky Ponting, had said that England would be distracted by Andrew Flintoffs retirement, and suggested that Australia had a good chance of winning the series. This statement was intended to divert the medias attention from his teams early exit in the Twenty20 world cup and to put England under pressure. But the strategy did not work, and Australia lost the last Test and the series. Now, the team needs to rebuild itself and salvage its reputation. To start with, the management should think of ridding the team of its present captain.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The English team must be congratulated for regaining the Ashes. Despite suffering several setbacks in international cricket in the last couple of years, the English players managed to achieve their cherished goal with the help of their indomitable spirit. The English skipper, Andrew Strauss, led his team from the front throughout the five-match series. In the last Test match at the Oval, Strauss won the man of the match award and was also one of the leading run-getters for the victorious home side.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Left wondering          
	Sir  International aid is not just about philanthropy; it has certain economic and political dimensions as well (Unnecessary irritant, Aug 22). If Britain decides to shower India with a lavish 825 million over three years, and the British taxpayer objects to it, as an Indian, I would not be bothered about the imbroglio. The people of Britain are as likely to benefit from this largesse as the Indians because Britons are entitled to tax exemptions on such donations.           
	I would start wondering instead as to what prompted Sunanda K. Datta-Ray to take up the cudgels on behalf of the British taxpayers. Datta-Ray is of the opinion that surrendering British aid would be good for Indias self-respect. But Indians seldom voice their reservations when it comes to accepting British aid in the form of academic fellowships or scholarships. Objections are only raised when Indian development organizations accept international assistance. Moreover, not a word was raised when EADS, the aeronautical giant manufacturing the Eurofighter Typhoon, had flown Indian journalists to the Royal International Air Tattoo in Fairford in the United Kingdom and to its German assembly plant in Manching to demonstrate the capabilities of the lethal fighter aircraft. Indias self respect was ostensibly not hurt as a result of this particular episode (Political card in aircraft dogfight, Aug 18).           
	Using blogs on the internet as credible sources of information for writing a serious piece can be harmful. This is because blogs often contain unreliable information. Datta-Rays repeated references to blogs only served to lower the credibility of the article.                     
	Yours faithfully,

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | The president in his labyrinth
                                                                            Tuesday , November 10 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                              THE PRESIDENT IN HIS LABYRINTH                                  Hamid Karzais devious return to power has pushed Barack Obama to the brink of some hard decisions, writes Somak Ghoshal                                            
	It was after Birnam Wood started moving towards Dunsinane that Macbeth finally became unhinged by fear. Until then, his self-assurance, in spite of the dire prophecies of the witches and his own fits of panic, had somehow held through. It may not be entirely facetious to think of Hamid Karzai and Barack Obama as kindred spirits with Macbeth. All three of them had a splendid start to their political career. They were turned into larger-than-life figures early on, with an aura of heroism trailing them, till a series of miscalculations pushed them into a corner. All three failed to read the signs at the crucial moments. But while Macbeth managed to sustain his delusions of invincibility, thanks to the cryptic riddles of the hags, neither Karzai nor Obama are likely to be beneficiaries of supernatural confidence-boosting. On the contrary, they have been swamped by loud warnings of imminent disaster.        
	Both Karzai and Obama are happy pretending that Afghanistan is on its way to stability. The incumbent government has returned to power, and with it Americas man in Kabul, Hamid Karzai. What more could the international community (read, the United States of America) or the Afghans want? Forget the fact that Karzai was allowed to stay on in the job for months after his term had expired, never mind the disputed August 20 elections and its abysmal turnout. Or Karzais failure to secure at least 50 per cent of the vote as stipulated by the Afghan constitution. As for the November 7 run-off that never happened, the opposition leader, Abdullah Abdullah, had opted out of the race voluntarily.               
	Hillary Clinton pointed out emphatically that the decision to quit was Abdullahs personal choice and would not undermine the legitimacy of the second round of polling. She seemed to have forgotten that the first round of voting had been so massively rigged that Karzai had to be arm-twisted into assenting to the run-off. That the next round was to be conducted, yet again, by the Independent Election Commission, lorded by Karzai loyalists, was a perfectly legitimate arrangement for Karzai but not for Abdullah. So, with Abdullah quitting, a re-poll had become redundant. Finally, the US secretary of state conveniently avoided the stipulation of the Afghan constitution that requires the president-elect to secure at least 50 per cent of the vote to be eligible to form the government. In case the constitution failed to resolve the crisis, a loya jirga or meeting of elders should have been convened, as is traditionally done in Afghanistan. So much for legitimacy.        
	Documents like the Afghan constitution have never been taken seriously by the US. Parliamentary democracy, being an American import to Afghanistan, is best left in the able hands of the US president, to be manipulated expediently. Exceptional times demand exceptional measures  all presidents, black or white, Republican or Democrat, Texan or Hawaiian, obey this golden rule of US politics.        
	It is easy to get away with such liberties in a country where around 70 per cent of the population is illiterate. In any case, credibility was never an issue for the US in Afghanistan. In the post-Taliban era, Bush had foisted Hamid Karzai on the nation. A Pashtun prince and former mujahideen whose father had been murdered by the Taliban, Karzai was tailor-made to be the poster-boy for the war on terror, even though the Tajiks, Hazaras and Uzbeks were generally displeased with the selection. Ordinary Afghans had little choice: the Taliban had been just ousted by the US and Karzai co-opted through promises of nation-building; people fell in line with this arrangement for their own good.        
	Somewhere along the way, things went from bad to worse. Karzai became embroiled in corruption. He reshuffled his cabinet at whim, promoted close aides and dropped others like the foreign minister, Abdullah Abdullah, even though the latter had been one of the original supporters of Karzais nomination to the presidency. In the meantime, thanks to a belligerent, home-grown and Pakistani Taliban, US military efforts in Afghanistan escalated.        
	Since Barack Obamas arrival on the scene, things have worsened. The Taliban is gaining ground and disrupting the democratic process. The Western allies of the US are disgruntled, reluctant to send more troops into the country. As Obama debates the prospect of deploying more soldiers in Afghanistan, reneging on his earlier promise of withdrawing them, the focus of credibility is shifting onto a different plane: it is no longer the future of the Afghan people that is at stake, but the survival of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as the Wests leading military alliance that is being threatened.        
	How would the Nato justify its existence if it is unable to wipe out the Taliban, let alone catch Osama bin Laden, dead or alive? Why should trillion-dollar budgets be squandered on funding a narco-economy and a seemingly unwinnable war, when the US economy has depreciated so starkly? And hasnt Afghanistan already resisted occupation by two no-less-powerful nations, Britain and the Soviet Union, in the past? Why should Americas chances of victory be any better?        
	If the November 7 polls had taken place, and ordinary Afghans had braved the freezing cold and the deadly Taliban to reach the booths, their verdict would have determined not only the fate of their own incumbent president but also that of the newly-elected US president. Had they chosen Karzai in free and fair elections, they would have indirectly endorsed Americas faith in Obamas statesmanship. But the reinstatement of a corrupt leader, that too by a fluke, has not done any good either to Obamas approval ratings or to the Democrat image in the US. Not only has the presidents popularity diminished starkly over the last few months, his party has also got a drubbing in the recent state elections, losing key gubernatorial posts to the Republicans.              
	Although the Republicans are excited by the resurgence of their party within a year of Obamas presidency, it is perhaps premature to celebrate just yet. Exit polls in the US showed that Democrat supporters had not voted in enough numbers this time, and those who did, preferred to put their money on the Republicans. It isnt useful to have a president who revels in tall but vacuous oratory and delivers precious little on the ground. While in power, the Republicans may have made a terrible blunder trying to tidy up the mess, but at least they did try something. So far, Obama has merely given out his blueprint for a perfect world, photoshopped and airbrushed by brilliant speechwriters, invoked by him like a conjurors trick at public lectures.        
	Recently, opinion polls conducted by the media and independent agencies revealed that as Obamas personal ratings are falling, a public consensus on the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan is growing. Around 56 per cent of the people want Obama to pull out troops from Afghanistan as soon as is feasible, or even sooner. But politicians continue to be clueless. In a recent episode of the NBCs Meet the Press featuring figures from across the political divide, a Democratic senator clarified that no ones talking about removing forces. No one, in this case, refers to 56 per cent of the population.        
	For Obama, the most honourable exit out of Afghanistan lies through a few tough decisions  even if that entails sacrificing the post-ideological, non-partisan character that the liberal press has crowned him with. Like Bill Clinton, who dreaded being in the bad book of the media, Obama has so far cherry-picked his way through a host of knotty foreign policies. Now he has to act for the greatest common good by withdrawing troops, by making his administration an impersonal stakeholder in the business of nation-building, and by respecting the sovereignty of Afghanistan. Even admitting defeat can sometimes be a bigger victory than winning a war.

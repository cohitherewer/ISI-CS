                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Unreal issues                  
	Sir  The Peoples Democratic Party leader, Muzaffar Baig, alleged that the Jammu and Kashmir chief minister, Omar Abdullah, had hired prostitutes from a certain Sabina Bulla in Srinagar. Although the Central Bureau of Investigation had cleared him of the charge, the raking up of the matter by Baig, and Abdullahs subsequent conditional resignation led to the chaos for no reason (Sex slur strikeback, July 30). Abdullah should not have been susceptible to such allegations and lost his cool. Taking action before being judged by a court of law is unwarranted. The PDP must also keep in mind that its attempts to defame the present government are becoming too obvious. There are innumerable issues that leaders of a troubled state like Kashmir need to take care of  addressing human rights violations, upgrading public institutions, controlling insurgency, and so on. It is unfortunate that instead of looking into these, the leaders are wasting time scandal-mongering.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Alok Kumar Mishra, Jamshedpur

                
	Sir  First, the PDP chief, Mehbooba Mufti, snatched the microphone from the Speakers podium and threw it in protest, and then her party member, Muzaffar Baig, named Omar Abdullah in the Srinagar sex scandal of 2006. Muftis was not a proper way of initiating discussion on what action could be taken on the rape and murder of two women in Shopian. At a time when politicians like Narendra Modi and Mayavati are using every trick in the book to retain power, Abdullahs action has set an example. But this does not overlook the fact that his resignation, not accepted by the governor, was a political act. Eventually what grabbed the attention of the media and the people were the actions of Mufti, Baig and Abdullah, while nobody bothered about the two girls of Shopian.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Nothing to lose          
	Sir  The joint statement in Egypt by the Indian prime minister, Manmohan Singh, and his Pakistani counterpart, Yousaf Raza Gilani, is a diplomatic blunder on Indias part (Joint statement, different spins, July 17). Singhs response to criticism on the inclusion of the Baluchistan clause and the exclusion of Kashmir from the statement has been that composite dialogue cannot be held hostage to terror. However, attempts at composite dialogue have not yielded results. Conceding so much ground to Pakistan is a big mistake.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Bimal Prasad Mohapatra, Mayurbhanj, Orissa

      
	Sir  Manmohan Singh must be given credit for allowing Pakistan to insert the Baluchistan clause in the Indo-Pak joint statement in Egypt. India has nothing to lose by excluding the discussion on Kashmir at the moment. Singh has soundly argued that having a peaceful and prosperous Pakistan will be advantageous for India as well. It is the humility of the prime minister, rather than the tough stand he is often accused of not taking, that will prove to be a diplomatic advantage.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Md. Aslam Parvez, Calcutta

                
	Sir  A few months back, the Indian government had said that there could be no discussion between India and Pakistan till the latter took action against the 26/11 terrorists. In stark contrast to this position, the Sharm el-Sheikh statement between Manmohan Singh and Yousaf Raza Gilani was signed. We must remember that this is just a statement and not an agreement. So, it is not a binding directive, but just a basis for future dialogue. Therefore, there is no reason to think that the inclusion of the Baluchi clause is a compromise on Indias part. It is possible that Gilani insisted on discussing Baluchistan to put India on a backfoot. But it would be illogical to think that Pakistan would keep fostering militants in Kashmir till India withdraws its alleged influence from the western frontier of Pakistan.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  The effort by the governor, Gopalkrishna Gandhi, to suggest to the Cricket Association of Bengal that the floodlights at the Eden Gardens be reduced to the minimum required intensity, is praiseworthy (Governor urges CAB to ponder, July 26). The case of the glowing advertisement boards must also be taken up. Billboards in certain areas of the city remain lighted up to 11.30 at night, well after the streets are deserted. Apart from wasting electricity, the light also affects the sleep patterns of people who stay in the area. If the lights of these boards are switched off by 9 pm, not only would electricity be saved, but people would also have a healthier environment to live in.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
D.K. Chanda, Calcutta

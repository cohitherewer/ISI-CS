	Rajarshi Banerjis passion for photographic documentation of nature was evident in Wild Visions, which was held till January 20 at the Gaganendra Pradarshashala. In these images, animals from the savannah of South Africa shared space with those from sanctuaries and reserved forests across India. However, the photographs in the section, Out of Africa, were less interesting than the rest. Whenever one thinks of the African safari, one cannot but visualize roaring lions, lonely giraffes among the tall grasses, sleepy alligators or huge tuskers. Banerjis photographs on Africa reproduced the clichs and hence looked no more exciting than posters, albeit expensive ones. The photographs from the various national reserves of India were as fascinating as the captions accompanying them were witty. The tiger from Kanha scratching its nails on a tree indeed looked as if it was carrying the trunk on its shoulders, as the caption pointed out. The photograph of the Malabar Giant Squirrel in suspended animation as it jumped from one tree to another was captivating. However, the funniest picture of the lot was perhaps that of two owls sitting sagely in a tree hole, one with eyes shut tight and the other with eyes wide open. The caption, which read The cynical and the uninitiated, could not have described the duo better.

	Sudeshna Basu is based in the US, but her love for Tagores songs brings her to her home city frequently. On December 19, Basu presented a bunch of raga-based Rabindrasangeet at the Purbashree auditorium of the EZCC. Among her offerings were Sranto keno ohe pantho based on raga Purvi, Chitto pipashito re (Mishra Khamaj), Tui re basanta-samiran (raga Kafi), Timiromoy nibiro nisha (Megh), Jharey jay urey jay (Hamir) and a cluster of songs with roots in Behag. For each raga, Basu presented a bandish. In some instances, she used bits of a dhrupad khayal, or thumri, to illustrate. But one was left wondering whether a performance of Tagore songs (as opposed to a lecture-demonstration on them) required such expositions, particularly coming from a non-specialist in the field of Hindustani classical music. While Basu was good with her treatment and presentation of Hey birohi hay, she was at best amateurish in Chitto pipashito re and Jaage nath jochhona-raate. But Abhra Chattopadhyay accompanied her brilliantly on the esraj, and together with Siddhartha Bhattacharjee on the tabla, he covered up for many of the singers obvious weaknesses.

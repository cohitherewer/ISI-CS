The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | In love with the white metal 
                                                                                                                 IN LOVE WITH THE WHITE METAL                                                               
	All that glitters may not always be gold. Or so it seems while leafing through S.K. Pathaks INDIAN SILVER (Roli, Rs 695), which brings out Indias continuing fascination with silver objects, as reflected in palaces, museums, private collections, and even in ordinary Indian homes. The allure of silver goes back many years. In his introduction, Pathak notes that excavations in Harappan sites such as Maandi in Meerut resulted in the discovery of silver churis (bangles) and karas (thick wire bangles). Significantly, Pathak also writes that this precious white metal, owing to its malleable nature and affordability, is also more popular than gold in our country.        
	But Pathak isnt interested only in the history of the metal. He divides the book into various sections, each providing useful information on a myriad topics, such as the techniques that are used to create silver items, and the various styles and types of jewellery, coins and utility items in use in India. Local traditions, aesthetics, religion and the natural environment play a crucial role in influencing silver-design techniques: for instance, bidriware  in which the Muslim craftsmen of Bidar use silver on metal alloy  is different from repouss, which involves shaping or embellishing articles with patterns in relief, made by hammering or indentation on the reverse side. Extreme left is a high relief work in repouss on a silver glass showing the monkey god, while bottom right depicts the surface of a silver tray featuring bidri craftsmanship in the chakari (running wheel) style.        
	Silver coins belonging to different historical epochs and regions are just as diverse. Mughal silver coins were a product of both Islamic and Hindu influences, while many of the silver coins of the Chola dynasty were inscribed with Nagari inscriptions and legends. The picture showing jewellery  bangles, bracelets and rings  on a Rajasthani womans hands and wrists (top) also indicates the subtle variations within a regional ornamental style. There are some fascinating pictures of ancient utility items as well, such as that of an intricately designed alam (the staff carried by the leader in a Muharram procession) that shows the silhouette of a mosque within a frame in the form of a heart-shaped leaf (bottom left).        
	Expectedly, Pathak inserts a chapter on religious and ceremonial silver objects, but it is far less engaging than the one called Modern Indian Silver. Here, lovers of the white metal can avail themselves of the names and locations of famous shops and establishments that are involved in Indias brisk silver trade. Cooke amp; Kelvey, a branch of the original shop in Calcutta that opened in 1857, is one such famous address in the capital.

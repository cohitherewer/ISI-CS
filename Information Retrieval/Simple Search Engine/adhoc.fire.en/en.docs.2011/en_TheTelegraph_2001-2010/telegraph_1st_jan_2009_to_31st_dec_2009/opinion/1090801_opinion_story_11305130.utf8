	Sanjoy Banerjee obviously took the title of his exhibition, In the Midst of Valleys (Academy of Fine Arts, July 11-17), very seriously. Almost all his paintings at the show had the same title as that of the exhibition. Most of them were variations on the theme of particoloured valleys, so much so that it was difficult to distinguish one from the other. Thus, the viewers found themselves surrounded by valleys on all sides. Given the sincerity of Banerjees effort to simulate the experience of standing in a vale for the viewer, it is a pity that his valleys actually looked like layers of solidified lave flow swathed in twilight hues ranging from gleaming orange to the darkest purple. Added to this, the mushroom-like trees in some of the paintings made the landscapes more Martian than earthly.        
	The handful of paintings that did not feature valleys was as banal as those that did. It required quite an effort of will to discover any worth, aesthetic or otherwise, in the painting of the old dhaki seated before a Ganesh idol or in that of the Vaishnabh woman against the backdrop of a Jagannath temple.

	Sharbani Das Gupta is an accomplished ceramic artist whose solo exhibition, King Midas and his Dinner, was recently held at the Weavers Studio Centre for the Arts. As the title suggests, her work is inspired by the Greek myth in which Midas, ruler of Pessinus, sought the gift of the golden touch from Dionysus. Unwittingly, Midas ended up with a bane, not a boon, which turned everything, including items of food and his beloved daughter, into gold the moment he touched them. Das Gupta revisits the moral ramifications of this parable to understand how we, in our times, are ruining natural resources unthinkingly. Her vision of artificially-controlled farming and of the appalling cruelty behind modern meat production gives rise to some compelling installations. Bloated fish with glassy eyes, fattened fruits that look unsavoury, flowers gleaming like stars and cloudy forms on what look like corals were part of her surreal montage. However, the painted screen, showing King Midas at his feast, was quite redundant as a backdrop to this bizarre mishmash. The gallery should have shown better taste than to paste price-tags on individual pieces of work, trivializing the seriousness of Das Guptas endeavour. A price-list on a separate sheet of paper would have served its purpose just as well.

	 Party tax        
	Under the U.P. Entertainment and Betting Tax Act, the authorities sent a notice to a discotheque in Delhi asking for information so that entertainment tax could be levied on it. The discotheque, however, contended that it did not come under the purview of the act. The petitioner challenged the validity of the act before the high court, saying that discotheques were clearly outside the reach of entertainment. As per the act, the word has been defined as including any exhibitional performance, amusement, game or sport to which persons are admitted for payment. The Delhi High Court held that the activities of a discotheque (serving meals, drinks, providing dance floors to guests) can certainly be defined as entertainment and hence the imposition of the tax was valid.

	Licence to pill        
	 A complaint was filed against three persons for manufacturing drugs without a drug licence. The accused persons approached the Kerala High Court for quashing the complaint on the grounds that the products were food supplements that were actually ayurvedic medicines. They added that they had already applied for a licence at the time of manufacturing and the licence had subsequently been granted to them. The authorities held that the issue could only be decided after the trial. The high court, however, quashed the proceedings. The authorities then approached the Supreme Court, which allowed the appeal. It stated that just the fact that an application for licence had been filed did not entitle the manufacturers to make the drugs. (State of Kerala vs Orison J. Francis)                    
	Futile surgery        
	 A woman sued a hospital and a doctor for compensation when she gave birth to a child in spite of having undergone tubectomy. The Orissa High Court dismissed the petition, relying on earlier decisions of the Supreme Court. It held that in exceptional cases childbirth could occur even after sterilisation. It also added that the petitioner had not made any specific complaints against the doctor otherwise. Besides, she also opted to have the child although abortion would have been legal under the circumstances.

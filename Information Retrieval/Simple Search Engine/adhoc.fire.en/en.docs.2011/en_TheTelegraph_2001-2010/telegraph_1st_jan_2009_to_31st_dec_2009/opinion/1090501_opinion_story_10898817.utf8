The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Life under communist rule
                                                                                                                 LIFE UNDER COMMUNIST RULE                                                      Erika Riemann in 2008 at Sachsenhausen                                  
	If an intelligent layman were asked which was the most significant event of the 20th century, strong chances are that he would say the collapse of communism. If the same question had been asked of such a man in the 1970s, the answer, in all probability, would have been the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917. The victory of communism in Russia, the regimes it unleashed in Eastern Europe and the collapse of those regimes mark the beginning and the end of an epoch. This epoch saw the establishment of the most oppressive political and social system in human history. The irony was that this system identified itself with communism, which at one time was seen as the ideology of liberation and emancipation of all human kind.        
	This book brings together statements by various kinds of people who lived under the totalitarian regimes of East Germany, Romania and Czechoslovakia. Many of the people whose statements and life stories are presented here actually worked with the States of these countries some as spies, government functionaries, party officials, guards and so on. There are others who were victims of these regimes  men and women who dissented in one form or the other. There are also stories of innocent and ordinary people who, for no fault of theirs, were imprisoned, interrogated, tortured and exiled because they were suspected of carrying out anti-State activities. No proof was ever provided and no trial was ever conducted.        
	To get a flavour of what life was like in a communist State, take the life of Erika Riemann, who lived in East Germany and was arrested as a teenager. Her crime was that, as a school-girl prank, she had drawn a bow on Stalins moustache on a portrait of the great leader. A military court sentenced her to 10 years of forced labour in Siberia. Immediately after her arrest, she was kept in a castle dungeon where she was interrogated. The interrogations took place at night. She was made to sit upright on a chair and not allowed to move. If she moved, she was slapped. No food or drink was offered to the young girl. Finally, out of sheer exhaustion, she confessed to all the charges levelled against her even though she didnt understand many of them.        
	She was first sent to a prison near Dresden where she and all other inmates were locked in cages. She also had a spell in the prison fortress of Torgau where women were systematically raped. She escaped that fate because a doctor took pity on her and told her guards that she had syphilis. But she had to undergo the humiliation of stripping in front of the men who bayed and howled. In another prison, conditions were so horrible that the inmates, including Erika, went on a hunger strike. They were beaten up; as a result of this beating, Erika lost her sense of taste and smell, and lost (for a few days) her sight as well. She tried to hang herself; she was rescued, hospitalized and sent back to a single cell. She was released in January 1954. She was then only 22.        
	What was it that made a powerful State take revenge on an innocent girl in this manner? Other recollections in the book testify to the insecurity and paranoia of these regimes. There is a remarkable account by Ion Mihai Pacepa, the national security advisor of Ceausescu. He reveals the often ridiculous steps the Romanian leader and his wife took to protect themselves from bugging and assassinations. Ceausescu never wore the same suit twice because he feared that his clothes could be smeared with poison. The rule was to keep a years supply in stock, 365 suits, 365 pairs of shoes and so forth.        
	If the horror of Erika Riemanns life  and there are many recollections in this book that are similar to her experiences  drives one to tears and despair, there are heroes in this book who refused to be cowed down by the State, men and women who worked to bring down the regime. But scars remain. As Vaclav Havel says in this book, Two generations will have to grow up to wash away the footprints of communism.        
	This is not an easy book to read because human kind cannot bear too much reality. Yet repression and torture were the reality for thousands of people who dreamt or were made to dream that communism meant freedom and a higher state of civilization. There is no forgiveness after this knowledge.                          RUDRANGSHU MUKHERJEE

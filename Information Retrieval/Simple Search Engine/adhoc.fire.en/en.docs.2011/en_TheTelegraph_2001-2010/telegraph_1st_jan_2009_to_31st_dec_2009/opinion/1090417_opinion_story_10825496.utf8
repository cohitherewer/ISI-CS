	Magic, and some hot water                
	The impossible journey: A novella (Roman, Rs 199) by James A. Coghlan takes the readers back to the tumultuous Thirties, to an impoverished world hurtling towards a disastrous war. In it, a young Scotsman enlists himself in the army in the hope that his job would help him learn about the world. But the lessons he learns make him a changed man. He savours the myriad sights and smells of India where he is posted, undertakes a perilous car journey from Rawalpindi to London as part of a secret military operation, forging unbreakable bonds on that dangerous road. Years later, the Scotsman finds himself in an Edinburgh pub, reminiscing about the men who are gone. He is older, scarred, but is not afraid to take the road again. Poignantly written, Coghlans book faithfully documents the life of a soldier in an India and a world that were very different from what they are now.                  
	Chicken soup for the tea lovers soul: Stories steeped in comfort (Westland, Rs 250) has been compiled by Jack Canfield, Mark Victor Hansen and Patricia Lorenz, and includes original pieces from previously published sources that chronicle the pleasures of tea drinking. Like the other offerings from the Chicken Soup for the Soul series, this one too blends trivia and witty anecdotes into a delightful concoction. The contributors write about the beverages historical roots, the many kinds of tea available, the intriguing differences between green and black tea, as well as teas universal appeal that transcends cultures and continents. (Shirley J. Babcocks moving piece recounts how the author savoured a refreshing cup in a hot Botswana village.) Those wondering how to host the perfect tea party would also find useful tips here.        
	(UN)settled: notes from a shifting life (Tranquebar, Rs 295) by Kamini Karlekar documents a young womans journeys to Sudan and Liberia  countries torn apart by strife  which leave her with the feeling of being the eternal outsider even as she straddles different cultures, places and people in her own life. But her memories of Africa are not only about rootlessness. They also make her realize that it was this sense of not-belonging that had given her the courage to stand up for her beliefs and enabled her to live, love and fight to make space for herself in a divided and dangerous world. Karlekars prose is lucid, and her descriptions of the horrors of war and displacement strikingly real.

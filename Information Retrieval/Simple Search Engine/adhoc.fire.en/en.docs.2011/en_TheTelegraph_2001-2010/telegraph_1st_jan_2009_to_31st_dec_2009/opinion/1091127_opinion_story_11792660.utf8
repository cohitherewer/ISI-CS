                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	No healing touch                  
	Sir  With the waning support for the Left Front government in West Bengal, many would not find it surprising that the health minister, Surjya Kanta Mishra, was heckled by Trinamul Congress cadre during his visit to the North Bengal Medical College and Hospital (Surjya roughed up, Nov 24). Mishra tried to present a bold face by claiming that he was not bothered anyway because these things happen when you face a crowd. One wonders whether Mishra has always experienced similar hostile reception while facing crowds during his long tenure as health minister. There can be little doubt that in the course of more than three decades of Left rule in the state, confrontation with an unfriendly crowd is a new experience for the leaders of the government led by the Communist Party of India (Marxist). Such confrontations have been taking place oftener than before following the defeat of the present government in the recent elections.          
	The healthcare system in West Bengal has been one of the worst in the country for a very long time. There is little doubt that public opinion about the abysmal healthcare system in the state played a major role in the defeat of the CPI(M) in the polls. Not only has the quality of treatment fallen, the quality of medical education, too, has taken a nosedive during the rule of this government. Today, doctors trained in the state can hardly be found in top hospitals across India. The incursion of trade-union mentality in medical colleges during the long period of Left rule has played a part in ruining the healthcare system in West Bengal.          
	But one must, at the same time, be critical of the conduct of the supporters of TMC who were agitating before the health minister. Nobody should encourage a rowdy public demonstration inside a hospital. All hospitals must maintain a completely quiet environment. Noise can aggravate many clinical conditions. One wonders whether the TMC cadre, who were shouting at the health minister, realized that their protest might bring harm to patients.          
	Positive changes in healthcare cannot be brought about through unruly demonstrations by supporters of political parties, who do no more than create a ruckus. One feels that meaningful changes in the present, ailing healthcare system can only be implemented by decent and solicitous individuals who are not merely motivated by political agenda.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Ground realities          
	Sir  It is not understood how the day of the demolition of the Babri Masjid was the saddest day in the life of L.K. Advani when he is, at the same time, proud to be associated with the Ayodhya movement, and the construction of a grand temple at Ayodhya is his goal (Babri panel high on purple prose, low on specifics, Nov 25). This is totally double standard. It is difficult to take Advanis expression of sorrow seriously as there is reason to believe that he abetted the demolition of the mosque by staying on at Ayodhya on December 6, 1992.          
	But giving a clean chit to P.V. Narasimha Rao, the then prime minister, while indicting Atal Bihari Vajpayee, is somewhat surprising. If Vajpayee did not make any effort to stop the movement from destroying the mosque, then Rao, too, could not prevent the demolition. Vajpayee could not have been able to prevent the demolition at that stage as Advani had taken the lead role. Rao, as the prime minister, could have imposed Presidents rule in the state to prevent the unfortunate incident. In such a situation, if Vajpayee is indicted then Rao should also have been held responsible in the Liberhan Commission report.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  It is difficult to fathom why such a hue and cry is being raised over the leaking of the Liberhan Commission report on the demolition of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya, when the truth has come to light after a long wait.          
	The accused members of the Bharatiya Janata Party cannot be absolved of their responsibility for the demolition. There is reason to believe that many of them were the masterminds behind the destruction. Are they scared of being exposed to further embarrassment? L.K. Advani, a veteran of the BJP, is still proud of his association with the Ayodhya movement. Other stalwarts of the party, too, do not seem to feel any real regret for their involvement in the demolition. Even Atal Bihari Vajpayee could not escape indictment.           
	The accused persons may not be feeling any guilt, or be conscious of having defamed the nations image. Consequently, they may not accept the Liberhan Commission report. But secular India should respond strongly to the accusations. The nation should also work towards preventing incidents that may cause hurt to any community, in any form, in future.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Wazir Hossain, Calcutta

                
	Sir  It is quite unfortunate that the highly sensitive Liberhan Commission report on the demolition of the Babri Masjid got leaked by the print media. It is definitely not responsible journalism by the newspaper involved. The electronic media, too, should have been more restrained in the coverage of the leak.           
	Having said that, the way in which those indicted in the report behaved in Parliament later is even more deplorable. In a truly democratic country, members of a party that calls itself democratic would have hung their heads in shame after being accused of such an offence. But BJP members of parliament, in both Houses, had the nerve to shout slogans and disrupt proceedings. The way the Left and some other parties gave their support to the BJP in its outcry against the Congress exposes their true colours as well. It is a pity that we are citizens of a country where the least regret or repentance is not shown by members of an outfit that has laid itself open to charges of being communal and divisive.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	The Satyam Saga

	When the Satyam board approved a proposal on December 16, 2008, to acquire 100 per cent of Maytas Properties for Rs 6,240 crore and 51 per cent of Maytas Infra for Rs 1,440 crore, the institutional shareholders and investment analysts smelled a rat.  
	Why would the fourth largest software exporter in India, and a highly profitable one at that, stray from its core competence to buy up two entities, at prohibitive prices, dealing in real estate and construction? Moreover, these two companies were for all practical purposes owned and run by the family of Ramalinga Raju, chairman and promoter of Satyam Computer Services Ltd. Since the proposal was announced after trading hours, no impact was felt in the Indian bourses that day. Late into the evening, news started coming in that the companys American Depository Receipts, or ADRs, have started to lose ground, finally closing at $5.70, down from $12.55, a drop of 55 per cent. The next day, Satyam got clobbered in the bourses in India, tanking over 30 per cent, resulting in shareholders losing Rs 4,610 crore in a single day.         
	Raju had no option but to abandon the plan and, as a last resort, engaged the services of DSP Merrill Lynch for strategic options available to the company. However, on January 6, 2009, Rajus luck finally ran out as the consulting firm expressed its inability to accept the assignment as there were material accounting irregularities. The next morning, in a move that made headlines across the world, Ramalinga Raju mailed his confession to the Satyam directors and the stock exchanges, taking sole responsibility for the entire scam, emphasizing that neither he nor his family has benefited financially from the inflated profits.        
	The numbers were staggering. As on September 30, 2008, the companys balance sheet carried enhanced cash and bank balances of Rs 5,040 crore, non-existent interest income of Rs 376 crore, and an understated liability of Rs 1,230 crore on account of money Raju had arranged. Actual sundry debtors were Rs 490 crore against the balance sheets Rs 2,651 crore. Revenues, too, were overstated by Rs 588 crore. It later transpired that Raju started inflating the companys income sometime in 2001, with the aim of showing his customers that the company was big and growing fast. The additional revenue, fraudulently added, went straight to the profit line and the company paid taxes on the overstated profits!        
	Several questions arise out of a scam of such audacity and magnitude. Were there any early warning signals? Did Raju inflate the numbers to bolster the value of his stake in Satyam? Was it done to increase his personal wealth, after all these shares were pledged to raise loans from banks to acquire other assets? What role did the auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers, play? Were they silent partners to this crime committed over 28 quarters? What were independent directors, all marquee names in the business world, doing all this while? What needs to be done to prevent a repetition in future? How can Satyam be salvaged? The issues arising out of each question have been addressed chapter-wise by the different authors of this book in an engaging manner. Not surprisingly, the consequent variation in the style of writing adds to the readability of this slim volume.        
	Before indicting Indian regulators en masse for this gigantic scam, it may be worthwhile to consider scams in other parts of the world. Bernie Madoffs Ponzi scheme, which came to light earlier this year, was just as improbable, highlighting lax regulatory rules and inadequate level of information available to investors across the western world.         
	Prominent among other frauds was the sudden bankruptcy of WorldCom in 2002 in the United States of America. And just in case one thought that Europe was insular in this respect, Parmalat, the Italy-based dairy giant, was declared bankrupt after the discovery of a multi-million dollar black hole in its books, proving, once again, that fraudsters have no colour or creed.                          SATRUJIT BANERJEE

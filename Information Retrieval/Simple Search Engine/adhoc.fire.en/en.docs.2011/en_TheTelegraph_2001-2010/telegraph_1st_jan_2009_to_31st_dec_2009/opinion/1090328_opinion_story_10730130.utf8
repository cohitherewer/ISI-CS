                                                                                                                 Birds of a feather                                  VISUAL ARTS: Somak Ghoshal                                                  
	Humour seldom takes centre stage in contemporary Indian art, especially if the art deals with as grave a subject as the Nation. Balaji Ponnas Black-Smoke (Bose Pacia, Feb 27- March 15) provided a refreshing change, in that it used comedy as a visual prop to convey a variegated sense of Indianness. After viewing the work of Josh P.S. and of Bari Kumar at the same gallery, one is haunted by a strange feeling of dj vu while looking at Balajis paintings. With a predilection for dusky shades (sepia and dirty ochre) and tricky phrases, all three appear to be birds of uncannily similar feather.        
	A typical exercise in the mode used by Balaji  with graffiti, political slogans or popular sayings  is expected to either lapse into terse sarcasm or gentle parody. While his comic idiom straddles both, it never privileges one over the other.        
	The most vivid image is of a man defecating, his faeces spreading out in the shape of the world map. The words They came for the spices, but they left those spices are inscribed in the painting. The preposterousness of such a composition hits the viewer first at a gut level, before the mischievous allusion to imperialism and the spice trade registers. This shock of recognition is what matters most, and it comes as much from the images as from the words inscribed on them. A diptych done in deep-sea blue and wet-sand yellow is trailed by birds and fighter planes, both reduced to dots: Common in their flying one searching food another reaching target, it says.        
	We are compelled to think about the relationship between words and images, about what the eye sees or is allowed to see. The reality, especially in a country like India, is most often not what it looks like. In Show love for land, not for name (picture), a huge crowd gathers under an azure sky on which angels flutter, holding tiny diyas giving out a sooty smoke that forms the words, We love Bharat. A close look at the crowd reveals quite another story beyond the feel-good Unity in Diversity. The banners held up by the cartoon figures counter We love Bharat with We love India. The cheerful diversity looks threateningly divisive all of a sudden.         
	This division of labour between the verbal and the visual in Balajis work is implied in the subtitle of the exhibition, Re-imagining nation through popular grids of geopi-ety/ty. Bringing together the affective, the intellectual and the witty, he creates a fluid emotional field that the viewer has to negotiate with. But the process does not involve a struggle, so amusingly accessible are the linguistic and visual codes. Balajis wisecracks make for excellent teasers that throw up challenges, as good crossword-puzzles do, to give the brain some healthy exercise.

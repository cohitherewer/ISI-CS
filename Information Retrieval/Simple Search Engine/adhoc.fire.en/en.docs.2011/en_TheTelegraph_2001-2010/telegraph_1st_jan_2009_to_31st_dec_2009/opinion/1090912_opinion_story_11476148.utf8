The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Energy, elegance and bits of a sonata
                                                                                                                 ENERGY, ELEGANCE AND BITS OF A SONATA                              Fauzia Marikar      Music                                                
	On September 5, the Calcutta School of Music presented Nathalie Bouquins piano recital at its fifth Monsoon Concert, also featuring the violinist, Sanjib Mondel.        
	Nathalie Bouquin is a reputed pianist and has performed in the major cities of Europe. Her impressive early education in the St Petersburg conservatory is evident in her presentation of each work, in charmingly accented English, which might have been further enhanced with the use of a mike. We had to content ourselves with the lilting nuances of her voice and a word caught here and there and the hope of clarification on the internet, later.        
	Sanjib Mondel is well known as the lively and popular conductor of the Calcutta Chamber Orchestra. He has been heard as a violinist in chamber concerts.        
	Despite steady rain, the little auditorium was filled to capacity. Bouquin began her recital with one of the most challenging works of the Romantic era, Robert Schumanns love poem, Kreisleriana. No matter how many complicated assumptions may be made regarding this early work of the composer, it is clear that it is dedicated to his beloved and later his wife, Clara Wieck. A letter referring to the work states, You and one of your ideas are the principal subject and I shall call them Kreisleriana and dedicate them to you.        
	Originally written as a fantasy for the piano, this work consists of eight movements built around a simple theme, said to be composed by Clara herself. It is understandable that Clara was the first performer, being the excellent musician that she was. Bouquins interpretation contained a robust energy, which did not detract from the romantic elegance of the whole. Her technique, overall sensitivity and stylish grace displayed an intrinsic understanding of the intimate nuances of each movement.        
	The second and third movement of the Sonata in A major by Csar Franck that followed featured Sanjib Mondel on the violin. These two extremely exciting movements were given a fiery rendering by Bouquin, but met with a tepid response from the violinist. Mondels intonation was almost there, but there was no understanding of the pathos and passion in the composition, and his violin had a rather thin tonal quality. It was a commendable inclusion, however.        
	Prokofievs Sonata in F minor, Opus 1, was performed with great emotional expressiveness. This pianist has a formidably powerful technique and an erudite approach to each performance. To resounding applause, she played Chopins Etude No. 13 in A flat as an encore. We look forward to hearing more of Bouquin in the forthcoming Winter Concerts series.

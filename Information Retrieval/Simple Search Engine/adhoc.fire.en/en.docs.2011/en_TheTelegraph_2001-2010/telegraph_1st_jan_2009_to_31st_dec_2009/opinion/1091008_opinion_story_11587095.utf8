                                                                                                                 UNQUIET FLOWS                                                    
	Now that the flood waters have started receding from the river basins of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, the magnitude of the devastation is revealing itself, together with the sorry tale of human culpability. In a flash, the floods in the South have claimed hundreds of lives, unsettled millions of people and destroyed valuable property and crop  the collective cost of which the nation is likely to go on counting till the next disaster strikes. But what will be missed, as usual, in all such calculations is the ugly truth the flooding of the Krishna once again uncovered  natural disasters of this kind can be prevented from assuming proportions of a national calamity and there is something fundamentally wrong with the way rivers and watercourses in India are being managed and controlled. In the specific instance of the Krishna floods, for example, it was bad planning and the complete lack of coordination between the state authorities that made it impossible for the state administrations to deal with the contingency of sudden and prolonged rainfall. Karnataka, with its own ideas about restricting the flow of Krishna water from its reservoirs (a bone of contention with Andhra Pradesh), was unable to cope with the surge in the volume of water following unprecedented rain. And Andhra Pradesh, which had to bear the brunt of the overflows from Karnataka, had no infrastructure in place to either contain the water or proceed with rapid evacuation. This is not surprising given that the work to increase the spillway capacity of the Srisailam dam is still pending and the Central Water Commission has complained that its flood warnings are being ignored repeatedly by Andhra Pradesh. The brunt of this incompetence is being borne by the people.        
	The management of droughts and floods  Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh suffer from both  requires coordination and an interdisciplinary approach in order to understand why such misfortune plagues this country year after year. Like the Krishna, the Kosi floods last year too made evident the need for an evaluation of the policy of managing water through the building of dams. This, together with more concentrated efforts at containing deforestation, promoting water conservation and de-silting of the waterways could minimize the effect of natural disasters. For now, of course, it is necessary to concentrate on relief and resettlement, with as little haggling as possible.

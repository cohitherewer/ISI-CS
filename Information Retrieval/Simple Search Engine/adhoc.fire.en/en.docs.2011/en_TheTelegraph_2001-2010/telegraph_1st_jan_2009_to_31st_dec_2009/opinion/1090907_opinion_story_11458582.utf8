	The tragic death of Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy leaves a problematic void in Andhra Pradesh for the Congress. Reddy had managed to hold together the unusually fractious state Congress unit, and this was one of the achievements that made him particularly valuable to the party high command. The efficiency, shrewdness and practical thinking that marked his intra-party strategies also lay behind his achievements as political worker and chief minister. His personal ambitions seldom got in the way of his mass appeal; rather, the Congress found in him a leader who convincingly devoted himself to public welfare. Reddy rose to claim the top job of the state and bagged it twice. For this, he depended on his political acumen and his feel of the popular pulse, and certainly astuteness, all of which are demonstrated by the fact that he never lost an election and was the only Congress chief minister to complete a full term in Andhra Pradesh. Where his predecessor, N. Chandrababu Naidu rather lost the plot, Reddy managed to strike a balance between agricultural and industrial development. Irrigation, the guarantee of free electricity, rural employment, housing facilities, healthcare for the poor and pension schemes had been given as much, if not more, attention as urban development, infrastructure and industry. Reddy, who twice gave the Congress a vast chunk of its seats in Parliament, in a way redefined the relationship of a centrist national party with its regional satraps.        
	It is its crucial dependence on Reddys stature that makes the Congresss task difficult in Andhra Pradesh now. To a large extent, Reddy had been a one-man show. Since there is no comparable leader, the choice of the next chief minister has been compromised. K. Rosaiah has been made to stand in, but it is doubtful if he will be able to hold out against the renewed faction-fighting and the claims of Reddys son, Jaganmohan Reddy, to the political mantle. Given the Congresss long tradition of dynastic politics and the outpouring of emotions in Andhra Pradesh, the top leadership may find it difficult to subsist on an unpopular decision. Yet, the moment calls for a clear head and a strong will. These are needed to carry forward Reddys policies, many of which may not reap the harvest they did for Reddy without adequate attention. If the party fails to fulfil the public expectations YSR aroused, it may find the political initiative passing on to the Telugu Desam Party. This time, the TDP may not repeat its earlier folly of treating the other anti-Congress vote-puller, the Praja Rajyam Party, as a pariah.

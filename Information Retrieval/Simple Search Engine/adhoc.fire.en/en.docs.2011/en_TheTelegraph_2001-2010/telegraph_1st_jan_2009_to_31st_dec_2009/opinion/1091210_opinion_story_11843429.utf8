	The agitation for separate statehood for Telengana has received a new stimulus with the fast-unto-death mission of the Telengana Rashtra Samiti chief, K. Chandrasekhar Rao. Some thought must have gone into its timing. No leader worth his salt would have let go of such an opportunity to raise the stakes, especially after being in a political wilderness. The ruling party in Andhra Pradesh is functioning without any sense of direction, its chief minister too weak to act and the Central command too confused to impose its will on the state. The calculations to derive maximum possible advantage from the situation were not entirely wrong, and this is evident from the way the administration in Andhra Pradesh has tried to meet Mr Raos challenge. The chief minister, K. Rosaiah, initially tried to buy out Mr Rao by promising to drop all charges against him and making constitutional changes that would lessen Hyderabads advantage over Telengana in employment opportunities. Since then, however, he has passed on all responsibilities to the party leader, who alone is supposed to decide whether there is a case for Telengana.         
	Telengana has a case, which may not be very different from those of the many other neglected regions on the map of India. Its backwardness, compared to prosperous coastal Andhra Pradesh and Rayalseema, is as much a result of its feudal history as one of neglect and callousness after Independence. Instead of addressing Telenganas problems, politicians have sought to use them as pawns. The Congress stands condemned for this sin as much as the other major political players in the scene, particularly the Telugu Desam Party, which has selectively associated itself with the cause. The Congress, however, has to shoulder a larger part of the blame. Telengana had been a major reason behind its victory in 2004. Yet, its critical dependence on Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy, once a staunch opponent of the Telengana movement, had somehow inured it to the concerns of the region. The ongoing agitation, with its mass participation, suggests that these cannot be swept under the carpet. There are fears that the issue of separate statehood for Telengana may give a fillip to agitations for a separate Bundelkhand, Harit Pradesh, Vidarbha and Gorkhaland. But unless issues of discordant growth, discrimination and neglect are confronted, there is little hope of keeping the state in one piece.

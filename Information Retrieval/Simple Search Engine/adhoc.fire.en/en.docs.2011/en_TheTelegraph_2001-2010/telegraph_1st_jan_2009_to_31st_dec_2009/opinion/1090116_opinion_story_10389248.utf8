	Chinnerys Hotel (Penguin, Rs 325) by Jaysinh Birjpatil presents a refreshing variation on the themes of cross-cultural identity and alienation that have been done to death by Indian writers in English. Here, instead of non-resident Indians digging for their roots, we have an Anglo-Indian family that sails back to England in 1946 on a sea of sorrow. The Chinnerys leave behind much more than just their beautiful hotel in Mhow. The two elderly members of the family do not survive the shift, and Grace Chinnery is left to fend for herself and her adopted daughter in post-war Britain. Grace later returns to Mhow to discover that the beloved land of her childhood no longer exists in reality. Reading the novel is like finding a forgotten photograph, which unlocks the door to an irretrievable past.                        
	Daughters Of Shame (Hodder amp; Stoughton, Rs 295) by Jasvinder Sanghera cashes on the success of Shame, which was Sangheras autobiographical account of the way her life came to be affected by the tradition of honour followed by Asian communities. Sanghera ran away from home in England when her family threatened her with an arranged marriage. She was disowned by her people after the defection. In 1994, she founded the charity organization, Karma Nirvana, to help victims of honour-based crimes. Daughters of Shame chronicles the stories of a few of these women. While the stories in themselves are terrifying, Sangheras retelling gets embarrassingly effusive at times.                        
	The True History Of Paradise (Headline Review, 6.99) by Margaret Cezair-Thompson can be the perfect companion on a bleak winter night, not the least because it is set in the colourful, sun-baked land of Jamaica. The story follows the political turmoil in Jamaica, before and after its independence, through the fortunes of the families of the Landings and the Darling-Sterns. These two families merge in Jean Landing, and she must carry the heavy burden of their histories, racial and colonial, on her dreary walk to freedom. In between Jeans story, her ancestors  some English, some Chinese, some Scottish  whisper their tales in Creole from beyond the grave. The past is played out endlessly in the present, and Jean must escape the trap of history if she is to survive.                                
	Growing With The Himalayas (Think Big, Rs 168) by Debarshi Roy is a book that would have been a treasure had its editors not been so outrageously sloppy. It is baffling that such an expensively produced book  there are colour photographs, as well as rare black-and- white ones on almost every page  should have such slipshod editing. But if the shaky and incorrect sentences in the book are ignored, it can be admired as an effort of love. Although Roy had spent his childhood in the foothills of the Himalayas, he had his first glimpse of Darjeeling only after the Gorkhaland agitation in the mid-Eighties. He found Darjeeling to bask in contentment in a quaint world of its own. A great deal of this old-world charm emanated from Darjeelings famous public schools, many of which have been there since colonial times. Roy talks about the inception, growth and the present condition of nine of these schools. The anecdotes are charming, as are the early twentieth-century photographs, which make the days of the Raj come alive.                        
	Mind Maps At Work (Thorsons, Rs 295) by Tony Buzan explains how to be the best at your job and still have time to play. True to the title, the book suggests creating a planned map to solve each problem of your professional life. If Buzan is to be believed, you can reorder your life or beat the bully at work if only you have a plan chalked out in your mind.

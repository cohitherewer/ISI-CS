The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | The wall that divides
                                                                                                                 THE WALL THAT DIVIDES                                  Neha Sahay                              
	The Chinese New Year frenzy is at its peak. January 26 was the New Year day, and, as usual, supermarkets had been full. People seemed to be heeding the advice of Li Zhe, member of the advisory body to the communist party. I suggest patriotic consumption. Everyone and every institution should spend what they make in one year just on consumption, said Li last month. Another official, head of a provincial capitals urban planning bureau, exhorted TV viewers: Buy an apartment, and you are patriotic. On the same day, Beijings mayor was telling builders, Ordinary people dont like you because youve pushed up housing prices irrationally. How can I love you, now that I cant buy a square meter with my monthly income? The average price of an apartment in Beijing is supposed to be 15 times the average annual salary.        
	However, the mayor seemed to be out of sync with the official line. Xinhua, the official news agency, carried an article by two economists titled Active consumption is patriotic wherein they quoted Marx: Production is thus at the same time consumption, and consumption is at the same time production.... Without production there is no consumption, but without consumption there is no production either, since in that case production would be useless. They argued that all the measures taken by the government to tide over the financial crisis would come to naught if people didnt spend. Historically, the Chinese had been averse to spending, but it was time now to be person-centred. Loving your country is loving yourself, they said.        
	Migrant workers also love themselves, but they find that few others love them. As always, the countdown to the Chinese New Year is the worst time for them  its when they start demanding back wages so that they can go home for the Spring Festival. This year, as every year, their struggle was as hard as ever despite the new labour laws that came into force a year ago.                
	Protest tunes        
	The drying up of export orders made it worse, for some small factory owners just ran off with the money, while others shut their factories without paying their employees. Sometimes police, at other times goons, were used to silence protests. In Guangdong, violent protests did take place, but in other less industrially advanced areas, the workers simply took what they got.        
	Apart from labour organizations in Hong Kong, migrant workers have found unexpected friends on the internet. Two musicians have composed songs specifically for them. Shi Yong composed a song titled You owe me my wages, while Xiaochaos song is Migrant Workers Blood and Sweat  Asking for back wages. Both talk about the contrast between workers lives and those of their employers. In the first, a worker tells his family he cant come home for the Spring Festival because he couldnt face them empty-handed. His boss drives a Mercedes, but has no money to pay him. We build the tall buildings in the cities but we are looked down upon, says the song, ending, I ask myself whether there is any justice and I calm myself down/ I persuade myself that I am the creditor and thats no doubt/ You owe me, You owe me...        
	In the second song, the worker from the mountains has waited long after the Spring Festival for his wages. He (the boss) said he had no money to pay but he spent several thousands on mahjong goes the refrain, which also talks about the bosss two mistresses for whom he bought the latest mobile and a necklace.        
	Significantly, in this song the worker knows his rights. He goes to the labour department, which keeps calling the boss till the latter switches his mobile off. The workers then sue him, but the court hears the case only after the next new year. It rules in their favour, but by then, the boss has run away with the money.

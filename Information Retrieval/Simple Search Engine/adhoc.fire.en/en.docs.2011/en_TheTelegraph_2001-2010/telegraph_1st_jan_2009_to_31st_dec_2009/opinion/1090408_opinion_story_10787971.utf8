	The inability of the international community to contain North Koreas nuclear and missile programme is evidence of the failure of the nuclear nonproliferation programme. The intention behind the latest Pyongyang missile test was to demonstrate, once again, North Koreas growing technological capabilities and its unwillingness to submit to the diktat of the United States of America. Since 2006, North Korea has faced sanctions enforced by the United Nations security council. In this case, however, the UN security council has been unable to either condemn the test or arrive at any other acceptable resolution. Both China and Russia have argued that the low orbit test does not violate any UN directive, and that pushing North Korea to the wall would be counter-productive. They want to demonstrate that they too will not sign on a US-dictated dotted line. It can only be hoped that the North Korean government will be persuaded to return to the negotiating table of the six-party talk, which includes the major powers and the regional actors. The North Korean government  led by the reclusive dictator, Kim Jong-il  aims at creating a significant nuclear and missile capability by 2012 to mark the 100th birth anniversary of the founder of the state, Kim Il-sung.         
	The North Korean test is the first major foreign policy challenge faced by Barack Obama, but it also reflects the growing impotence of the nuclear nonproliferation regime. Syria and Iran are two other states that are believed to be in the process of acquiring nuclear weapons and technology. Nuclear weapons still seem to carry prestige and are a powerful symbol of technological advancement. For authoritarian regimes and weak states, they offer a quick way of building domestic support and legitimacy. States like North Korea view nuclear weapons as a bargaining chip to secure economic aid and other benefits. Some states genuinely believe that nuclear weapons enhance their security. The only way to prevent nuclear proliferation is by delegitimizing nuclear weapons, ensuring security guarantees for those states that face threats from other nuclear states. There has to be a real movement towards the reduction of nuclear weapons and towards disarmament by the nuclear weapon states if they have to ensure that nuclear weapons no longer remain attractive symbols of power and prestige.

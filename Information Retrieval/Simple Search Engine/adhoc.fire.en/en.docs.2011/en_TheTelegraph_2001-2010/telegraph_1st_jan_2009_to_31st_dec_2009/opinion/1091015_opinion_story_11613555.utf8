The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Time to heed the call
                                                                                                                 TIME TO HEED THE CALL                                  China Diary -Neha Sahay                              
	The inscrutable Hu Jintao actually smiled spontaneously while watching the awesome National Day Parade on October 1. That was when the Beijing Womens Militia passed by  the last square formation to do so. The perfect square of red-mini-skirted slim marchers with long white boots and pert white berets was a sight for sore eyes. Leading them were two students, part-time models, whose dogged determination to march as well as the rest of the militia has turned them into national heroines. It helps, of course, that they are sexy.        
	The womens militia comprises ordinary citizens, part of the peoples militia that Chairman Mao had set up, a kind of civil defence corps that works under the army. When it made its first appearance in 1958, it comprised peasants, workers and students. This time, it comprised women entrepreneurs, mothers, village officials, private sector employees and students, but no peasants and workers.        
	Many ordinary Chinese applied to be part of the National Day Parade. The selection was only the first step; what followed was arduous training in marching for four months. The army would measure with the help of strings the precise distance that the arms and knees of the marchers should move.        
	This is not new. Ten years back, the training for the 50th anniversary parade had lasted 10 months. Every stride of the marchers had to be 75 cm long and 25 cm high; they had to stand at attention for two hours every day. Even at that time, ordinary citizens were willing to make great sacrifices to be part of the parade. Competition was intense  only one in 500 applicants was selected. Liu Fulan cut off her long hair, 52 inches long, to comply with the requirements; she doesnt regret it. One lock of that hair is on display in the Military Museum of the Chinese Peoples Revolution.                
	Vast change        
	So it is not surprising that Zhao Na and Zhang Xiaofei, who led the womens militia contingent, managed to achieve what at one point seemed impossible for these modelling students. Initially unable to stand at attention or at ease, their feeble kicks earned them the nickname limp noodles. So they decided to go that extra mile: do 50 push-ups instead of the required 20 and practise on their own after the days practice was over. Their teachers fretted as their complexion grew darker; after all, these two had already modelled for Audi, Mercedes-Benz and LOreal, and had also been hostesses in last years Olympics. But the two seemed transformed.         
	Liu Jiaxin, aged 18 years, was the youngest in the contingent. Her transformation was equally drastic. Someone who couldnt fold her quilt to start with was, at the end of the training, washing her own clothes and sweeping the floor. Zhang Yuanyuan gave up her Singapore green card and a job that paid her 20,000 yuan a month to apply for participation in the parade. During the training, she suffered a stress fracture, but didnt drop out. Then there was the nurse who withdrew from the nationwide finals of the Miss Tourism International contest when she got selected for the parade.         
	Forty-six per cent of the womens militia comprises single children born in the late 1980s and early 1990s, described as the strawberry generation because of the privileged lifestyles they lead. The glamour of being part of the parade must undoubtedly have been a motivation, but what made them stick on? Simple old-fashioned patriotism, it would seem. Coming here for the military review is like going to the battlefield. The call from the motherland must be answered with concrete action, the two models said. By the end of their training, 43 participants had joined the communist party. After watching the parade, many women decided they wanted to join the army.

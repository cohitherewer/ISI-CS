The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | When a dream comes to an end
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        WHEN A DREAM COMES TO AN END                                  FIFTH COLUMN - SUMANTA SEN                              
	There is an adage that says, you cant keep a good man down. To the outside world, the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha supremo, Shibu Soren, may not appear a good man, and not without reason. But as the Jharkhand election results show, the ordinary tribal in the small state is still not prepared to go with the outsiders on this. Indeed, the tribals were angry at the way in which both the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party treated Soren. So the people decided to show the world that they were still with their Guruji. Soren had not swept the polls but with 18 seats, he ensured that he would call the shots in a state that yielded the verdict of a hung assembly once again.        
	After a court had initially linked him to the murder of an associate some years ago, many outside Jharkhand had thought that this would be the end of the man. But he bounced back following his acquittal, and the results show that the Jharkhandis still find him relevant, no matter what the Congress or some BJP leaders in New Delhi have to say. He also won a personal battle, defeating Babulal Marandi who had hoped to emerge as the new guruji by hitching his Jharkhand Vikas Morcha to the Sonia-Rahul bandwagon. Marandi would have tried to bury the differences with Soren had he received the right price. However, he became irrelevant since Soren decided to become the chief minister with the help of the BJP, the Janata Dal(United) and the All Jharkhand Students Union.        
	When it came to numbers though, the Congress could have been in a better position. If it had agreed to help Soren become the new chief minister, the combined strength of the two parties would have gone up to 32 . In that case, even if the JVM decided to opt out, the magic figure could have been secured with help from the Rashtriya Janata Dal, the Nationalist Congress Party and the independents.                 
	Real problems        
	Soren might have succeeded in forming the government but this is not a happy situation for Jharkhand. Sorens government will continue to be dogged by uncertainty as politicians can fall out as easily as they come together. What Jharkhand needs is stability, as well as a ministry that is determined to pull the state out of the mess it is in at the moment. Notwithstanding its natural resources and the fact that Jamshedpur is home to a huge industrial empire, Jharkhand is the most backward state in the country and a happy hunting ground for the Maoists. It needs to get out of the tunnel, but the uncertain political situation suggests that the state will remain in the dark for quite some time.        
	There is little point in blaming the voters for this. Like in the past, this time too, they had not a single party before them to repose their faith in. Indeed, if anybody is to be blamed, it is the tribal leaders who had fought for the creation of a separate state. If a Soren, a Marandi or an Arjun Munda had stayed together and resolved that having got their state they would show the world how the tribals lot can be improved, then the dream of the ordinary Jharkhandi would have come true, at least to a large extent.         
	But, unfortunately, that was not to be. Like the dikhus, the tribal leaders had also decided that politics was all about self aggrandizement. In this years elections, the Congress had come waving the development flag but it found that there were only a few takers. After all, what can development mean to a people who are resigned to remain the wretched of the earth, thanks to the present quality of leadership within the state?Also nowhere else perhaps is it so obvious that politics is all about money. Hence, the low turn-out of voters during elections. For Jharkhand, it looks as if this is the beginning of the end of a dream.

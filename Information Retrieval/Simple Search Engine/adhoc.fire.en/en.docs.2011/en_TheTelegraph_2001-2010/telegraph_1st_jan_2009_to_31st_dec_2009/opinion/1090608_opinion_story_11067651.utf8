The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Morning after
                                                                                                                 MORNING AFTER                                                    
	It is not surprising that the presidents speech boasted about the 8.5 per cent average growth achieved in the governments just-ended term, although the foundations were laid by the previous National Democratic Alliance government. And it was understandable that it did not mention the grievous damage done by her previous government to the fiscal balance. Still, it was only appropriate that it should have given priority to its correction. It was full of references to the governments past and future populist schemes, so it could not promise to rein in government expenditure. Being an old-style Congress government, it should raise taxes on the rich to reduce fiscal deficit. But that would have been unfriendly to business, with which the Congress has made peace.        
	Bereft of other alternatives, the speech promised to promote private-public partnerships. Just how that would bridge the fiscal gap is a mystery. For private-public partnerships have hitherto been used only to undertake investment projects for which the government did not have money. The idea was that a private firm would build a public facility, and in return be allowed to levy a charge on the services until it had retrieved its costs with a decent return. Private-public partnerships were first tried out by the preceding NDA government with success; it greatly expanded the handling capacity of ports. But it was also conscious of the limits of such partnerships. For instance, it built thousands of miles of roads, but used its own money to build them because it is difficult to fence and cordon roads so that a charge for their services can be levied. That was the legacy the United Progressive Alliance government inherited and dissipated. The National Highways Authority fell apart under its leadership because its ministers could not find executives who could satisfy their greed; as a result, the road mileage built in the last five years was miserable. The contracts given to private builders for new airports fell apart because the results did not match the estimates with which the builders had won the contracts. This is always a risk with giving out public works contracts by tender: that a bidder would win the contract with an unrealistically low bid, and would ask for more money halfway through the works when the government could no longer dismiss him and get another.        
	Such is the legacy of non-achievement that this government inherits from its previous incarnation. Whether it can improve upon the legacy depends on what it has learnt from its experience. That it is conscious of its legacy is abundantly clear from the presidents speech; it contains numerous promises of monitoring and reporting amongst the things it will do in its first 100 days. Beginning oversight after billions have been spent has the handicap that the undeserving beneficiaries have a vested interest in sabotaging oversight. So the promises must await oversight before they acquire credibility.

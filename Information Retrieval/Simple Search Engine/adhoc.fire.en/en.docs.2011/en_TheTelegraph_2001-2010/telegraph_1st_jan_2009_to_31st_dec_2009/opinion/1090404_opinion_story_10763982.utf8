	At the altar of the people                  
	Sir  No middle way (April 2 ) described the will to tighten security in Tibet, lock up dissidents, and bar entry for foreigners as a Chinese characteristic. The former Soviet Union had also annexed small states like Lithuania, Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan, ostensibly to liberate the proletariat. The annexation of Tibet is not a Chinese characteristic, but a Marxist one of expansionism. How long will China keep Tibet? Sceptre and crown tumble at the altar of the people. That is the historical truth.                     
	Yours faithfully,         Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta
                  
	Supreme lesson          
	Sir  Munnabhais cinematic Gandhigiri did not cut ice with the Supreme Court (Lost chance, April 2). So the court turned down Sanjay Dutts application to contest elections. His illegal possession of weapons was a blunder and he has paid dearly for it. The Supreme Court deserves praise for this judgment  to give Dutt permission to fight the elections would have been shocking. Nominating him as the Samajwadi Party candidate from Lucknow has compromised the credibility of the party leaders, Mulayam Singh Yadav and Amar Singh. Perhaps they had wanted to create rivalry within the Congress and within Dutts family. This landmark judgment should also be a lesson for political parties that nominate criminals as their candidates. Throughout the country, there is a campaign building up that seeks to persuade political parties not to nominate criminals as candidates, and to request voters to reject the candidates if parties field them. The Supreme Courts judgment strengthens this campaign. But the Bharatiya Janata Partys decision to nominate the Kandhamal-riot-accused, Manoj Pradhan, on the same day shows that alleged criminals will continue to be in politics in the worlds largest democracy. But when the apex court stayed the conviction of Navjot Singh Sidhu, invoking rare circumstances, then one expects some clarification as to what these circumstances could be. Perhaps the only way to avoid such discrepancies is to make the laws more precise and equitable.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  No daagi candidate should be allowed to contest elections. A person who has been sentenced to jail even for a day must be disqualified from contesting the polls. Most political parties give tickets to daagi candidates for the parties own benefit and ignore the welfare of the people from whom they are seeking votes. It is now up to the voters to throw them out by refusing to vote for them. If any such candidate wins the elections, then this will mean that the entire constituency is daagi too!                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  The self-appointed leaders of the Gorkhas, Bimal Gurung and Roshan Giri, seem bent on proving their own gullibility. Otherwise, why should they ask Jaswant Singh of the Bharatiya Janata Party to fight the Lok Sabha polls from Darjeeling (Morcha offers hill ticket to Jaswant, April 3). If they think that the BJP will take up the Gorkhaland cause, they are mistaken.           
	The BJPs only intention is to fish in troubled waters and make both the Central and state governments uneasy. Supporting the BJP will serve no purpose for the hill people. By antagonizing both the Congress and the Left parties, they are causing a great deal of harm to their own cause. One can only hope that good sense will prevail in the leaders of the hill people and of the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha.                    
	Yours faithfully,

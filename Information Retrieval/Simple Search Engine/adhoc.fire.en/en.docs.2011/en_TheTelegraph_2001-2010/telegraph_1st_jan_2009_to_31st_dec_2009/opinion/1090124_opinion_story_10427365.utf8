                                                                                                                 HEALTHY, WEALTHY AND PROLIFIC                                  This above all - Khushwant Singh                          Happy family                                        
	During the last days of the British Raj, among the top Hindu families of undivided Punjab were the Mahajans. The doyen was the leading civil lawyer of the Lahore High Court and the president of the bar association. I am not sure how devout a Hindu he was but he was firm in his belief that unless Hindus were more prolific in breeding, Muslims, who were entitled to take four wives, would out-breed them and become the majority community of India. Neither he nor I could name a Muslim who had more than one wife, and knew a few Hindus and Sikhs who had two at the same time. However, he remained unshaken in his belief.        
	He made breeding his dharma altogether he had 11 offspring through two wives (one had died), and thus created a family large enough to make a cricket, hockey or soccer team. Karan Mahajan is one of his descendants. After completing his school education from Delhi, he went on a scholarship to do his graduation from Stanford University and is now living in Brooklyn, New York. He has published his first novel. Names have been changed but still are recognizable to those who know the Mahajans of Lahore. The chief character is reincarnated as Rakesh Ahuja, who has 14 children, one from the first wife, 13 from the second. He loves making love to his very plain-looking second wife. When she is pregnant, the family makes a lot of savings in sanitary towels because she does not have much time to menstruate. Karan Mahajan calls his novel Family Planning. It has received laudatory notices from American critics, and is to be published in England and other European countries, and also in India.        
	Like his non-fictional counterparts, Rakesh Ahuja is a very important person: a cabinet minister who lives in a large ministerial bungalow, has an official car with a red beacon on top, commandos and an army of servants. He is the favourite of the lady chief minister (with close resemblance to Sheila Dikshit), whose feet her ministers wash with rosewater and drink like amrit. Ahuja is for-ever putting in his resignation and withdrawing it, and this gives him dual publicity. He is the chief progenitor of Delhis many flyovers and is busy completing the latest. His eldest son from the first wife is loved by his step-mother and all his step-siblings. He is also into jazz and is organizing a band to perform at the inauguration of the flyover.        
	From the loaded title to the shenanigans of our political netas, Karan Mahajan manages to weave together a readable tale with sarcasm and wit spiced with a profusion of the four letter word. It is a most promising start. I have no doubt we will hear more about him in the years to come.                
	Ghalib, again                
	I crave the readers forgiveness for coming back to Ghalib again and again. He has become my old-age obsession: I read some couplets every day and mull over them. He is both a kindred spirit and a role model  he was an iconoclast, a hard-drinker, womanizer, and indifferent to praise or blame. I would not have written about him again but for the fact that yet another book on his work has been published very recently. I gobbled up the contents of the book as fast as I could. It gave me acute indigestion. Let me explain why.        
	To start with, I could not understand the sub-title of the book Epistemologies of Elegance. I looked up the dictionary. Epistemology is the philosophy and theory of knowledge. I was still unable to grasp the meaning. I turned to the names of the compilers, translators and commentators  both Karachi-born ladies settled in America. One of the two, Azra Raza, a practising oncologist, lives in New York. The other, Sara Sulari Goodyear, is a professor of English at Yale. Since the mother tongue of both is Urdu, I expected them to do a better job in translating Ghalib than others. I felt very let down.         
	The two authors should have know that the primary object of writing is communication. If your text is beyond the comprehension of readers, writing becomes a self-defeating exercise. Their prose is verbose. For instance, they write that one of the main conflicts in the poem, Aah ko chaahiye ek umr asar honey tak, is that between infinitude and the actuality of temporality. On Dil hee to hai na sang kisht they say, Ghalib both looked back on the Greek myth of Narcissus and proleptically read Freuds theories of narcissism.         
	They admit that poetry loses much of its verbal music in translation. This applies more to Urdu poetry, where great emphasis is put on rhyme, meter and wordplay. Nevertheless, translations are a must, provided that they are better than the ones done earlier. Unfortunately, I do not think that their translations of the 21 ghazals are an improvement. They give the ghazals a thematic sequence which they do not have. And many are way off the mark. Jigar, which recurs many times in Ghalibs poems, is translated as soul. It is not. Ghalib and other poets clearly use dil (heart) as the seat of love and jigar (liver) as the seat of passion or lust. The book is Ghalib: Epistemologies of Elegance.

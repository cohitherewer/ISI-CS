The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Letters to Editor
                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Why spare the babus?                  
	Sir  Whichever government comes to power in the next general elections, the disinvestment of public sector units must be its foremost priority. The vast number of people working in the private and unorganized sectors should not have to pay for the luxurious lifestyles of those employed in the PSUs. When all over the world, and in India, everybody is having to work doubly hard to hold on to his or her job, why should the PSU babus be spared the challenge? Privatization, and not populist policies, should be at the top of the new governments agenda.           
	Yours faithfully,         Abhijit Guha, Toronto, Canada 
        
	Brave ending          
	Sir  Although the British reality-television star, Jade Goody, had became famous for her racist comments against Shilpa Shetty, her death gives to her career a sad end (Princess from wrong side, March 23). Goody earned goodwill after apologizing for the incident and had visited India to make amends. She will be remembered for being outspoken and candid in admitting to her mistakes.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
R. Sekar, Visakhapatnam 

                
	Sir  It was sad to learn about Jade Goodys death. She was a true fighter and an inspiration for those who are fighting cancer all over the world. It was ironic that she breathed her last on Mothers Day. I feel sorry for her children. Her courageous battle has raised awareness regarding cervical cancer.                    
	Yours faithfully,         Rupa R, Jamshedpur

              
	Enemy within          
	Sir  In his article, Pakistan s achievement (March 24), Ashok V. Desai is wrong when he says that Pakistan has not been as successful in its destabilizing strategy in Kashmir as it has been in Afghanistan. In 1972, both Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto and Indira Gandhi came to a tacit understanding in Simla not to resolve the Kashmir problem but to keep it alive. A Kashmir aflame helps Islamabad in obtaining unrestricted military and economic aid from the United States of America and from countries like China.           
	Kashmir is the epicentre of the Muslim vote-bank and as long as the dispute with Pakistan continues, Article 370 reigns, not so much for Jammu and Ladakh, but for the residents of the valley who virtually live on the house and sell their votes.          
	Adding fuel to the fire, Zia-ul-Haq launched his eminently successful thousand cut war on India in 1986 by bleeding us through terrorism. Keeping the vote-bank factor in mind, no government in New Delhi (including the Bharatiya Janata Party) adopted any proper counter-terrorism measure. The Line of Control has been an open border over the last 22 years, and Indias only response to trans-border terrorism is to use its army purely for fire-fighting. Every recommendation made by the army to eliminate terrorism has been junked by our powers-that-be in view of their vote-driven priorities.           
	Indias real enemy is not Pakistan, but its own leaders.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Jayanta Kumar Dutt, Calcutta

                          
	Parting shot          
	Sir  My heartiest congratulations to The Telegraph for carrying Mithu Alurs article on the hundred million differently-abled Indians who face the wrath of nature and man but who refuse to be crushed (The hundred million who refuse to be invisible, March 24). The suggestion of appointing a national disability commission in the Prime Ministers Office should be heeded. Such articles can change the destiny of the nation, and with it, the world.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Nileen Putatunda, Calcutta

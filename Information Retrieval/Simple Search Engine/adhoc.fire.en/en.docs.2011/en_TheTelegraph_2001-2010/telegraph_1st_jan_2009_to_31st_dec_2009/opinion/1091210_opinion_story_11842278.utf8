                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        BATTLE FOR SHELTER                                   CHINA DIARY -NEHA SAHAY                              
	A woman immolated herself last month on the top of her two-storeyed home in Chengdu while it was being demolished. This was not a sudden act, taking everyone unawares. As the woman stood on the roof-top, people gathered outside her building and beseeched her to come down, but she went ahead. The entire incident was telecast three weeks later, after the woman had died, by CCTV  the State-owned television channel  which was given the video by an onlooker who had captured it on his mobile.         
	The video showed the woman standing on her terrace for some time, then pouring a bucket of gasoline on herself. People were shouting themselves hoarse below. After 10 minutes, huge flames rose up from the spot; the womans form could be seen through them. Water hoses started dousing her, but not before shed collapsed. It was a shocking scene.        
	A few days later, the police arrested two groups of people in another city, Guiyang. One group comprised goons sent by a builder to demolish a building complex, the other included residents who had resisted the goons. Both these incidents were not only shown on CCTV, but they were also followed by discussions with Wang Xixin, a Peking University law professor. The discussions ended with the professor and the anchor agreeing that a citizens right to life and property must hold sway over the governments and builders right to demolish illegal structures.        
	Self-immolations over demolitions and relocations are not new. In fact, after the Chengdu self-immolation, the State-owned news agency, Xinhua, listed a few of these incidents that have taken place since 2003. The run-up to the Olympics witnessed tons of demolitions in Beijing; but across the country, as part of development, villagers and urban residents of old structures are continuously being dislocated. As in India, they have not been made part of the development process. Ironically, it was only in 2007 that the country adopted a property rights law. Last year, a Shanghai home-owner waved a copy of this law as she threw burning missiles from her rooftop at a demolition crew.                
	Terror tactic        
	As in India, citizens are helpless when it comes to demolitions, be they by the government or builders. So they resort to violence to defend their homes. Builders often send goons to evict unwilling residents. These goons switch off electricity and water connections, and physically drag out the residents. In the Guiyang incident, they even packed off the residents into waiting vans and left them in some far-off place. The younger ones, however, stayed back to confront the goons with knives. When the latter fled, the residents blocked the road.        
	In the Chengdu self-immolation incident, the house owners had paid almost 50,000 yuan in 1996 as crop compensation and rent to the authorities to acquire the plot of land. However, they never did get the necessary papers to make their house legal. In 2007, the authorities decided that the house had to be demolished to make way for a waste water works project. But the excuse they gave for demolishing it was that it was illegal. Earlier this year, a demolition attempt was resisted by the owners, violently. Even before her extreme step, for full three hours, the woman had thrown bricks and gasoline bombs on the team.        
	In the CCTV discussion, the authorities were attacked for calling her death an accident, and for not stopping the demolition to negotiate with her. The demolition could have been postponed, what mattered most was a human life. Why didnt the fire brigade douse her with water after she poured gasoline on herself? Wouldnt they have done so under normal circumstances? Why did the authorities wake up to the houses illegal status after so many years? All this on State-owned TV. Obama and the US media, are you listening?

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | govern or go
                                                                                                                 GOVERN OR GO                                                    
	Niccol Machiavelli, the master of the art of statecraft, wrote in the 16th century that a prince ought to be both feared and loved, but it is much safer to be feared than loved. The dilemma of the Left Front government in West Bengal is that it is neither feared nor loved. This peculiar position of the government is in the governments inability to act on any issue of consequence. The government of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is seized by a catatonic fit, and the stupor has affected all areas of administration. It is not just that faced with insurgency in Lalgarh, the government is incapable of behaving like a government. But the phenomenon of inactivity combined with incompetence has been writ large in other spheres  from Nandigram to Singur to Gorkhaland to bringing relief to thousands affected by the cyclone. The machinery of the State has become invisible. Mr Bhattacharjee wants to remain in power but he does not want to bear the consequences and the responsibilities of wielding power.        
	Governance, Mr Bhattacharjee should know, is not always a pleasant business. Decisions that are harsh have to be taken because no government can allow a few to hold the rest of society at ransom. Mr Bhattacharjee perpetually shies away from such decisions because he lacks courage. A political leader and a head of a government cannot be a saint; he cannot even pretend to be a saint. He has to be feared and rather enjoy the awe that springs from fear. Mr Bhattacharjee inspires neither fear nor awe. At the moment, his inactivity only calls forth ridicule. He has reduced the law and order situation in West Bengal to a farce. Insurgency in Lalgarh and vendetta in Khejuri  to take two recent and burning issues  are only two examples of the collapse. The collapse itself is derived from the relentless effort of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) to eradicate the critical distinction between partisan politics and governance, and between party and the administration. Alimuddin Street, and not the chambers of Writers Building, has run the administration in West Bengal. The consequences of this are now laid bare to the disgrace of the state administration and the chief minister of the state.        
	The police, at the time of writing, are moving towards Lalgarh. But their progress is slow because the forces are hampered by orders that do not permit them to take precipitate action. Insurgency cannot be quelled with hands that are covered in kid gloves, and the urge to be popular. The fear of being feared is stopping the government from taking the action demanded by the prevailing situation. Mr Bhattacharjees government is not feared; it has also failed to avoid hatred. Since it will not govern and cannot govern, it should now exit. It will only be pursued by ridicule.

	The term cabinet as it is used in politics is derived, according to the Concise Oxford English Dictionary, from the sense of a small private room. The notion of size is of some relevance to any discussion on cabinet formation. This is especially true in India where cabinets are often large, and impossible to accommodate in a small private room. The idea that a cabinet should meet in camera is often an absurdity in Indian politics. Manmohan Singhs cabinet has 33 cabinet ministers. Most of these individuals will be backed by ministers of state who number 38. There will also be seven ministers of state who will have independent charge of the portfolios assigned to them. Mr Singh will thus be at the head of a council of ministers that will have 78 members. Size, it is assumed, will give confidence to the team. But size may not contribute to effectiveness and efficiency. In fact, the large size of the council of ministers may hamper swift and clear decision-making. Mr Singh is too wise a man not to be aware of this. Yet he proceeded to select and set up such a large team  the largest in 10 years.        
	Mr Singh has declared that his new council of minister is a mixture of experience and youthful energy. The Congress president, Sonia Gandhi, seemed to buttress the point when she said that factors like talent have played a crucial role in the selection of ministers. The nation would have been more reassured if it could be said that talent had been the only criterion for choosing ministers. This was obviously not the case. Berths had to be found for allies, even if this meant choosing as ministers certain individuals whose track records are singularly disgraceful. Proportions had to be calculated so that one ally was not favoured over the other. Loyalists had to be rewarded. In spite of all this, portfolios could not be allotted and announced till Thursday evening, the time of writing. Commenting on this inordinate delay, the prime minister said, We wanted to do a thorough exercise. It would take a lot of stretching of the imagination to accept that in a country like India, with its narrow political class that is short of real talent, the process to form a ministry has actually taken over 12 days because of the thoroughness of the exercise. And the process is still not complete because portfolios have not been allocated. India deserves better, and it certainly deserves greater speed and less haggling.

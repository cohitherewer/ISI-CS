The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | More money for stealing
                                                                                                                 MORE MONEY FOR STEALING                          - The budget refuses to look failure of governance in the face        Commentarao   S.L. Rao                                                                          
	India has made some progress in the economy, but much less than other countries in its human development. This is because of a failure of governance at all levels  legislatures, ministers, the entire bureaucracy and regulatory institutions.         
	When Barack Obama unveiled a stimulus package to revive the American economy, he included in it, apart from expenditures to restore the health of the banking system and on rebuilding the infrastructure, spending on health, education and other social indicators of human development. When Pranab Mukherjee does the same in his budget, some like me criticize him. That is not because these expenditures are not necessary in India. It is because of our demonstrated incapability of spending the funds available efficiently and honestly. Drastic changes are needed in the institutional mechanisms of the administrative system for this purpose. To achieve efficiency and minimize waste we need accountability of individuals in the delivery system, strong institutions, decentralization, a speedy penal justice system and severe punishment to thieves. Without them, most of whatever expenditure is incurred will be stolen by politicians, bureaucrats and contractors at all levels, as has happened with every social programme over the years.              
	This is the principal cause of Indias abysmally low ranking on the UNDPs Human Development Index. It is not that our governments do not spend money on sanitation, safe drinking water, nutritious food for the poor, pregnant and lactating women and school-going children, on healthcare centres and hospitals, medical and nursing education, and so on. But contractors do sub-standard work when cleaning drains and ditches, food meant for the poor gets diverted to the market or to the undeserving, government doctors and nurses at government health-centres are often absent, medicines are not available, and medical and nursing education is known to have corrupt practices. Medical institutions, even ayurveda colleges, charge huge capitation fees. Government officials know this, sometimes collude, but do nothing to prevent it.        
	Education is no different. Corrupt practices in recognizing engineering colleges, management and computer institutes are well known. There is an autonomous regulatory body, the All India Council for Technical Education. The minister and his officials are in full control. The AICTE dances to their bidding. Many of these recognized institutions lack adequate or competent faculty, as well as good libraries and computers, among other things. The AICTE continued recognizing such institutions. Thus almost 2,000 management institutes are recognized. So it is with the other disciplines. Students pay heavy capitation fees for admission, mostly under the table, actual fees are very high, the quality of instruction is poor in most, and we have barely qualified managers, engineers and computer professionals. The faade of regulation hides the reality of no inspection, monitoring and punishment for violations. The super regulator proposed by the National Knowledge Commission, and accepted by the government, for higher and professional education should think through how it is to be implemented. A structure to cover the whole country is not easy to envisage, create, find committed staff for, or develop systems to make it effective in improving the quality of education.        
	School education is another dismal story of poor execution in spite of massive funding. Teachers are of poor quality; in many cases, teachers do not attend, or sub-contract their work to others. Even the poor prefer private schools for their children despite the cost because they can be confident of real teaching for their children. The Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan programme of the government is said to have been effective in getting most children into school. The schooling itself is poor. Handing over the governance of schools to local communities with the capacity is not acceptable to politicians and bureaucrats.         
	Drugs controllers exist at national and state levels. They are to ensure that drugs sold are of right quality, made in hygienic conditions, and specified medicines are dispensed by prescription only. Yet, repeated surveys show that over 40 per cent of medicines in India are fake, dangerous to sick people. Indian pharmaceuticals manufacture is open to small scale industry. When many patients died in a Mumbai hospital, using sub-standard intravenous fluids, the Lentin Commission pinpointed responsibility on small-scale manufacturers producing such zero-defect medications in non-sterile conditions. None of the culprits, not the minister nor any of the officials was punished for the murder of these patients. Retailers all over the country sell the most dangerous drugs to people who ask and pay for them. The drugs controllers take no action. A substantial quantity of cheap and substandard kerosene meant for the poor is diverted for the adulteration of diesel, illegally making fuel that is much cheaper for truck owners.         
	For years, the Food Corporation of India procuring foodgrains for the public distribution system is corrupted by officers who pay for higher quality than they actually procure. The handling, storage and distribution result in the loss of a lot of grains. Millions of bogus ration cards enable diversion of cheap grains for sale in markets, depriving many poor of the grains. It is this highly inefficient, wasteful and corrupt system that will execute the 2009 budget commitment to giving 25 kg of grains at Rs 3 per kg to the poor.              
	The national rural employment guarantee scheme is well-conceived, guaranteeing 100 days employment annually at a guaranteed wage. The labour will build rural assets. The government admits what many surveys have shown: rarely do those who come for employment get paid their full entitlement. Many times, there are no assets built; sometimes contractors are paid the money and import labour to do the asset-building, depriving the local of his entitlement. A pilot programme was suddenly rolled out on a much larger scale. Now it is to be much enhanced, with 140 per cent more expenditure. Weak institutions, poor implementation, corruption and leakage are ignored.         
	Independent regulatory commissions for electricity, telecommunications and tariffs for ports have only partially fulfilled expectations. The problem is the lack of commitment by governments. Such reform actions are often only on paper, with little support or preparation to make them effective. State governments, in particular, have little interest in giving up power to independent regulators. Many state regulators are subservient to the desires of their governments and not truly independent to safeguard the interest of all stakeholders. Many have obstructed open access to the transmission system that is required by law. The Central government was influenced for over seven years by its monopoly interstate transmission company not to implement a law that allowed private entry into the sector. The Central government prevented its own law from being implemented!        
	These are only some instances of our democratic system having excellent laws or regulations or procedures or institutions, but not the commitment or will to implement them or penalize violations. In this situation, surely the first priority of the government must be to set this implementation system right, with the procedures, people, penalties and supervision, before throwing more money into the same inefficient programmes. The finance minister does not think so in the 2009 budget.

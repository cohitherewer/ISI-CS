	Is there a kind of convergence taking place between the mass media and book-publishing? That the two have a great deal in common in their editorial and production functions has always been accepted. But there was little similarity in the nature of the work they produced: journalism, especially the print media, was for the present and, therefore, ephemeral; books were meant for the long term, they were something you could go back to time and again.         
	Not any more, if you see the bestseller non-fiction lists. Many authors there are well known media personalities, and the books relate to contemporary issues that make the lead stories of the day. So we have any number of books on Islam, Iraq and Central Asia, Afghanistan and Pakistan, the war on terror, climate change, the global financial crisis and so on. You can bet that there will be a flood of books on the post-poll situation in India. This shift from up-market or more serious literature that had some enduring value to here and now issues is now too marked to be ignored. And because of the medias overwhelming influence, we get books on themes that are all-too-familiar today  entertainment, celebrity gossip of the who comes, who goes kind, and opinion-making as reportage. Why has this happened, and what are its implications for the serious common reader? Or, to put it more bluntly, how do publishers take the call on what to publish today?        
	Whether you like it or not, well-known-ness or the image of the author is a key factor in deciding what to publish. Some years ago, the American historian, Daniel J. Boorstin, made a distinction between well-known-ness for its own sake (the modern celebrity cult) and fame as the product of greatness (old-fashioned heroism). The hero was distinguished by his achievement, the celebrity by his image or trademark, he said. Or, in his oft-quoted remark, the celebrity is a person who is known for his well-known-ness.        
	It is the image that matters now because we always think of the famous in terms of images. In fact, editors are encouraged to think of them in this way because images are that which sell them: scenes on television, photographs in newspapers and magazines, and quotes in the media.        
	Every editor knows that images are disposable. New images are constantly pushing old images aside, not only in the media but also in our minds. But so what, if the book brings in the returns within a month or so  that is what matters, after all. The long-term is now out of the reckoning for most publishers because the shelf-life of unknown authors is not more than 30 days in Britain and America; not much more here either because of the cash crunch and the lack of storage space. Celebrities may be a safer bet.        
	The implications are simple: serious, up-market fiction is not a commodity that sells easily. Or, to put it more gently, only one out of five non-fiction is worth putting your money on. Of course, there are exceptions: many of our new young authors, of both fiction and non-fiction, have been accepted because of the merits of their works.         
	But this doesnt hold for the Big Shots: only one out of fifty may be worth your time and money. In any case, check out whatever the media and blurb-writers tell you. It is the only way we can redress the imbalance between the famous and ourselves.

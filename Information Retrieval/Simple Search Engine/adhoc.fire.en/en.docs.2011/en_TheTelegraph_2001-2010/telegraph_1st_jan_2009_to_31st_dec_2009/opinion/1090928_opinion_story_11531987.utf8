	Let us suppose that Manuel Zelaya, the ousted former president of Honduras, is an intelligent man with a good understanding of how politics works. Then the question is: what is his game? Because he started all this.        
	He was removed from office three months ago in circumstances of doubtful legality. Both the supreme court and the Congress had demanded his removal for repeated violations of the constitution and the law. But the way it was done  woken up by soldiers and hustled out of the country by plane  smelled more like an old-fashioned military coup.        
	A member of Zelayas own Liberal Party, Roberto Micheletti, the speaker of Congress, was sworn in as interim president, and everybody promised that normal democratic service would be fully restored after the elections due on November 29. But every non-Honduran with access to a microphone took up Zelayas cause  from the Organization of American States to the US state department  and he emerged as a full-fledged democratic martyr.        
	The leftwing leaders who have proliferated across Latin America in recent years were particularly supportive of Zelaya. Despite firm denials by Luiz Incio (Lula) da Silva, the Brazilian president, the suspicion lingers that Zelayas sudden re-appearance in the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa, last Monday, did not come as a complete surprise to Brazilians.        
	Now he is holed up there, surrounded by the Honduran army. Its the perfect scene for a media watch that puts enormous pressure on Zelayas opponents to make concessions  or alternatively, the ideal location for a massacre of his supporters by trigger-happy soldiers, in which case, popular opinion shifts to Zelayas side and he returns triumphantly to power.        
	Or at least, that is probably his plan. Am I being too cynical? Okay, lets consider the evidence.                
	Past follies        
	Manuel Zelaya was in the closet before he became president. He secured the nomination of the Liberal Party, a slightly left-of-centre party, which has traditionally alternated in power with the rightwing National Party, and he narrowly won the presidency in the 2006 election. But it was only after he was safely in the presidential mansion that he dropped the mask and started moving Honduras sharply Left.        
	But he did not achieve much in practice for the poor, and failed to build mass support. He was also running out of time, since the Honduran constitution allows presidents one term in office, and his term ended this year. So he did something peculiar: he announced there would be a non-binding referendum on creating a constituent assembly to change the constitution and allow presidents a second term.        
	It was peculiar because he had no legal right to hold such a referendum, nor does the constitution allow a constituent assembly to be elected for such a purpose. Even if the illegality was ignored, there was no chance that it could all happen in time to let him run for a second term in the November election. In any case, his own party would refuse to re-nominate him. So what was his game? Zelayas only chance of holding on to power was to create a crisis that would sweep all those considerations aside. So he pressed ahead with the referendum even after the supreme court declared it illegal.         
	His dramatic return to the country has created semi-siege conditions, and its unlikely that the November polls would go ahead. That already improves his prospects, as it drives the country beyond the usual constitutional procedures. Zelaya has painted himself as the democratically elected victim of a coup, and as such enjoys a lot of foreign support. If his domestic opponents are stupid enough to use force, he could win. And judging by the past, they may be that stupid.

                                                                                                                 NO RETURN ZONE                                                    
	Special economic zones, the brainchild Murasoli Maran bore in 2000 after a visit to China, have always been awkward children. They have been extremely slow to develop; many have been braindead. There has often been a suspicion that their promoters set them up to buy up large tracts of land with a speculative purpose. There have been endless discussions between promoters and the commerce ministry about liberalizing one or other restriction or giving one more concession. The finance ministry has been concerned that the cost of exports generated by SEZs in terms of taxes forgone is high. Even when it has lost an argument with the commerce ministry on this issue, its daughter departments, which collect direct and indirect taxes, have issued a host of irritating circulars to harass units in SEZs.         
	The ministry of commerce has collected statistics for SEZs as on March 31, 2008; on that date, all the SEZs together had generated a total employment of 349,203 persons  hardly an impressive number, considering the administrative effort that has gone into SEZs. In 2007-08, exports worth Rs 66,638 crore were made from SEZs. The commerce ministry proudly announced that they had increased by 92 per cent, but it wisely omitted to mention their share in total exports, which were Rs 637,190 crore. The share of SEZs in commodity exports thus works out to be 10 per cent  again, hardly a figure to boast of seven years after the policy was instituted. From the countrys viewpoint, it makes no difference whether foreign exchange is earned from visible or invisible exports. If services are added, total exports in 2007-08 come to Rs 928,929 crore, and the contribution of SEZs falls to seven per cent.        
	Unfortunately, after the government has given the generous incentives and created expectations that the privileges will last forever, it is virtually impossible to withdraw them. Many of those who have taken permission to start SEZs are businessmen with deep pockets; if they are hurt, they can involve the government in litigation that could last for decades. Meanwhile, courts will give them injunctions which will prevent the government from withdrawing the concessions. So it is quite beyond the governments power to reverse the SEZ policy. What it can do, however, is make SEZs less profitable and less necessary. The balance of payments is deteriorating fast, and will get worse as the world slump progresses. As it worsens, the government will be forced to devalue the rupee. As it does so, it should reduce and ultimately abolish import duties; that would take away one major attraction of SEZs. The other is the tax holiday. It should be given to all investment, anywhere in India. The government has long been intent on guiding investment in various desirable directions. It has been consistently ineffective in doing so; it is time it recognized its failure.

                                                                                                                 CAUGHT IN THE WEB                                   CHINA DIARY - Neha Sahay                                    
	It rsquo;s a story straight from hell. Fifteen-year-old Deng Senshan was beaten to death in an internet de-addiction centre in Nanning, a provincial capital, within 14 hours of his parents leaving him there. They paid the centre 7,000 yuan (Rs 50,000), and received a signed assurance that while the centre would mete out punishment, it would not harm the child rsquo;s health.  
	This happened early last month. Last week, the editor of the local tabloid that investigated the incident was sacked.  
	The first internet de-addiction centre opened in Beijing as far back as 2005. Now, internet de-addiction is big business. The Nanning centre has branches across provinces and advertises on TV. Its rates are 7,000 yuan for the first month, and get progressively higher.        
	With kids at school all day, parents only notice the addiction when grades start falling. To parents obsessed with grades, these centres promise a way out of a hopeless situation; they discipline the child in a way the parents cannot. One centre in Beijing is run by the army; treatment includes exercise, counselling (to parents too) and medication. Electric shocks were banned last month. Psychiatrists warn that unless the loneliness thats at the root of such addiction is tackled, these centres will do more harm than good.        
	Parents always have to trick their kids into accompanying them to these centres. Inside, its a virtual prison. Under 24-hour supervision, the students arent allowed contact with family or friends. When reporters visited another branch of the Nanning centre, the inmates, prevented from talking to them, held up signs saying SOS and beating. From grilled windows, they threw little chits which unfortunately didnt reach the reporters.                
	Routine affair        
	Details of the treatment meted out to young Senshan read like scenes from a medieval orphanage. The irony was that the boy wasnt much of an addict; he had insisted on being bought a computer, but he only spent weekends on it, his devastated father said later. Although his grades had fallen, he remained a good swimmer; in fact, he was taken out on the pretext of going for a swim. En route to the centre, he even saved a woman from drowning in a river. He was that fit when his parents last saw him. They didnt even get to say goodbye to him; he was whisked away as soon as they arrived.        
	When they saw their only child the next day, he was a bloody and bruised corpse. Eye-witnesses said they had heard him groaning soon after he was taken inside. Soon, a student went in with a mop, saying, his head is bleeding; the blood has to be wiped off the floor. Senshan came out later, his clothes bloody, but seemed okay and participated in another inmates birthday celebration. But at night, he was told to run 100 laps. He couldnt run more than 30; but every time he stopped, he was beaten, with the leg of a chair, then with the chair itself, till it broke. Finally, students were asked to wash him with cold water. He was by then foaming and delirious, shouting, The bomb is going to go off, and People are being killed.        
	The reporter who interviewed these student eye-witnesses found them unusually stiff, sitting at attention all the time. They revealed that newcomers were made to stand without sleep or food for the first few days; they got only water. Beatings were routine; so was hospitalization.        
	The centre was closed down and 13 persons arrested; but why was the editor sacked? The incident was reported widely; even by the State-run China Daily. It also reported the sacking of the editor  sympathetically. His colleagues told China Daily that local officials felt the coverage of the incident had harmed the provinces image. The centre was run jointly by a government sports department and a public school, with the latter receiving a share of the profits.

	There are a few things more exasperating than trying to find a solution to a problem in which the contending sides have valid and justifiable claims. The crisis facing private schools in West Bengal over the rise in school fees is one of those problems. The crisis has to an extent come in the wake of the West Bengal governments decision to implement the recommendations of the fifth pay commission. This, in practical terms, means a salary hike for teachers and employees in government schools, government-aided schools and private schools. This rise in salaries hits the private schools very badly because they are not dependent on the government for subsidies. They have to meet the rising costs from their own resources. The principle source of income for these schools is the fees they collect from their students. The schools have thus taken the logical step of enhancing their fees, which have risen between 50 to 80 per cent. This very sharp increase in tuition fees has naturally not found approval among most parents who send their sons and daughters to private schools in the hope of providing them with a good education. Some of these parents make considerable sacrifices for this education even without the proposed rise in tuition fees. The new fees will put private schools beyond their reach. The disapproval and the anger of the parents are understandable as is the decision of the schools to raise fees.        
	What else can the schools do to meet the rising salary bill? This is where a modicum of foresight could have helped to avert the crisis. For one thing, pay hikes need not be announced once every four or five years, as is customary under pay commissions. This practice inevitably imposes a very heavy outlay which institutions like private schools, without subsidies, find impossible to cope with. The option of more frequent and therefore incremental revisions is bound to be less burdensome and certainly less controversial. There is another, and deeper, aspect to consider. Private schools in India, save perhaps a school like The Doon School in Dehra Dun, have not seriously pursued the path of building up a corpus through endowments and donations made by alumni. Such a fund helps the development of a school and also serves as a cushion when government decisions increase costs. These suggestions do not solve the present impasse, but they might prevent similar ones from occurring in the future.

	Although the Congress government decontrolled industry in 1991, it was in two minds about what it had done. When it had believed in controls, it was with the faith of a believer; faith is not easy to jettison. It just happened that the intense crisis that had led to the lifting of the controls ended almost immediately, and the lovely boom of the early 1990s unfolded. The coincidence of the two led to a causal connection in uneducated minds; the belief spread that decontrol had caused the boom. But the pathological controllers never left the Congress; their insidious influence continued to work underground.         
	One of their achievements was the Drug (Prices Control) Order of 1995, under which the Centre took the power to take back what it had given. The pharmaceutical industry had been decontrolled, but the prices at which it could sell could still be controlled. Since no firm could survive without remunerative pricing, the government continued to exercise the power of life and death over the industry. It exercised this power sparingly till 1997. But then it fell prey to a craze for regulators, and appointed the National Pharmaceutical Prices Authority. This body of unoccupied bureaucrats was itching to exercise power. So one by one, it started to prescribe the maximum prices of drugs. The list got longer and longer, and the authority grew cheerier and cheerier. Then some intrepid consumers went and complained to it that some pharmaceutical manufacturers were charging more than the controlled price it had prescribed. The NPPA got into the righteous mode and asked the firms to disgorge their immoral gains. They simply ignored its letters. It recently opened its files of outgoing letters, and discovered that it is a rich regulator: that firms owe it Rs 2,000 crore in unpaid fines; a single firm owes it Rs 748 crore. But when it harried firms for so much money, it also thereby raised the profits on contesting its demands. Most of the firms with crores to lose have gone to court, and the crores NPPA dreamt of are mired in cases.        
	The situation is not dissimilar to that of the Securities and Exchange Board of India, which asked the National Securities Depository Limited to disgorge Rs 150 crore because some Rupalben Panchal made multiple applications for shares and the NSDL did not detect them in the millions of applications it sent on. There, too, the NSDL has gone to court, and Sebi can only dream of the money. The height of irony is that V. B. Bhave, who headed the errant NSDL, now heads Sebi. These are just two of many instances to show that the governments experiment of replacing its industrial departments with so-called independent regulators had run its course. It has to think of something else; that could include another phase of decontrol. This should be at the top of the next governments agenda.

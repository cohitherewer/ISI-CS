                                                                                                                 OLD THEME                                                    
	It is exciting to be new. But a government that prides itself on having given an ancient country a mint-new start needs to be sure about the modes of newness it wishes to follow. When the Maoist prime minister of Nepal, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, first sacks and then, forced by popular outrage, reinstates the Indian priests in Kathmandus Pashupatinath Temple, it raises questions about the Maoist conception of newness. Mr Dahals interventions came, professedly, on the basis of an old law, that the king of Nepal had a say in the appointment of priests in the temple. But the king of Nepal headed a Hindu kingdom, and the revolutionary impact of Mr Dahal and his government has been to turn Nepal into a secular republic, where the State does not intervene in matters of religion. Ignoring this anomaly, Mr Dahal sacked the priests from south India who traditionally served the deity. In response to protests, he explained this in terms of nationalism  in a new Nepal, Indians should not be heading the worshippers in its most famous temple.        
	Nationalism is an old theme that is ever new, particularly when there is a steady drumming up of feeling against the big neighbour at Nepals doorstep. But the States intervention in matters of traditional faith is bound to take on a different colour when the State is a Maoist one. The story of China and the Dalai Lama is too old for there to be anything new in Mr Dahals sudden interest in how a Hindu temple is run. Nationalism is a canny way to sell an old habit of communist States  the government is officially without a religion, so no one it governs can have a right to their traditional faith and its procedures. Chinas closeness is not just geographical, after all. But the Nepali priests in the temple objected that the priests appointed by Mr Dahal were not only ignorant of the temples conventions, but they were also chosen from his cadre. Besides, it is being said that control over the temple would give the government control over enormous wealth. As is usual in all big places of worship, there is no transparency in the use of funds in the temple. But that could have been solved in other ways. Getting embroiled in a temple controversy to give the new Nepal a new Pashupatinath  as Nepals culture minister claimed  has not enhanced Mr Dahals secular credentials. But they may not be the credentials he is concerned about.

	Shaibal Ghosh was a talented watercolour artist, who will be remembered for his continuing efforts at bestowing on this medium the gravitas of oil colours. Ghosh died an untimely death at the age of 49 in 2000. Gallery K2 is holding an exhibition of his monochromatic sketches and drawings (till October 22) in small format made in the early 1970s, when he was still a student at the Government College of Art amp; Craft.        
	In spite of their modest scale, they are compact studies of life as seen by an idealistic young man, its romance, despair and exuberance expressed in the tight compositions that often show signs of maturity beyond his years.                    
	There are hints of sadness in the picture of the family that had taken shelter under an umbrella along with their dog  a familiar scene in Calcutta that continues to fascinate foreigners. A suicide hanging from a rope holding a flower in his hand (top, right). A lonesome scarecrow stands with its arms outstretched in the middle of a field of flowers. Death casts its shadow in the shape of a vulture. There can be no doubt about Ghoshs skill as an artist but these images are typical of those times and look a little dated.        
	Ghosh was a romantic at heart and this is evident from some of his best works depicting starry skies and a pastoral scene with cows and birds melting like wax, rendered entirely with a hail of feathery penstrokes. But, at times, there are touches of humour  a cat, hungry even after a feast of fish, eyes a parrot in a flutter (top, left)  and the erotic  male and female bodies in close proximity  to relieve the sadness.        
	Ghosh had, later in life, developed a style of his own  his transparent watercolour paintings were known for their density and his images were always splintered like reflections on a shattered mirror  but as a student his personality as an artist was yet to form.                            
	Yoga, like many ancient practices originating in India, has become a lifestyle thing. The Wikipedia entry on yoga may be accompanied by an image of Shiva, but in real life it has more to do with people seeking relief from ailments and the stress of living in a society that expects the world of us. Rabin Roy, a youngish artist, takes a wry look at the exploits of todays yoga aficionados and their idiosyncrasies. In his acrylic on canvas paintings, Roys style is rather formal  they remind one of Egyptian art in the somewhat hieratic poses of the figures (bottom). In his smaller paintings in gouache, however, his style is quirky and idiosyncratic, occasionally reminding one of a childs doodles. So there is a marked contrast between the two.        
	Each canvas has a dominant shade like red, lemon yellow, orange and green, and the figures are painted against them. They are deep in meditation, strike different yoga poses or else are engaged in sundry activities but never forgetting their yogic stance. So men taking a shower do so in the most uncomfortable positions imaginable. In some of the paintings, he uses mirror images in a decorative manner, rather like the illustrations on those poetry sheets which were once distributed among guests at wedding ceremonies. He uses the figures like motifs that he arranges in a manner not unlike that of the late Bhupen Khakhar. In one of the most harmonious compositions, the figures have been reduced to smudges of pigment that almost merge with the backdrop of blue.        
	Roy seems to be at more at home painting the smaller compositions in which a single or more figures wrestle, argue, enjoy their camaraderie, dance in joy or engage in endless chinwagging. He has also painted a series of flowers in the same nave manner. In keeping with the freewheeling style of these paintings, the colours are brighter, sometimes in jarring contrasts. It will be interesting to see if this artist develops a style of his own in future.

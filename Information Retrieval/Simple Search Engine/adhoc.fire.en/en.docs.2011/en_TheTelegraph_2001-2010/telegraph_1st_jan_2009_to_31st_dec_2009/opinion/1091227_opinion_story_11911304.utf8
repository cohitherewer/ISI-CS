                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        AS TIME GOES BY                                                          
	Wisdom is always post facto: Minervas owl, it has been said, flew only after dusk. No one, when the first decade of the 21st century dawned, could have predicted any of the momentous events that have taken place in the last ten years. At the beginning of the decade, the world economy was booming and free marketeers, bankers, investors and stockbrokers were boasting that they had never had it so good. Myopic commentators, smug after the collapse of communism, were confident that history had come to an end. Only prophets of doomsday, confined then to the loony fringe, could have seen the speck of a dark cloud on the horizon. It did not take very long for that cloud to overwhelm the sheltering sky of complacency. An aircraft deliberately flown into the World Trade Center in New York shattered many illusions of the epoch. That has become the signature event of the decade. But even those horrible and unforgettable images, beamed across the world into the drawing rooms of millions of ordinary men and women, could not quite capture the horrors to follow. The first decade of the 21st century is a chronicle of a disaster no one foretold.        
	Bombs fell relentlessly on Afghanistan; the worlds only superpower launched the biggest manhunt in history; and there was an unnecessary war in Iraq. But even these events, terrible as they were, did not quite measure up to what happened when the slowdown and the recession hit the global economy. Of course, the recession did not lead to violence and the loss of human lives, like the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, but it was the biggest blow to the confidence and the complacency that had been on display when the decade had begun. That capitalism and the market could not meet the challenge of equity had been conventional wisdom. What the meltdown revealed was that the system, if let unregulated, could be unscrupulously manipulated by greedy punters. It was this that came as a shock. There was a fall from innocence. Capitalism would never be the same again. In the aftermath, the role of the State came to acquire a renewed importance.        
	If pessimists had not read the tea leaves correctly, neither had the optimists. No one in the latter category could have predicted that towards the end of the decade, in an epoch-making election, the people of the United States of America would send a coloured man as president to the White House. The connected histories of slavery, discrimination and the struggle for racial equality were redeemed in a triumph that even today is difficult to believe. The new president, Barack Obama, by his extraordinary rhetoric and humility, has swelled the ranks of the optimists. The violence is not over, but the recession perhaps is. There is a new current in the air on which Minervas owl is poised to fly and survey how humans make their own history.

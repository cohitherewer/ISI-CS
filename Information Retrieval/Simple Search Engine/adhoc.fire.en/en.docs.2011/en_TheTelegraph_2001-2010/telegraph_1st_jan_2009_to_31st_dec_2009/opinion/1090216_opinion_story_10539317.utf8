	The results of the recently concluded general elections in Israel reflect the current political situation in the Middle East: a complete deadlock. The two main parties, Kadima and Likud, with 28 and 27 seats respectively, have come pitifully short of the magic number (61) needed to form a government on their own. They are trailed by the ultra-nationalist Yisrael Beiteinu with 15 seats, and by the Labour Party, managing a shockingly low 13. The obvious mandate is for a coalition, although the negotiations among the stakeholders may take some time to get over. Kadimas Tzipi Livni has claimed moral authority to form the government having come first, even though by a ridiculously narrow margin. Benjamin Netanyahu of Likud has a better excuse to stake claim: the results show a clear right-wing majority. This, of course, is hardly a plausible ground to corner his rival. Although Kadima is ostensibly a centre-left party, it has a chameleonic capacity to change colours at will. It is not without reason that Ehud Olmert, the outgoing prime minister from Kadima, has been called a post-ideological leader.        
	The only meaningful conclusion that one can draw from the nationalist bias is the majoritys denial of the land-for-peace deal with Palestine and Syria. After he offered to resign his office last August, Mr Olmert made the historic declaration that he was willing to return the Golan Heights to Syria and all the territories Israel had occupied in Palestine since 1967. His suggestion seems to have gone down badly with the people. It appears that Israelis, contrary to Western expectations, are not making a seamless transition to the two-state solution. Like so many Western fantasies of tidying up the mess in the decolonized world, this solution sounds like wishful thinking. For the crisis to be resolved, the West needs to first distance itself from the Middle East. But given the Wests abiding stake in oil, and its attitude to the Islamic world, this is unlikely to happen soon.

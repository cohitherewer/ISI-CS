The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Behind the invisible screen
                                                                                                                 BEHIND THE INVISIBLE SCREEN                                  A year after the revelations in Pavlov Hospital, Uddalak Mukherjee visits Lumbini Park Mental Hospital                                             
	Tears welled up in Bindis eyes. (All names have been changed.) Then they spilled over, rolling down in two straight lines on her cheeks. Someone asked her if anything was wrong, but she chose not to answer. It was Mithai who spoke up for her. Or bari hariye gache. Tai kandche (Her home is lost. So shes crying), said Mithai, with a nervous giggle. Mithai, dark, cherubic, with cropped hair, then burst into raucous laughter, even as Bindi continued to sniff. But the eyes of the two women bore a vacant look, as if they could not quite comprehend the reasons for their mirth or misery. Their eyes gave away the truth: something was not quite right about Bindis and Mithais world.         
	Bindi and Mithai are two mentally ill women at the Lumbini Park Mental Hospital in Calcutta. Bindi lived in Benaras before she was brought to Calcutta. Mithai insists she never had a home. There are 56 male and 41 female patients in the 200-bed hospital, which lacks adequate space. Two women friends from an NGO that works with the mentally ill had facilitated my visit to the hospital under a borrowed identity, and I sat with them chatting with Badalda, one of the two ward masters at Lumbini, in a room full of rickety furniture. One of the walls, with its paint peeling off, was partially covered with a chart. Painted on it were ten useful tips to keep the mind healthy. I could also see a medicine cabinet, as well as a sooty water container. Badalda made it quite evident that space was not the only problem in Lumbini.               
	The two separate wards for male and female patients had only four toilets each. The service provided by the dryer and cleaner contracted to clean the patients clothes was quite unremarkable. Inexplicably, the hospital administration had not appointed a washerman, which would have certainly been a cheaper option. Three meals are served daily: the selfsame breakfast of milk, banana and a slice of bread, and a lunch and a dinner of rice, dal and vegetables. Fish, chicken and eggs are available, but not on a daily basis. In accordance with the government guidelines, each patient is provided with 95 grams of rice, lower than the earlier amount of approximately 315 grams. There are large gaps between meals. Breakfast is at 7 am, lunch at 12.30 in the afternoon and an early dinner at 7 pm, and patients often spend the night hungry. The hospital also lacks a general physician, and its library lacks books. The absence of open space means that recreational activities are severely limited. However, medicines are available, as are nurses and doctors, and the hospital has stopped electroconvulsive therapy.         
	Even as we listened to the ward master pointing out the problems in infrastructure, Mithai broke into our conversation with her smattering of English. We all mad, you mad? she asked, as her searching gaze settled on me. For a moment, her questions floated in the room that had gone suddenly quiet. I wondered what Mithai was trying to say. Could it be that, in her own muddled way, she was wondering who decides what is and is not madness? Indias lunacy law isnt much of a help in this respect. Activists working in the mental health sector have often argued that the definition of insanity in the Mental Health Act of 1987, which repealed the earlier Indian Lunacy Act, needs to be amended. Significantly, although mental retardation and dementia do not come under the laws purview, families of those suffering from retardation or dementia often get them admitted to asylums citing insanity. At Lumbini, I met Kunal Banerjee, a middle-aged man with an exceptional memory. I was told that he does not forget even a 10-digit phone number. But he also suffers from bouts of delusion, imagining himself the director of a film that he can never finish. Although Banerjee has no other problems, he has by now spent a good part of his life inside the hospital. He passes his days fiddling with his prayer beads by a window, waiting for a phone call from home that never comes.        
	The act also provides for the voluntary admission of patients, ignoring the fact that the clause, by which the patient gives his consent, is often exploited by greedy relatives to dispose of the mentally ill and claim their entitlements. A fragile mind can always be manipulated into giving consent. Most disturbingly, the phrasing of the act reflects certain inherent prejudices. It talks of custodial ownership of patients, which suggests an institutional willingness to disempower the ill. Insanity, even when proven on the most dubious grounds, takes away a persons rights as well as the opportunities of self-determination, such as employment and marriage. Judicial intervention in the admission and discharge of patients, which does not apply in cases of other forms of illness, also gives to mental illness a criminal flavour.         
	A shrill bell rang somewhere, announcing the lunch hour. Bindi and Mithai rushed out after asking me whether I was hungry. Later, as they ate, I stole a glance. Women of all ages (I was visiting the womens ward) sat in a neat file and ate quietly on dining tables that had been purchased from the funds provided by the government to the hospitals patient welfare committee. Some of the nurses, however, had demanded that the money be spent on buying cages for their own protection. After lunch, the women, happy and somewhat sleepy, washed their hands and trooped to their classes to learn pottery.         
	As I watched them go about their lives, I wondered about my privilege. I was watching people who were victims of a collective amnesia generated by our desire to efface them from our consciousness. This erasure is made easier by the way asylums are structured physically, and by the laws on which they are run. (Had it not been for my friends in the NGO, I would have found it impossible to gain access to Lumbini.) A report by the National Human Rights Commission in 1999, based on the findings of nearly 37 government facilities, stated that around 37.8 per cent of Indias mental institutions were modelled on a jail-like structure. Earlier, as I had waited outside a small gate to enter Lumbini, the hospital looked like a prison camp, behind which patients disappeared, perhaps forever. A small door opened with a creaking noise, and I was transported into the twilight world that lay behind.              
	Understandably, most patients find this invisibility disturbing. During my visit, Bindi had secretly fished out a notebook and begged me to call one of the illegible numbers scribbled on it. Sujata had asked me if I knew why no one had come to visit her from Alipurduar. Her friend, a nameless old woman, had peered at me closely, and then sighed that I was not from her family. Some families find it impossible to visit the patients and support the costs of treatment. But in a majority of cases, families find it convenient to abandon them because of the stigma surrounding insanity. Efforts to counsel families to accept patients seldom bear fruit. In some cases, patients who have recovered sufficiently to rejoin their families have been abused and sent back. (Bindi was one of them.) The media too sometimes show a preference for the lurid  reporting instances of sexual abuse in asylums  while ignoring the other problems in the mental health sector.        
	Another bell, equally shrill, announced that the classes had come to an end. Bindi and Mithai rushed back, even as I got ready to leave. Bindi looked as if she was ready to cry again. She asked me if I would visit again and help her find her lost home. I lied, hoping that I sounded convincing. As I waited for the jangling door to let me out into my world, I knew that I did not have the courage to tell her that this was her home.

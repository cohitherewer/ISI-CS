	Adaptations of two late Ibsen classics on marital incompatibility raise the issue of directorial imposition upon dramatic texts. On the one hand, directors have every right to interpret according to their vision. On the other, it has become fashionable, in the name of artistic freedom but in the service of artistic novelty, to make interventions that go against the grain of the source or the spirit of the author. Ibsen, ironically enough, wrote Hedda Gabler (1890) and When We Dead Awaken (1899) about individual destiny, but the productions under review show their directors wielding excessive individual licence.        
	The showpiece of the Paschimbanga Natya Akademi festival, Chorus Repertory Theatres Ashibagee Eshei, stamped Ratan Thiyams pictorial USP on Ibsens swansong, without the subjective depth that makes When We Dead Awaken so mesmerizing and searingly introspective. Instead of the bitter opening tension between the famous sculptor Rubek and his wife, Thiyams equivalents (including the great R.K. Bhogen) just shout at each other. The loudness alienates us right through.        
	Equally alienating, the predominantly Bengali-theatre viewers  seemingly starved of spectacle  applauded wildly when giant tableaux of lotus plants coasted from one wing to the other. Above them floated, first, fish and then, at the same height, birds. I thought of titling this review When Fish Did Fly. Thiyams giveaway reference to a Manipuri Ibsen play for the global audience suggested that he has not yet grown out of playing to the foreign gallery. Submerged in his pretty designs was Ibsens theme: Rubek, lost in guilt over how he treated the young model who loved him, symbolizing artists exploitation of subjects.        
	Ibsen always sought the truth in human relationships, Hedda Gabler being another exemplar. This is why, though ostensibly realistic, it has lent itself to stark direction, from Meyerholds expressionism to Bergmans minimalism. So Abanti Chakraborty follows in fine footsteps, but in adapting it (strangely, to Shillong, though in Bengali) as Arshis Ranjabati Sen, she should have consulted a complete translation rather than another adaptation, by Jon Baitz. Ibsens genius lies in his characters and subtextual dialogue; by compressing it to the storyline only, Chakraborty shears the heart out of Hedda. She allows Senjuti Mukhopadhyay in the lead (picture) to luxuriate in melodrama, detracting from Heddas tragedy and compromising Ibsens pioneering feminism. Rajib Bardhan as her self-obsessed husband, Tesman, and Sohini Mukherjee as her friend, Thea, who supplants her in his career, support adequately, but the damage is done. Apparently small details also upset credibility in a big way  like the crucial manuscript, for which Chakraborty uses an unbelievably thin file.

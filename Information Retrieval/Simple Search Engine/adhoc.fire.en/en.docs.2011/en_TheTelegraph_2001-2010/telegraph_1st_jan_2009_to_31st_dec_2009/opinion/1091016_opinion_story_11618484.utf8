	Publishers receive unsolicited publication proposals every day, but most are rejected within a week. There are three reasons for this. First, the proposal doesnt fit into the kind of list the publisher is identified with; or he has already published a book on the same subject or is proposing to do so in the future. Second, he is already full up with his forthcoming programme and does not have the time or space to fit in another title. Third, the author isnt sufficiently well known to compete with other books in the same field.         
	But there is a fourth reason that is often overlooked: the proposal hasnt been crafted as something new that would sell which is the indispensable first stage in the publishing process. A publisher wants a proposal that clearly conveys the books central concept and demonstrates how the concept will appeal to its target audience. For many authors, however, summarizing in a few pages a subject that has taken some years of research or personal experience is not easy.         
	Very often, authors get carried away by the richness of their content into over-writing without clarifying the central concepts. Besides, all good authors assume that anyone else will find it equally enthralling. Enthusiasm is fine, but often there is a gap between the authors zeal and the harsh realities of the market. So how does the author shape the proposal to make the publisher call for the manuscript?         
	To begin with, the proposal would be like a CV name, address, phone numbers, qualifications and work experience  before getting on to the heart of the matter, which is the synopsis and market potential of the work. But there is one difference between a CV for a job and an editorial presentation for publication: it must emphasize the candidates computer literacy, which means whether the manuscript would be presented in an electronic format and whether the subsequent editorial suggestions would be incorporated in a revised floppy/CD or transmitted in an electronic file.        
	From a publishers point of view, electronic presentation is important because it helps to cut costs: he does not have to recompose the work, proofread and format it before printing it. Composing costs are cut considerably if most of the pre-publication work can be done on the computer, and all that the publisher is left to do is to tell the printer how many copies have to be printed.        
	The synopsis and the market potential can contain upto a dozen components depending on the nature of the work and what the author thinks would be the size of the market. It isnt easy to identify the main subject of a sprawling content or, for that matter, the market size that is scattered over a wide area. No publisher has been able to work out in any precise detail how this exercise should be done because no worthwhile work contains only a single idea, and the market consists of many parts that do not always jell together.        
	One way out is to provide the publisher with a detailed table of contents with a brief introduction to the subject and the rationale for the work. What is important here is that the entire proposal is spelt out clearly. No publisher has the time to wade through a mountain of unsolicited words. Done properly, you can expect an invitation or at least a rain check for something you might have in the pipeline.

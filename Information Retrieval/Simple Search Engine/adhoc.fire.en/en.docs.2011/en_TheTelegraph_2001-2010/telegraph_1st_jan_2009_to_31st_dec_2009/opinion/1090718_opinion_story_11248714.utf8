The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Not making too much sense
                                                                                                                 NOT MAKING TOO MUCH SENSE                              VISUAL ARTS      Soumitra Das                                                                  
	The title of the exhibition, Trying to make sense of it all, at Ganges Art Gallery (June 25-July 15), was telling enough. It made the reviewers job easier as it more than explained his dilemma, for what can one write about an exhibition in which the four artists  Debraj Goswami, Somit Gupta, Rajiba Lochan Pani and Pampa Panwar  have little in common with one another, either thematically or stylistically? Except for Somit Gupta, all three are relatively well-known artists, but these are certainly not their best works. With their stress on the obvious, they remind viewers anew that works of art are quite unlike doctoral theses  making statements defeats their purpose, if they have any at all. For works of art need not tell all, unlike the metaphorical open book. What the artist wishes to conceal or reveal depends entirely on him. At this exhibition, on the other hand, the viewer, too, would not have found much beyond what he saw before himself.        
	Take the works of Somit Gupta. This artist splashes paint around, one would be tempted to say, in an expressionist manner. But he does little else, and that, one must hasten to add, is of no account. It is not impossible to make out certain human and other shapes in the expanses of paint often splattered liberally with darker shades (detail, top left). Parts of his works are painted in detail. But mostly amorphous and seemingly menacing, these vague and nebulous forms make no impact whatsoever on the viewer. The other three artists are able to project their ideas in a tangible manner and have done so earlier. What they displayed here was a different matter. These were inferior works.        
	Rajiba Lochan Pani has in the past depicted on his canvases images typical of Orissa  exploitation of its natural resources and icons used in information technology sometimes juxtaposed with symbols of traditional ways of life, skills and arts. Thereby, he explored various issues confronting us in a globalized world. But the man drilling a rock with the electrical wire hanging from the machine like an umbilical cord surely demonstrates a lack of imagination (detail, top right). Had it been a poster, one could have accepted such a direct statement, but in a painting one expects a more oblique course. His concern for the degradation of the environment in the villages of Orissa is understandable but one expects a little more than mere illustrations of the disaster caused by man and industry.        
	Debraj Goswami goes in for visual puns, and this time he has gone at them hammer and tongs, quite literally. He uses the symbol of the hammer in his three paintings and there are references to Ren Magritte as well  Magritte sans mystery. One can hardly call these arresting images, however abstruse the thought process behind them may be. The tree with the hammer heads looks quite ludicrous, in fact (bottom, left). But if one aspect of art is image making, the painting of the giant scorpion under the light of a table-lamp surely has an eeriness about it that transcends long-winded explanations and meanings.        
	Longing for the innocence of childhood and nature under attack from development work gave Pampa Panwars work a certain freshness. A long-time resident of Santiniketan, Pampa continues to refer to the unspoilt paradise that this abode of peace once used to be. She uses certain recurrent motifs such as insects and scenes from childhood like boys at play that one associates with innocence and are not difficult to decipher.         
	In this exhibition she goes back to the same imagery but there is a difference in her approach that has marred these two works. She creates a collage of these images that look cluttered and in disarray (detail, bottom right). In the process her paintings lose the freshness that was the hallmark of her earlier works.

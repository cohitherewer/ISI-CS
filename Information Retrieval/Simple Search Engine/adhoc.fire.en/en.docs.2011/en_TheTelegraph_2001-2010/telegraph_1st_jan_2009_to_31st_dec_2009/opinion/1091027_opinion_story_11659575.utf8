                                                                                                                 PASS THE BATON                                  Malvika Singh                              
	Wherever one goes in India, there are wonderful buildings, monuments, estates, and open spaces that tell stories of diverse histories, motivations, aspirations and commitments that have come together, merging seamlessly into a gigantic jigsaw puzzle that never fails to boggle the mind. The forts, palaces and edifices that remind us of the many dynasties that ruled India through the centuries are protected by the Archeological Survey of India and identified with a small blue board that deems them special and stand-alone. Many others, spectacular and historic, some comparatively recent and therefore treated with less importance, that were taken over by the government of India or the governments of the various states in the Union post-Independence, have drastically deteriorated, as a result of shameful and often dangerous, neglect. The primary reason behind this lack of concern for valuable historical real estate is many human and administrative deficiencies.        
	Sadly, one always has to revert to the babu and his constrictive babudom. Aesthetics, a sense of history, a desire to conserve the plurality of an extraordinary national legacy, concern for cleanliness, appropriate management and more, are all non-existent in their work manual. For most, being modern means replacing all the our special inheritances with polyester curtains, formica furniture, plastic plates and other such unhealthy, alien horrors. All this degradation began in 1947 when the colonial power, which had ruled us, retreated.         
	We inherited from them some marvels of architecture, some stunning hill stations, a wonderful fusion cuisine called Anglo-Indian food, a language, some customs and conventions, all of which blended with the diverse cultures here. But along with all that we inherited a bureaucratic machinery, and the ruler versus ruled mindset. Angrez sahibs went back home and a new breed of brown sahibs took the baton, altered nothing, not even the civil and police laws and acts, and continued to administer free India in the same exclusive fashion. Sixty-two years down the road, even after generation changes and cross influences of the world playing a role in transforming the patterns of society, that same breed of arrogant civil servants still rule and run amok.                
	Under fire        
	The worst culprits amongst them, who continue to fight the change are the members of the Central Public Works Department  an arm of the government that has altered some of the best examples of period architecture and reduced them to musty, smelly and broken-down buildings that had once seen much pomp and splendour and good times. Today, in 2009, people have become far more alert and committed to caring, conserving, restoring and protecting their immediate environment as well as the public space.        
	Pressure is beginning to mount on government and on municipalities that are corrupt and do not deliver on their mandate. The babu is under fire. His disconnect with the requirements on the ground is not acceptable any longer. Inexperienced and unable to comprehend the real needs of historic buildings, for instance, these protectors of our heritage just do not fit the bill.        
	If we are to conserve buildings like the Victoria Memorial in Calcutta, and the Viceregal Lodge or Rashtrapati Niwas in Simla, we need to fashion a new set of rules and norms, a radically different parameter of operation with new and clean mechanisms that compel quality work without the interference of a minor babu who wants to make a buck on every renovation. We must teach the young in primary schools to venerate their past and learn from that rich canvas. The government babu must be removed from his dominant role and the responsibility must go to an autonomous mechanism.

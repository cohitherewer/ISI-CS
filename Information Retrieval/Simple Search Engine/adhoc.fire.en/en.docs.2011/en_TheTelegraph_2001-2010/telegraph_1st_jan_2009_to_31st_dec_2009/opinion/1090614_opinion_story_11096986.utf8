	Save the silence                  
	 Sir  If one looks for some solitude in the adjoining areas of ones home, it is probably best to avoid roads or lanes invaded by speeding, noisy two-wheelers. But it may not be possible to escape the encroachment of pedestrians. Almost everyone seems to be vociferously responding to the slogan  Bol India Bol  the new catchphrase of a certain cell phone company. The crowd is talking non-stop on cellphones. Concrete structures have eaten up most of the vacant spaces. So where will one go to find solitude?           
	Yours faithfully,      
N.K. Das Gupta, Calcutta 

      
	End of an era          
	Sir  The demise of Habib Tanvir is a moment of great sorrow for the nation. Tanvir always gave expression to his conscience through his plays and did not fear the forces that tried to curb his freedom. His plays were marked by truth, irony and a social message. Tanvir was loved by his admirers and intensely hated by his opponents. But he did what he felt was right without caring for the social reaction towards works like Ponga Pandit and Jis Lahore Nai Dekhya. With his death, the nation has lost a true artist  a poet, an actor and a director. An era has ended.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The passing away of Habib Ahmed Khan, popularly known as Habib Tanvir, opens up a floodgate of memories. He was a pioneer Hindi playwright, theatre director, poet and actor. His play Charandas Chor got him the prestigious Fringe Firsts Award at the Edinburgh International Drama Festival in 1982. The highlight of this play was the nacha  in Chhattisgarhi language  a chorus that presents commentary through songs. Tanvir also acted in about nine feature films, including Richard Attenboroughs masterpiece Gandhi.           
	His greatest contribution to Indian theatre is that he gave the folk performer a belief in his art, and drew the nations attention to traditional resources in the performing arts. The death of Tanvir has created a great void in Indian theatre that will be difficult to fill.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
S. Balakrishnan, Jamshedpur

                
	Sir  With the passing away of Habib Tanvir, Indian theatre has lost one of its greatest stalwarts who could cull the classic out of the mundane, turn a street into a universal space of expression and graft urban thoughts on to a tribal mindscape. His art was full of activism, blending theatre with folk art and poetry in his famous works, such as, Agra Bazar, Charandas Chor, Jis Lahore Nai Dekhya and Ponga Pandit.           
	He was an eminent playwright and left a permanent mark on the minds of his audience. He inspired many artists by picking out raw talents from among the marginalized and honing them into artists of international calibre. He enriched the world of theatre with various folk styles, especially the nacha style of Chhattisgarh. His plays bear ample evidence of his conviction that a play addresses society and therefore it is the duty of the playwright and the director to produce plays with a social message. His unmatched legacy will always inspire Indian theatre.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  Most people have unused spectacles lying around the house. Shopping malls, schools and clubs may keep a box for donating these to the needy, labelled with numbers to denote the plus and minus powers. Charity begins at home, and this is a practical and easy way to help underpriviledged people in the society.          
	Yours faithfully,

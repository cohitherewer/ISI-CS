	Look within                  
	Sir  Supriya Chaudhuris, New lamps for old (Oct 27), and Sukanta Chaudhuris, From enclave to empire(Nov 5), published in The Telegraph, are, taken together, an eye-opener to the foreboding of a new disaster in Indian higher education if the government of India carries out its plans to establish a number of innovation universities unencumbered by the history or culture of the past. One wonders if any of the world universities which have continued to excel for hundreds of years have ever felt the need to detach themselves from the history or culture of their past[s]: Oxford, Cambridge, London, Heidelberg, Tbingen, Paris-Sorbonne, Sapienza-Rome, Harvard, Yale, Princeton to name a few?           
	There are also other reasons for concern about the so-called new lamps. We know from past experience that Indians as a people (and as a government) have a particular knack for neglecting the existing institutions each time new ones come up. Lately, however, there has been some change for the good in this regard. As the articles point out, a few existing universities have been upgraded with more research grants and better library and documentation resources for the research-oriented departments. The University Grants Commission provides for special assistance programmes and advanced centres within the university system towards this purpose.          
	These changes speak well of the policies for higher education in the recent decades. But the latest concept of innovation universities floated by the new minister of human resource development does not seem to reflect any such concern for the collective good of Indian higher education. Universities cannot be about innovation only, they also have to build foundations of knowledge before they can venture into meaningful innovation in ideas and research. Moreover, the ministers almost singular premise of carrying out this project by drawing mainly on the talent pool of non-resident Indian academics from the West seems far-fetched at the least. There will always be a small number of idealists who will find the enthusiasm to make the switch. But it is doubtful that even their idealism will last long, especially among people in their mid- careers whose lives have been set in a very different working environment. Can we afford to create more problems in a country where even the Right to Education Act has been delayed by sixty years?          
	Leaving alone such realities which the new minister may have slurred over in the temptation for innovation, it is positively sad to think that such unjustifiable ideas can be promoted by a responsible governmental body in a sphere like higher education, where there is universal recognition and urgency to work for the benefit of society and a larger humanity. Promoting excellence is welcome but those doing so must have a clearer picture in their minds about the countrys needs for higher education at multiple levels, with a view to the future.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Poor track record          
	Sir  The editorial, Another track (Nov 16), points out ways in which the Indian Railways can improve its services and ensure the safety of passengers. The Indian Railways, no doubt, occupies a special place in the transport system of the country, and is oriented towards serving the people. However, in spite of the progress made by the Indian Railways, there are certain loopholes in the system which need to be plugged early, especially those relating to passenger safety.           
	Currently, accidents are taking place in quick succession causing loss of lives. Mishaps, occurring so frequently, are likely to make passengers panicky. The editorial is right in saying that the situation cannot improve until the railway minister spends less time wooing voters in her home state, and pays closer attention to what is ailing her own ministry. It is indeed true that these days the railways minister, Mamata Banerjee, along with her council of ministers, is found rather too often addressing potential voters in rallies and meetings. This is bound to affect her work as minister.          
	A wave of change is in the air in West Bengal. The people are determined to bring about a change for the all-round prosperity of the state, which has been lagging behind other, developed states of India. In view of this need, it is useless to hold frequent rallies that throw peoples lives out of gear. This only causes resentment among the people. People want development, not uncalled for rallies and meetings. It is expected that Banerjee will devote more of her time to toning up the ailing railway network, which is a lifeline for the country. One would like to see her turn Indian Railways into a world-class system.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Jayant Mukherjee, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The editorial, Another track, rightly says that while  tragedies are mostly caused by technical incompetence, it is impossible to deny that the Indian Railways has not moved with the times when it comes to passenger safety. The frequent accidents are an indication that all is not well with the functioning of the Indian Railways. But blaming the lower-level staff only will be of no avail. Also, the railways is reported to be earning a huge profit. Why not spend a part of the profit on passenger safety?                    
	Yours faithfully,       
N.R. Ramachandran, Ooty

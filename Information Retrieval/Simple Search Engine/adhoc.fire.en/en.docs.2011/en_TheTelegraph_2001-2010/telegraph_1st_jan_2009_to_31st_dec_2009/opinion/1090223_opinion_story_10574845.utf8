                                                                                                                 FIRED UP                                                    
	An unbecoming showdown between the judiciary and the executive has been precipitated by the violence in the Madras High Court premises. The court witnessed ugly scenes between the police and lawyers last Thursday, when the former entered the court to arrest advocates allegedly responsible for assaulting Subramanian Swamy, the Janata Dal leader. Matters took a worse turn eventually. Pitched battles were fought between lawyers and the police, which left several badly injured and court property severely damaged. As the violence escalated and spread to the other courts, the state government had to resort to tough measures, including a shoot-at-sight-order, to break the impasse. An inquiry by the Central Bureau of Investigation has been instituted and the chief justice of India has appealed to lawyers to get back to work for the sake of the innumerable litigants who are suffering. The CJI, K.G. Balakrishnan, could not have been more explicit. Courts in the state have functioned for a handful of days over the past two months as lawyers have gone on strike under one pretext or the other, the most persistent being the judicial communitys support for the Sri Lankan Tamil cause. This seems to have led to the attack on Mr Swamy.         
	The judiciary, quite naturally, has taken serious note of the Madras High Court violence. But the legal fraternity itself seems to have escaped most of the censure. The barrage of legal proceedings that the Madras High Court intends to start in response to the incident is directed mostly at the law-enforcing machinery of the state that is seen to have acted wantonly, thereby sparking off the violence. Although one cannot rule out police highhandedness, questions also need to be asked about the reaction of the judicial fraternity to both police action and the issues that have led it on to perpetual strikes. The Supreme Court itself has limited lawyers right to strike to only issues that involve the dignity, integrity and independence of the judiciary. But it is the judiciarys sympathetic view of the overt disregard of this ruling that has encouraged irresponsible behaviour among members of the community. Dismissing the behaviour of Tamil Nadus lawyers as an expression of their greater political sensitivity may be misinterpreted and end up damaging the judiciarys exalted standing. An impartial inquiry into the violence should try to pin responsibility on lawbreakers among members of both the executive and the judiciary equally.

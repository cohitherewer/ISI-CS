	Trouble in the flight path                  
	Sir  I am 12 years old, and I have a complaint to make about Air India Express. On December 26, 2008, my parents, my sister and I were supposed to return to Singapore on IX-932 after a holiday in Calcutta. The flight was originally scheduled to depart from the Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International airport at 9.15 am. However, as my father suspected some delay because of fog, he kept calling the airport authority since 6 am. Until about 7.45 am, he was told by an automated voice that till then, there was no information. However, when he called at 7.50 am, he was informed that the flight had been rescheduled and would leave at 12 noon now. Imagine our frustration then, especially as we had already reached the airport.           
	We were horrified when the electronic display board showed at 10 am that the flight had been further delayed and would depart at 2.30 pm instead. My three-year-old sister was getting tired, hungry and irritable. My parents, deciding that enough was enough, along with some other passengers, called the Air India Express authorities for an explanation. To our irritation, the person they spoke to was not at all sorry for the inconvenience. After much argument, arrangements were made to serve meals to the stranded passengers. I doubt whether this favour would have been extended if the group of irate passengers had not argued.           
	After we had finally checked in and were waiting in the lounge, the flight was again delayed by an hour at 2.30 pm. By that time, we had lost our patience and prayed that it would not be delayed any further. Finally, the flight departed at 4.15 pm. My sister was dehydrated by the time the ordeal ended, and she was not the only victim  other families, especially those with smaller children, were just as badly off.           
	A simple SMS on time would have averted the trouble. The passengers would have started late from home. Worse, nobody came forward to apologize for the inconvenience caused to the passengers. Arent budget airlines supposed to regret inconveniences caused to their fliers? Till now, we have not been informed about the real reason behind the delay. I am stunned at the monumental indifference shown towards the comfort of passengers. Perhaps my amazement is heightened because I am growing up in Singapore, where the first concern of the authorities is public comfort.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Recently, my wife and I had travelled to Auckland, New Zealand, to spend our vacation with our son and daughter-in-law. But our journey turned out to be very unpleasant, and all because we had booked our tickets through Yatra Online Pvt. Ltd. On September 3, 2008, I booked tickets on the Yatra site, www.yatra.com  Jet Airways from Calcutta to Bangkok and a connecting Emirates flight from Bangkok to Auckland. After I had booked my ticket for Rs 49,000, the fare shot up to Rs 68,000. It was only after calling up Yatras office in Gurgaon that I was able to book my wifes ticket at a lower price of Rs 57,000. I had to transfer the funds immediately to Yatras account, and I did. The receipt of the funds, and my wifes ticket, were confirmed by e-mail. Then we applied for a visitors visa to New Zealand and got it in three days. Yatra only sent us the itinerary with confirmed status but did not issue the tickets with the e-ticket number. The itinerary showed that the Emirates flight had one stop at Sydney.           
	Three days before travelling, I got our e-tickets issued from the Jet Airways office in Calcutta. The ticket showed that the flight from Bangkok to Auckland had one stop but did not mention the city. On Oct 25, the day of travel, we reached the airport and approached the Jet Airways check-in counter for boarding passes. We were asked to produce our Australian transit visa and, to our horror, were told that the Australian immigration required this for Indian passport-holders. Jet refused to issue boarding passes to us.           
	Nowhere on Yatras site is it mentioned that the Bangkok-Auckland flight is via Sydney for which an Australian transit visa would be required. Neither did Jet mention this in any of its communications. Are travellers supposed to know this automatically? After Jet refused to board us, I called up Yatra and managed to book us on the Singapore Airline night flight from Calcutta to Singapore and a connecting flight from Singapore to Auckland, but only on paying an additional Rs 30,000. We had to start again at night. From there on, however, the journey was smooth.           
	I wrote to Yatra listing our troubles. I had spoken to their representative thrice and exchanged several mails prior to booking the tickets but the requirement of transit visa was never brought to my notice. To my dismay, Yatra wrote back saying that they were not responsible for any lapses and according to their terms and conditions, the onus of finding out about visa requirements was on the traveller. Further, they would be deducting cancellation charges for the earlier tickets. Instead of the promised three days, it took 22 days to get the refund. For my wifes ticket, the refund amount after deductions was sent in three cheques. But all three were drawn in the name of one Rohit Mohan Asthana. When I complained, I was accused of providing the PAN of Asthana, a man I did not even know. Nor had I provided, or been asked to provide, any PAN. Yatra finally admitted there was some discrepancy at their end, and eventually issued fresh cheques in my name. The refund was credited to my credit card account. But I have no access to the sum unless I spend on the card. I wonder what I did to deserve this harassment.          
	Yours faithfully,

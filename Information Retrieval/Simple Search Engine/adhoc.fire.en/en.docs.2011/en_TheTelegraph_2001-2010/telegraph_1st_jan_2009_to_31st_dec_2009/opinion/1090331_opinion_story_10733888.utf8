	Nineteen of the worlds largest national economies and the European Union constitute what has come to be called the G20. Some idea of their importance in the global economy can be gauged by the fact that they produce almost 90 per cent of the aggregate world output. The G20 finance ministers and central bank governors met recently in England. This was a precursor to the meeting of the heads of government of these countries which is slated to start on April 2.        
	The communiqu issued at the end of the meeting was a rather bland affair, full of promises of good intentions but almost devoid of any hint of concrete steps to be taken by the global economys leaders. The communiqu starts with the very surprising and quite inappropriate statement that we have taken decisive, coordinated and comprehensive action to boost demand. This must surely prompt the public at large to wonder why economists, businessmen and bankers continue to issue warnings that we may still be far away from the worst of the slump! Why have the decisive steps failed to boost world demand?        
	The communiqu promises to take whatever action is necessary until growth is restored. It doles out some hope to developing countries by promising to correct the reversal of international capital flows and to increase the resources of international financial institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund, so that these can step up assistance to the poorer and more vulnerable countries. However, the statement stops short of specifying any quantitative targets either about the size of future coordinated stimulus packages or about the extent of help that the emerging countries can hope to get.              
	Perhaps, the only positive that one can take away from the communiqu is that it contains a quite unequivocal statement that increased regulation of financial institutions is more or less inevitable. In particular, it promises to ensure that all systemically important financial institutions, markets and instruments are subject to an appropriate degree of regulation and oversight, and that hedge funds or their managers are registered and disclose appropriate information to assess the risks they pose. Since most of the G20 countries are staunch supporters of the free market, this is a very candid admission that virtually everyone now recognizes the dangers of an unfettered, unregulated international financial sector.        
	Everyone has become so accustomed to bad news that even a hint or tiny possibility that something good is just around the corner cheers us up. Certainly, stock exchanges around the world perked up after the communiqu was issued. Of course, it also helped that a couple of leading American banks announced improved performances during the course of the last couple of months.         
	The other possibility is that even the fact that the countries could agree to issue a common statement  that the meeting did not break up due to a stream of accusations and counter-accusations  must have come as a pleasant surprise. After all, there was a considerable amount of acrimony amongst the leading member countries, with three separate groups and contentious issues being easily discernible.         
	For instance, the Americans have been lecturing to the rest of the world that all the major countries have to spend much more on stimulus plans. They have been talking of a universal demand agenda. The magic figure of two per cent of gross domestic product has been suggested as the target level for each countrys stimulus programme. Tim Geithner, the American treasury secretary, has suggested that the IMFs coffers should be increased by no less than $500 billion, so that it could help those emerging countries which have been severely affected by the global crisis. This money, he suggests, should be made up of contributions from the rich countries as well as China and India.        
	The Europeans, with the exception of the United Kingdom, form a distinctly separate group. The most influential amongst them  Germany and France  are reluctant to undertake large expenditure programmes. They are yet to suffer from the global meltdown to the same extent, and so their citizens have concerns which are very different from those on the other side of the Atlantic. In particular, they are more apprehensive about the size of the public debt and government deficits since a large deficit may result in inflation and a weaker Euro.        
	The last group of countries consist of the developing countries which are concerned both about the protectionist tendencies that are surfacing in America and the flight of capital from their countries. They would also like vastly greater assistance from the World Bank and the IMF.         
	There has been some recent talk that the worldwide recession is about to bottom out. For instance, Ben Bernanke, the chairman of Americas central bank, has stated in a recent television interview that the recession in America may come to an end this year. Similarly, Chinese leaders have also claimed that benefits from their gigantic stimulus programme are already discernible. These are giant economies and generate a significant share of total world demand. So, any revival in these economies will certainly be a huge help in reversing the downturn.               
	But, the actual data, particularly in the US, do not seem to validate any degree of optimism. US job losses continue to mount, the housing market is in deep slumber, while the financial sector remains in a precarious state. So, one is left with the feeling that the positive public statements of top policymakers are designed to instil confidence in the global economy!        
	Of course, such cheap talk has its uses  no amount of confidence-building exercises can be too much for the current world economy. Unfortunately, all these can be undone by news of just one more bank collapse. What are essential today are hard facts and concrete policy initiatives.         
	There is no getting away from the fact that if the world economy is to recover from the global recession any time soon, the G20 countries have to agree to cooperate. They must implement coordinated policies which are designed to increased aggregate incomes not just in their own countries, but in the world as a whole. The advanced countries need to be able to sell their products in the markets of the emerging countries. But how can the latter buy these products unless their incomes increase? Clearly, narrow beggar-thy-neighbour policies almost certainly postpone recovery in all countries.        
	There is a widespread feeling that most important decisions are taken at meetings of top officials, with the meetings of the heads of government being more of a ceremonial affair. Hopefully, the G20 meeting on April 2 will prove that this feeling is not always true. The world will be hoping that these leaders will announce very concrete steps that they want to carry out in order to reverse the global slowdown.

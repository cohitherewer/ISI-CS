The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Glimmer of despair
                                                                                                                 GLIMMER OF DESPAIR                                  Sumanta Sen                              
	The August 11 tripartite talks to discuss the Darjeeling situation decided that the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council, as also the bill to provide greater autonomy to the hills under the Sixth Schedule, would be given a formal burial. It was only a matter of time before this happened: the DGHC had been non-functional for quite a few years. As for the bill, the state government itself had stopped talking about it even as Writers Buildings insisted that autonomy, and not statehood, would help the hill people. So, on paper, nothing really happened at the talks except for the decision to meet again in December. Expectedly, the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha assured that it would stay quiet till then, a pledge that it has broken routinely in the past.        
	But there is reason for the GJM to feel happy. The Centre has decided that whatever might have happened in the past be forgotten and a new start towards a solution be made. This can always be interpreted in the hills as an indication that New Delhi is not averse to considering the demand for a new state. Earlier, the Centre had not given any such indication; indeed Pranab Mukherjee had even categorically rejected the idea. But now, it looks as if New Delhi is prepared to have a fresh look at the issue. This should cause concern in Calcutta, as also the talks of having an interlocuter. Who will that person be, to what extent will his recommendations, if any, be acceptable? The state has reasons to feel worried.        
	The concern should not only be about what happens ultimately, but more about the present. Today, there is practically no administration in the hills, the DGHC has ceased to function and the writ of Writers Buildings is not allowed to run. The GJM has been able to create a situation in which it is the only relevant force. The longer such a situation continues, the stronger will be its case that people have no faith in others. Such a contention can only be countered politically, but the ruling Marxists never had much of a political presence in the hills. Today, their district headquarters has been shifted to Siliguri. In the past, the late Ratanlal Brahmin was a force to contend with but only among tea-garden labourers. The trade union organization had never developed into a political force, and a ruling party without a political base can never hope to turn things its way through the administration alone.                 
	Bleak, but real        
	The GJM has been able to convince the people that because the DGHC under Subash Ghisingh could not deliver the goods, autonomy is not the answer to the problems. What should have been pointed out was that if the DGHC failed, it was because of the leaders of the hills themselves and Calcutta cannot be blamed for this. The Marxists failed to do so because they are not present in the hills. This being the reality, is it not possible that their arguments against a separate state are not carrying much weight in the home ministry?         
	The only thing that may hold back the ministry is the fear that granting Gorkhaland will open a Pandoras box all over India. Hence, its desire to prolong the talks. Yet, for how long can the present uncertainty continue? There is talk about extending the three-tier panchayat system to the hills, but how relevant will that be when the demand for a separate state has not been given a burial? Also, Darjeeling being a border area and Nepal itself in a state of uncertainty, a quick decision is required urgently. That decision should be guided by the ground reality in the hills. And even if that reality is given precedence over other issues, it should be kept in mind that the GJM has also sought to make common cause with divisive forces in North Bengal, and does not believe in allowing political rivals to function. This does not inspire much confidence in its ability to behave as a democratic force if it were to enjoy State power.

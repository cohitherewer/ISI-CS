                                                                                                                 STOP AND GO                                                    
	To paraphrase Gary Schilling, the American economist, slowdowns are stop-and-go affairs; most have at least one or two really good months before they pick up again. The index of industrial production, an important monthly indicator of economic activity, showed a startling performance for August. It grew 10.4 per cent over the same month last year. Taking both July and August together, the IIP grew by 8.8 per cent, compared to 3.8 per cent in the same period in 2008. In GDP growth terms, the two month improvement translates into about an annualized 9 per cent. It is small wonder, therefore, that the stock markets have responded euphorically, going up by over 2 per cent on Monday. But before popping the champagne, consider three factors.        
	First, the impressive performance is a function of the low base effect: if you are starting from a low base in anything, initial improvements will be huge, but will get harder to achieve in successive months. It takes very little to create huge improvements. The IIP number in August 2008 was about 266.6 and rose to 294.3 in August 2009. However, that number is lower than the above 300 IIP level achieved in March 2009. So rather than looking at this as heralding a big economic recovery, it is more prudent to view it as normalizing from the strong economic contraction that took place over six months from January to June this year. Second, while many sub-indices  manufacturing, mining and electricity and petroleum products in particular  drove the overall stellar performance of the IIP, consumer goods growth decreased from 14.3 per cent to 8.5 per cent for August. The improvements in some of the sub-indices were not similarly reflected in others: productive capacity utilization is still behind. Several sectors continue to report significant excess capacity: most traditional industries, food products, beverages, metal products and equipment and machinery. Capital investment, which usually follows such a jump in the IIP, may not materialize as quickly as many may expect, and it is fresh capital expenditures by companies that will take us back to 9 per cent GDP growth.         
	Third, if the improvements in the IIP imply an increase in overall demand, the prospects for an increase in inflation expectations will be higher. Already, consumer price inflation is shouting distance from double digits, and consensus forecasts suggest that wholesale price inflation is moving up more sharply than envisaged. But credit growth is still rather anaemic: at an estimated 17 per cent compared to the growth target of 20 per cent even though monetary conditions remain easy. While the IIP numbers for September may be satisfactory too, the October numbers will reflect the impact of rather inadequate monsoon rainfall. That glass is still slightly less than half-full.

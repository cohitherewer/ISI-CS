The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A city that loves its own filth
                                                                                                                 A CITY THAT LOVES ITS OWN FILTH                                  Calcuttas indifference to the deadly effects of illegal autorickshaws, inadequate rubbish disposal and neglect of cleaner means of transport remains a mystery                                            
	An autorickshaw ride in Calcutta can be quite a rewarding experience provided you can be all ears, and so forget that you also have a nose that is taking in generous quantities of carbon monoxide and whatnot with each breath during the journey. Seated in an auto a few days back, just when I was getting bored practising the art of shallow breathing, I heard my driver asking the one in the neighbouring auto whether his was a gas-gari. It was obviously a rhetorical question, since the auto being enquired about was a ramshackle two-stroke one, as was the one I was packed into. The other driver smirked, and said, Gari to ar chulli noye je gas e cholbe (The vehicle is not an oven that it will run on gas). And then, pleased with themselves, the two drivers roared off, trailing dark clouds of glory.        
	Secure in the tender care of trade unions and political parties, the autowallahs do not seem to be much perturbed by the court order banning two-stroke autos. During the auto strike on January 3, I questioned a group playing cards in a stationary vehicle about their agenda. They protested vehemently against the injustice they are being subjected to by the sarkar (the government), which is bent on depriving them of their daily bread. And what exactly is the sarkar? I asked. They were taken aback for a moment and then replied confidently, Keno, joj court (judges court)? Incidentally, these drivers ply their autos in the Ballygunge-Judges Court route.         
	Given the level of the auto drivers awareness, it is perhaps not surprising that environmental pollution, which is the issue behind the court ruling, does not bother them at all. I was dismissed peremptorily when I asked Babu Pal (all names changed), who plies his auto between Tollygunge and Behala, about his opinion on the use of adulterated katatel, which is chiefly responsible for causing air pollution. Kishe bhejal nei bolun to? Jol, khabar, kichhu mone korbenna, apni, ami, sob bhejal (Tell me, what is not adulterated? There is foulness in the water, in food, in you and in me), he said with a swagger. For him, the real source of pollution is to be found in the self-serving political leaders, and Calcutta will be cleansed only if they, and not the autos, are dispensed with.        
	Unlike Pal, Ajoy Das has changed his auto over to liquefied petroleum gas. He is yet to master the finer points of driving this more sophisticated version of his vehicle, and keeps halting suddenly in the middle of the road, much to the consternation of the passengers. Besides suffering the taunts of his fellow drivers, who joke that his concern for his green auto is like that of a newly married man for his wife, Das has to live with perpetual apprehension regarding the availability of LPG cylinders, without which he cannot run his auto. Given the limited number of LPG outlets in the city, he is unsure whether he will get a refill of the gas whenever he wants. He thinks that within the existing infrastructure, making thousands of autos run on LPG is nothing but a fanciful scheme. He complains that his wife booked a gas cylinder back in November last year and she is still waiting for it to be delivered. When essential cooking gas is scarce here, how can we auto drivers even hope to have a steady supply of LPG? Das asks.         
	Benoy Dam had started using LPG from August last year. What made you switch over to LPG so promptly  the court order, the state government or the auto union? I enquired. He replied indignantly that he fears no party, no dada, no didi. But he loves his city, and hence the change to prove that he cares. A month after the court order, before Durga Puja, when all the autos of Calcutta started displaying their party flags, either Citu or Trinamul, I attached a jhuljhara (broom) to my auto. It was to show that I am moved by no concern other than my own, and as an autowallah, my only aim is to give my passengers a safe and pollution-free ride, Dam announced proudly.                    ANUSUA MUKHERJEE

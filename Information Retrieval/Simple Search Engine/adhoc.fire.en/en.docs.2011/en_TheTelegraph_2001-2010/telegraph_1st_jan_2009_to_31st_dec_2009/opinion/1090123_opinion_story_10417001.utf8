                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Take it easy                   
	Sir  Ashok Mitras articles make for fascinating reading, and Ministerial visage (Jan 19) was no exception. Indias relationship with Bangladesh is set to take a new turn not only because Bangladesh has a liberal prime minister in Sheikh Hasina Wajed but also because India has a new home minister, P. Chidambaram, who unfortunately, is a bit too eager to prove his mettle. In the process, he has lost sight of the new developments in the subcontinent after the regime change in Bangladesh.           
	Mitra has brought to the fore some stark truths that India can ill afford to ignore. Wajeds tilt towards India is well-known. However, one must also remember that she could do precious little to contain corruption or to keep religious fundamentalists at bay in her previous stint as prime minister. Her predecessor, Begum Khaleda Zia, perceived to be close to the Islamic forces, had repressed secular minded people as well as the Hindus during her time. Wajed has promised to open a new chapter in Bangladeshs bilateral relations with India, despite the existing constraints. Therefore, it would not be pragmatic or prudent on Chidambarams part to keep pressurizing Wajed to remove the irritants that plague mutual ties overnight. For instance, Wajed has promised to dismantle hideouts in Bangladesh that are used by terrorists operating on this side of the border. But mouthing strongly worded messages to start the process cannot be termed as diplomatic on Chidambarams part.           
	As for Wajed, she must be serious about checking infiltration into India. However, Mitra correctly points out that a majority of the visitors sets foot here for the sake of medical treatment or as goodwill ambassadors to strengthen shared cultural bonds. India must also look at Bangladesh as a potential ally to develop the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation as a powerful forum to thwart the hegemonic designs of the developed world for the subcontinent. For this to take place, it is imperative that Chidambaram stops forcing Bangladesh to bow down to Indias demands. It may not be impossible to confront the challenges that face India and Bangladesh even as they prepare themselves to turn over a new leaf. Linguistic and cultural ties are most likely to be the determining factors in this respect.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Ashok Mitra has opposed the home ministrys initiatives to check illegal immigration from Bangladesh with the plea that there exists close cultural relations between the people of the two countries. Mitra seems to have overlooked the fact that border guards are not meant to prevent the movement of teachers, musicians, film-stars, poets and suchlike, but to stop the entry of smugglers and militants into India.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta

      
	Sir  India is in a miserable state, thanks to the corruption and greed among its politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen. The misdeeds of these traitors have helped increase the frequency of terrorist attacks and enabled militants to establish sleeper cells in this country. Under the circumstances, the home minister, P. Chidambaram, must be lauded for taking a tough stance on terror. Be it in tackling cross-border terrorism from Pakistan or illegal migration from Bangladesh, the steps taken by Chidambaram might just help in making India more secure.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Different game          
	Sir  If we were to examine Bengals sport and transport ministers track record, we will see that he has failed to keep many of his tall promises (Sourav has a new admirer, Jan 19). Subhas Chakrabortys proposal of bestowing the honorary D.Litt upon Sourav Ganguly is nothing but a political gimmick. After his controversial comments regarding the conversion of Calcuttas autorickshaws to liquefied petroleum gas, Chakraborty simply wanted to please the voters by praising the former Indian cricket captain.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Subhayu Saha, Khagra, Murshidabad 

                
	Sir  Subhas Chakrabortys appeal to the Calcutta University to confer an honorary degree on Sourav Ganguly for his contribution to cricket was certainly a good gesture on the ministers part. Whether or not the university heeds Chakrabortys request remains to be seen, but there is no doubt about the fact that the former Indian captain deserves the honour.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  I recently visited the State Election Commission office for some work and was shocked by the rudeness of some the officials. On finding no one at the reception, I approached an officer who not only refused to entertain my request but also asked me to leave in an impolite manner. The commission should be thanked for making voter-registration simpler, but its officers surely need to improve their behaviour.           
	Yours faithfully,

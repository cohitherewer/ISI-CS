                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	Favoured faces                  
	Sir  It is surprising that the railways minister, Mamata Banerjee, hired professional singers and presenters for railway programmes and paid them generously with no regard for the Centres austerity drive (For a song? Not Nachiketa, Nov 22). At a time when safety inspection teams are being pruned and procurement of departmental necessities put on hold in the railways, one wonders whether cultural functions are at all necessary. The issue becomes more glaring in the light of a comment by a senior railways official, who said that the norm is to have artists from cultural associations of the various railway divisions for these programmes. Is this Banerjees own way of doling out favours to her faithful followers? She has also made one of her supporters the chairman of the passenger amenities committee. Do these people have the knowledge or experience to be placed on government committees? This committee has recently proposed the introduction of luxury coaches exclusively for foreigners. Such discrimination is disgusting after 62 years of Independence.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Amit Banerjee, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  To what extent can a Union minister spend public money at whim? Mamata Banerjee has decided to pay certain intellectuals from West Bengal hefty salaries and other perks after making them members of the newly-created heritage and cultural committee of the railways. The singer, Nachiketa, has also been paid generously from the railways funds. Are the people of Bengal so nave that they cannot read Banerjees intentions?                    
	Yours faithfully,       
A.K. Das, Calcutta

      
	Sir  A cluster of celebrities from various fields appearing in inauguration ceremonies of the railways has become a common phenomenon in West Bengal. The truth behind such grand displays has been revealed now. The railways, under Mamata Banerjee, is wasting public money by hiring professional singers such as Nachiketa. After this, there is hardly any difference between a railway inauguration programme and a para jalsha.          
	Banerjee has done an excellent job for the development of the Indian Railways, and this has been proved by the immense positive feedback that she has received from the people. Then why is she indulging in such meaningless waste of money when the country is reeling under a financial crisis?                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Subhayu Saha, Khagra, Murshidabad 

                
	Sir  The idea of the railways minister showering favours on a select few in West Bengal rings alarm bells. The railways belong to, and earn revenue from, the entire country. Can Mamata Banerjee reward celebrities who openly support her party with enviable salaries and perks from the railway funds? In behaving this way, Banerjee is treading the same path that her predecessors in the ministry had taken. If this bestowing of special favours goes on, members of parliament will clamour for stints in the railways ministry in order to fritter away national resources for short-term political gain.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Sandhya Sen, Calcutta

                
	Sir  It is unfortunate that on the one hand, Mamata Banerjee is asking the railway authorities to cut down on expenses as part of the austerity drive, and on the other hand, a huge amount of money is being squandered on hiring professional singers for inauguration ceremonies of the railways. A full-page advertisement of the railways with Banerjees photograph is also being published in the print media often. This, too, incurs substantial costs. Banerjee should stop wasting the taxpayers money on non-essential matters.          
	Yours faithfully,       
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

                
	Sour truth          
	Sir  After mounting protests, the ministry of information and broadcasting had issued a showcause notice to Star Plus over objectionable content in its reality show, Sach ka Samna. According to a Right to Information Act response, the ministry is yet to take a decision on Star Pluss reply on this issue. But reports suggest that the show may be revived soon. The government should promptly take a decision on the issue before Star Plus relaunches this high-TRP show.           
	The channel is misusing the polygraph test by using it in a money-minting game show. The test may cause unnecessary embarrassment and sour close relationships. Is there any proof that the information about a participant found in the test are the same as what is revealed to the audience? The questions on sexual behaviour are also highly offensive.          
	Yours faithfully,

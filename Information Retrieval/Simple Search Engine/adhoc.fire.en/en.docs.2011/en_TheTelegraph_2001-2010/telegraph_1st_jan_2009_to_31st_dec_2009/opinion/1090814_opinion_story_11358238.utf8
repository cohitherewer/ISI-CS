                                                                                                                 ACTIVE CALM                                                    
	During an epidemic, panic can be quite as contagious as the disease itself. Apart from being dangerous, panic is useless, having no preventive or therapeutic value. So, given the situation in the country with regard to swine flu, especially in Maharashtra, it becomes all the more important to keep ones head. This is as important for the government, the health sector and the media as for ordinary people. Swine flu has to be managed efficiently and sensibly, and allowing irrational fears to disrupt the normal processes of everyday life is unlikely to make things any safer. But being informed, alert and efficient remains the best way to be careful. First, the health authorities in Calcutta will have to decide swiftly on how to involve the private health sector in its arrangements. This would involve preparing hospitals for properly segregated and equipped wards, as well as the accreditation of private laboratories for carrying out diagnostic tests. Delhi and Bangalore have both taken definite steps in this direction. Second, hoarding medicines and selling spurious drugs have to be prevented, just as the indiscriminate use of the medicines have to be checked. The government must be proactive and vigilant in dealing with, and preparing, medicine companies, private hospitals, laboratories and even the sellers of masks. Cautioning people against large gatherings is alright, but shutting everything down, including discount sales, could verge on the excessive.        
	There is no harm in recalling that about one per cent of those who get the flu die of it, and those who get it and survive it do not suffer significantly more than those who catch the common cold or ordinary flu. It is also important to remember that every year, all over the world, thousands of people die of the ordinary flu  a fact that rightly does not cause panic regarding the flu in ordinary times. Yet, this is also Calcuttas, and Bengals, chance to get certain things in order in the public health sector  with regard to specific institutions like the Infectious Diseases Hospital in Beliaghata, and generally in its way of planning, deciding and keeping itself ready for unmanageable emergencies. Like panic, indecisiveness, sloth and inefficiency are useless and actively dangerous qualities in crisis situations. To learn to act quickly, clearheadedly and responsibly would not be a bad thing for the health department.

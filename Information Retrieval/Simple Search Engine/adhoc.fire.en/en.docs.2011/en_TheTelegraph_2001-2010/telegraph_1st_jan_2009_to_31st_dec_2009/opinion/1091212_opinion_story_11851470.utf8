The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Women beware men
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        WOMEN BEWARE MEN                              Ananda Lal      THEATRE                                                
	About the Odeon Festival, I wrote in 2006, its claims to showcase the best in Indian theatre sound hollow as both imported productions came from Mumbai. 2007 triggered this response: Continuing to labour under that delusion, Odeon again imported Mumbai plays to fill those two slots. For whatever reason, 2008 corrected that favouritism. But this year again, Odeon relapsed into Mumbai mode, bringing both out-of-town shows from there when we could easily name better ones from elsewhere, for instance Chennai. On the positive side, Q Theatre Productions Some Girl(s) (picture) introduced young American playwright Neil LaBute to Calcuttans. LaBute has earned some notoriety for rubbing audiences the wrong way, but Akarsh Khuranas faithful Indian-English adaptation doesnt ruffle any feathers. Instead, it overturns the dominant androcentric nature of romantic drama by presenting its solitary man as a calculating wanker, and his four jilted girlfriends as much more appealing and self-assured. Mukul Chaddas portrayal of the mendacious filmmaker (LaBute, himself a film director, had created him as a short-story writer), especially given the hidden recorder he carries and the revealing conclusion in which he scribbles names of more ex-flames, should warn girls of predators vowing undying love and could even be read as a moral lesson against casual sex.        
	The director, Nadir Khan, does partially stereotype the women into devoted housewife, flighty free bird, unglamorous intellectual and ideal sweetheart (ironically, the last seems to have no other traits), yet we must applaud each actress (Shivani Tanksale, Juhi Pande, Radhika Mittal and Tarana Raja Kapoor respectively) for individuating her own character more naturally than these categories suggest. Unpardonably for theatre, however, the cast wears conspicuous remote headmikes straight out of a call centre, while the set leaves stage right peculiarly unutilized.        
	In contrast, the full-house Apki Soniya proved a drag, like most sequels. Javed Siddiqi had lifted Tumhari Amrita from A.R. Gurneys Love Letters, which gave his Indianization considerable body because of Gurneys deeply-felt epistles. Left to his own devices here, Siddiqi exposes his superficial hand. The correspondence between the dead ladys lover and daughter is pedestrian at best and incredible at worst: no senior dignitary would reply to an unknown females initial unexplained rantings as he does; if at all, in this day and age, their remarkably brief missives would occur over e-mail. In defence of Essay Communications one can argue that it is trying to revive Urdu theatre. At least Farooque Shaikh reacts facially during Sonali Bendres readings, but Salim Arif fails miserably in directing her: when her turns come, she just looks glassily like a plastic doll, redeemed only when her tears stream down at the close.

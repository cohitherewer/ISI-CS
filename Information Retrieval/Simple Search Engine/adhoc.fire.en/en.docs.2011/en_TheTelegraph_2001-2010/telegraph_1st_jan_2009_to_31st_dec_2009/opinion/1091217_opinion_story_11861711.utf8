	Unjust war                  
	Sir  The report, Peace Nobel in Obamas hand, just war on lips (Dec 11), had an apt headline. But the critical analysis of Barack Obamas speech should have been harsher. This years Nobel Peace Prize was not justified in the least. It has tarnished the credibility of future awards in this category. The way in which Obama tried to play up his war efforts as just in the Nobel peace prize ceremony was shocking. This kind of a speech would have been suitable in a military academy. Even more surprising was the fact that many members of the audience actually clapped in appreciation of his speech.          
	There is a possibility that the Nobel committee wanted to discourage Obama from pursuing his war efforts by awarding him the peace prize. But Obama has held on to his war plans, and is justifying them, even after receiving the award. As to Obamas comment about the war being just, even Hitler might have thought the same about his own war. The justification of wars by those involved in them is not acceptable. A neutral body should decide whether or not a war is valid. Till date, none other than those involved in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan has defended them. Both the wars have been fought at the expense of innocent citizens. The military powers on the two warring sides, in both cases, were also unequal. From another point of view, these two wars can be seen as being not only unjust but also oppressive.          
	Obamas speech failed to address the real problems being faced by the world at this time. What came out in the speech is that the world can expect more wars in the future. It seems that the United States of America may wage war against any country that it considers a threat to itself, and that harmless people will suffer from these fights. Obama and the Nobel peace prize committee should realize that the only way to achieve peace is to prepare for peace, not for war.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Afghanistan had, for long, resisted British domination, and later, the Soviet invasion. Then the Americans got involved in Afghanistan; the 9 /11 attack forced them to do so. The editorial, Not quite new (Dec 3), rightly points out that by setting 2011 as the deadline for Americas exit from Afghanistan despite the absence of any indication that the strategy adopted may be successful, Barack Obama seems to be taking a rather ambiguous approach to the issue. The US has to reach focused and concerted decisions regarding Afghanistan. Given the unstable situation in Pakistan, it is in the best interest of India for the US to have a certain amount of control over the volatile neighbourhood. As in Iraq, what is needed is a dedicated army to defeat the Taliban in Afghanistan. To achieve this, the US as well as the rest of the world should take a holistic view of the war in Afghanistan, and Pakistan should actively cooperate in the process of solving the crisis.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
R. Narayanan, Ghaziabad

                
	Higher still          
	Sir  The rise in the prices of vegetables, pulses and other food items and the hike in transport fares as well as in electricity and water charges are the results of faulty economic policies of the government. Most economic policies are designed by the government to contain inflation. It justifies these by citing shortages and high demands. But the government itself is responsible for such shortages.          
	It should have planned on a long-term basis for adequate production and the storage of essential commodities. Hoarders and black marketeers are also responsible for shortages and inflation. A number of intermediaries in the production and distribution chain of essential goods contribute to the price rise. The prices of necessities have gone up so much that an ordinary citizen cannot afford most of them any more.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Mahesh Kumar, New Delhi

                
	Sir  Common people have suffered the most because of the spiralling food prices. There seems to be no respite from this problem in the near future. Remedial measures adopted by both the state and the Central governments have failed to yield positive results.          
	Not only India, but other countries too are under tremendous pressure because of the food shortage and inflation. Production of food is not taking place according to demand. The global recession has added to the crisis. Despite the growth in agriculture, governments throughout the world have failed to provide people with basic necessities due to the lack of proper assessment and planning.                    
	Yours faithfully,

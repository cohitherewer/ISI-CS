But what would humour, sexuality or ritual be without multiple languages?                          Man Ray, Untitled                                  
	Ones thoughts must necessarily have a language that is tangible, organic and perhaps a combination of the languages of the thinker. Since the act of thinking precedes expression, how does one reconcile the languages that form the medium for these two processes? Is one conscious, while thinking, of the language in which one would eventually have to express ones thought? In that case, what about the thoughts one never articulates in any known language. Do they remain inside the psyche in a language that is a curious mix of different known tongues?        
	I have wondered if Arabic forms a part of my mental world, and if so, to what extent. My familiarity with Arabic extends as far as the pictures the script makes on paper and the sounds that those pictures correspond to. This is a result of a fairly rigorous training in learning how to read the Quran, say the namaz by heart, and so on. Being a language with which I am associated only by its sights and sounds, as it were, is it possible that I sometimes even think in the language I dont understand a word of?        
	Perhaps it was never important for me to understand Arabic. It is after all the language in which I would be communicating with god, and it was he who needed to understand what was being told to him  the belief that what one is uttering by looking at the words on a page are necessarily in praise and thanks to the lord for showering his bounty upon the world is unquestioned by devotees. Several years ago, on refusing to read the Quran daily like the rest of my family because I did not follow what I was reading (none of them did either), my mother bought me an English translation of the Quran to revive my interest. It had a parallel Arabic text in the English script. Since I read English faster than it takes me to decipher the Arabic letters, I announced that if I must read the Quran (not reading it wasnt an option) I would do so from this book in English. I think my mother was appalled and a bit offended. That god didnt know English is something I had taken for granted from a very early age, but the fact that god would know if I read to him via the Roman script (something that, my mothers reaction told me, he did not approve of) convinced me of his omniscience.        
	If Gujarati, my mother tongue, is a language of my primal emotions  there are terms such as those for items of food, parts of the body, to urinate, to go to bed, house that I think of primarily in Gujarati  Arabic could very well be a language of my fears. While walking down a deserted road or while feeling there is a ghost in my bathroom, I find myself chanting snatches from the several passages I know in Arabic. I dont know what they mean, but in moments of extreme anxiety, I am assured they are protecting me from evil.        
	Hindi, my second language in school, is one that keeps reminding me of Bollywood, and of the mindless filmy and melodramatic sessions  khush to bohot hoge tum aj, says a friend tilting slightly to one side like Amitabh Bachchan, to which one is expected to come up with an appropriate retort, Shashi Kapoor style.        
	Bengali, however, happens to be a language of necessity  a tongue picked up to understand, and make myself understood to, bus conductors, people at the post office, my college librarian, and so on. It shapes my interaction with the various people I meet, often with hilarious results  from the instance when I scandalized a fruit-seller with my confused usage of the words ami and amake (I had said amake khabo instead of ami khabo), to the times when my landlady frantically gesticulates to me in dumb-charade when she needs to ask me to, say, lock the door, because she is convinced I would not understand what she said. Someone once told me that Bengali is perhaps my first language because of my ability to use Bengali expletives without inhibition. Perhaps Bengali is also the language of my humour.

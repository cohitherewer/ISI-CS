                                                                                                                 DONT INQUIRE                                                    
	Every incident of violence does not require a judicial inquiry. The Karnataka chief minister, B.S. Yeddyurappa, may seem to have done the right thing by turning down demands for investigation of the July 2 riots in Mysore. He mentioned that a police probe was on, and this was sufficient to ensure that no wrongdoer escapes punishment. Mr Yeddyurappas comment could be construed as an indication of his faith in the efficiency of the state police and justice system. But he made another observation only minutes later on the same day in the assembly. He stated that there was an organized conspiracy to tarnish the image of his government. It is obvious that his decision to refuse holding a judicial enquiry into the Mysore riots has been informed by the same belief, which naturally makes it imperative for him to make light of each and every instance of the transgression of law in the state. Earlier this year, he had dismissed the violence committed against women in a Mangalore pub with the same observations. The perpetrators of the crime were arrested and released on bail, and the police continued to hedge on arresting the kingpin, Pramod Muthalik, the leader of the Ram Sena, till the top brass of the Bharatiya Janata Party made known its displeasure over the incident. Despite the show, however, the chief ministers explicit disavowal of pub culture ended up giving the Ram Sena the free licence it had always sought, and encumbered the police with confusing principles of public action. Similarly now, Mr Yeddyurappas summary dismissal of allegations that the Ram Sena or the Bajrang Dal may have instigated the riots in Mysore will, without doubt, come in the way of the police carrying out an impartial investigation into the incident.        
	It goes without saying that the mental universe in Mr Yeddyurappas state is rapidly shrinking, and has been shrinking for a while now. The prolonged and incessant attacks on churches last year, the hounding of young people for befriending members of communities that are different from theirs or for entertaining themselves in the open are as much a reflection of this as the riots in Mysore are. Mr Yeddyurappa and his party may or may not be entirely responsible for this. But as head of the government in his state, Mr Yeddyurappa is expected to give these matters the attention that is their due, instead of being excessively touchy about them.

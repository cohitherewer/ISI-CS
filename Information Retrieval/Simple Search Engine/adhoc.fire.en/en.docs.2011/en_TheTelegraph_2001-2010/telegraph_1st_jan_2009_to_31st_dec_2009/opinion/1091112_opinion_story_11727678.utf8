The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Flurys, old into new
                                                                            Thursday , November 12 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                              FLURYS, OLD INTO NEW                                                                  
	The new Flurys, with its fake-French allure, mind-numbing music and dirty toilets, makes me angry. Flurys used to be a character, but is now just a restaurant. All cities need to have public places that let you be yourself, alone or with people of your choice. Comfort, familiarity and silence, a few trusted things to eat and drink, myopic waiters who know when to disappear and reappear, a general feeling of timelessness, and the right sort of gloom in the midst of bustle: that is all one asks of these places. Flurys had them all. Then came the tarting up, and I remember my shock when told that I couldnt just sit with a cold coffee after six and had to order food.        
	For a while, the old furniture, crockery, waiters and menu shifted across the street to T3. You began to see the Flurys veterans there, looking bereft, slightly lost but still alive, and felt reassured that all had not been tarted out of existence. But, just when watching life through those lovely windows in the middle of the day started becoming a habit, a strange, rotting stench took over the place, the toilet became hellish, and then T3 was shut down. That was the end of the Flurys sort of time. One is now left with nothing but the chain cafs, World Music and the young in one anothers arms. Even if T3 reopens, Im sure it will be yet another new thing, with some sort of pre-fabricated designer ambience and waiters with hair-gel trying to pass cluelessness off as vanity.        
	But isnt this the story of most of Park Street, and of that tedious old clich called Purono Kolkata? It started with Sky Room, of course, and every now and then you hear of it reopening, and wonder what it would reopen as. But think of what has happened to Moulin Rouge, Blue Fox, the Coffee House on Chittaranjan Avenue, or even the Great Eastern Hotel. All of them could have been wonderful challenges to intelligent new money: how to take on a place that has its own character and clientele and turn it into a commercial success without destroying this character and shooing the old clientele away with blasts of bad taste.        
	What is required is a kind of eye, instinct and memory, and the ability to work with old staff and train new ones, and then marry all that to a solid business sense and, of course, some money. So why do the new institutes of management, architecture, hospitality or design, together with all the clever scions of old money who go abroad to be educated and then come back to India to become its movers and shakers, never manage to pull these things off in Calcutta?        
	With Flurys, for instance, it was just a question of taking a sharp long look, thinking hard and then carefully reinforcing what was already so charmingly there  renovating the tangible, while leaving the intangible tastefully and respectfully untouched. It is like restoring an Old Master. But whats happening to Old Masters in Bengal is another sad story  or is it part of the same story?                    AVEEK SEN

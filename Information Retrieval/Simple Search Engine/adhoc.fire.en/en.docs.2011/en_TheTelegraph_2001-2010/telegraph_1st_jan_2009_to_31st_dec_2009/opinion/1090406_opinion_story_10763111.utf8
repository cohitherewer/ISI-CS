                                                                                                                 HEAVY PRICE FOR SUCCESS                                  FIFTH COLUMN - GWYNNE DYER                              
	The French city of Strasbourg and the German town of Kehl, which face each other across the river Rhine, will be in lock-down this weekend as the grandees of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation gather to celebrate the alliances 60th anniversary and protesters home in on the site from all over Europe. Its almost 20 years since the original reason for Natos creation  the Soviet Union  disappeared, but there is still a queue of countries clamouring to join.         
	Yet behind the festivities, there are two major problems that the alliance needs to confront at this summit. First, Afghanistan has been a problem for the alliance from the start, for some members were much keener on the adventure than others. About half the foreign troops in Afghanistan are Europeans and Canadians who operate under Nato command, and have taken almost as many casualties there as the American troops  but their losses have been unequally shared.        
	Only three countries with a total population of under 100 million people  Britain, Canada and Denmark  have suffered almost two-thirds of all of Natos fatal casualties in Afghanistan. France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Poland have all together lost fewer soldiers than Canada alone. Expectedly, this disparity generates some bitterness in the ranks of the alliance.        
	Sooner or later Western troops will leave Afghanistan, having failed to fix a country that is very resistant to foreign meddling. Nothing especially bad will happen elsewhere because of this failure, and the whole episode will quickly be forgotten. The real threat to Natos future lies elsewhere.        
	Since the Cold War ended 20 years ago, every former eastern European satellite of the old Soviet Union has joined Nato, together with the three westernmost republics of the Soviet Union itself (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania). This has caused much distress in Moscow, which thought Nato had promised not to expand into eastern Europe if it freed the satellites. But the promise was never put on paper, and the Russians have taken Natos expansion reasonably well in the circumstances.                
	Way out        
	Now, however, Nato has promised to admit Ukraine and Georgia, two former Soviet republics that lie not west of Russia, but south of it. The old fear of encirclement has revived in Moscow, and the Russians warn that relations will get very frosty indeed if Nato expands into these countries.        
	There is little enthusiasm for this expansion among the older members of Nato in western Europe, and not much in Ukraine either. Nato membership is wildly popular in Georgia, but for the wrong reason: Mikheil Saakashvilis government stupidly tried to seize the breakaway province of South Ossetia last summer, killing Russian peacekeeping troops in the process, and then rapidly losing the war with Russia.        
	There is strong support for Ukrainian and Georgian membership in Washington and among the new Nato members in eastern Europe. Next years Nato summit may well see both countries admitted to membership  but that would ultimately destroy the Nato.        
	The alliance was founded on a guarantee that all members would come to the aid of any member that came under foreign attack. It was a believable guarantee, and therefore a strong deterrent to any attack. Whereas nobody in their right minds believes that Nato would risk fighting a nuclear war with Russia to save Ukraine or Georgia if they should stumble into a military conflict with Moscow.         
	So if Nato lets those countries in, it will become a two-tier alliance, with real guarantees for most members and paper promises for the others. In due course, there will be doubts as to whether all the existing eastern European members are really covered by the alliance guarantee either. If that happens, Nato finally dies.

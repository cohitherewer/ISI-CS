	Civilization and its discontents          
	NATIONALISM (Penguin, Rs 199) by Rabindranath Tagore is a compilation of the lectures delivered by the Nobel Laureate during the devastating years of the First World War. One of these talks was given in Japan, while the other two in the United States of America, keeping specific audiences in mind. But their relevance, especially in these times scarred by racist intolerance and sectarian violence, remains universal. The thrust of Tagores argument, which was not irrefutable, did not please everyone. He was emphatic about the shortcomings of Western ideas of nationalism, which, he believed, were exclusivist, as opposed to their Indian variants, which were more inclusive. The volume comes with an erudite and illuminating introduction by Ramachandra Guha.                        
	The Storytellers Tale (Penguin, Rs 225) by Omair Ahmad is a beautiful novella set in the 1700s. Glorious Delhi is ransacked by the soldiers of Ahmad Shah Abdali. A storyteller, whose house has been destroyed in the pillage, takes to the road yet again with a thousand hurts, and innumerable untold stories in his heart. He lands up in a haveli in the middle of the road, and the Begum of the casbah invites him to tell his stories. Thus ensues an exchange of tales between the two in which they try to outdo, and express their unspoken feelings for, each other. The self-reflexive tale is as much about the art of story telling as about love and freedom. Compared to the enigmatic core of the tale, the ending seems a bit trite.                        
	institutions, consultants and transformation (Response, Rs 295) edited by Lalitha Iyer and Shaibal Guharoy puts together a collection of case studies to highlight a range of issues faced by institutions in transformation in the social development sector. After an introductory section by Iyer that charts the fundamental principles of organizational change and institution building, there are chapters on Ekta, Chaturya, Prakruti, Triveni and Panchim. Each of these ventures began as experiments, then through trials and errors, developed into full-fledged projects. The aim is to look at how and why a certain set of factors worked for these organizations, and whether they could have done things in a different way.                                
	ROGUE AGENT (Penguin, Rs 299) by Nandita Haksar is tellingly subtitled, How Indias Military Intelligence Betrayed the Burmese Resistance. This is a compelling account of how thirty-six Burmese prisoners, held in Port Blairs jail, turned out to be much more than simple political detainees. When Haksar, an eminent human-rights lawyer and activist, took up the case, she misjudged it as an simple instance of illegal detention. It turned out, after Haksars persistent investigations, that these unfortunate Burmese were pawns in a great geopolitical game of intrigue. The operation in the Andaman Islands, in which the Burmese were picked up, was hatched by Indian intelligence agencies to upstage the military junta in Myanmar. Yet, somewhere along the line, this ingenious plan went horribly wrong. In Haksars gripping narrative that chain of mistakes is reconstructed. In this book, not only do the human violations become starkly evident, but the fragile political situation in Indias Northeast, the deadly role of China in the area, and the growing importance of Myanmars gas reserves also become apparent.                        
	The Charlemagne Pursuit (Hodder amp; Stoughton, Rs 295) by Steve Berry is in the tradition now made famous by The Da Vinci Code. In a tiny shift from the mystique of Christ, this novel has at its centre a lost civilization predating Christianity and hinted at in a book found in Charlemagnes tomb. All the ingredients needed to cook up a sumptuous story in this genre are present: an ex-agent trying to solve the mystery of his fathers disappearance, slightly unhinged femmes fatales, the Third Reich, and an American president.

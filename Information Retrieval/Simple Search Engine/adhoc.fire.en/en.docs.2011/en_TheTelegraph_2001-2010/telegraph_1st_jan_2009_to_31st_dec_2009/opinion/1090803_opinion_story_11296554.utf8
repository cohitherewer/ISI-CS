                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Bitter truth                  
	Sir  The Union ministry of information and broadcasting should set up a committee of psychologists along with experts from other disciplines to decide whether the newly started television programme, Sach Ka Saamna, where the participants have to take a lie-detector test, should be allowed to continue (RS scan on reality shows, July 23).           
	Is the use of the polygraph, the lie-detection machine, as a money-minting device for a game show justified? Also, is it fair to expose a persons private life before millions of viewers ? Can failure at the lie-detector test not cause unnecessary embarrassment ? And how reliable are the tests results? These and other questions need to be examined closely by the committee before allowing this programme to be aired on TV.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Madhu Agrawal,

	Sir  Given the controversy that the reality show, Sach Ka Saamna, has created across the nation, the call by some members of parliament to censor the show is understandable. A dispassionate look at the programmes content would reveal that it is quite natural to react to it with revulsion. A regulatory body should be set up by the ministry of information and broadcasting to monitor the contents of television programmes.           
	This is not a question of the information and broadcasting ministry playing the Big Brother, but of honouring the sentiments of people, most of whom would find such exhibitions of vulgarity unacceptable. Although the experience that one has to go through in this show is disturbing and could even be shattering, the programme is being justified in the name of the participants willingness to undergo the ordeal. Such defences, as well as the fact that the winner of the show gets a prize, serve to obscure the role played by the producers of such shows in spreading greed among people. The mechanism of the television research partnership ratings and our dedication to American culture play a major role in the promotion of such shows.          
	If freedom of speech and action is to be equated with licence, then why not broadcast pornography on television? In the same vein, one could argue against the need to have any regulatory body at all, citing the mature moral sense of most Indians .          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  A lot of fuss is being created over the game show, Sach Ka Saamna. If the contestants themselves do not have a problem with revealing facts about their private lives, why should certain social organizations want this show to be pulled off the air?           
	The contestants who take part in the show are well aware that they have to sit through a lie-detector test and answer some questions. They are not under any obligation. So we too, as viewers, should sit back and enjoy such a unique show.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Rupa R., Jamshedpur 

                
	Sir  There has been a debate in some news channels over reality shows that expose the details of the participants private lives. There is no doubt that these shows are being telecast to increase the TRP ratings, but that is a known fact. It is only natural that the producers, being businessmen, should be after money.           
	One such programme, Sach Ka Saamna, has been accused of degrading Indian culture. It is true that the contestants in this show are asked very private questions. But that is done with their due consent. So whats wrong, one is tempted to ask. We live in a modern society with Western ways. Young people want newer and bolder programmes such as the South Park and the Roadies in place of the boring old stuff like the Mahabharata or the K-serials. It is all very well to speak of heritage. But in order to restore that, one must address the evils of real life, such as the rise in the violence against women, communalism and so on, rather than censor reality shows.           
	The reality shows get their share of popularity while the news channels, by starting debates on what is shown on these programmes, draw an even greater share. But at the end, the viewer does not get a chance to complain that he is bored.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The unnecessary furore recently caused by some MPs over the reality show, Sach Ka Saamna, indicates their misplaced sense of priority. The ruckus over Sach Ka Saamna was started by a member of the Samajwadi Party perhaps with the intention of bringing some diversion to the usual proceedings of the Parliament. Then such an insignificant issue became one of the most debated ones and ended up wasting time. It seems that these politicians have nothing more serious than a reality show to discuss among themselves.          
	There are many viewers who, instead of condemning the show, have appreciated the honesty with which the participants have confessed. Perhaps the participants wanted to confess things which they could not have revealed elsewhere, and the show provided them with a good platform to unburden themselves. The show, instead of disrupting families, as one MP claims it has done, has actually gone on to cement relationships. The show also gives one the opportunity to be honest and forthright about relationships.           
	Many MPs insist that the show promotes vulgarity. There was nothing vulgar, however, about any of the questions asked. Politicians may fear that if the show is not stopped then one of their kind would be asked to participate, thereby letting loose an avalanche of skeletons from their cupboards. Parliamentarians have no right to dictate what should or should not be shown on television. Audiences are mature enough to choose for themselves.           
	Yours faithfully,

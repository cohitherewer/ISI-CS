The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Anything whatever
                                                                                                                 ANYTHING WHATEVER                                                          
	The end will be like the beginning. There will be the Word. That word will be Whatever. The Book of Genesis got it right: language is the perfect companion to nothingness. But that was gods own nothingness, full of things about to happen, turning into men, women, snakes and apples with the uttering of the Word, followed by sweet, happy sinning. The rest is history, and literature. But the nothingness of Whatever is another story altogether. It will be not only the end of language, but of everything else that comes with language. The great void will be full of the sublime indifference of Whatever, the ghost of a shrug and an everlasting yawn. The boredom of it would kill the most die-hard nihilist, for so much of nihilism is pure talk.        
	A tiny survey, conducted by an American college with 938 adult Americans, has found that nearly half the people questioned said whatever was the word that got on their nerves the most. Close on its heels came you know, anyway and at the end of the day. What is it about the word that annoys even the Americans? Perhaps it stands for a kind of urban cool that the iPodding, netting, texting, chatting, not-so-bright young thing has perfected to a First World stereotype: a bored and sullen teen shading into a virtual, chat-engine avatar, indifferent to the pleasures and responsibilities of nuanced verbal communication. The link with America and the First World is only historical. Whatever rules the world. A Singaporean soft drink is called Whatever (the other brand is called Anything), and Oasis has a song called Whatever, which goes, Im free to be whatever I/ Whatever I choose Im free to say whatever I/ Whatever I like        
	Another little survey, also made in the West, is relevant here. Among finalists in genetics at Londons Imperial College, the British students were found to make three times as many errors in their English compared to their overseas classmates from China, Singapore and Indonesia (surprisingly, there seems to have been no Indian in that class). This is a different bracket of youngsters, more Facebook than iPod, more expensively educated and among the toppers in their specialist subjects (usually in the sciences or technology), but their language skills woefully inadequate. Perhaps this has got more to do with modes of competitiveness in the global higher-education scenario, and in the way English becomes the primary vehicle of such competition. For native speakers, English is the language in which they make themselves understood to one another, primarily in conversation or through means in which the niceties of spelling, grammar or vocabulary do not matter. But for overseas students in the Anglophone West, good English is a matter of survival and, increasingly in Britain, of integration. They cannot afford to shrug it all off with the hated W-word. Whatever is still not Whoever.

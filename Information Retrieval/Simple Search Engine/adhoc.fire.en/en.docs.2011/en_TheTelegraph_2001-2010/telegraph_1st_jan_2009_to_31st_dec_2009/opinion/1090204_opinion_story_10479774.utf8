	The curtain, it was imagined, had come down on swadeshi. The past, however, has strange claimants. Barack Obamas call to buy American can only be interpreted as the United States of Americas version of swadeshi. The call to change  Mr Obamas election rallying cry  seems to have become a call for a reversal of economic policies and attitudes. Buy American is a signal for a turn to protectionism and insularity. It is significant that buy American is a clause in the $819 billion stimulus package proposed by the new president and now awaiting ratification by the US Senate. The package has already won the endorsement of the House of Representatives. The new proposal stipulates that any construction project financed by the package must use iron and steel produced in the US. A caveat says that only if this results in an increase in the budget of more than 25 per cent will the condition be waived. It is not difficult to trace the economic theory underpinning Mr Obamas policy. It is argued that if more money is spent on domestic goods and services, demand would increase and growth would be faster. The logic of this may appear flawless, but its application may be difficult and antiquated in a globalized world. Mr Obama can expect opposition from his well-known allies across the world.        
	In November last year, the G-20 passed a resolution that emphasized there would be no falling back on protectionism to counter the global economic crisis. Both Gordon Brown, the British prime minister, and Peter Mandelson, a British cabinet minister and former trade commissioner of the European Union, have voiced concerns about the tendency to revert to protectionism. The US was a signatory to this resolution even though the signature was that of George W. Bush. Mr Obama cannot renege on that signature. Yet his buy American clause is a violation of this. There is no guarantee that a vigorous pursuit of protectionist policies will result in the ending of the global crisis. In fact, if every country were to pursue its own insular economic interests, there could be an intensification and a prolonging of the crisis. What is a cause of concern is the fear that Mr Obama, instead of directly engaging with the global meltdown, is being driven by narrow domestic political concerns. This is not expected of a leader who has promised his country that he will win back for it the moral high ground in world affairs.

	Monumental waste                  
	Sir  The Supreme Courts directive to the Uttar Pradesh government to explain its statue-building spree at the cost of the exchequer has been vehemently contested by the state (Mayavati in a monumental battle, June 30). The state has attempted to dilute the case by citing the manner in which Teen Murti Bhavan was converted to a prime ministers memorial. In fact, Teen Murti Bhavan was Jawaharlal Nehrus official residence and was converted to the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library after his death. Indira Gandhis residence at Safdarjung Road, New Delhi, was converted to the Indira Gandhi Memorial Museum.          
	Mayavati probably considers herself a living legend and thus justifies the erection of her statue alongside those of B.R. Ambedkar and Kanshi Ram. Such blatant misuse of public money is a blot on Indian democracy. If Mayavati is a true Dalit leader, then the crores spent on such statues would be used to ease the poverty of millions of Dalits, some of whom still believe that she is their saviour. Recent electoral gains might have emboldened her to venture into south and west India. However, her ambition to be a national Dalit leader and even prime minister will certainly take a beating if she persists in playing with peoples sentiments, especially those of the Dalits.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Prabhakar Bhattacharya,Ichapore, North 24 Parganas               
	Sir  The Supreme Court has issued a showcause notice to the UP government headed by Mayavati for wasting public money in building statues of herself, her political mentors, and for projecting her party symbol. It is significant that Mayavati hurriedly advanced the date of unveiling these statues in fear of a possible stay order.           
	To avoid such circumventions, the Supreme Court could institute a fast-track special bench for speedy disposal of cases involving politicians misusing public funds for self-advertisement. Such cases drag on for too long. The prime minister, Manmohan Singh, would receive huge public support if he could bring a bill to ban publicity stunts of politicians and parties at the governments expense.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

                
	Sir  It is a matter of concern that a public interest litigation had to be filed by two advocates to bring to the courts notice Mayavatis huge expenditure of Rs 1,000 crore on statues. Some questions are unavoidable. Can a chief minister remain in office after squandering public money? Can the Centre not intervene in such cases? The governor could report to the Centre seeking its intervention regarding such waste, and a suo motu case could be instituted at the Centres instance.           
	It seems that the Centre did not take a serious view of the state exchequer being emptied to satisfy a chief ministers ego. But it is duty bound to keep a close watch on the state governments excesses.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
S. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

                
	Sir  P. Chidambarams question, Can there be something more shameful than this [referring to Mayavatis statue-building spree] in Indian politics? invites another question: Who started it all? The Congress and its first family, would be the answer.           
	It has been noted that the Congress has named all major government programmes, projects and institutions after three members of the Nehru-Gandhi family  Rajiv Gandhi, Indira Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru. They are the party icons. Such naming is part of a systematic effort to gain unfair advantage over other political parties. So the Congress first disturbed the level playing field in the electoral arena.           
	Yours faithfully,      
P.M. Ravindran, Kalpathy, Kerala

                
	Left out          
	Sir  The results of the recently concluded municipal elections have definitely shaken the Communist Party of India (Marxist) as is suggested by Left nightmare: Part III (July 2). Even before the party could brace itself after the Lok Sabha elections, another blow has made the stalwarts of the Left Front stagger. The outcome marks an imminent shift of power in the political history of West Bengal. After being in power for over 30 years, homesickness will undoubtedly reign supreme in the CPI(M) ranks. To a generation used to seeing the red flag always a-flutter, the exit of the old guard would hold more significance than the arrival of the new. For 32 years, Asansol had been a stronghold of the Left. But the recent elections have changed that a change likely to be welcomed by most.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Souvik Banerjee, Asansol 

                
	Sir  Never leave your enemy half-dead, goes the adage, and the leader of the Trinamul Congress, Mamata Banerjee, has perhaps taken it as her motto. After the Lok Sabha triumph in West Bengal, the TMC and the Congress have once again dealt a blow to the Left citadel in the recently concluded municipal elections.          
	Nothing is going right for the Left at the moment. The Lalgarh mayhem has put the CPI(M) on the backfoot. The anti-Left wave has brought about an near-total reversal in the municipal poll results as well. It was almost a clean sweep for the Opposition as the CPI(M) somehow found a face-saver in three seats out of 16. The matter of concern for the Left is that the seats it has lost were believed to be the Left Fronts stronghold for many years. Going by this trend, it seems that the chief minister of West Bengal is going to have many sleepless nights before the 2011 assembly elections.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Subhayu Saha, Khagra, Murshidabad

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | sipping on time
                                                                            Thursday , November 12 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                              SIPPING ON TIME                                                                  
	Paramount Sherbet on Bankim Chatterjee Street looks as if it has always been there. Tucked away between rows of dingy shops selling everything from books to dimtoast, Paramount can easily go unnoticed by a passer-by. Then it materializes suddenly, almost out of a gap in the Mullickbari arcade. Step into the shop, and you enter a place that seems to have existed forever.        
	The high ceilings segmented into neat rectangles by the intersecting kari-bargas, the garlanded idols of Lakshmi and Ganesh in the kulungis, and the yellowing photographs of Bengali icons are enough to transport you to another world. Globalization obviously hasnt touched this place. The mounted heads of antlered stags staring down from the walls add to the charm. The present owner of Paramount, Parthapratim Majumdar, informs me that these had been purchased from the nizam of Hyderabad at an auction 80 years ago. His family has owned the shop for 91 years. His grandfather, Niharranjan Majumdar, who started Paramount, was a freedom fighter. In pre-Independence days, the shop acted as a cover for a hideout at the back. Intrigues had been hatched there, and stratagems discussed by the likes of Subhash Bose. Sitting at one of the marble-topped tables of Paramount today, it does not require much imagination to visualize the grimy green curtains  dividing the shop proper from the backyard  parting to reveal the revolutionaries at a tryst.        
	Paramount had hosted not only political leaders but also such well-known personalities as Nazrul Islam, Satyendran-ath Bose and Satyajit Roy. Parthapratim reminisces that one of the main attractions of Paramount today, Dab Sherbet, was fashioned by Niharranjan on the basis of a suggestion by Prafulla Roy, who had asked him to prepare a drink that would not only quench the students thirst but would also be a mouthful. So Dab Sherbet, which is iced coconut water with scoops of the kernel, came into being. The other varieties of sherbet on offer have such tantalizing names as Grape Crush, Malai Sherbet and Cocoa Malai. With most of them priced at a modest Rs 20, Paramount is never short of customers  mostly students from the nearby Calcutta University and Presidency College for whom the shop is a favourite watering hole. As I drank my Dab Sherbet, I could not help noticing a young couple who sipped from a single standard-sized glass. Being inherently selfish, I wondered how they pulled off that feat without quarrelling over the share. But then, the girl was perhaps on a diet.        
	The owners of Paramount have no plans to modify the shop. There were clamours of protests from old-timers when glass cabinets were installed behind the main counter to display the articles on Paramount that have appeared in various newspapers over the years (this is all that the shop does by way of publicity). So they had to close shop for a few days and renovate surreptitiously.        
	One of the distinguishing features of Paramount has been the constant pounding that serves as a bizarre background music. I remember being baffled by it on my first visit to Paramount. Then I discovered that it was the sound of huge ice slabs being crushed for the sherbets. I felt strangely happy to hear the sound when I visited Paramount this time, after ten years. In this life of flux, at least some things do not change.

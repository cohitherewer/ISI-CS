                                                                                                                 FOR CHOICE                                                    
	Forty years have passed since Indira Gandhi nationalized banks. It was a political decision  a shot fired in her battle with Congress patriarchs who she thought were propped up by industrialists. Though spectacular, it was not radical, at least immediately: the banks names remained unchanged, all managers were kept in place, and even the special relationships between industrialists and their erstwhile banks were covertly preserved.        
	But all that is history, and banks have become part of the government. They are governed by regulations made by the Reserve Bank of India, and run by staff recruited on the basis of examinations like the civil service. Bank managers have considerable power to favour borrowers and to ingratiate themselves with their patrons; some perhaps use it for personal enrichment. A handful have been caught; a much larger number lived happily ever after. But banks have functioned without too many hiccups, and have occupied and retained a central role in the financial sector. Although her flamboyant moves  bank nationalization, war with Pakistan, declaration of Emergency  did not help her keep her chair, Indira Gandhis family and followers are back in power; so there will be many celebrations of the anniversary of nationalization. Many paeans will be sung, and many tributes paid to her wisdom.        
	But it no longer matters whether she was wise or not. Banks have survived and prospered. The insecurity that has frozen the banking sector all these years can now be put behind. There was a brief period, in the early 1990s, when the Congress made peace with industrialists and saw the merits of competition. It then licensed a few new private banks. That radical phase was soon over; since then, private and foreign banks have increased their market share, but not so much as to change the market structure. Parts of the structure remain weak. Cooperative banks remain an instrument of local politicians to enrich themselves at the expense of depositors as well as governments; 19 of them failed between April 2008 and March 2009. Regional rural banks are another weak pillar. Government banks remain reluctant to extend services to rural areas; their employees, who cannot lose jobs, prefer to stay in big towns where their children can go to good schools. New entrepreneurs find it difficult to get loans. The government has tried all the weapons at its command to address these problems  talks by finance ministers to bank chairmen, instructions from the RBI, manipulation of senior appointments  but none has worked. Government banks are secure, stable, self-satisfied. This is the time to give new competition a chance. It has been suggested by many committees, the last one being the Percy Mistry committee. Even S.S. Tarapore, once paragon of Indian-style central banking, now favours it. The government should now act.

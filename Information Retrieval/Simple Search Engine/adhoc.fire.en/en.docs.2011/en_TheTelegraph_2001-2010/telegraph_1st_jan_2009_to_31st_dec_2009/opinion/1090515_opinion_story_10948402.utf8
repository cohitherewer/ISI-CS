	In search of the devil                
	The Winner Stands Alone (Penguin, Rs 325) by Paulo Coelho comes with a warning from the author  This is not a thriller, but a stark portrait of where we are now  lest the reader misunderstands his intentions. Coelho has preached the importance of following ones dream in his previous books. This one explores what happens when dreams are manipulated, and get distorted. It is written in Coelhos unmistakable holier-than-thou style that seeks to expose, through quaint irony, the devil in the glitter of money and fame, and so to lead the sinner to light. Igor, a Russian millionaire, Hamid, a rich fashion designer, and Gabriela the celebrity get to realize the folly of their ways when the emptiness of their dreams mocks them in the face. Coelhos pious voice, buttressed by appropriate quotations from the Scriptures, resounds in the dark when the light of flashbulbs has died. The prodigals have only to lend him their ears to give the devil a timely slip.                                  
	Soil Not Oil: Climate Change, Peak Oil, and Food Insecurity (Women Unlimited, Rs 225) by Vandana Shiva is a well-argued book that asks to be taken seriously. Shiva examines the nature of the climate change affecting India, and finds that the situation is not entirely beyond redemption. To reverse the trend, We need a new model, one that respects peoples right to land and food, to their commons and biodiversity, she says. The new model is one of small farms and local economies that would tackle the food crisis while narrowing the gap between the rich and poor. For Shiva, only a future that dispenses with fossil fuels and concentrates power in the people can be an antidote to the harmful effects of unplanned industrialization and urbanization.                        
	The book of flights: An Adventure Story (Vintage, 4.10) by J.M.G. le Clzio is a classic by the 2008 Nobel Prize winner for literature. This is an irredeemably bleak account of the travels of a young man, Hogan, across four continents. The journey begins in a necropolis similar to those surreal and enchanted townscapes of film noire. The weird assortment of faces and objects brings to mind the deathly dream of Bergmans aged protagonist in Wild Strawberries. Readers might find this novel somewhat heavy-going, what with the rapidly changing landscape, broken plot-line and fragmentary monologues of Hogan. However, the unmistakable mark of an eccentric brilliance is more than evident.

	Two steps back                  
	Sir  The two-day bank strike revealed how West Bengal is going back to a past when a live work culture was scorned at. Not only did state banking unions go on strike, they also insisted that others must not work as well. Why else did they forcibly close ATM outlets of ICICI and HDFC banks, which were not participating in the strike? Incidentally, the branches of these banks in other states operated as usual. As long as such irresponsible trade unionism is not addressed, industrialization and development would remain empty words.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Beauty with brains          
	Sir  The demise of Gayatri Devi has created a void in the hearts of her many admirers across the world (Gayatri Devi passes away, July 30 ). Apart from being an ethereal beauty, she was highly educated and intelligent. She was a woman of substance who left a mark through her work. She was not just another aristocrat with a fanciful interest in social justice. As a politician, she fought for womens education and environmental causes. She led an eventful life, in spite of the tragedy of her sons untimely death and a series of legal battles over the ownership of property. Controversies apart, the Rajmata of Jaipur will always be remembered as an embodiment of courage, beauty and grace.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
A. Bhattacharyya, Guwahati

                
	Sir The death of the legendary beauty, Gayatri Devi, has saddened the world. The magical aura of the royal personalities of India has mesmerized people across the world, which is why Indians are proud of the striking looks of the late Rajmata. The astonishing record of gaining the biggest electoral victory in the world, set by her and endorsed by the Guinness Book of Records, still remains unbroken. However, at the same time, it is lamentable that accusations of breaking tax laws put a taint on her many achievements.          
	Yours faithfully,         Soma Biswas,Durgapur                        
	Spirited fighter          
	Sir  The courage shown by Sudans trouser girl, Lubna Hussein, deserves praise (Whip me if you dare: Trouser girl, Aug 3). It is hard to imagine that even today, a nation can be so conservative as to force a dress code on its women. Hussein, in her conviction to protest against this, has indeed started a revolution. The state cannot curb an individuals freedom of expression. The way one dresses does not necessarily indicate ones religious values, patriotism, or the lack of any of these. It seems as if enforcing rules on women is the only way a patriarchal society asserts its efficiency. In doing this, such societies fail to recognize that a nation cannot progress unless it respects women.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
A. Mallik, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Lubna Husseins vow to stand up for womens rights in one of the most conservative nations should be an eye-opener for suppressed women across the world. Her courage reminds one of another fearless woman, Taslima Nasreen, who has firmly stood up against Islamic fundamentalism.           
	The oppression of women, especially in Asian and African countries, is a global concern. Hussein was arrested for wearing trousers, and was humiliated in public. But she did not take advantage of her status as an United Nations employee to escape the consequences. Instead, she grabbed this opportunity to fight against repression in the name of sharia. Her fight should inspire more women to seek emancipation from the shackles of oppressive social laws and customs.          
	Yours faithfully,        P. Bhattacharya,Ichapore, North 24 Parganas

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Letters to Editor
                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	A train for everyone                  
	Sir  The shoddiness with which the Metro Railway was extended up to Garia Bazaar, without proper infrastructure to ensure hassle-free runs, shows how politicians put selfish interests before the safety of the common people (How smooth was our metro ride, Sept 7). Ever since the star-studded inauguration of the new route, hardly a day has passed without passengers being harassed. As the report rightly points out, the system that could bail out Calcutta when everything else failed, has suddenly become a problem child. However, can the problem child be solely blamed when it has been indulged by irresponsible and mindless guardians? It is a pity that those responsible for bringing the Metro to this state of ignominy are taking pride in their achievements instead of apologizing to the commuters.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Srikanta Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

                
	Sir  I am a daily passenger on the Metro. Of late, I find Calcuttas so-called pride  the underground train  getting sorrier by the day. Punctuality, comfort and regular services, the features that once defined the Metro, have become history ever since it started plying on an extended route. In peak hours, trains are often late, and cancellation leads to overcrowding. Passengers are kept waiting on every station and the doors fail to close as people try to squeeze in. The other day, while returning from Dum Dum, I was almost thrown out of the train at Esplanade. Hasty planning prior to the extension is responsible for this mess. Increasing the frequency and the number of trains might sort out the problem.          
	Moreover, naming stations after national icons has led to confusion. Passengers find it difficult to locate the right stations, as they are not identified by place names. Perhaps a better tribute to these celebrated figures could come in form of naming roads, heritage buildings, and suchlike after them. For the sake of the commuters, the new names of the Metro stations should be scrapped. Even if the fancy names are retained, the place names should be included alongside to help ordinary people.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Wazir Hossain, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Recently, an infrastructural snag caused an electric spark in a Metro compartment which was enough to incite panic among the commuters. That the new tracks are not up to the mark was apparent from this incident. And naming the stations after iconic figures would not cover up these shortcomings. In the days preceding the Pujas, there is generally a great hustle and bustle and trains get crowded with excited shoppers. Long delays or snaking queues at the ticket counters during such busy times cause a lot of distress to the people.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Ahana Sen Gupta, Calcutta

                
	Sir  In the extended phase of the Metro Railway, only four stations have been added, but actually, the trains now cover the entire stretch between Garia and Tollygunge, inviting a huge number of people to use the service. Hence, the sorry state of affairs. It seems that either the authorities have not taken overcrowding into account or the railways minister has forced them to run the trains along the new route to offer a sop to Calcuttans before the Pujas. Clearly, any sense of accountability among ministers stops with inaugurating new projects. They hardly bother about proper implementation or the delivery of quality services           
	Yours faithfully,       
Narayan Das, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The new route of the Metro Railway from Tollygunge to Garia passes through residential areas. The noise emitted by the trains running on this stretch is far more than the permissible noise level. School children cannot concentrate on their studies and elderly persons cannot sleep until the last train has rolled down. The noise levels were alarmingly high when the piling of Tolly Nullah was being done. The work often continued beyond midnight. I had taken up the issue with the Pollution Control Board at that time. The board had promptly called for a hearing and thereafter, the general manager, Metro Railways, was directed to stop piling between 9 pm and 6 am.           
	In the same letter to the PCB, I had expressed apprehensions about rising noise levels once trains started running in the future, and suggested that a suitable noise barrier be put in place. I was given to understand that the matter would be looked into by the PCB before the trains started running. Nothing seems to have been done so far, and the residents on either side of Tolly Nullah continue to suffer due to the high noise levels from early morning till late night.          
	Yours faithfully,      
S.N. Mitra, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The Telegraph should be congratulated for the way it has portrayed the condition of the Calcutta Metro. Due to the indolence of the management, mishaps seem to be on the rise everyday. Technical faults, as the one that happened recently, may even endanger the lives of the people. At present, the lack of coordination between the management and the staff is evident. With overpopulation and the phasing out of many vehicles, the Metro has turned out to be an important means of transport for Calcuttans. The problems that have arisen are not a new, but they are yet to be dealt with efficiently. In India, there is a lack of consumer-friendly attitude among various service providers. Daily passengers on the Metro should act in unison and force the authorities to make the rides safer.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Jayanta Datta, Chinsurah, Hooghly              
	Sir  While the otherwise patient and cooperative city of Calcutta has been quick to criticize the Metro authorities for initial troubles that cropped up during the recent extension of services to Garia, I am sure that all the issues would be resolved eventually. In fact, already services have been smoothened out to a large extent. This is indeed a Herculean task and all stakeholders must step in to ensure success. The railways minister ought to be thanked for this pre-Puja gift. The citizens of Calcutta will be truly benefited by the new Metro services during the festive season.           
	However, I wish to suggest a few practical measures to ensure that revenues are secured and people do not dirty the stations. First, all automated swivel gates must be made operational on priority basis to stop passengers from underpaying for their tickets. Second, a cleanliness drive should be initiated to identify people who spit or throw litter on the platforms or in the train compartments. This may be done with the help of the security forces to avoid a backlash. Spot fines must be reintroduced. Third, bins should be kept near the exit for disposing paper tickets. Finally, a smoking ban should be enforced strictly.                     
	Yours faithfully,

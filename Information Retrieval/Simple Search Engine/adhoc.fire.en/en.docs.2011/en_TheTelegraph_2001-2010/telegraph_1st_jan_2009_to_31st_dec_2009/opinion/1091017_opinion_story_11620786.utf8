The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Do not sleep, its Diwali
                                                                                                                 DO NOT SLEEP, ITS DIWALI                                  This Above All -   Khushwant Singh                          Ammunition bazaar                                        
	On the evening before Dussehra, there was a wedding in the servants quarters attached to the block of flats where I live. I had no knowledge of it, but was informed of the arrival of the baraat by a series of deafening explosions which even pierced my non-receptive ears. The families concerned probably could not afford to have a brass-band and had to do with a party of three drummers. Between them, they raised a din no brass-band could match. It went on for over 20 minutes, followed by more explosions before the marriage ceremony started. We are a noise-happy people, I explained to my guests. I could not help adding, at times I think my growing deafness is a blessing in disguise. These explosions get muffled and I am spared a lot of bullshit. The next evening there were a few more bangs and some crackers. Is there any other wedding? I asked my servant, Bahadur. No, he replied, tomorrow is Dussehra. In the evening following, the bombs and crackers were as deafening as on the first. So it continues evening after evening till Diwali when most of the stored up ammunition of pathakas, phuljharis, sparklers and rockets will be spent.         
	Loudspeakers have enhanced noise-makers ability to destroy other peoples peace and quiet. One early dawn, I reached Jalandhar by train. A waning moon could be seen and beside it, the morning star. It could have been a serene amritvela  the ambrosial hour. But from all corners came all sorts of noise: gurbani from gurdwaras, bells from mandirs, calls for fajr prayers from mosques. We think nothing of imposing our faiths on people we do not share them with. To top all unwelcome noises are all-night jagrans they are noise-makers ultimate victories over all humanity; they will not let you sleep.                
	Look closely                
	Shamsur Rahman (1929-2006) of Dhaka is probably the most admired Bengali poet in Bangladesh and in literary circles of Indian Bengal. He is lucky in having found an excellent translator in Shankar Sen of Calcutta. Although I do not know Bengali, I enjoyed reading Sens renderings since they sounded authentic, as if composed originally in English. Though The Best Poems of Shamsur Rahman was published sometime ago, it came into my hands recently. I quote the opening verse as appetizer:         
	...look at me, look well,        
	look very closely          
	my gray whiskers are suffused with        
	deep sighs, I am often        
	afflicted by toothache, my eyesight        
	is deteriorating day by day....        
	I am busy, exhausted, with no        
	respite,        
	I am like a ghost, who return drained        
	 and exhausted after a soiree        
	And strolls dejectedly on the balcony        
	Yet even now I can bluff with ease        
	and upbraid a friend with relish        
	In no time; the better part of         
	days is often spent        
	In wishing the deaths of        
	 close relatives,        
	I easily manage to forget my        
	 own wife        
	While placing my mouth on the breast of anothers wife        
	You are hating me a lot,        
	arent you?        
	That is what I am now. The person you knew has risen from        
	within me and        
	Gone in hiding very far away        
	Now, would you please leave me         
	and go?                
	Brown sugar                
	The one dessert that has become popularly accepted all over India is caramel custard, pronounced by most Indian cooks as kamel kushtad. All Irani restaurants in Mumbai specialize in it. Now you can savour it in most Indian eateries, including some fancy dhabas. My cook does an excellent job making it when he has run out of ideas.        
	I had assumed that caramel custard was the legacy left by British memsahibs and that the word, caramel, was some variation of Mount Carmel of Biblical times. I looked up my dictionary and found I had been wrong down the line. It is made of sugar heated till it turns brown or of soft toffee made of sugar and butter. The name is not derived from the Bible but from the Spanish word, caramelo.                
	Fatal lunch                
	A Gujarati, a Tamil and a Punjabi were doing construction work on the scaffolding on the twentieth floor of a building. They were having lunch and the Gujju opened his lunch box and said, Dhokla! If I get dhokla one more time for lunch, Im going to jump off this building. The Tamil opened his lunch box and exclaimed, Idli-sambar again! If I get idli-sambar one more time, Im going to jump off too. The Punjabi opened his lunch and said, Parantha again! If I get a parantha one more time, Im jumping too.        
	The next day, the Gujju opened his lunch box, saw dhokla, and jumped to his death. The Tamil opened his lunch, saw idli-sambar, and jumped too. The Punjabi opened his lunch, saw the parantha and jumped to his death as well.        
	At the funeral, the Gujjus wife was weeping. She said, If Id known how tired he was of dhokla, I would have never given it to him again! The Tamils wife also wept and said, I could have given him dosa! I didnt realize he hated idli-sambar so much. Everyone turned and stared at the Punjabi wife. She said, Dont look at me. He made his own lunch.

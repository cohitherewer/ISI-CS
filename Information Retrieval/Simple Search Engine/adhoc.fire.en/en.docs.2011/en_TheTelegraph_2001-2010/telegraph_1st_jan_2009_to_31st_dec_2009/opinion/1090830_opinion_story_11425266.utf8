	With Atal Bihari Vajpayee ill and L.K. Advani rendered speechless and under serious attack, the Bharatiya Janata Party is without a credible leader. Only the very brave or the charmingly innocent will use the word, leader, to describe Rajnath Singh. It would appear that the BJP is facing the worst crisis in its history. Even when it was reduced to two seats in the Lok Sabha in 1984, things had not looked so gloomy for the party. At that time, despite the electoral debacle, inner party strife had not torn it apart. At the moment no one seems in a position to give the party any kind of direction. What is worse is that the party leadership has suffered a terrible loss of face. First, it decided to expel Jaswant Singh for writing a book. Second, its most prominent (some would prefer notorious) chief minister banned the book in his state. This needless storm over a book was followed by some very embarrassing revelations and allegations. All these were directed at Mr Advani. One ideologue suggested that Mr Vajpayee had wanted Narendra Modi to resign after the Gujarat pogroms but Mr Advani had scuttled that. A very close aide of Mr Vajpayee went on record to say that Mr Advani was part of the group that decided to send Mr Singh to Kandahar. This indicated that Mr Advani had been rather economical with the truth on this matter. Mr Advani has maintained a silence that is not particularly dignified since all this puts him and his party in a very lurid light.        
	Away from the highest echelons of the party, the second-rung of leaders  Arun Jaitley, Sushma Swaraj et al  have gone scurrying to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief for counsel. This move by itself is a pointer to the BJPs dilemma. Is the BJP its own master? There has always been a theory that the BJP is a puppet and the puppeteers sit in Nagpur in the RSS headquarters. As long as Mr Vajpayee was at the helm of affairs, he performed a balancing act and successfully thwarted pressure from the RSS. Mr Advani, the iron man, was more pliable in the hands of the RSS. But he, in a bid to be the prime minister-in-waiting, wanted to be more secular than the Congress and praised Jinnah and, of all places, in Pakistan. Since then, his position has been fragile. Now, Mr Advani seems to have lost whatever goodwill he had. The turn to the RSS by those who want to be leaders, in a way, confirms the puppet theory.        
	The return to the RSS is a retreat from the project to make the BJP a modern and democratic party. It is a return to the womb as it were. The challenge before the new leadership of the BJP is to make the party capable of leading India, not just a section of India. The BJP believes that it represents India. In reality, except for brief moments under Mr Vajpayee, it has been an exclusivist and sectarian formation. The present crisis is an opportunity. The BJP is poised to miss it.

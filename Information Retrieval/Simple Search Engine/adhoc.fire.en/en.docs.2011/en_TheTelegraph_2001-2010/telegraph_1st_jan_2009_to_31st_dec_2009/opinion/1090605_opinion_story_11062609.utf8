	Nocturnes By Kazuo Ishiguro, Faber, Rs 499         
	Very hesitantly, Kazuo Ishiguro tells The Guardian that he likes to think of his latest book of five stories as a story book that happens to be divided into five movements: It sounds very pretentious, but you know some music forms, like sonatas, you get five what seems like totally different pieces of music but they go together. He is speaking, one realizes, in 21st-century Britain. In 20th-century Europe, he would not have had to be so carefully unpretentious. Brought up on Chopin, Proust and Mann, or on Piaf, Barbara and Jacques Brel, his Continental readers would have known exactly what he was up to with a book called Nocturnes: Five Stories of Music and Nightfall.        
	Ishiguros book  his seventh in 27 years  invokes the sonata as well as the nocturne. He wants to give it the structured unity of the classical sonata, with themes and motifs introduced, elaborated and recalled to create a web of moving connections. But he also invests each of the five stories with more autonomy than the movements in a sonata usually have. Chopins nocturnes, for instance, like his preludes or ballades, broke the sonata up into shorter pieces, like lyric or story fragments that are complete in themselves but also form richly interconnected clusters and sequences. In the late-19th and early-20th centuries, Western music, fiction and poetry continually drew from one another structurally and thematically, so that the rise of the short story or lyric poem and the emergence of fragmented musical forms became parallel histories in the evolution of modern narrative and lyric modes.        
	The formal achievement of Ishiguros Nocturnes is close to that of Jhumpa Lahiris latest book of interconnected stories, Unaccustomed Earth. But Ishiguros stories are more explicitly aware of these parallel histories of music and of fiction than are Lahiris. However, the musical worlds or atmospheres that he spins out in these stories draw mostly upon popular music  crooners like Frank Sinatra, Ray Charles or Julie Andrews, or old American Broadway songs and the Great American Songbook variously sung by Sarah Vaughan, Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald and Chet Baker. There are also the worlds of solitary Dylanesque songwriting, of aspiring jazz saxophonists (a jobbing tenor man), and even of Abba sung at Swiss weddings and resorts. It is only in the last story, Cellists, mixing elation and chill, that musical genius in a more classical sense, together with legendary teachers and conservatories, and the music of Rachmaninov and Britten, is paid homage to. But this classical world is also rendered alien and remote from the perspective of a less exalted, possibly Eastern European guitarist-narrator.        
	So, in spite of their classical lineage, Ishiguros stories have a wistfulness, embodied by people who are too shy or too self-disparaging to be seriously profound, and a lightness of touch even at their most sentimental. (I counted six key moments when somebody weeps or a characters eyes fill up with tears.) This keeps the stories close to the spirit of what someone in a Nol Coward play calls cheap music. Extraordinary how potent cheap music is, remarks Amanda in Private Lives. For Ishiguro, this spareness and lightness go back, not to a Japanese aesthetic, but to his early absorption in songwriting, with Bob Dylan, Leonard Cohen, Joni Mitchell and that whole generation as his heroes. He describes his transition from songs to novels  including Nocturnes, which he wrote at one go, like a novel  as seamless. It was also fed by endless discussions, in those early years, on the relationship between words and music and how they had to come alive within the context of performance.         
	In thus creating fiction from within the total experience of producing and consuming music, Nocturnes exists alongside such diverse fictional and semi-fictional reflections on music as Michael Ondaatjes Coming Through Slaughter, Geoff Dyers But Beautiful: A book About Jazz, Amit Chaudhuris Afternoon Raag and his latest novel, The Immortals, together with Ishiguros own The Unconsoled (on a monumental scale) and some unbearably sad, unforgettable parts of Never Let me Go. At a less literary and more immediate level, anybody who has grown up with Rabindrasangeet, Hindi films, folksongs or Broadway musicals, or who loves the jazz-haunted early Woody Allen, the pre-Hollywoodized Almodvar and the stylish melancholy of Wong Kar-wai that keeps returning to the lissomness of a single tune, or has marvelled at the splicing of the ordinary and the lyrical in Resnaiss On connat la chanson, would be able to get how life and music, feelings and songs, are together made and unmade in Ishiguros stories.         
	In Nocturnes, songs  writing, singing, accompanying or listening to them  are part of the innermost recesses of our emotional, visceral and fantasy lives. They tap into our secret motives and unspoken histories. They are tied up with our sense of our own worth, potential and desirability (or their terrible opposites), with our sense of how dispensable or indispensable we are in the lives of others. They are what we rehearse inside our improvised cubicles, where they soar in secret above worldly compromises while we wait for our genius to be recognized and unwrapped at last. They might even bring about some of the most surreal turning points in our lives. A song could also be a parenthesis in time, during which not only are human emotions intensely savoured or shared, but their banal consequences also kept at bay, if only for a few minutes.        
	Yet, the solitary closet of music opens out, painfully or exhilaratingly, into the world. Music not only connects us to other lives, but it also pitches us into larger systems and structures that are inevitably collective, technological and commercial. This makes our relationship with music both pure and impure, perfectly mundane and grandly deluded. It is music that makes a lone songwriter, so used to feeling undermined, sit at his big bay window on the Malvern Hills on a clear morning and have the glorious feeling that when I strummed my chords, they were ringing out across the whole nation. It is also music that enables a saxophonist, dull, loser ugly...the wrong kind of ugly, his reconstructed face wrapped in bandages, to glimpse something larger than rejection at the end of a sublimely absurd night with a celebrity whose face had also been lifted and bandaged: lifes so much bigger than just loving someone.         
	Ishiguros loners and drifters form a band of the unblessed. Peculiarly bereft and useless, they are happiest living in other peoples houses and observing other peoples marriages. And they get to know the uplift of music as well as its dying fall. Their nocturnes fill the night with difficult magic, even as they bring on the light of common day.

                                                                                                                 CLEAN UP THE CLUTTER                                  BONA FIDE - MALVIKA SINGH                              
	The Right to Information Act has been one of the most salutary bills passed by the Lok Sabha in the last few years. It has allowed the questioning of wrong practices and exposed the misuse of a hitherto closed and exclusive machinery that operated the governance of India, ironically at the cost of the Indian people. To protect the lucrative wheeling and dealing within the privileged nexus, the government had become used to enacting laws with one hand and then making sure that the other hand prevented the enforcement of those very laws. Today, many a cover is being lifted to reveal the sordid reality.        
	Most recently, information revealed that a representative of the mining lobby, who was on many boards that have had their applications cleared by the environment ministry, was a member of the clearance committee  a complete scandal and wholly unacceptable. This one example is symbolic of a disease that has infected most protection committees of the government of India and the state governments, making them committees that exploit rather than protect. And that is where the problem lies  in the exclusive clubs where derailed politics, inappropriate administration of civil society and illegitimate businesses come together to destroy the ethos of India. Much more needs to happen through the consistent use of the RTI Act.        
	Recently, a daily carried a story about illegal mining in a state in south India where the chief ministers son is allegedly connected with the strong mining lobby, trying to process illegalities through the concerned ministry at the Centre. Will the wrong-doing, in this particular case, be stopped in its tracks, or will it be allowed to pass, ostensibly unnoticed, till it is too late to make the corrective? Who is the watchdog? Is it the minister at the Centre? Or, does the government need to install an ombudsman to oversee every ministry so that ministers can overcome political pressures that come with standing up for what is right? There are thousands of such cases across India degrading and polluting the country.                
	Act fast        
	The government must be emphatically directed to stop giving with one hand and taking with the other, disregarding the people whom it governs. Having passed the tribal rights act at the cost of protecting what little remains of our forests, and having overturned other established laws that governed their protection, tribal lands are being eyed by large multinationals for takeovers through fast-track clearances for mining rights. The tribals are being exploited even more. The do-gooders are silent. Why have the NGO brigade not demanded that tribal communities in those areas give 51 per cent of the shareholding to displaced tribals? That would give them enough resources to better their lives and those of their children, and propelled them into economic growth.        
	Similarly, simple things like running the offices of the prime minister and others in the cabinet must be efficient and citizen-friendly. If one wants an appointment or any information from such offices, it is near impossible unless one goes directly, privately, to the person concerned and he or she then directs the secretary. In other words, you have to be within the inner circle and operate on nepotism rather than on professional goodwill. Till this insular attitude changes, and the secretarial staff are compelled by their immediate bosses to meet all requests with efficient, time-bound responses, lobbies will continue to flourish and leaders will remain at the mercy of their personal secretaries.        
	We are in the early phases of a cleansing that could take a decade. As citizens, we need to be proactive and use all the legal mechanisms at our command to ensure corrections, however small they may seem. All the drops come together in the larger pool to purify the space for the future.

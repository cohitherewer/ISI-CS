                                                                                                                 LOVE IN THE TIME OF STUDIES                                                          
	An idiotic old man is perfect for a long-lasting heterosexual relationship. This is the latest wisdom regarding marriage, emerging from a scientists study of 1,000 couples that was published in the European Journal of Operational Research. The man must be at least five years older than the woman, and be less educated than her  an intriguing combination of attributes that would make enduring relationships truly rare. But ideas about endurance are relative. The scientists felt that a period of five years for a marriage or a serious relationship was quite long enough, since the couples surveyed have been together for about five years. Maybe, it is long enough for the men who have heroically digested their younger partners higher accomplishments without a peep. And if the husband is fairly doddering, the chances of a strong relationship are even greater; egos have a tendency to dwindle with the testosterone.        
	The scientists confidence is deeply touching. One thousand couples are considered a big enough sample; they evidently represent the essence of conjugal relationships that, less scientific minds tend to think, are as numberless in their variety as motes in a sunbeam. Poor Ashton Kutcher; he has no place in the survey. He has not only made it past five years with his much older wife, but he is also far more educated. Off the celebrity trail, there is a growing number of perfectly happy younger husbands and live-in partners, ever since women began cocking a snook at the social judgment that turned them into corrupters of innocent flesh the moment they took an unmotherly peek at a more youthful male. There are exceptions both ways, or rather variety in every way. Cleopatra, for example, predictably makes a poor show from the point of view of a long-lasting marriage with a younger partner. Legend has it that she was rather more focused on her empire than on relationships, and the little Ptolemy she married was getting in her way. But she was definitely cleverer  and more educated  yet he became collateral damage.        
	Lest anyone suspect that the scientists are grannies who think that older men make better husbands, they have also found that the wives need to be more educated for a lasting relationship. Such a radical idea is much too avant-garde for places like India, where there are thousands of firmly wedded women with no education at all. They may be cleverer than their men, but then, women are cleverer as a rule. The question is, given the gender picture of workspaces in the world, what are the learned wives doing with their education  hiding it under hand-embroidered wraps? The study has actually proved another old belief, that women are an enigma. Else why should an educated woman want to hold on to a relationship with a stupid man without even his youthful ardour as compensation? Or maybe, just maybe, the wise men of science have got it wrong again, and there is something more to a relationship than juggling ages and education.

	Being away from the newspapers and television for five days is like having been to a fine spa where elaborate treatment relaxes the knotted nerves, calms, and therefore, activates the mind and cleanses the soul. In the countryside, the lungs get cleared, the skin sparkles and energy is renewed. A trip outside the city also brings many realities into perspective that tend to drown in the false and superficial banter that overwhelms us in our metropolitan environment. Hope is alive in the hinterland, and anger simmers against the political class that is in the gaddi at the moment. The youth there are looking desperately for someone to lead them into another realm and empower them.         
	Recognizing this stifling truth, the Youth Congress led by Rahul Gandhi is attempting to restructure the failed and hugely diluted democratic processes of the party. The experiment to garner new members began in the Punjab, where over three-and-a-half lakh young men and women have enrolled as part-time members and paid their fees. In Gujarat, the exercise is underway and there has been overwhelming support for it with the membership-drive forging ahead, bringing in large numbers of young people who have felt neglected and isolated so far. When I discussed the political conditions of Gujarat with some serious observers, their reaction was that Rahul Gandhi was making an incredible impact on the youth, attracting and drawing them into his fold and that this truth has unnerved Narendra Modi, which is why he had reacted as he did. In Punjab, an activist supporting the chief minister, Parkash Singh Badal, who has been virulently anti-Gandhi and Congress, admitted candidly that Rahuls scheme had electrified the youth of Punjab.        
	But, as always, the caveat accompanying the praise was that the Congress was defunct on the ground, that its senior leaders were battling each other and would soon be stabbing the young man in the back, and therefore, none of the good work would convert to votes. The forthcoming elections would be lost and so what was the point of it all. Sick.                
	New life        
	Well, here is the point of it all. In Punjab, the members of the legislative assembly have elected their local leaders who are in place and in office. A new leadership has taken charge, and the youths aged 45 plus will have to give up office! That one change is a huge move away from the nomination of favourite chamchas, all of whom had been appointed to key positions by either the Punjab Congress hierarchy or the Delhi based general secretaries who have manipulated their puppets to serve their personal interests for decades. A renewal is underway and could take many months, but there is hope.        
	In Gujarat, Modi is rattled because he realizes that the without the youth on his side, so to speak, his days are numbered. The Congress leaders understand this truth less clearly and think that they can continue playing their petty games of kaan katcha and factionalism.         
	Correctives have to come into play if India is to emerge out of her present political mess. Correctives take time and need to be put in place methodically, and adjusted to local demands. The first phase of this corrective, to bring democracy back into the internal operations of the Congress, could take many months before it escalates into a force. But escalate it will. And for the cynics who accept that there has been a substantive impact but it will not convert to votes, here is the alternative  if the Congress is to avoid being bullied by the allies who have served themselves and betrayed coalition politics, the party should sit in Opposition, get rid of the dead weight, allow the base to rebuild, and win the next round, following a messy central coalition of all the regional satraps fighting for power.

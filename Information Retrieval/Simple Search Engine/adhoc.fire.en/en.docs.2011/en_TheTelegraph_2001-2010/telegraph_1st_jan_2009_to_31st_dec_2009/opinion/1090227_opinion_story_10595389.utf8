	More than a million                  
	Sir  A.R. Rahmans Oscar win has opened up a new dimension for Indian music (Mere paas ma hai and Om echo in Kodak theatre, Feb 24). His achievements deserve more than an Oscar. It is a pity though that acknowledgment of his talent came so late. He has been an outstanding composer for the last one decade.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Iravati Sen, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  The 81st annual Academy Awards will remain etched in the Indian memory for years to come. This is not because a film based on India swept the Oscars, but because the world witnessed so many talents from India. A.R. Rahman has made the world sit up and take note of popular Hindi film music. That he bagged the Oscar for the composition of Jai Ho, which is in Hindi, is testimony to the global acceptance of Indias film music. Just like the protagonist in Slumdog Millionaire, Rahman too had to overcome numerous odds in his life before he achieved success.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Barun Kumar Mahapatro, Berhampur

                
	Sir  Slumdog Millionaire deserves all the Oscars it has won. I have nothing against the film, but international acclaim means that pictures of Mumbais slums are being splashed everywhere. For an Indian, this becomes distasteful after a while. Yes, there are slums all over India , but I have a feeling that the West is trying to rub salt on India s wounds. It still likes to see India as impoverished and unhygienic, or at best, as a place of curries and call centres. Indians may be joyful after the Oscar win, but let us not forget the negative publicity the film has created for the entire country.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Sumon Kar, London 

      
	Sir  The success of Slumdog Millionaire and Smile Pinky at the Oscars shows that it is not merely a glamorous cast or the millions spent on making a movie that appeals to the international jury. It is the inner content of a film that matters. If the film is made in English, all the better. Subtitles are not enough for the proper understanding of a film. Otherwise, Pather Panchali too would have won an Oscar.           
	Yours faithfully,       
K.B. Goswami, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  I am surprised to note that Slumdog Millionaire has not been received well at home. There have been objections to the inclusion of the word, slumdog, in its title, and the sight of the filthy toilets has not made things better. But Pather Panchali and Asani Sanket, too, portrayed poverty, and yet Satyajit Ray was never criticized for showing it.           
	The criticism directed at Slumdog Millionaire in India shows the narrow mentality of film critics. I am sure no one would have raised an eyebrow had the film been made by a director from Mumbai or from Tollygunge.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Kasturi Paul, Jamshedpur 

                
	Sir  It is rather amusing to see the hype generated by Slumdog Millionaire, which won eight out of a possible 10 Oscars. Suddenly, national pride has been awakened and Indians feel a deep sense of joy. Politicians creep out of the woodwork and start promising apartments to the children who have acted in the film and talk of Dharavis uplift. The international crew of the film too talk of how fascinating their stay in India has been.           
	Why do we forget that Salaam Bombay was just as worthy of an Oscar? It did not get the award because it was filmed by an Indian director and made in Hindi.           
	We also forget that A.R. Rahman has composed far more musical and meaningful songs than the one for which he got an Oscar. When we soak in the sight of slum kids in tuxedos and gorgeous dresses, we forget that there will be no Henry Higgins waiting to emancipate them from suffering in India .           
	I have noticed that the same national pride is awakened when NRIs excel in games like cricket and tennis or win awards for their literary excellence. Yet, NRIs invariably fumble when asked to name the Indian president or prime minister. I think we ought to be a little more conservative in our assessment of films and of genius.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
John Ambat, Calcutta

                
	Sir  After Slumdog Millionaire, India is being celebrated not only for its music and lyrics, but also for its technical excellence. That is something new and wonderful. All those who have done India proud should be congratulated. Films that have a strong emotional component and have slums as their subject do not usually get recognition. This years Oscars has been an exception to that rule. I regret that films off the beaten track are still neglected in awards ceremonies for commercial cinema in India.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Mahesh Kapasi, New Delhi 

                
	Sir  The eight Oscars for Slumdog Millionaire are a great achievement, considering the fact that it was up against big-budget Hollywood productions. However, the icing on the cake was the Oscars won by A.R. Rahman and Resul Pookutty. We have known Rahmans genius for a long time, but the Oscars show, as the Golden Globe and Bafta awards also did, that the world has finally acknowledged his talents. One hopes a purely Indian film too will win the Oscars some day.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Ambar Mallick, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Although Slumdog Millionaire was produced and directed by foreigners, the story, the score and sound were Indian. Days ago, it was Viswanathan Anand, and now, A.R. Rahman and Resul Pookutty have done India proud. They deserve to be honoured by the president.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
R. Sekar, Visakhapatnam

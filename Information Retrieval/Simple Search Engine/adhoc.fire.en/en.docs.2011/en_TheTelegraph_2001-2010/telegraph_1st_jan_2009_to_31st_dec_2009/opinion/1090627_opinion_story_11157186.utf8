	What a wonderful world                  
	Sir  I wish to thank the ITC and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation for the 500-room hotel coming up on the Bypass (Hotel to scale new heights, June 23). Now I dont care if we dont have power or water for 3-4 hours a day. I wont worry that I may fall and break my neck on the broken pavements, which are littered with construction material from nearby building sites. I wont complain if I die of pollution before this wonderful hotel is completed. At least, Calcuttans will have a super deluxe property for which we feel honoured.           
	Yours faithfully,        Iti Misra, Calcutta
        
	Dress by choice          
	Sir  In the editorial, Veiled Meanings (June 25), the effort to portray the wearing of burqa as a choice for a woman is misplaced. The burqa is a sign of oppression of women by religious leaders. But it is more a sign of male domination than of religious oppression. The ban on the burqa is not the abolition of choice but the restoration of the right to choose any attire.           
	The American president, Barack Obama, is right in saying that no one should be told what to wear. But his statement should not be taken to mean that the States ban on the burqa is inappropriate. State intervention is necessary to establish the right to choose. The fact that such an action may distance it from a particular section of the community should not deter it.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Tista Ghatak, Durgapur 

                
	Sir  The debate over girls wearing jeans in colleges raises important questions as to why dress codes are applicable to women only (UP scraps jeans ban in girls colleges, June 24). If men are uncomfortable with womens apparel, it is their problem. Why should women suffer on that account? Ones dress is ones personal choice.           
	A college-going girl is mature enough to decide what she should wear. If guidelines are needed at all, parents will set them.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
M. Kapasi, New Delhi

                
	Sir  It is extremely unfortunate that when India has so many areas that need immediate attention, there is so much hullabaloo over what girls should wear in colleges. Certain persons in authority believe that if a girl dresses provocatively, she is to be blamed for any untoward incident that may occur. That reveals their own attitude. Surely, the primary concerns of people in power should be issues such as education and health rather than womens dresses.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Nivedita Basu, Kalyani

                          
	Food hazard          
	Sir  Based on the data collected by Canadian researchers, G.S. Mudur, in his article, Fast food joint near your home? Youll get fatter (June 18), demonstrated that a large number of fast-food outlets in ones neighbourhood increases the risk of obesity. According to the research, there is 28 per cent difference in the prevalence of obesity within 800 metres in neighbourhoods where the number of fast food outlets was higher than the number of grocers or supermarkets selling fruits, vegetables or uncooked food. An Indian public health specialist said that the findings would be relevant to India. According to a survey report of the ministry of women and child development, Indian children are suffering from obesity because of their growing preference for fast food. Metropolitan cities like Calcutta, Mumbai, Delhi and Bangalore have a huge number of junk food vendors and may even have more than one fast-food outlet within a zone of 800 metres. Such eateries have a pernicious effect on the people, especially on children.                    
	Yours faithfully,

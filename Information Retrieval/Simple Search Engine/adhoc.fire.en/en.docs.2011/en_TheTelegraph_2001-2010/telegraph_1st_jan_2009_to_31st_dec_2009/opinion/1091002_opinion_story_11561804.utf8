The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Spin out of control 
                                                                                                                 SPIN OUT OF CONTROL                                   BONA FIDE - MALVIKA SINGH                              
	The dangerous, immature and contradictory foreign policy of Pakistan has begun to unravel in a terrifying manner. It spells trouble for the region, and is manifest in the form of unprecedented terror and unfathomable lies. Much like a rogue state, nothing it says can be trusted. Each day produces yet another chapter of reckless games played with nuclear toys, condoned till very recently by America, until the superpower realized that it had created a monster, allowed it to grow and assume menacing proportions.         
	The resultant horror is now beginning to threaten democratic processes across the region and the world. The United States of America needs to make a clean break from supporting its ally under the present terms, and it will have to dismantle the dangerous nexus that has developed over the last decades. The repercussions of climate change could be a cakewalk compared to the extent of nuclear proliferation that the US has not been able to check or control.        
	Spinning out of control, this fast-changing truth will affect the entire world, and not merely Asia and South Asia. China has been striving for political supremacy in the region by providing economic assistance and building infrastructure such as roads, ports and suchlike for the poorer Saarc nations. This is something that India should have taken a lead in. To put it in a simple manner, the mandarins in South Block continued to play Big Brother, and succeeded in alienating Indias neighbours.         
	India now finds itself in the unhappy situation of being a recent partner of the US, something that has angered our neighbours who, in retaliation, have silently aligned themselves with China. Surrounded on all sides, sharing our borders with nations that do not trust us completely, we will need to undertake enlightened and transparent measures to heal raw bruises.                 
	Broken faith        
	Many questions pop up. Will the US restructure its position and politics in Asia and in South Asia? Will the Indo-US partnership antagonize Asia and South Asia against India? Has the faith been broken or is it damaged? Are there any fresh strategies? With China and India being the two emerging economic powers, is the US feeling insecure about its future? Will it therefore continue to play one nation against the other? Or will these nations unite and create an inclusive blueprint to alleviate poverty?         
	Internally, lawlessness continues unabated and in some instances with the state governments approval. The Uttar Pradesh government defied a Supreme Court order to stop building memorials and statues. The people watched even as nothing was done to stop the violation of a court order. There was even some talk that if any action were to be taken against the concerned chief minister, it might make a hero of her. Hence, it would be better not to take such a risk. A much smaller, and weaker, response was that corrective action has to be taken to honour the order of the highest court of the land. Are we then allowing anarchy and corruption to replace governance and integrity?        
	As world leaders debate climate change and the destruction that has led to the dire reality, we in India want to ruin the few remaining tracts of forest land in a desperate bid to fast-track illegal projects. Whether it is mining, or the felling of trees to build a highway, the story remains the same. Are we just posturing on international fora or do we really mean business? Are we playing a game of contradictions that creates huge openings for corruption? Does our management of politics and elections depend on raising resources for numerous individuals so that they can make it to the higher echelons of power through illegal and unwarranted means? We need a radical change in the collective mindset if we are to think of solutions that can protect our future.

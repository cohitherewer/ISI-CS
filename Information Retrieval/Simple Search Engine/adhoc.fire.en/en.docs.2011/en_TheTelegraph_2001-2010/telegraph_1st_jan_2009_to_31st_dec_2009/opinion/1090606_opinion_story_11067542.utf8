                                                                                                                 REMEMBERING THE NIGHTINGALE                                  This above all - Khushwant Singh                          Among friends                                        
	Among the treasured memories of my life is hearing Lata Mangeshkar record Gurbani in a studio. It was over 30 years ago in Bombay. Surinder Singh (one of the Singh Bandhus), who was there as an income tax officer, asked me if I would like to be present. I jumped at the invitation. I arrived well before time. A one-word introduction with an exchange of namastes, then they got down to work. She went over the hymn written for her in Devnagari. Surinder hummed it in tune; she accompanied him. She nodded her head to indicate she was ready, and went to the studio where the orchestra awaited her. After crooning softly to herself, she gave the signal. The orchestra played, she sang the hymn. It was all over in an hour. She refused to accept the fee; it was her tribute to the Gurus. Another exchange of namastes and she was gone.        
	Some years later, I ran into her in the bookstore of Hotel Taj on Mansingh Road. She was browsing through a shelf of books. I greeted her. She acknowledged my greeting by naming me. I was flattered she remembered my name. She didnt buy any books but stayed in the shop instead of going into the reception lounge to avoid people accosting her. She has always been a shy person. Her escort, Raj Singh of Dungarpur, arrived and they went out for dinner.        
	Thereafter I only saw her from a distance but made it a point to hear her voice on the radio or the record player. Once it was in Londons Albert Hall. It was packed with Indians, Bangladeshis and Pakistanis. She sang Saavan ka mahina, pavan kare sore. The crowd clapped to keep time with the song. It was a thrilling experience when I heard her sing Ai mere vatan ke logon zara aankh mein bhar lo paani after the Chinese had given us a thrashing in 1962. It brought tears to my eyes. I heard her sing Allama Izbals qawali, Kabhi ai haqeeqat-e-muntazar nazar aa libaas-e-majaaz mein, over and over again. It is one of the best qawalis I have heard. My admiration for her went to the extent of making a special pilgrimage to the temple in Mangesh in Goa from where this unusually gifted family comes. I rejoiced over the honours heaped on Lata: Padma Bhushan, Padma Vibhushan and Bharat Ratna.        
	Her life has been recorded in a beautifully produced book, Lata Mangeshkar in her own voice: Conversations with Nasreen Munni Kabir. It is a priceless collectors item with pictures of her from childhood to the present day with the innumerable celebrities who came into her life. I have only two reservations. The compilers have not done justice to her sister, Asha Bhonsle. If there is any singer who deserved as much acclaim as Lata got, including the Bharat Ratna, it is Asha Bhonsle. She has been fobbed off with a few photographs without any mention of her matching talent.         
	The second omission is Raj Singh of Dungarpur, one time on the board of selectors of the Indian Cricket Eleven, who has been Latas companion for many years and is responsible for her abiding interest in the game.                
	Poetic revolution                
	The Urdu poet, Josh Malihabadi, was held in high esteem by Jawaharlal Nehru largely because he wrote a lot of fiery, patriotic verse and came to be known as Shair-e-Inqilab  poet of the revolution.        
	Shabbir Wasan Khan Josh (1898-1982) was born in Malihabad, Uttar Pradesh, of Afridi Pathan heritage. For a while, he compiled songs for Hindi films and edited Aaj Kal Kalaam. However, in 1956, without telling anyone, he migrated to Pakistan  probably to find suitable matches for his daughters. Panditji was very disappointed.        
	Josh did not flourish in Pakistan; he felt homesick for India. A story goes that in the later years of his life he started taking lessons in Punjabi. When questioned why, he replied: I know when I die, I will go to hell. I am told Punjabi is the national language of hell. He died in Rawalpindi in 1982.        
	An incident little known to Joshs admirers took place in Delhi. At the time he was without a job or any other income. He was famished and went to the United Coffee House for a meal. Having had his fill, when the bearer brought him the bill, he said, I have no money. I am a shair (poet), and tried to walk out. The manager stopped him and asked him to leave his sherwani as token of payment. As they were arguing, Lala Kishenlal Kalra, proprietor of the Coffee House came in and Josh introduced himself. Lalaji gave him back his sherwani and took him to his home to be his guest as long as he liked. It became Joshs home in Delhi for almost nine years.         
	Every December, Kishenlal organized a mushaira. Among the poets who came were Firaq, Sahir Ludhianvi, Kaifi Azmi, and Mahinder Singh Bedi. Panditji made it a point to be present. Kishenlal Kalras hospitality was generous: premium scotch, shami kababs were followed by a banquet. Kishenlal died in June 2009, leaving his estate, including the Rajdoot Hotel, to his sons. The photograph reproduced here was taken out of his album by his son Prem Mohan Kalra. It shows Josh with Nehru next to him, along with members of Kishenlals family.                
	Small town, big numbers                
	Shardagram, a small village in Gujarat, can claim to be the most attractive town in India; look at its postal index number  362235.

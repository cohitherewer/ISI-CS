	Communist leaders are very unlike old soldiers  they would rather die than fade away. The top post in a communist party is, therefore, a lifetime appointment, which can be cut short only by a coup, death or an assassination. That is how it was for Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin, Ho Chi Minh, Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping and Indias very own E.M.S. Namboodiripad or Harkishen Singh Surjeet. If the Communist Party of India (Marxist) is now thinking of fixed terms for its leaders other than the general secretary, its reasons seem to be other than a newfound love of organizational democracy. The CPI(M), which was once pro-Beijing as opposed to the pro-Moscow Communist Party of India, obviously did not take the hint from the Chinese communists. The Communist Party of China moved to fixed two-year terms for its general secretaries at the end of the Deng era. The CPI(M)s late discovery of the virtue of regular changes in leadership suggests that it is a half-hearted attempt to reinvent itself.        
	The CPI(M) desperately needs to redefine its identity and political approach. The setback it suffered in the May elections to the Lok Sabha shows how ineffective its old politics has become. But it is still incapable of doing some simple things that a democratic party would have done in similar circumstances. Even the leaders of the so-called bourgeois parties routinely offer to quit in the face of an electoral setback. This is in the best tradition of accountability in public life. But Prakash Karat, the CPI(M)s general secretary, has no faith in such liberal bourgeois traditions. It is thus no surprise that the fixed term that the party is considering for its leaders at different levels does not apply to the general secretary. The CPI(M) has opted for parliamentary democracy rather than armed revolution. Democratic politics demands that the partys top leaders also face the test of popular mandates. But then, what is a communist party without its caucuses?

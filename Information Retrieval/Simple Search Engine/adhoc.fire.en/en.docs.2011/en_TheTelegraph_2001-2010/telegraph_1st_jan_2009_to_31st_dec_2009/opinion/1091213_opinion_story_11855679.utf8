	 This time, it was the turn of the Bengal Congress to organize a chintan shivir, and this is what Adhir Chowdhury, a man not exactly known to be enamoured of Mamata Banerjee, came up with. Pranab Mukherjee, Chowdhury argued, should be projected as Bengals chief minister if there were to be a change of guard in the state after 2011. Some state leaders think that such a move will help the Congress kill two birds with one stone. First, Mukherjees elevation will mean that the Congress will have at the helm a leader who will be able to match Jyoti Basus political and intellectual stature. Second, it will also enable the party to clip didis wings as few consider her to be a patch on this veteran leader. What Chowdhury and his band of wise men forgot to mention is that Mukherjees removal from the centre stage will also help a few party leaders kill a third bird. After all, some Congressmen, living under Mukherjees long shadow, are known to have been afflicted by a condition known as Pranabphobia.                
	 David has won his battle against Goliath, and it is now time to reward him for his feat. Raj Babbar did the unthinkable recently by winning his electoral battle against Mulayam Singh Yadavs daughter-in-law, Dimple. Soon after Babbars triumph, the Congressmen busied themselves in thinking how to honour the winner. Before Babbar was asked to participate in the battle for Ferozabad, even the most optimistic Congressman was not too keen to place a wager on him. Babbar, everyone thought, would bite the dust, as he had done earlier in Fatehpur Sikri. He was promised a seat in the Upper House if he were to lose, and a cabinet berth if he won. But now, it seems that none other than Rahul Gandhi wants Babbar to take over the mantle of the state UPCC chief from the controversial Rita Bahuguna Joshi. In Congress circles, Babbar is seen as someone who is young (given the average age of senior Congressmen), free of caste baggage and possessing considerable glamour quotient. These qualities, Rahul Gandhi perhaps thinks, are just the right skills required for the job at hand. As for Babbar, unlike his reel career, things seem to be moving in the right direction in real life.                            
	 The former prime minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, was known to skip social functions unless they were held close to his official residence. He did not want to inconvenience the aam admi on the road who would have to stop to let the PMs cavalcade pass. Some other leaders have also had to sacrifice the pleasures of a normal life. Take, for instance, an important member of Indias First Family. A health freak, he has had to restrict his morning jog at Delhis Lodhi Gardens to only a few days in a month. The reason? The special protection group insists on placing sleuths in plain clothes at every turn in the park, forcing other joggers to stop in their tracks and stare at their VVIP guest.                            
	 The Congress headquarters, we are told, will soon have a new address. It is all set to move out from its current location at 24 Akbar Road to a spanking new location on Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Marg. The change in address has been necessary ever since the apex court passed an order that all political parties would have to vacate the bungalows in Lutyens Zone. Some years ago, the Congress had built another swanky building to house its HQ, but it was later used to accommodate the offices of Rajiv Gandhi Foundation. But the change in location has brought with it some peculiar problems. Some partymen, who never tire of tom-toming the Congresss secular credentials, are reportedly unhappy about being located on a road named after an iconic figure in the saffron camp. But then, after thinking hard, they came up with a clever idea. Apparently, it has been decided that the new building will have a rear entrance from Kotla Road. That way, Congressmen visiting the HQ would not have to set foot on enemy territory.                            
	 Back to the mercurial Pranabda. After giving Yechury and Karat a piece of his mind, he took on Basudeb Acharya recently. While replying to Acharyas query on disinvestment, Mukherjee was heard thanking the almighty that the Congress had not followed the Lefts policies. Otherwise, it would have found itself in a soup as well, he stated. Is this then a sign that the Left and the Right will never meet again?

	 After the depressing reports of netas leading luxurious lives in defiance of the austerity directive, here is a little something that is in different taste. Ahmad Patel took his family to perform haj recently, but in keeping with the norms, he chose not to take any benefits from the government. Patel paid for the trip from his own pocket, and preferred to stay in a modest guesthouse, unlike the other members of a government delegation who were put up in five-star accommodation by the Saudi government. Some say that Patels unassuming ways, as well as his close ties with the Congress president, renew hope in the adage that the meek shall inherit the earth.

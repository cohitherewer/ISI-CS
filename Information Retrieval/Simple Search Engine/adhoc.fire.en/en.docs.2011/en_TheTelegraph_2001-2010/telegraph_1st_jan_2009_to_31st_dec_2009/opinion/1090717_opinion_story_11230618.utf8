	Arzee The Dwarf By Chandrahas Choudhury, HarperCollins, Rs 325        
	His name is Arzee, which in Arabic means plea or petition. Like everything else, this name also has a history, not too difficult to guess. When Arzee was born his parents felt that their petition to god was at last answered  this is how Arzee explains the genesis of his name. Now Arzee has grown up  but, unfortunately, not as much as he should have. Merely two feet  two nagging feet  separate him from what could have been a decent, dignified, normal life. He does not have a surname; people call him Arzee the Dwarf.        
	Arzee is the protagonist of Chandrahas Choudhurys novel. The novel presents his point of view, and because Arzee always has to look up to the people around him, it is a bottom-up view of the world. The world is the bustling city of Bombay (not called Mumbai for some reason),with its gambling dens, film-fare and congested neighbourhoods. When the novel opens, multinationals have long burst into the scene and they call the shots in the globalized economy. Arzee, professionally a projectionist at a theatre called Noor, belongs to this world.         
	But he is not happy with just belonging; he wants to make his presence felt. He has a big heart trapped in a small body. As if to make up for his physical deficit, his dreams have become extra large. The world was on credit when dealing with him, he believes, there was plenty it had to pay back. Daring to love Monique, a Christian girl much taller than him, is just one of his ways of demanding back his arrears from this world. But his efforts in this direction suffer a setback when Arzee gets bullied by Moniques brutal father. Is this then the end of the road for Arzee? But how can that be?        
	Meanwhile, Arzee has other difficulties to wrestle with. Noor is under the threat of being closed down. Desperate for money, Arzee has to assume bottlehood, that is, he has to roam the city streets in a lime-green bottle suit, campaigning for Limzee drinks, which is about to launch a smaller bottle in the market. Arzee is defenceless against the commodification of his dwarfhood. And to cap it all, he has the mortifying revelation that he is only an adopted son of his parents. At this point in the novel, rattled by a host of spurious and putative identities thrust upon him by the world, Arzee realizes that his life was to be a journey, and that there was no home for him anywhere except in the hut of his own crooked self.        
	Arzee is always already caught in a cleft stick. He is ill-at-ease with the jesting world and also with his stunted body, which has made him into a joke. He wages war on both fronts, and wants to win on both. He is not afraid to hit back at his powerful tormentors, and turns his height into an advantage by looking down upon the world around him from the top of a high wall or from a higher storey of the theatre. These are two of his many ways of asserting the self. The trope of height has been used variously in the novel to represent widely divergent views of modern urban life. Looked upon as a joke himself, Arzee wants to turn the joke back on the world, and to reinstate his body in the position of glory it so richly deserves.        
	Choudhurys narrative efficiently captures the conflict between Arzees self and the surrounding world, which assigns him multiple identities with the ignominious motif of dwarfhood stringing them together. But Choudhury fails to explore the great scope of variations within his favoured narrative structure that would have fleshed out Arzees specific egoistic discourse.

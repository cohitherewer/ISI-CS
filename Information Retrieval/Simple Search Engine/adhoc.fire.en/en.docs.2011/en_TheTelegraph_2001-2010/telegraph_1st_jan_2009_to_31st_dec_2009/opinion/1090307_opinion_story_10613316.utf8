The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Sunday morning treat
                                                                                                                 SUNDAY MORNING TREAT                                  MUSIC: Nilaksha Gupta                                                   
	Exceptional performances by Debojyoti Bose on sarod (picture) and Partho Sarathi Desikan (khayal) made Kajalrekha Musical Foundations 8th annual music concert at Madhusudan Mancha, on February 22, a Sunday morning treat. The foundation itself is exceptional. It was instituted by the tabla ace, Subhankar Banerjee, to perpetuate the memory of his mother, Kajalrekha, who, despite having lost use of her legs from the age of three, became a singer and composer of repute and nurtured her son to glory. The foundation grants annual scholarships to aspiring tabla-players, and these were given to Abhijit Kastha and Pritam Das at the outset. The two were later featured in a tabla trio with Kuntal Das. The opening item was Saraswati bandana by students of Naad, with six-year-old Archik Banerjee on the tabla.        
	Partho Sarathi Desikan, a pupil of Ajoy Chakrabarty, sang khayals in Todi in a rich and powerful voice that delivered with full-blooded gusto figures and nuances originating from Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan and Ustad Munawar Ali Khan. These, moreover, retained much of the original flavour. The pancham (major 5th), a tricky element in Todi, was expertly integrated into the sustained movements of the vilambit khayal based on a Patiala composition, and this was continued in the slow medium sargams and faster rhythmic sargams in its second half. The sargam and aakar taans of the drut teental khayal, based on a classic composition of Taanras Khan, were powerfully delivered and expertly developed. There were equally good taans and sargams in the drut ektal tarana. Characteristically solid and powerful tabla accompaniment by Samar Saha heightened the warm ambience of the recital.        
	Debojyoti Bose, senior pupil of Ustad Amjad Ali Khan, is perhaps the best conservator of the ustads style. His alap in Shuddh Sarang was tuneful and well-structured, and very much embodied the ustads approach. Had you shut your eyes, it would have seemed that it was the ustad who was playing. This effect permeated not only the jod and jhala but the entire recital as well. The phrasing of the rhythmic patterns and gamak-added ekhara taans in the jhaptal gatkari and both the high and low stroke density taan-toda cemented the effect. So did the two-octave khayal-style ekhara taans in the drut teental gatkari and bolkari, as well as the clear and melodious fast jhala in the ati drut teental gatkari. Equally good was the taan development in the final drut teental gatkari in the tricky raga, Desi Todi (ni Sa, Pa Dha, Ma Pa, Re ga, Sa Re, ni Sa). Sandip Ghosh played a steady theka even at express tempo and unleashed explosive tabla breaks. His impressive tabla playing was very much integral to the success of the recital.

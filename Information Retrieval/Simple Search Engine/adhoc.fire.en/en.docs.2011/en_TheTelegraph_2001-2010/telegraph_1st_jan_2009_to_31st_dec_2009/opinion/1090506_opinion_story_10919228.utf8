	Steady start                  
	Sir  The editorial, Promises to keep, together with K.P. Nayars A hundred days (April 29) made for an instructive commentary on Barack Obamas first 100 days as the president of the United States of America. It would be presumptuous, if not foolhardy, to expect miracles of Obama within such a limited span of time. Yet, it would be worthwhile to examine whether Obama has been able to keep his pre-election pledges. The recession and the endless conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan have compounded to make Obamas inheritance difficult. Considering the present circumstances, it would be unfair not to take cognizance of the legislations already initiated by him to extend the healthcare system as well as to preserve the wilderness in the US. His opponents, the Republicans, tried their best to block the passage of the bills, but Obama had his way, thanks to his determination and to the support he received from his fellow Democrats. His policy on the torturing of suspects and his announcement to close down Guantnamo Bay reflect his willingness to erase the stigma associated with Americas treatment of detainees. The police in Washington too are showing remarkable restraint against protesters and demonstrators, something that was rarely seen during the Bush regime. The American presidents vision of a nuclear-free world is a positive sign. Moreover, Obamas preference for maintaining a low profile in his personal life also indicates that the president is a man with a different mindset.          
	On the foreign policy front, Obama still seems to be grappling with the seemingly intractable Afghan problem. The developments in Pakistan are far from encouraging. Fighting the Taliban without taking the people of Pakistan into confidence either by persuasion or by coercion will turn out to be a tough task as well. India will watch with interest, after its engagement with the process of electing a new dispensation is over, how Obama goes about handling the Indo-Pak imbroglio to bring in stability in the subcontinent. If anything, Obama has shown in his first 100 days in power that he has it in him to deal with almost a hundred separate issues of critical importance.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Barack Obama has completed his first 100 days in office, and within this short period of time, he has brought about major changes such as legislations to combat discrimination against women at the workplace and promote environmental protection. He has also initiated a dialogue of peace with other nations. Obamas middle-class upbringing undoubtedly helps him to identify and understand the aspirations and disappointments of the common man. This has been reflected in his endorsement of the Lilly Ledbetter Act and the State Childrens Health Insurance Programme. Corporate giants, in their pursuit of profit, often ignore issues relating to equality in wages and other benefits at work. The higher management draws hefty pay packages but employees at the lower rung have to do with less.           
	But under Obama, things are set to change and this is heartening. Obama has also rolled out bailout packages to companies that have been affected by the recession and, at the same time, closely monitored their spending to ensure a judicious expenditure of the tax-payers money. When Obama assumed office, the US economy was in a shambles. But as he had promised in his presidential address, he has initiated measures to combat recession so that Americas economic security can be restored. That he is a doer is evident from his dealings in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iraq.           
	Moreover, the fact that Obama even stops at traffic lights while running personal errands signifies that he has not forgotten his roots even after becoming the most powerful man on earth. Obamas conduct is in stark contrast to that of Indias leaders who consider themselves superior to the masses, although they promise the world to the aam aadmi during elections. It is evident that in Obama, the Americans have found a true peoples president.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  Elections are on and, expectedly, every political party is trying hard to sway the voters with the promise of a better future. But no party seems to have given any thought to the sections of the youth who are disinclined to vote. Only a handful of young people are actively involved or interested in politics, but no party seems to be interested in addressing the problems of those who are not. Reservations are destroying the future of educated and ambitious students who find politics unappealing. Consequently, they seldom show up at the booths on election day. The political parties should realize their plight. Along with their electoral promise of providing electricity and reducing costs, the parties should also take steps to solve the problems of young voters, and make them aware of their responsibilities as democratic citizens.          
	Yours faithfully,

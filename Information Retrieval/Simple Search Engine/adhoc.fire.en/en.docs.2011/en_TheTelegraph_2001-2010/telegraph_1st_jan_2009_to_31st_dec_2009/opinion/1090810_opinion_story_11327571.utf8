	In Successful Negotiation (1994), I had discussed the use of power and perceptions of power in negotiations. The weaker party, by its confident behaviour, skilled arguments, and underhand methods, successfully influences the stronger party into thinking that the weaker one is more powerful than is the case. The India-Pakistan negotiations over past decades show how successful Pakistan has been while India has been unable to use its stronger economy, powerful military, democracy and good world-image to get its views across.        
	The Kashmir dispute, since 1946, has seen Pakistan lose three wars with India and a good part of its territory to Bangladesh, use military supported incursions into India by terrorists, become a surrogate for China against India, and use well-crafted propaganda to give India a bad name. This is despite an economy that has depended on American financial aid for decades, a feudal society, increasing Islamic fundamentalism, high illiteracy and a military-dominated society.         
	Pakistan is imbued with a core sense of victimhood, measured through the prism of India. It has developed the fine art of heightening perceptions of its power beyond reality and excellent negotiation and communication skills in diplomacy and at the international political level.        
	India, after its economic growth since 1991, has less of a Pakistan-phobia. Though it does not need to be so, India is submissive to the American governments pressures. Since the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the post-9/11 hostility to the Taliban, the United States of America has been considerate towards Pakistans concerns about India, primarily about Kashmir. Indian governments are nave in policy-making, lack holistic thinking and are poor in coordinated implementation. There is incredulity in India that Indian intelligence agencies can mount covert operations in Pakistan as they are accused of doing in Baluchistan. We have a self-righteousness, an inability to agree on national policy and a singular faith in words without looking for underlying falsehoods.              
	In 1947, after a victory in war, India went to the United Nations and accepted a damaging resolution for a plebiscite, giving Pakistan a handle against it for the next 60 years. Since then, after each successful war with Pakistan, we have repeatedly been gentlemen and not demanded a final settlement.        
	The Tashkent talks between Lal Bahadur Shastri and Ayub Khan, after Pakistan lost to India in the battlefield, might not have resulted in lasting peace. Under Indira Gandhi, India defeated Pakistan, captured over 100,000 Pakistani solders and enabled the creation of Bangladesh. She trusted Zulfikar Ali Bhuttos word during the peace negotiations in Simla, agreed to release captive Pakistani soldiers, apparently on Bhuttos word that he would prepare Pakistani public opinion for a final settlement on Kashmir. Possibly, the line of control would formally be the international border. He boasted to his ministers in Pakistan that he had put one over Mrs Gandhi. He immediately initiated the development of a nuclear bomb by any means. Chinese help, theft and bribery by A.Q. Khan ensured that Pakistan had the bomb in a few years. Instead of an all-out war with India, Pakistan would aim to destabilize India by bleeding its economy, using non-state actors under the Inter-Services Intelligence to foment insurgency in Kashmir, support other insurgencies within India and destabilize the rupee by flooding India with counterfeit notes.        
	In 1961, when China was weak and grateful to India for recognizing Chinese sovereignty over Tibet, India was unwilling to recognize that the British-drawn border with China (and disputed by China) was faulty. China crushed an unprepared India in a humiliating defeat in the 1962 war. India had believed that Hindi-Chini were bhai bhai. For China, the border is still unsettled and now claims the whole of Arunachal. India has, over the years, mishandled its Kashmir policy by rigging the state elections in the 1980s to get a supportive government, pouring money but not ensuring its honest use so that it had little effect on peoples lives, and using force instead of political and economic reforms. Where there was little support for domestic militancy, our policies created a strong base of support for imported militants.        
	Atal Bihari Vajpayee invited Pervez Musharraf to Agra after India threw the Pakistan army out of Kargil. After consistently denying Pakistans role in Kargil, Musharraf used Agra to score publicity points. He now claims Kargil as a Pakistan victory that made India come for talks with Pakistan. In negotiations, Pakistan has always used words as weapons, not as expressions of commitment.        
	Vajpayee persisted with peace overtures, despite the Pakistan attack on Indias Parliament. Pakistan responded with continuing infiltrating terrorists into India, trained and financed by the Pakistan army. India had no persistent and coordinated publicity and diplomatic drive, no coordinated overt and covert acts to finesse Pakistan. At different times, Indias knee-jerk actions like army mobilization, stopping PIA flights over India, breaking off talks and resuming them even when Pakistan did not desist were initiated.        
	A victim appeals to bystanders for sympathy and support. He quietly retaliates by actions that he can deny taking. He will commit to anything if cornered, but will, at the same time, be planning on how to score over his opponent. He will try to transform his position of weakness into one of strength as Bhutto did by going after a nuclear bomb for Pakistan at any cost. Subsequent Pakistan administrations have continued by using their intelligence agency to direct militants to create mayhem in India. In such situations, the stronger party must have plans and actions to counter his weak opponent. India has failed woefully in doing so. Ronald Reagans plan to destroy the Soviet Union illustrates the response of a strong party to a weaker, but nuclear-armed, country. Reagan initiated a competitive arms race, while arming the Taliban to fight the Soviets in Afghanistan. Ultimately, this sapped the financial strength of the Soviets and led to their collapse.              
	With the US, India must have a clear laxmanrekha of national interest. India must discount the USs professed admiration for India as the worlds largest democracy. The Obama administration, like others before, is comfortable with authoritarian states, and needs Pakistan to fight the Taliban. India must always be suspicious of American words and look more at understanding core American interests. This requires that we do not become dependent on the US for sensitive supplies like nuclear plants and defence equipment. We must not become more subject to American control than we are by blandishments like a possible Security Council seat. India should rather buy sensitive technology and equipment from purely profit-seeking states like France, Israel or Spain that will sell anything for a price. Safeguarding national interest and our freedom of action are more important than fripperies like this or being regarded as having transformed its relationship with the US.              
	India needs to be more belligerent with Pakistan and not worry about the reaction of G-8 countries. We must constantly publicize the human rights violations by Pakistan in Baluchistan, the North-West Frontier Province and Sind. We must support the rebels there with money, equipment and training. We must deal directly with the Pakistan army and the ISI. We must stop the smuggling of essentials and luxuries to Pakistan. We must use every forum to attack Pakistans interests. Our focus in relation to Pakistan must be the closure of terrorist camps meant for infiltrating into India. Words from Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton must not force us into mere dialogue with Pakistan with no action against terrorists. We must neutralize Chinese support to Pakistan by trade, investment and a border settlement with China, even sacrificing territory over which we have doubtful claims. We must build economic strength and treat Pakistan as only one among countries for policy and actions.

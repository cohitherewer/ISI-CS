	UMRAO SINGH SHER-GIL: HIS MISERY AND HIS MANUSCRIPT (Photoink, Rs 3,500) is one of the most important books of photography to have come out in India in recent times. Indian art photography would have evolved, perhaps, along different lines if Umrao Singhs pioneering work had been shown earlier. Reproducing 141 images from an archive of more than 2,000 vintage prints, glass-plate negatives, film negatives and autochromes, this is a handsomely designed book, scrupulously annotated and with essays by Umrao Singhs grandson, the artist Vivan Sundaram, and by the art historian, Deepak Ananth.        
	Born in 1870 in the Punjab, Umrao Singh was a debonair, scholarly, melancholic and richly self-absorbed man  a landed aristocrat who modelled himself on Tolstoy, knew Sanskrit and Persian well, and was hounded by the British for his nationalist activism with the revolutionary Gaddar Party. This was undoubtedly an intriguing combination of qualities, and Umrao Singhs numerous self-portraits show how aware he was of his own multi-faceted attractiveness. Photography was integral to both the self-obsessed and the contemplative aspects of his life, as it was to his domestic life, lived in India, Hungary and France, with his second wife and their two talented and visually arresting daughters. This was his second marriage, and the book is strangely reticent about his first wife (who died in 1907) and the four children he had by her, given how fully the second family is represented and written about in it.        
	Top left is a vintage stereographic print of Umrao Singh reading to his second wife, Marie Antoinette Gottesmann-Baktay, after the birth of their daughter, Indira, in Budapest in 1914. Marie Antoinette wrote on the back of this print, My beloved good husband and myself in our Szilagyi Dezso Ter appartement. Photo was taken after sweet little Induskas birth in 1914 Apr. Marie Antoinette was a Hungarian opera singer and the travelling companion of the Princess Bamba, daughter of Maharaja Duleep Singh, when Umrao met her in India. She shot herself in 1948 after repeated earlier attempts to kill herself. On their right, Umrao Singhs daughters, Amrita and Indira, are sitting for their fathers 1931 experiment with double exposure in Paris. Next to them, at the top, is Umrao Singhs self-portrait made from a glass-plate negative after 15 days of fasting (Paris, 1930). Below this photograph, is a detail from a 1923 vintage print of Indira and Amrita, in Simla, with their clay busts made by the sculptor Pasquinelli, who is in the picture together with Marie Antoinette. At the centre, is a vintage print of Amrita, made in Simla in 1935, next to which, bottom left, is a self-portrait with a telescope, from a glass-plate negative made in Simla around 1942, a year after Amritas untimely death. Soon after, Umrao Singh began to lose his memory, to die at the age of 84 in Indiras Delhi home.

	Lions share                  
	Sir  A tale of two brothers (Aug 28), by Ashok Mitra, was enjoyable to read. There can be no argument about Mitras conclusion that monopoly will be gifted on a platter if one has friends in political quarters. Too many events in India are testimony to this fact. What needs to be probed is Mitras suggestion that this monopoly is linked to liberalization. In India, private monopolies had been woven into the system since Independence. The licensing system during the British raj had justified the creation of such monopolies. Otherwise, India would have at least had better cars than Ambassadors as a regular means of transport.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Ashok Mitra has blamed political connections as the root cause of monopoly. But Mitras article overlooks the critical role played by the product in question. For instance, oil is an important commodity. The Ambani brothers, along with their father, had the foresight to create a monopoly over this product. Their political connections may have helped, but the importance of oil as a product cannot be ignored in this context. Similar monopolies exist in the power sector today, with the Calcutta Electric Supply Corporation being the only private player in the city. Perfect competition, like the idea of a classless society, is merely a dream. But it is an important dream nonetheless. In a globalized world, it is not possible to set up a perfect economy, which discourages private monopolies. Even then, it is unfortunate that such monopolies are being encouraged in the name of sustainable competition.           
	Yours faithfully,         R. Subhranshu,Chandernagore, Hooghly     
	Sir  Ashok Mitras article displays a certain amount of navety about the creation of monopolies. Mitra states that Monopoly does not spring overnight.... In the final round, though, one of the entrepreneurs leaves the others behind, lagging rivals drop out, the one left in the field establishes a monopoly. Mitras contention does not apply to all markets or products. How many articles of everyday use are sold by companies that have an absolute monopoly in their respective markets? In fact, so far, big brands like Bata, Britannia or Maruti have not been able to eat up the small players and establish complete monopoly.           
	Mitra quotes Joan Robinson to present his strange analysis. However, raising the price does not necessarily ensure higher sales for all products. On the contrary, it may actually lower sales. By lowering the price, a company can achieve higher sales and earn a bigger profit. For example, prices of electronic goods have come down drastically over the years, but the companies manufacturing these products have not incurred losses. Mitra also mocks the animal spirit of entrepreneurs. Yet it is this animal spirit  and not the benevolence of the State  that provides essential commodities for consumers. It is the State that creates conditions for a monopoly. If monopoly is bad, government monopoly  characterized by corruption and poor services  is worse.

	Without a care          
	Sir  After the spate of recent road accidents in Calcutta, it was expected that the people will take extra precaution while commuting. But it is shocking to see how careless people still are about road safety. The bus accident at Maidan, which resulted in three passengers losing their arms, is now talk of the town (Racing bus rips off arms, Aug 26). But even after an accident like this, people are seen sitting with their elbows sticking out of the windows of buses. Calcuttans also continue to cross roads without paying any attention to traffic signals, desist from using footbridges, jump on or out of moving buses and talk on mobile phones while driving.          
	If the people themselves are not concerned about their own safety, who else can they blame for the high rate of road accidents? If everyone were to follow the basic rules while travelling, the number of accidents on Calcuttas roads will surely come down.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Calcutta remains at the mercy of bus drivers who have no regard for the lives of commuters. However, the ire against errant drivers should also be directed towards corrupt officials who manipulate the system and enable drivers to dodge the law. The commission system needs to be done away with immediately to stop buses from racing each other to get the maximum number of passengers. But the rot has gone so deep that even the new transport minister was unsure about doing away with this system, and could only say that he will look into the matter. Unless the people protest against such thoughtlessness, citizens will continue to be puppets in the hands of irresponsible drivers and administrators.          
	Yours faithfully,

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Release the Energies
                                                                                                                 RELEASE THE ENERGIES                                  BONA FIDE - MALVIKA SINGH                              
	There is so much to do for the government this time around, and over the next few years. Very fortuitously, some extremely competent and qualified ministers have been appointed in key ministries with a mandate to ensure corrective change, and to hasten the convoluted processes that have held back progress and development, and allowed for interminable delays leading to unimaginable corruption in virtually all spheres of activity. The newly instated men and women at the helm have the opportunity and the professional ability to lead their ministries out of the morass they have been lodged in for the last many decades, to bring in new and fresh ideas. They are empowered to dismantle the structures of patronage that led to unacceptable practices. Exciting challenges are crying to be taken on and executed with creative energy and vigour.        
	Education is a coveted portfolio for anyone who wants to become a chapter in Indias political history. It is one of the few essential infrastructure areas that affect all, and is particularly responsible for shaping the future mind of India in a competitive and globalizing world where individual nation -states are asserting themselves as they forge partnerships and alliances. To have lost our multi-dimensional and pluralistic intellectual, philosophic and indigenous scientific strengths to a compartmentalized and rigid framework of the little boxes made of ticky tacky owned by the Left, was hugely damaging for India and Bharat in civilizational terms. We are the finest example of plurality and diversity and to have boxed it all into an ideological framework was wrong. Energies need to be released and the mind freed from narrow judgmental constrictions.                 
	Dynamic areas        
	Old people should be given emeritus status, removed from executive positions, and a fresh young band of professionals made to lead the process of change and growth. Bureaucrats must be briefed to act without personal political bias and perform with integrity and honesty on behalf of their elected masters, working out the mechanisms and modalities to deliver on the electoral promises within the law. This will make democracy effective. A radical overhaul in the realm of education would be brought about by re-examining the system itself, the CBSE for instance, and by considering a complete change from this ridiculous, unimaginative and rote-oriented learning. We have created a whole generation of toppers in the humanities who are unread and, to that extent, uninformed beyond the kunji. Added to this, the information from television, more often than not presented with a sharp bias or worse, half-truths, has killed peoples intellect.         
	Information and broadcasting is the other dynamic area where change can be infused immediately. To make Doordarshan into a vibrant, contemporary and rocking space for Indians across the board is not a difficult task so long as there is an inspired will to deliver a new product. Again, the bureaucrats who were comfortable with mediocrity, who were allowed their lethargy by their bosses, who used the medium as yet another lucrative point of state patronage, need to be shaken up, compelled to deliver through regular and ruthless assessment of their products, much like how it happens in the private sector. To misuse public money is nothing short of an assault on the minds of the people of India who have centuries of invaluable knowledge in their gene pool.        
	Textiles and crafts need to be merged and given industry- status equivalent to commerce and industry. This is our IT strength  our traditional, indigenous information technology that goes far beyond computers and software. An enhancement of its stature by statute could begin the process of solving the crises of unemployment and migration to the cities.

	Who cares?                  
	Sir  The recent statement by the state health minister, Surjya Kanta Mishra, about the quality of service in government hospitals (Chief minister, heres what ails your government quot;, July 9), is so irresponsible as to be callous. His words do not speak much for his integrity. Such ministers as him have been the mainstay of the Left Front government for the last three decades. One is led to wonder whom they actually represent. Not the aam admi, surely.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Indraneel Chandra, 

      
	New Jersey, US                     
	Sir  The state health ministers vociferation in the assembly about the condition of government-run hospitals was shocking. You are saying patients are lying on the floor. There are two-three patients in one bed. Hospitals are getting overcrowded. From this, it is clear that patients are going to government hospitals because of the service they get. They get good service. Thats why they are going there, Surjya Kanta Mishra told the Opposition.           
	Mishras complacent statement proves his ignorance of the despicable condition of the state hospitals and healthcare units. It is true that private hospitals and nursing homes demand exorbitant charges in comparison to state hospitals. But the difference in the quality of treatment is striking. Only those who cannot afford better treatment are forced to go to government hospitals. Basic facilities, including food, are of the worst kind. Relatives of many patients have discovered at their expense that connection with trade union or political leaders is the only guarantee of better care in state hospitals.          
	Mishra cannot deny, if he is sincere, that a visit or stay in a state hospital is nothing short of horrifying because of the filthy atmosphere and the impolite and negligent staff. Most people who work in government hospitals are indifferent to the welfare of the patients. People who are compelled to take admission in state hospitals, especially in the free ward, become more ill and despondent in such an atmosphere. A number of state ministers and political leaders have reportedly been admitted to state hospitals. But have they ever ventured to check the state of other, ordinary patients?          
	Yours faithfully,

	Building block          
	Sir  The Calcutta High Court has allowed the construction of a resort in South Andaman in an area reserved for the Jarawa tribe (Resort threat to Jarawas, July 8 ). This is a threat to the natural environment and dignity of the Jarawas. The construction of the resort for the rich and the famous, to be built by Barefoot Resort, should be stopped. We cannot afford to destroy our multi-cultural heritage any further.          
	The managing director of Barefoot, Samit Sawhny, claimed that they dont propose to sell the Jarawa to promote tourism, surely not to evoke voyeuristic pleasure among the tourists. Good words, but if this is so, then what exactly are they doing in that obscure part of the archipelago? Sawhny seems to be denying exactly what they are planning to do  let celebrities from the West watch and offer gifts to the Jarawas and take pride in their philanthropy.           
	A resort in the middle of the Jarawas habitat would ruin their survival skills and push the tribe to extinction. By Sawhnys own admission, the site is 3.2 kilometres away from the reserve. Thus it is well within the 5 km-long buffer zone where no trade and tourism activities are allowed. But Barefoots lawyer, Anjali Nag, has claimed that the so-called buffer zone was a ploy to block the entry of certain companies into the Andamans. One wonders what stopped her from disclosing which organization, if any, has ever been allowed to build within the buffer zone by the local administration. Also, what stopped her from reporting any such irregularity to the courts?          
	Yours faithfully,       
Tapan Pal, Calcutta

                
	Parting shot          
	Sir  I live in Massachusetts, and visit Calcutta quite often. The citys traffic is notorious and the bus and auto-rickshaw drivers are very rough. Crossing the roads is dangerous, especially for senior citizens. Although people get killed on the roads almost by the day, accidents are eventually accepted by Calcuttans as a part of their daily lives.           
	The inefficiency of the transport minister is appalling. The chief minister is to blame too. Controlling traffic in Calcutta is certainly a daunting job and in order to do it efficiently, the city needs a well organized group consisting of traffic engineers and police officers. Cooperation of the vehicle owners and the various unions is also necessary. Once a working solution to the problem has been arrived at, it must be strictly implemented on an everyday basis. Otherwise, the streets of Calcutta will become increasingly dangerous for the common man.          
	Yours faithfully,

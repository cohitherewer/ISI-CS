                                                                                                               PICTURE THIS                                                              
	There may be moments when even the most earnest voter wishes he did not have to gaze upon the faces of the leaders of his preferred party at every turn, twist and jump of his daily life as elections near. He may not wish to be rude or aesthetically over-nice, but he runs a grave chance of feeling his inspiration ebb as he looks upon those faces too many times, distorted as they often are by their own passions or menacing determination, or by inconsiderate creases in the hoarding, or uncivilized bursts of biological frankness from birds. But this is a point of view political parties are yet to appreciate; they are far too convinced of the charismatic power of their leaders and candidates to ever doubt their visual charm. Besides, for a culture in love with images and icons  and one part of it with idols  pictures are part of the thought-process. That the same culture is yet to emerge fully from illiteracy merely adds to the need of matching symbols with faces as many times as possible.        
	So, having laughed for years at the southern culture of gigantic cut-outs of political leaders, West Bengal has not done too badly in that line this time. The enormous mug-shots and full-length images of party leaders are as threatening and visually intrusive as cut-outs. One turns away from one only to be overwhelmed by another. The less spiritually resilient or electorally passionate may begin to feel trapped. Confused as well. Because the same party that achieves creative splendour in the championing of industrialization in one part of the city, suddenly shifts premise and target in another part, reminding voters there that the Opposition was once with the alleged perpetrators of post-Godhra violence. It must be very intelligent to tickle some voters with class and some with religious community. This is not the time or place to look for consistency or decency.        
	But how do we know that decency is at last just a fading memory? What is really new? What shows us that the political culture of West Bengal, irrespective of party or alliance, has sunk to a level inconceivable before? The competition now is in the display of dead bodies. Pictures of bleeding, mutilated, pitiful bodies, visually shocking and deeply painful, are arranged like panels on flex hoardings, presumably to remind the electorate of the ruthless, violent inhumanity of the rival side.        
	But they need not have bothered. Every party that uses such hoardings as part of its election campaign announces to the world its own inhumanity. The display of pain, not only of those killed, but implicitly of their families, exposes a level of disrespect for human beings and an insensitiveness to the dead left vulnerable before the worlds gaze that are frightening. How is this better than the ruthless political killings? It makes us fear, not hope, for our future as we press the button.        
	The faces of leaders on the hoardings are no longer merely wearying, they are suddenly terrifying. They embody the reality that these people can use the innocent, unknowing, bleeding, burnt dead to win votes. How much more hideousness is West Bengal going to accept?       BHASWATI CHAKRAVORTY

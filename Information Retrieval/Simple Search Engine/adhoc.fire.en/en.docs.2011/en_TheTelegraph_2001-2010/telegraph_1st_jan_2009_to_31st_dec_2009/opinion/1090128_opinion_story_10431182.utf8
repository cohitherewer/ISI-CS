The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A State in Distress
                                                                                                                 A STATE IN DISTRESS                                  Sumanta Sen                              
	To what extent an individual can hold a state to ransom is being seen in Jharkhand. When Shibu Soren lost the by-election at Tamar earlier this month, it was thought that somebody else would become chief minister and the show would go on. He chose, after quite some time, Champai Soren as his successor but his allies, the Congress and the Rashtriya Janata Dal, did not favour his candidature. But as these parties did not have the required numbers, the obvious course of action was the imposition of presidents rule. But this did not come about immediately after Sorens defeat in the by-election. The Centre intervened only after it had given him the time to put up a ministry of his liking. This is an old Congress tactic and reminds one of Assam in the Eighties where even as the anti-foreigner agitation raged, the followers of Indira Gandhi kept propping up one ministry after another, none taken seriously by the people.        
	But why is Soren so important? Elections in Jharkhand, since its creation, have amply demonstrated that he and his Jharkhand Mukti Morcha do not really call the shots in the state, as the world had assumed during the long agitation for Jharkhands separation from Bihar. Now he has even lost a by-election, but the United Progressive Alliance still seemed intent on humouring him for a long time after his defeat. This must be because of the fact that the UPA does not have another tribal leader who enjoys even Sorens by-now-diminished stature. If he decides to part with the UPA, then taking over the Jharkhand government may well be just a cakewalk for the Bharatiya Janata Party.                
	Dark future        
	Soren knows this well. Hence, even during his brief stint in office, he kept badgering the Centre with demands to shift the headquarters of the Damodar Valley Corporation and Coal India from Calcutta to Ranchi, and to make the tribal areas of Bankura, Purulia and West Midnapore part of Jharkhand. His dream is to preside over a greater Jharkhand, although the ground reality has not allowed him to preside even over the existing Jharkhand. He should have been told at the outset where he stood, but perhaps that would have been too much to ask from the people who are clinging to his kurta tails for dear life.         
	The fact that there was prima facie evidence against him in the Chirudih massacre case, which led to his detention, should have continued to weigh heavily against him, his subsequent acquittal notwithstanding. But, unfortunately, realpolitik triumphed. So now its Soren gets what Soren wants, at least as long as the UPA is in power. The situation was similar in the case of Lalu Prasad, who officially still has not been cleared of the many charges of economic offence but remains well protected by the umbrella of the ruling coalition, or more precisely, of the Congress.        
	Meanwhile, poor Jharkhand continues to groan. The lives of the majority of the people in a state rich in minerals and forest resources, and with a strong potential for industrial development, still continue to be in tatters. Why? Because the political class has no time for them. The BJP ministry did nothing and ultimately ended up with Babulal Marandi and Arjun Munda fighting among themselves, the Madhu Koda ministry was not expected to do anything and it didnt, and now the Soren episode. Comparisons are said to be odious, but when discussing Jharkhand it is difficult not to be reminded of the much more stable condition in two other small states carved out of larger ones, namely Chhattisgarh and Uttarakhand. While a Raman Singh could romp home, Soren failed.        
	Another ministry may be cobbled up in Ranchi in the near future but given the players around, the prospects do not seem to be too bright for the state.

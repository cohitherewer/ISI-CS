The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Reliving the Nakba
                                                                                                                     RELIVING THE NAKBA                      - Israel passes off its every act of violence as self-defence        POSTSCRIPT -   GITHA HARIHARAN                                                              
	Theres one thing about the high-tech world we live in: its hard to pretend ignorance of what is happening to real people in real places. In the days to come, we are bound to hear and see more of what happened over the weeks Israel wreaked destruction on Gaza. But already there is more than enough evidence to tell us what has been done to ordinary citizens. Take, for instance, the images and eyewitness accounts on Al-Jazeera or The Electronic Intifada.        
	The pictures are hard to look at.        
	Theres the photo of a girls hand sticking out of the rubble that used to be her home in the Zeitoun neighbourhood of Gaza City. Perhaps her family too is buried under the rubble. Another picture, also of a home in Zeitoun, has no hint of bodies at all. Twenty-four members of this family were killed when an F-16 fighter jet dropped a bomb on their house. The only remains visible in the picture include a pillow, a belt, a childs schoolbag, and paper that the caption describes as pages of a torn copy of the Quran. These possessions are strewn about in the concrete and metal wreckage.         
	Survivors accounts describe what happened to them; what happened to their families and neighbours, their homes, their cattle, their land. Their schools, hospitals, their ministries.         
	These testimonies are painful to read.         
	Theres the account of the man who was killed while trying to recover a wounded person and a corpse. Theres the man who has just managed to pull out the body of his 94-four year old mother from the wreckage of her house. The Israeli army shot her, he says, before bringing the house down. What did she have to do with rockets being fired into Israel? he asks.               
	Such stories  and the pointed question at the end  recur in the accounts of those who have survived Israels deadly war on Gaza. Its difficult for any rational person to imagine a clean war; but still, the testimonies from the locals reveal a particularly vicious edge to the destruction. Consider, for example: a man is dragged away to prison with some of his family members. On his return he finds that his son has been shot, and the body left to rot in the decimated orange groves belonging to the family. Inside the house, the walls are smeared with graffiti in Hebrew. The Star of David, an icon of both the Jewish faith and the Israeli State, has been distorted into a threat and spray-painted on the hallways.         
	Its not just people and their homes; its also animals that are among the targets. Accounts of farming areas describe scenes of slaughter. In a farming area near Beit Hanoun, cows lie dead across an entire field, some ripped open by shrapnel, others simply crushed by tanks. The corpses of donkeys, horses, goats and chickens line the streets. These slaughtered animals were a source of livelihood for people in this area, people such as the teenaged Youssef. Now his familys livelihood is gone. He, too, asks a pointed question about acts that can only be perceived as war crimes: Who would take the time to kill cows in this war? In the same area, an Amnesty International representative reports that residents have found an extraordinary weapon. It can fire a throng of nails as far as the size of a football field in each direction. One of the locals, the father of an ambulance driver killed by a drone missile, points to nails lodged in the side of his house. He says the Israeli army used the weapon on them during his sons funeral procession.        
	Family members dead under the rubble. Surviving members digging up bodies on ceasefire. More than 1,300 Palestinians killed in three weeks, a third of them children, according to both Gaza health officials and the United Nations. Some 5,500 people injured. This is the worst violence we have seen since the Nakba, a news item quotes 75-year-old Ibrahim Mohamed Hindi of Zeitoun. Nakba, the Arabic word for catastrophe, is a word that has become familiar the world over to describe the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians when Israel was created in 1948. It seems we are still to learn how much brutality and death this word can describe.        
	It has taken only three weeks for generations of families to disappear, and for entire villages to be destroyed. It will take a while for information  the full details on the sheer scale of devastation wreaked by Israel  to emerge fully. How long it will take for the fear, terror, and anger of the victims (and their families, their sympathizers) to abate is anyones guess. For the moment, its clear there is profound psychological damage. I dont have any feelings any more, said Mohamed Hindi. The Israelis have managed to destroy everything. Even our emotions.        
	How does Israel justify such destruction? How does it manage to set aside its own history of memories from people who are destroyed and damaged in any holocaust?        
	The first answer has got to be the expertise Israel has acquired in passing off its every act of violence as self-defence. The Israeli army shoots a 94-year-old woman in Gaza, but it is Israel that is the victim. Israel drops bombs on children returning from school, or on their parents going about their daily lives; but Israel is not the aggressor. Somehow, Israel always manages only to retaliate. It never attacks. This is how, for example, Israel has been justifying killing thousands of Palestinians for 20 deaths caused by al-Qassam rockets over the last 10 years.               
	John Berger describes this strategy of justification as the twisted logic of racism. He says: Today, in face of the Israeli attacks on Gaza, the essential calculation, which was always covertly there, behind this conflict, has been blatantly revealed. The death of one Israeli victim justifies the killing of a hundred Palestinians. One Israeli life is worth a hundred Palestinian lives. This is what the Israeli State and the world media more or less  with marginal questioning  mindlessly repeat. And this claim, which has accompanied and justified the longest Occupation of foreign territories in twentieth century European history, is viscerally racist.        
	The second answer is that the kind of destruction wreaked on Gaza is only possible if people are systematically dehumanized. Once Israel has dehumanized those children, those men and women, they are no longer people. They are only military targets. But among the photos of what has happened in Gaza, and what continues to unfold every day, there are two that wordlessly deny any attempt at dehumanization. One photo shows two children picking up scraps of schoolbooks from debris. They have already made one neat pile, creating a semblance of order in the middle of chaos. The other photo shows children who have returned to their classroom, and are gravely inspecting the damage there. These lives that have been altered forever are not weapons or missiles. They are not terrorists or military targets. They are just terrified children who now have to learn how to live again.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	New faces                  
	Sir  The new president of the Bharatiya Janata Party, Nitin Gadkari, has rightly decided not to contest any election (Gadkaris headache, Dec 24). Being the president of the main opposition party of the nation is in itself a big responsibility. Holding another post as parliamentarian will not help Gadkari do full justice to the BJP. He would also not be able to deliver his best to the voters who elect him.          
	A system should be worked out whereby members of parliament, state legislators or civic-body officials may not be able to hold any other post either in the government or in the party, or even in any other private organization. That would enable them to devote quality time to their constituencies.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Madhu Agrawal,

	Sir  Both Sushma Swaraj and Nitin Gadkari have been given big responsibilities. As the leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, Swaraj should respect parliamentary procedures and outgrow the habit of shouting, running into the well, violent protests and walkouts. She should ensure that her party members obey rules in the Upper and the Lower Houses. To improve the BJPs image, Swaraj would have to demonstrate astute leadership qualities.          
	Gadkari should also shoulder the burden of reviving the BJPs drooping morale and retrieving the prestige it enjoyed under Atal Bihari Vajpayee. He must enforce discipline, without which the BJP will not be able to make a comeback. Internal bickering must also stop.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
M.M. Kale, Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh 

      
	Sir  The infusion of young blood  in the form of Nitin Gadkari, the new president, and Sushma Swaraj, the leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha  into the BJP is merely a cosmetic measure that will give the party a new look. The shift of power to Swaraj comes in the wake of the BJPs search for a different face to remove the taints on the partys ideology.          
	Now is the time to shed the garb of Hindutva and accept India as a composite entity rather than encourage communal divisions. The BJP has lost much of its sheen recently, and its abysmal performance in the Lok Sabha elections bears testimony to this fact. Rajnath Singhs resignation seemed to have affected neither the party nor the public. Petty squabbles have, for some time, cracked the premises of the BJP. It is imperative to cement the bond among the members, without which the BJP cannot emerge as an effective Opposition.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Ashok Jayaram, Bangalore 

      
	Sir  To win the confidence of the people, Nitin Gadkari has to appreciate the value of the leadership left behind by L.K. Advani and Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Gadkari should remain unbiased and balanced for the sake of the integrity of the country as well as that of his party. Gadkari should reward competent party workers, instil a sense of discipline, and widen the mass base of the BJP. The BJP should also strengthen its ties with its allies.          
	The BJP has come a long way riding on Hindutva. Now the people want a new agenda that would embrace all Indians, irrespective of religion. Gadkari has to keep in mind that a balanced approach pursued by Vajpayee played an effective role in bringing the National Democratic Alliance to power in the past. In India, no political party can survive for long by lobbying for a particular segment of population, be it for the Dalits, other backward classes, the scheduled castes, the scheduled tribes, Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs or Christians. All of us are citizens of India first, then members of individual communities. An inclusive India should be the BJPs topmost agenda. One hopes that Gadkari will succeed in fulfilling the hopes and aspirations of the supporters of his party.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Danendra Jain, Agartala 

                
	Sir  Nitin Gadkari is the right choice to revitalize the BJP, which had lost a lot of ground since its defeat at the Centre. The erosion of the BJPs support base has been great in the last two years due to its painful lack of direction. Given his expertise with roads and flyovers, will the new party chief be able to build new bridges with the common people as Rahul Gandhi has been doing with the Dalits and the downtrodden?          
	The BJP has to project an inclusive appeal for Hindutva while mastering electoral arithmetic. Since age is on Gadkaris side, he should launch an extensive programme focusing on development, poverty alleviation, employment generation and empowerment through knowledge. Moreover, bringing back estranged leaders like Uma Bharti, Jaswant Singh and others into the fold would also prove beneficial for the BJP. The younger generation in the party should be given a greater chance to prove themselves.          
	Your faithfully,          Raghubir Singh, Pune

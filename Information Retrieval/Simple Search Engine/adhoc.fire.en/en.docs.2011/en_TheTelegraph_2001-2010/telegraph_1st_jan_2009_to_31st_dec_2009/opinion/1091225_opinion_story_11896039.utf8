The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Lead from the Front
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        LEAD FROM THE FRONT                                  Malvika Singh                              
	The dictionary defines perks  an abbreviation of perquisites  as a benefit one enjoys because of ones job or position. Perks are now going to be taxed. Unfortunately in India, this tax is made mandatory for all those professionals who generate the wealth of this country and ensure regular growth, but is not applicable to those in politics and government who live off the wealth generated by those being taxed. The time is ripe for the prime minister to compel the finance ministry to tax equally, according to the same law of this land, all the perquisites provided to the members of parliament, the council of ministers, bureaucrats and babus. For Indians, this discrimination is no longer acceptable. Lead from the front, and lead by example.        
	Subsidized housing, electricity, water, cars, gardeners, service staff, everything must come under the common taxation net. Let these men and women who institute the laws, a pampered and privileged minority who fail to deliver simple goods and services that define dignity to the people of our land, be forced to abide by those very laws, and not continue to exploit and live off the hard work of the majority. This should be the gift of the government to the nation. Indians have had more than their fair share of this lopsided and inappropriate exploitation of perks by a small bunch of rulers at the Centre and in the states, who have lived well-cushioned lives in bungalows set within large sprawling lawns at the cost of someone else. They have not learnt either to appreciate or comprehend the trials and tribulations that hardworking professionals have had to face at the hands of misguided rules and regulations, operated by themselves over the decades.                
	Red lights        
	These smug rulers have always stalled growth and development, change and innovation, fresh thinking and movement. Insecure, carrying the baggage that has pushed them deep into the mire, this class of professionals has consistently discouraged entrepreneurship, and harassed anyone who has tried to break new ground and succeed. Boulders in the way, tedious delays even when all papers are in perfect order, envy and jealousy, bribery and corruption, indignation for those with ideas and minds of their own, have all been the ingredients of this unpleasant cocktail, which has been fed to potential entrepreneurs and competent individuals. Indians need to know why the few are set apart from all those who actually make India move forward. Who will make the former accountable?        
	I have never known the anger to be so intense as it is today. A young generation feels that it is being taken for granted. It is being stalled in its tracks. Ironically, young politicians, gearing up to take over the reins of power, are also being stalled by devious political manoeuvres. The party leaders playing this game know well that their days are numbered. The red lights atop the cars we see plying our streets have come to symbolize an unconcerned group with blinkers on their eyes. There is no respect for that class of citizens. The victims of this careless and self-centred governance have responded and revolted in varied ways. Many have adopted militant postures with arms, others are on the verge of reacting in similar ways. The failed administrators threaten to suppress their own people by using the strong arm of the State to stifle their call.        
	Will the political and administrative classes ever cease to be in a state of denial? Will decency and correctness reappear in our mechanisms of governance? Will this government lead the way to the future by establishing that the law applies to all citizens equally, as does the tax structure? Will one caste or class be allowed to get away with corruption and murder while another is brought to book?

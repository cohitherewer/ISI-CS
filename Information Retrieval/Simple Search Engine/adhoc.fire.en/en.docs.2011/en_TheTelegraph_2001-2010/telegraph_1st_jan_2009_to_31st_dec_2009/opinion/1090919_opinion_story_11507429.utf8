	Arindam Chatterjees is a twilight world of splintered shadows, webs and smudged greys  if you feel you have read this before it is only because there are other artists who are doing similar work based on the built environment of cities. Chatterjees exhibition of recent works at Chitrakoot Art Gallery confirmed this, but it went on to show that the young artist has some ideas of his own. There are hints of the artist throwing light on the secret life of the city and its inscrutability in these works executed with oil, acrylic, charcoal and pastel on paper. The artist was trained at the Government College of Art amp; Craft and at Kala Bhavan in Santiketan as well.        
	Most of the works are in large format and Chatterjee makes good use of the available space as they often suggest a vista, a vast swathe of a city and its many layers, some that remain invisible in daytime and are revealed only after dark. The combination of oil colours, acrylic, charcoal and pastel creates textures that would otherwise not have been possible to produce if these media were used on their own, as they often are. With their smudged colours running into each other as if Chatterjee had used resist dyeing, they could often be mistaken for lithographs with intricate charcoal lines on them, often as complicated as the webs of spiders.        
	Chatterjees works are bathed in a weird light that gives them a haunted look. It is this light that sets his work apart from those of other artists whose matrix is urbanscape. But Chatterjee gives it a twist as if he were exploring the unseen life of a city and not just its architecture. His charcoal drawings are suggestive of anything from tectonics to the human anatomy and skeleton.        
	The cityscape he conjures up with its network of grids, intersecting lines, loops and vast, jagged skeletal forms exists at two levels. It is as much a city that exists in reality as it is a figment of the artists imagination, a chimera released in sleep. This gives Chatterjees dark and ominous cityscapes a hint of danger that has kinship with death.        
	It is a relief that Chatterjee does not use photographic images, like many of his contemporaries, in his work. He still uses the simplest of techniques and materials to achieve the effects he desires. Technical innovation is certainly not to be discouraged but often traditional skills can be equally effective.        
	It will be interesting to see how this artists work develops in future. While this exhibition made quite an impact, one wonders if a repeat act would be quite as effective. Death and darkness can be boring stuff if overused.

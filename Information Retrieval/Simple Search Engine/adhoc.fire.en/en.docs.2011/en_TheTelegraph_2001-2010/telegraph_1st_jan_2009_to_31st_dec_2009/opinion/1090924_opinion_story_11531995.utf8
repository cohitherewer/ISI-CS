                                                                                                                 A NEW STORY IN NUMBERS                                  Fifth Column -R.C. Acharya                              
	The middleman has always been the bane of any society. Acting as a facilitator or a go-between, the middleman is always the weak link in effective communication between two parties, and the elimination of this person is what the proposed unique identification number promises to achieve. Nandan M. Nilekani, having dreamt of the concept of UIN and having thought of its design, could not be expected to let go of this opportunity of a lifetime. Manmohan Singh has chosen to give Nilekani a cabinet post, and Nilekani, with nearly 30 years of experience in information-technology related matters, can be expected to do the job in record time.        
	After going through the chapter titled ICT in India, as well as the subsequent pages of Nilekanis excellent book, Imagining India, one realizes the enormous impact the UIN scheme will have not only on the daily lives of the citizens but also on the nations economy. Its promise of effective delivery of the various policy initiatives for the common man will revolutionize the life of India and its people. Most importantly, the UIN would enable various agencies  government or private  to obtain highly accurate feedback, which is presently impossible because of the existence of a large number of middlemen.        
	As pointed out by Nilekani in his book, the UIN, which started as a pilot project a few years ago, was initially seen as nothing more than a means to effectively identify and then check the influx of illegal immigrants. Even today, it is looked upon as such in some quarters. In Nilekanis scheme of things, however, the UIN would be an all-encompassing tag to connect every individual identity that a person possesses  the ration card, passport, permanent account number, election identity card, credit card, driving license and so on.                
	Little interference        
	The UIN is modelled on the Social Security Administration of the United States of America. Nilekani states that the UIN will be effective in empowering Indias citizens and in doing away with the middleman when it comes to interaction between the citizenry and public and private institutions. The UIN would be at the core of any system that an organization may build to facilitate interaction with the people.         
	However, Nilekani might find the going far from easy. He would have to tackle nearly 600 government departments and their heads, who would want to hold on to their respective fiefdoms. These men will undoubtedly make matters worse for Nilekani even if he chose to flaunt his rank and let them know of his reported proximity to the prime minister. Given his personal commitment and competence, the aura and the respect that he commands in the IT industry, intellectual community and business circles, there should be no dearth of brilliant minds eager to join Nilekanis venture.         
	New Delhis babudom seldom fails to defer to the political hierarchy. The induction of Nilekani to the rank of a cabinet minister was thus a master stroke by the prime minister. This move will give Nilekani access to resources that would otherwise have remained out of bounds had Nilekani been just another government secretary. Nilekani will have many doors to pry open, and persuade those sitting behind them to change their minds.         
	However, problems will remain even after the UIN project becomes a reality. The ubiquitous middleman is unlikely to give up without a good fight. With a penchant to beat the system, the middleman can still upset plans unless the system ensures a reduced probability of human interference and corruption. As pointed out by Nilekani, the introduction of the simple First in, First out rule eliminated the possibility of middlemen demanding and being paid bribes in the updating of land records in Karnataka. This is the way to go forward.

	Costly damage                  
	Sir  The Bharatiya Janata Party called a 12-hour bandh on November 30 in West Bengal (Goondas find Bengal haven, Dec 1). It was a protest, as they called it, against the rise in the prices of practically every article of everyday use. Price rise has indeed placed a heavy burden on the common people. And the BJP boasts of having observed a successful bandh. Members of the party claim low attendance in offices as proof of the peoples support for the bandh. The facts, however, point to a completely different conclusion. Bandhs result in the wastage of working days. A labourer cannot be happy to lose a days wage, nor a shopkeeper his days sale. Commuters cannot be pleased at being blocked on the way to office or to school. The BJP tried to make its bandh a success by unleashing terror. They set buses on fire in Howrah and many other places, smashed the windscreens of cars, and beat up drivers and office-goers in some places. They did not allow even ambulances to pass through roads they had blocked. They also attacked an office in the citys IT hub, Sector V in Salt Lake.          
	One wonders what the BJP wanted to prove by this show of muscle. It appears that its cadre were trying to scare the people. A days work was lost owing to irresponsible behaviour by one of the countrys major political parties. The BJP was the ruling party once, and must surely be dreaming of ruling the country again. It will not gain anything from this bandh, though, apart from the infamy the partymen have already brought upon themselves by their thoughtless hooliganism. While acts of violence during bandhs are not unprecedented, the scale of violence unleashed in the last bandh had not been witnessed in recent times. It is clear that the police were not adequately prepared to tackle the situation. They were late in reacting to outbreaks of violence and were often no more than spectators. The failure of the administration to maintain law and order gives rise to the question: how can citizens have confidence in a government that cannot provide them security?                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The state administration and the people at large were no doubt surprised at the violence unleashed by the BJP, a party which has hardly any standing in West Bengal. It is obvious that there was more to this bandh  whether factionalism within the BJP, an effort to impress the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, or an alliance between the BJP and the Communist Party of India (Marxist), as some have alleged  than a protest against price rise. The contention of Rajnath Singh, the BJPs outgoing president, that the violence was a spontaneous reaction can be dismissed outright. Events show that it was planned in advance to disrupt life and terrorize people. Burning buses, attacking cars, blocking traffic, especially near the airport, and railway tracks, making trouble in the IT sector and forcibly preventing students from attending school can hardly be called spontaneous actions.          
	While violence is intrinsic to Indian politics, bandhs and bandh-related violence have become a very Bengali thing; it is to be noted that no such violence took place during the bandh called by the BJP on the same issue earlier in Delhi. However, to indulge in debates on who is responsible for the disruption of public life and theorizing about the politics of bandhs would be to miss the wood for the trees. As the editorial, In disarray (Dec 1), pointed out, the disruptions are not a sign of the BJPs success, but the state administrations failure to exercise power in the public interest. It is the duty of the State to protect citizens and property, whether public or private, and to ensure that citizens are not terrorized by such blatantly unlawful actions. Lawlessness is spiralling out of control, with an inept state administration at the helm. One way to control the damage done by militant bandh-enforcers is to take cognizance of the disruptions as organized crime and punish them accordingly.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Powerless          
	Sir  Once again an unintelligible arithmetic jugglery has been dished out by the West Bengal Electricity Regulatory Commission in their calculations of the revised tariff (Power bill to burn hole in pocket, Nov 28). What seems clear, though, is that from November, customers of the Calcutta Electric Supply Corporation would have to part with about one hundred rupees more for an average monthly consumption of 200 units.          
	The rise in tariff is largely due to the increase in the price of coal. The reason put forward by Coal India Limited  that it is due to a pay rise for the employees  is a valid one. But CIL authorities are silent on the extent of the coal theft they suffer. It appears that there is none to oversee this colossal waste, the cost of which the people of the state have to bear. The other loss is power theft from the CESCs distribution network. The CESC expects consumers to keep vigil to detect tapping and inform the company so that the police can take action. This is a very high expectation. Instead of addressing the problem of tapping, the CESC takes the easy path of recovering the cost of power theft from the consumers.          
	The regulatory authorities are not even sure if the revised tariff is commensurate with the cost of production. They have assured customers that if the raised tariff is deemed excessive, they will ask the utility services to refund the money. The present state of affair seems very gloomy. The customers, as in the past, will have to bear the brunt.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Diptimoy De, Calcutta

	The Bharatiya Janata Party continues to blot its book with public squabbles that do it no good, particularly after its virtual decimation at the hustings earlier this year. The Karnataka chief minister, B.S. Yeddyurappa, standing his ground against the Bellary brothers means that the falling-out must have been over a contentious issue because the three were close political partners till recently. The brothers hold sway over Southern politics, and are equally close to the Andhra Pradesh leadership, particularly to Jagan Reddy, the son of the late Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy.         
	What had happened to bring about this schism? That is what we need to know, and this critical ingredient has not been revealed in the narrative that is being doled out. Will the party throw its weight behind the chief minister or will it support the rebel factor in a desperate attempt to stay in power?        
	Someone in the party needs to take charge, present a strategy, and stand by the mandate it devises for itself. Witnessing the unfolding of this tragic saga in which the major Opposition party, ridden with infighting, seems to be falling apart is a frightening sight for those in the public domain. We need a strong Opposition to ensure that the many checks and balances necessary for a functioning and well-oiled democratic machinery are in place. The inability of the top leadership of the BJP to rapidly reinvent itself and put in place a younger, and more intelligent, set of leaders from within only goes to show the paralysis that has gripped its body. Who will move to force the change? Which faction will lead the battle charge?        
	After Atal Bihari Vajpayees exit, the BJP became rudderless and was not able to replace Vajpayee with another, equally Machiavellian, persona. It became a deadpan organization with a one-dimensional central leadership that brooked no dialogue within the portals of its party edifice, thereby alienating many of its talented members.                
	New way        
	If the party is in the painful process of revival and reinvention, we shall all have something to look forward to and combat with. Hopefully, the Parliament will cease to be adjourned frequently by the chief Opposition party, and it will start taking a strong position on the many critical issues that face modern India.        
	Our federal democratic framework is in dangerous waters: the Maoist problem is now seemingly uncontrollable; there are contentious foreign policy issues that have to do with aggressive neighbours at our borders; a weak Opposition in Parliament has diluted a serious discourse on national concerns, raising the possibility of attempts to divert opinion from the real issues of political failure; corruption pervades every sphere of social activity and the administrative service is in constant denial about indulging in exclusive governance. As a people, we must compel the restoration of good practice based on humane values and ethics.        
	The forthcoming session of Parliament needs to set a new standard. Perhaps the prime minister should call a meeting to work out a joint strategy, which will give dignity and honour to the institution that represents Indias diversity, plurality and unity. The dignity of Parliament has to be restored and the leadership of different parties, however ideologically diverse, must together respect and abide by the Constitution.        
	India cannot be derailed by incompetent, corrupt men and women who have personal agendas and no real national commitment. Discussion is the way forward. Consensus on national issues is the directive that the bureaucracy needs to be given. Only then will that corroded administrative machine cease to pit politicians against each other by using the lack of consensus as an excuse. This truth comes across the footlights loud and clear.

	The recent developments in Nepal need not cause any apprehension in some or arouse hope in the others that these may pave the way for the return of the ousted monarch, Gyanendra Shah, and of palace rule. Gyanendra was deposed neither by the Maoist cadre nor by any other political party. It was a peoples revolt that caused him to leave Narayanhiti palace. The people of Nepal made it clear that they wanted constitutional rule in the true sense of the term and there is no reason to believe that they have changed their mind. They knew it was a new experiment they were opting for  governance without royal presence  and one year is too short a time for anybody to even feel that the experiment has not worked.        
	Prachanda and the Maoists have to be given time. It is not easy for a revolutionary party, drawing strength from the teaching that political power grows out of the barrel of a gun, to suddenly change itself and come to terms with parliamentary politics. In a way, a similar situation had confronted the undivided Communist Party of India in Tripura when the then-secretary, Biren Dutta, had declared that the party would contest the first Lok Sabha elections while most leaders were still underground, waging an armed struggle against the government in the hills. The party adjusted itself to the new situation, and with success. There is nothing to indicate that in Nepal, the Maoists would call it a day. Other parties like the Nepali Congress and the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist-Leninist) would not allow them to do so because, in spite of differences, nobody wants a situation in which the experiment with democracy may fail.                
	Tricky situation        
	Prachanda may be blamed for being in a hurry on the issue of amalgamating his Peoples Liberation Army with the regular army that led to his friction with the chief of the armed forces and his eventual resignation. But as the prime minister, he perhaps had reasons to be angry when his order was disobeyed by a general who, only a year ago, was an enemy. Questions may also be asked about the way the president asked the army chief to stick to his guns. Nepals new constitution is yet to be framed and so, the president may also be seen as acting hastily and at the behest of the Nepali Congress.         
	The problem in Nepal is that neither the Nepali Congress nor the communists have any clear idea as to what should be the fate of the Peoples Liberation Army. These men had fought with arms to create a wide base for the Maoists in the countryside, they are politically trained and want to be a part of the nation- building process. They cannot be asked now to go back and till the soil. Logically, the only place for them is in the armed forces but all non-Maoist forces and the army brass are dead against this. The fear is that the Maoists inclusion in the army will only increase their clout. This anxiety is not unfounded. But then, the liberation army also cannot be wished away.         
	The situation is tricky but not beyond repair. The Nepali Congress and the CPN (UML) must realize that if the Maoists are not accommodated, any government that may be formed in Kathmandu will face serious problems. The army may choose to take the cue from Pakistan, and Bangladesh may step in. Hopes of democracy will then be shattered.        
	Prachanda has already displayed signs that he is not averse to a negotiated settlement. Without naming India, he has warned against meddling outsiders, obviously feeling that the Nepali Congress had worked under advice from New Delhi. Whatever the merit of the charge may be, India should keep in mind the fact that an angry Prachanda may well make it difficult for the country to deal with the Maoists at home. So both Nepal and India need to keep Prachanda on the right side.

	The bureaucracy in India usually creates more problems than it solves. It is curious, therefore, that Assams chief minister, Tarun Gogoi, is thinking of creating a new bureaucracy dedicated to rural development. The issue of rural uplift is crucial for a state which has hardly any major industries except oil refineries. But to suggest that a new rural civil service on the lines of the Assam Public Service Commission is the answer to the problem of rural underdevelopment is rather far-fetched. Mr Gogoi argues that the setting-up of the rural service is necessary because officials belonging to the APSC are reluctant to work in the villages. Even if this were the case, it is not a good enough argument for creating another service. The problem, the chief minister should know, is the bureaucratic mindset. There is no reason to think that the typical weaknesses of a bureaucracy will not affect officials at the village level as well. Another civil service may actually end up duplicating  and also complicating  the present administrative structure. Also, given the bureaucracys record, it can mean opportunities for more corruption for more people in the administration.        
	All this is not to underestimate the importance of strengthening the village-level administration in Assam. Apart from its industrial backwardness, the state has to tackle several ethnic insurgencies. Most of the insurgent groups exploit rural poverty in order to both recruit their cadre as well as to influence the common people. Better management of rural development programmes can thus achieve two goals simultaneously. It can reduce poverty and secure livelihoods for villagers and thereby help in the fight against the militants. The Centre funds a host of such programmes in every state. The national rural employment guarantee scheme alone has a huge potential for creating jobs for the poorest of villagers. What every state government, including the one in Assam, needs to do is effectively implement these programmes and ensure that corruption and incompetence do not derail them. Mr Gogoi can do this better by improving the monitoring system and by involving the people in these programmes. It is not so much another set of bureaucrats as public scrutiny and supervision that can make a difference to the success of rural development work. If anything, Assam, like other states, needs less (and not more) of bureaucratic waste.

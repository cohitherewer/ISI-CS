The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | right to deface
                                                                                                                 RIGHT TO DEFACE                                                    
	Imagine that general elections are round the corner, and the doorbell rings. The boys from the local party office have dropped by to ask if you mind political graffiti being painted on the outer walls of your home. They show you what sort of paint they are going to use, and how easily it can be washed off. You do mind, they accept that, politely apologize and move on next door. Why does such a scenario of civilized, everyday normalcy seem ridiculous in most parts of urban, suburban and rural India, and particularly in Calcutta and the rest of West Bengal? Anybody with a realistic sense of the political culture that has taken root here over decades  and who has had to protect his home or family members from going up in flames for defying the diktat of the local cadre  will titter with indignation if told to swallow such an imagined scene. But this is precisely what the Election Commission is asking Indian citizens to accept by relaxing the ban on political graffiti that it had firmly endorsed not so long ago. It has, of course, left room for the house-owners wishes, to be registered with the police in advance, and so on. But all this is founded on a rather baffling set of expectations regarding the way Indian democracy works, especially when it comes to political parties and the State respecting citizens rights.        
	This is even more baffling because when the EC had endorsed the ban in October, it seemed to have understood very clearly exactly what it appears to have forgotten now: the lawlessness and abuse of power, the intimidation and hooliganism, that determine the ordinary citizens experience of elections (including preparations for them). And this applies to political parties of all hues. In 2006, after winning the assembly elections, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and his Left Front government decided to celebrate their victory by changing the law against graffiti, passing this off as triumphal largesse meant for the people. This made what the new law called non-commercial advertisement legal, and the ECs previous inflexibility was directed at this. In a democracy, a political partys right to freedom of expression cannot be played out at the expense of the citizens right to protect his private property. Striking a balance between the two rights has to reckon with the actual conditions, vis--vis law and order, that prevail in society and in the polity.

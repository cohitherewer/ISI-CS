The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | same old show
                                                                                                                 SAME OLD SHOW                                                    
	How much change can Bengalis really take? Not much and certainly not in their politics, it seems. Jawaharlal Nehru knew it when he described Calcutta as a city of processions. Had he witnessed how the city was stopped by Mamata Banerjees show on Tuesday, he would have known how little the city and its politicians have changed in half a century. After all, the ability to stop things has been the measure of Bengali politicians success. The Marxists were the original sinners, but their rivals have taken a leaf from their book on how to disrupt public life in order to rise in politics. If Ms Banerjees rally was one of the biggest the city has seen in recent years, the hardships it caused to the people were also the harshest in a long time. In Bengal, street shows that violate all norms of civilized conduct are supposed to be the road to power. The ruling Marxists rose through them and Ms Banerjee emulates them. This cynical indifference to the peoples suffering and norms of political decency go on irrespective of whether a party is in power or in the Opposition. In Bengal, this affront is legitimized in the name of radicalism.         
	Yet, Ms Banerjees rally was all about the change she is said to represent. She wants to oust the Marxists from power and change everything that she thinks has been wrong with the state during the Marxists long reign. It is possible that her mission to capture Writers Buildings will succeed in the assembly elections in 2011. In fact, she used the rally to promise changes in the states economy and politics if she comes to power. The irony is that she stopped Calcutta and forced the people to suffer in order to promise all those changes. Many of the promises have been made, and broken, by other leaders in other times. But the biggest message from her show does not inspire much hope for any real change in Bengals political culture. No matter who rules the state, the importance of road power will not change. Irrespective of what happens in 2011, the fact is Ms Banerjee is already a Union minister. And never did her chances of ruling the state look as real as now. That she could still hope to succeed by disruptive politics shows how much Bengalis love such politics. Those who dare to really change things are doomed to fail in Bengal. The actors may change but the old show must go on.

	It is generally agreed that North Korea and Burma have the two most oppressive regimes in Asia. They rule over two of the poorest countries in the continent, and that is no coincidence. But there is one marked difference between them. No foreign leaders pay court to the Burmese generals in their weirdly grandiose new capital of Naypyidaw, whereas even Bill Clinton, the worlds most recognizable celebrity statesman, makes the pilgrimage to Pyongyang.        
	Clinton was there to secure the release of two American journalists who were seized on the Chinese-North Korean border four months ago, probably with the explicit purpose of taking American hostages and forcing a high-level US visit to the North Korean capital. Thats why it was private citizen Bill, rather than his wife, the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, who made the visit to Kim Jong-il: the United States of America paid the devil his due, but deniably.        
	The big difference is this: the Burmese regime is seen by most foreign governments as ugly but harmless, whereas the North Korean regime is seen as ugly and extremely dangerous. The most dangerous thing about North Korea is its nuclear weapons; so if the Burmese generals also want to have emissaries from the great powers genuflecting at their doorstep, they need some nuclear weapons too.        
	The notion of a nuclear-armed Burma is faintly ridiculous, because the country has no foreign enemies that it needs to deter, let alone attack. But respect matters too, especially to regimes which feel their legitimacy is always under question. Articles published in the Sydney Morning Herald and the Bangkok Post by Desmond Ball of the Australian National University and by Thailand-based Irish journalist, Phil Thornton, suggest that the Burmese regime has sought North Korean help to build its own nuclear weapons. It wants the North Koreans to create a plutonium reprocessing plant in the caves near Naung Laing in northern Burma, not far from the site of a civilian nuclear reactor that is being built with Russian help.                
	Dangerous ways        
	The usually reliable website, Dictator Watch, has been publishing warnings about the Burmese nuclear weapons project for several years now. Most of the information comes from defectors, including a former army officer who was sent to Moscow for two years training in nuclear engineering.         
	Why would North Korea be doing it? Because it is being paid in yellowcake (partially refined uranium), which Burma processes at the Thabeik Kyin plant. The fact that North Korea is a reckless nuclear weapons proliferator makes it more dangerous, and being dangerous is what forces people like Bill and Hillary Clinton to talk to it. All assuming that North Korea really is helping Burma to develop nuclear weapons, of course.        
	Ball and Thornton suggest that Burma could be processing 8 kg of plutonium-239 a year by 2014, after which it could produce one atomic bomb per year. Well, yes, but we all know that apparently competent intelligence agencies like the Central Intelligence Agency and Mossad have been predicting that Iran will have nuclear weapons within five years practically every year since the early 1990s. They were wrong about Iran every year, and Iran is a much more serious country, in scientific, technological and industrial terms than Burma.        
	But suppose its true. Why would Burma be doing it? Not to nuke Thailand or Malaysia or Bangladesh, surely, for it has no quarrel with its neighbours. But one can imagine that Than Shwe and his colleagues would feel more secure if the US and other great powers, instead of condemning and boycotting the Burmese dictatorship, were begging it to be responsible and give up its nuclear weapons.Thats why North Korea developed nuclear arms too.

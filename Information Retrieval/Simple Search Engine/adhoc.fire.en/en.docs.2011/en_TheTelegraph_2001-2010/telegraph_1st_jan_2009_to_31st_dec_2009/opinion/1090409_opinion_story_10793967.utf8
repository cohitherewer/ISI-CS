The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | far from cover
                                                                                                                 FAR FROM COVER                                                    
	From a few hundred square kilometres in early February, the safe zone in the north-east of Sri Lanka has rapidly shrunk to 20. So have the chances of the Mahinda Rajapakse government of emerging victorious in its fight against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. Given that the government may now find it impossible to stop the bloodbath awaiting it as it frees the last bit of territory from the clutches of the Tigers, it is unlikely that the administration will escape the opprobrium that is bound to follow. The situation, of course, is not entirely its doing. The Tigers have ensured that they retained enough human cover by driving the population with them wherever they went, and by seeing to it that there was no easy escape. Thousands have escaped, but there still remain some 1,90,000 within a narrow strip of land, caught between the advancing Sri Lankan army and the Tigers. Most of these unarmed civilians have nothing but a plastic sheet over their heads for shelter, little water and food, and no security. Although the government is still hesitating to send in troops to get it over with, the constant shelling  even of hospitals  is already taking a high toll, particularly among women and children. There are also fears that the Tigers may undertake a mass slaughter of the population as a parting gift to the Rajapakse government.         
	The consequent moral pressure that is mounting on the Sri Lanka government to declare a ceasefire is naturally enormous. Sri Lanka, standing close to victory, is livid that the world should be so unreasonable about its national concerns. But its predicament is the inevitable outcome of its militarist policy, which has no place for larger humanitarian issues. Had it been otherwise, Sri Lanka would not have summarily brushed aside offers of assistance from neighbouring countries and the United States of America, which earlier helped sort out differences between the Tigers and the government over tsunami aid. The government could have saved itself from bad press had it conducted an earlier evacuation drive. But trust has always been a major casualty in dealings between the government and the Tamil population in Sri Lanka. Even now, a singular lack of it prevents the government from reaching out to the suffering people in the north-east, and the people from surrendering their fate to a government they find so unforgiving and so difficult to trust.

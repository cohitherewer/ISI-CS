	Only three months in office, and Japans new prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, could hardly be expected to make dramatic changes in sensitive foreign policy issues. His call to New Delhi to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty should not, therefore, be seen as a pre-condition for improvements in India-Japan relations. It is the continuation of Japans old policy of a strict export control regime for trade in dual-use high technology items. True, Mr Hatoyamas visit offers no hopes of India getting nuclear power technology from Japan any time soon. Although last years civilian nuclear deal between India and the United States of America reversed three decades of US policy barring the sale of nuclear fuel and technology to India, there was no real possibility that Japan would follow the US example. But Manmohan Singhs response points to new thinking in New Delhi on the issue. He has now hinted at a different Indian response should America and China ratify the CTBT.         
	However, the most significant outcome of Hatoyamas visit is not his reiteration of old Japanese policy on CTBT, but a fresh commitment to expand India-Japan co-operation. In this he has followed in the footsteps of his recent predecessors such as Junichiro Koizumi, Shinzo Abe and Taro Aso. The agenda for economic and security co-operation that emerged from Mr Hatoyamas visit indicates Japans willingness to engage India in a new balance of power in Asia. It also follows from the India-Japan security agreement signed during Mr Singhs visit to Tokyo in October, 2008. Both countries have a stake in peace, stability and the power equilibrium in Asia at a time when the rise of India and China gives the continent new economic and strategic dimensions. The expansion of India-Japan ties need not be seen as part of a strategy to encircle China. It is more realistic to see this as being symbolic of a resurgent Asia.

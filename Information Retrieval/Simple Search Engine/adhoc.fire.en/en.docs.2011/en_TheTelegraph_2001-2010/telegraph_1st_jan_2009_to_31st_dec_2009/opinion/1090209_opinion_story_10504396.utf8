                                                                                                                 PLAIN CONFUSION                                                    
	The storm that was brewing on the hills has finally reached the plains. The Gorkhaland agitation, in its original form under Subash Ghisingh, had focused exclusively on drawing on the Gorkha support base. But its new avatar, the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha led by Bimal Gurung, is a more ambitious front. Although the GJM has stuck to the demand for a separate state for the hill people, it has added more fuel to the already simmering fire by trying to claim the Terai and the Dooars region as part of Gorkhaland. The result of this folly is starkly evident in the outbreak of clashes between the GJM supporters and the adivasis and other anti-Gorkhaland protesters in several parts of the Dooars. The Morcha leaders had pressed for a bandh in the region protesting the ongoing atrocities in Lalgarh and demanding permission to hold rallies in the Dooars. However, after the Akhil Bharatiya Adivasi Vikash Parishad and a few other apolitical bodies resisted the call, it was decided by the highest echelons of the GJM that the strike would not be enforced on the region. With at least two people dead and several injured in the ensuing riot, it is clear that the GJM cadre paid scarce heed to their leaders. Or perhaps the decision to carry out a peaceful bandh was just a lot of empty words.        
	This fresh outburst of violence drives home the inevitable consequence of stretching a theme too far: the GJM has already pushed its divisive identity-based politics to the brink. Blackening the faces of people who do not wear traditional dresses or removing number plates marked WB (West Bengal) from vehicles and replacing them with those marked GL (Gorkhaland) is certainly not going to win loyalty from very many. The sooner the GJM realizes this, and ends its reign of terror, the better. The entire premise of the Gorkhaland movement, after all, is presumed on the idea of popular support, as also on the denial of the fact that there could be others who hold opinions that run contrary to the GJMs politics of fear and coercion. In this continuing drama, the role of the government of West Bengal remains marginal as usual. This might be the states way of expressing its apathy for the cause, but choosing to remain an indifferent observer is neither going to resolve the crisis nor help it win any credibility.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | To the lands where the Jumblies lived
                                                                                                                 TO THE LANDS WHERE THE JUMBLIES LIVED                                  In uncovering the sense behind nature, Charles Darwin also inspired nonsense literature, writes Somak Ghoshal                          Kimbhut in Sukumar Rays illustration                                  
	In 1831, a young man, fresh out of Cambridge, went to seek permission from his father to set sail on the HMS Beagle, a modified warship (named after a breed of dog) embarking on an expedition to South America. His request was met with a severe rebuke: You care for nothing but shooting, dogs, and rat-catching, and you will be a disgrace to yourself and all your family. Little did Robert Darwin know that one day his son, Charles, would become one of the greatest natural scientists of all times, and the trip on the Beagle (Charles finally managed to persuade him) would be the turning point of his sons career.         
	In the bicentenary year of Charles Darwin (1809-1882), and the 150th anniversary of The Origin of Species (1859), Darwins theories of evolution and his religious heterodoxy are being revisited, and events organized to commemorate these twin occasions. But what is less talked about, perhaps, is the social context to Darwins journey on the Beagle. As a successful doctor with high hopes for his son, Robert felt upset that Charles was on the verge of turning into a good-for-nothing aristocrat with not a care for a proper career. Although sea voyages, by the 19th century, were not a novelty, they nonetheless carried a whiff of danger and infamy. They could be safely made fun of  as Edward Lear did when he sent certain unnamed characters in a sieve to the lands where the Jumblies live  but did not make for splendid careers. By the time Lears Book of Nonsense Verse came out in 1846, major expeditions had been undertaken by Europeans. Explorers like Mungo Park and David Livingstone had travelled through Africa before dying there in 1806 and 1813 respectively. Darwin grew up reading Alexander von Humboldts famous Personal Narrative of Travels to the Equinoctial Regions of the New Continent, which inspired the Origin. Several of his contemporaries, among them T.H. Huxley, A.R. Wallace and Joseph Hooker, would also undertake expeditions by sea.              
	Despite the increasing public debate on evolution, especially since Jean-Baptiste Lamarcks Philosophie Zoologique appeared in 1809, many of Darwins ideas were viciously ridiculed in the press. Darwins agnosticism, and his suggestion that human beings and apes had descended from a common ancestor, were singled out for derision. Yet a peculiar version of natural history, filled with Christian piety that praised all things bright and beautiful, all creatures great and small as the handiwork of god, also gained prominence. With the coming of the locomotive in the early 19th century, weekend railway trips to the countryside to study flora and fauna became a hobby for Victorian patriarchs and their families. Collecting butterflies and hunting fossils turned into the new pastime. Darwin was working on the Origin through these times when radical ideas were being disseminated, assimilated and contested in oddly contradictory ways.        
	Like a warped hangover of the Romantic idyll of Nature, the lush countryside proved to be the ideal Sunday indulgence for the gentry. Suddenly, everyone seemed to have woken up to an exciting new world, though few were willing to reckon with its scientific implications. Even Edward Lear, beginning as a painter in the tradition of John James Audubon with his first publication, Illustrations of the Family of Psittacidae (1832)  paintings of the parrot family, would later turn to humour. It was as if the unsavoury implications of a godless world could only be accepted if turned into plain nonsense.         
	With the discovery of the first Neanderthal skull in 1856, and the publication of the Origin three years later, the notion of evolution went through an upheaval. In spite of the storm of controversy raised by Darwin, and amid the outrage and scorn poured on him, the idea started capturing the fancy of writers like Charles Lutwidge Dodgson aka Lewis Carroll. It is through his work that Darwin made an entry into nonsense literature in a serious way for the first time.         
	A mathematician at Oxford, Dodgson disapproved of vivisection; his circle did not take to Darwin. But then, he also doubted the idea of hell. While Dodgson was in residence, the 1860 meeting of the British Association was held in Oxford, where Huxley gave a ringing riposte to Bishop Wilberforces condemnation of Darwin. So, in Alice in Wonderland, published six years after Origin, when Dodgson wrote the pool-of-tears scene, he seemed to look askance at Darwin.         
	As Alice swims in the salty water (perhaps a reference to the sea from where life emerged) with a host of other creatures, she is made to enact the primal drama of origin. Shrunk horribly by the gloves thrown at her by the white rabbit, Alice undergoes a physical levelling with the animals. She is even able to speak to them as if they are old friends going back a long way. John Tenniels illustration shows a monkeys head and the extinct bird, dodo. But the soberly comic chatter in this assembly makes it impossible to sustain the scientific analogy for long.         
	But the true force of Darwinism in nonsense literature comes through in the works of Sukumar Ray (1887-1923), the poet, printer, humorist and illustrator from Bengal. From his early poem, Khichudi, Ray disclosed a playfully witty, yet empathetic, understanding of the inner lives of animals. He not only created a menagerie of fantastic creatures here, but also endowed each of them with a fantasy life. In the poem, the duck (hans) fuses with a porcupine (sajaru) to become hansjaru, the caterpillar chooses to merge with the goat for mysterious reasons. Some of these strange meetings are self-conscious, as if out of some evolutionary design the best of two disparate worlds have conspired to become one: the lion with horns like the deer or the giraffe with the torso of a grasshopper. Such a mix-up, of herbivore and carnivore or winged and terrestrial beings, hints at  and parodies  an evolutionary process (like Darwins natural selection) that allows only the best features to endure by coming together.        
	The Darwinian urge in nature to favour the fittest is also explored in the figure of Kimbhut, another bizarre assembly of body parts giving rise to a hotchpotch animal. In the poem, Kimbhut, a sniffling, disgruntled creature longs for the voice of the cuckoo, the tail of an iguana, wings of a bird, the elephants snout, and the kangaroos legs. The end product is so fearfully ugly that it only inspires jeers. That Ray was deeply fascinated by Darwin is evident from the mini-biography he wrote for the young readers of the Sandesh magazine, which he edited. In that article, Ray explained the scientific premises of Darwins theories  why weaker species, unable to adapt themselves to changes in the environment, become extinct, how bodily features evolve through use and disuse.              
	The rationalism of this piece also pervades the origins of Rays nonsense animals, even though wish-fulfilment need not always bring a happy ending. Consider the fate of Kimbhut, who ends up as an incoherent jumble, or of the cow rattled by her own body half taken over by the cock. The poor cow wonders if she too has got that accursed topsy-turvy rog (disease). Unlike Dodgson and Lear, Ray based his nonsense on the bedrock of reason, however fragile or eclectic its outcome. No wonder Rays Professor Heshoram Hushiyar, fearless explorer in the depths of Karakoram, closely recalls Darwins insatiable curiosity. Here is Darwin pulling the tail of an angry lizard in The Voyage of the Beagle: At this he was greatly astonished, and soon shuffled up to see what was the matter; and then stared me in the face, as much as to say, What made you pull my tail? Professor Hushiyar was as nosy about the odd inhabitants of Mount Bandakush: the miserable Becharatherium, the madly yelling Chillanosaurus, the glutton Hyanglatherium or the poor, limping Lyangratherium.         
	Ray wrote with equal facility on a range of topics, from the pin-hole camera to comets. But natural history and wildlife brought out the best in him: wacky humour, a quaint eye for detail, keen wit and an endearing consciousness of lifes imperfections. With his interest in ever-changing forms, and the delights and dangers of such change, Ray captured a unique version of Darwinism in his works.

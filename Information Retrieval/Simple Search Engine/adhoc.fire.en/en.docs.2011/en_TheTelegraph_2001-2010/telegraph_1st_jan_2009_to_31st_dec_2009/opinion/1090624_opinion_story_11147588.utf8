The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | band of terror
                                                                                                                 BAND OF TERROR                                                    
	The rule of law, one of the pillars of a democratic polity and society, is based on an element of trust and reciprocity. It is not far-fetched to assume that those who expect protection under the rule of law are also upholders of it and respect it in their politics and in their daily lives. Terrorists and Maoists do not fall into this category since they believe that their political and socio-economic grievances entitle them to kill innocent people and those they consider to be their enemies. They have no respect for the rule of law and therefore, logically, they cannot expect any protection from it. Thus the Central governments decision to ban the Communist Party of India (Maoist) is entirely justified. The Union home minister, P. Chidambaram, was right when he described the outfit as a terror organization. The argument, made by the general secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), Prakash Karat, that the ban is meaningless since the party will regroup under other names is a piece of spurious logic. It bypasses the crucial point that no organization that promotes and advocates violence and thereby undermines the Indian Constitution and the rule of law can be allowed to function. Democracy cannot provide a license to agents of its own subversion.        
	Mr Karats statement and the hesitation of the Left Front government in West Bengal to implement the ban are evidence of the double standards of communists. The CPI(M) recognizes that the Maoists operating in large tracts of West Bengal are enemies of the party and of their government. It has no problems sending out a huge police force to crush the Maoists, but it is squeamish about banning them. If the chief minister of West Bengal, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, sees himself as a communist leader, he should remember that no communist regime would tolerate what the Maoists are doing. It will be an irony, of course, if Mr Bhattacharjee and his party  given their track record  suddenly become sponsors of communism with a human face. Moreover, Mr Bhattacharjee cannot overlook, once again, his duties as a chief minister. In that role, irrespective of what his party says, he has to quell the Maoist-led insurgency in Lalgarh. The ban for him is a convenient instrument, which he should grab and use to his advantage. That would show that he has learnt, at last, the distinction between party and government.

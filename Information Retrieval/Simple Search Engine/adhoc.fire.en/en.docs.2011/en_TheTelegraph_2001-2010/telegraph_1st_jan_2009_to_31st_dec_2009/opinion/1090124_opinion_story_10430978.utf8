The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | All in a days work
                                                                                                                 ALL IN A DAYS WORK                                                          
	If there is a first-past-the-post system in the contest of returning to work after childbirth, then it is not the justice minister of France, Rachida Dati, but Sarah Palin, then governor of Alaska, who should get the laurels. Ms Palin got back to her office full-steam three days after giving birth. But before admiration bursts its bounds, Ms Datis achievement must be put in perspective. She had a caesarean section, and she was back to work in five days, only two days over Ms Palin, when the minimum rest advised after such a surgery would be three weeks. She was as enviably fit and perfectly turned out as any Hollywood star stepping out after a coyly glorious delivery. More points to Ms Dati, surely? Poor Carme Chacn, the defence minister of Spain, who flew to Afghanistan to review the Spanish troops when seven months pregnant, actually took six whole weeks to come back to work after delivery. But she replaced a number of senior military officials within hours of her return, so everyone knew she was back with a bang.        
	Ms Chacn may have been  involuntarily  more sensible than Ms Palin and, more recently, Ms Dati, but good sense is not the issue here. Ms Datis rapid return has not made her popular among women who have been fighting for at least two generations for the right of pay-protected, job-protected maternity leave. While Britain has the most generous, and therefore the wisest and most civilized, rules of maternity leave, Ms Dati in France had 16 weeks of fully-paid leave to recover and to nurture her newborn. But why did she, or why do numerous women in high-powered corporate jobs and professional firms, feel the need to hit the ground running  like newly-elected American presidents  after giving birth? It is colossally stupid, for themselves and for their babies. And it is a greater stupidity to think that it somehow makes them equal to men. Men are not yet giving birth on a regular basis, so who are they competing with? Maybe, they just want to be patted on their backs by proving that the great and the powerful who have always believed women make an unnecessary fuss over pregnancy are absolutely right. They are as good as the women working in the fields in Asia and Africa, popping the baby out and rushing back to work. The mortality rate of mother and child in these countries does not form part of this argument.         
	So is it still insecurity that lurks behind the show of confidence and strength? It is a costly show, for it plunges thousands of women making role models of female politicians into uncertainty and guilt about their abilities. Ms Dati and her like-minded colleagues might try shaking themselves out of the school performance mode. Running a country is hardly like the show and tell hour.

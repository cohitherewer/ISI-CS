                                                                                                                 LOVE BY CHANCE                                                                  
	In the Mahabharat, Arjun won Draupadis hand by accomplishing two formidable tasks at her swayamvar. He strung a bow that none (save Karna) could lift, and then used the weapon to shoot a suspended target by looking at its reflection in the water. In the Vivel Swayamwar  a reality show which gives three young marriageable women an opportunity to choose their life partners on national television  the 12 men in the fray hope to marry one of the three girls with the help of a different kind of marksmanship. On Tuesday, the anchors had put the contestants to the test. They were asked to give any one of the three girls  the portly Tanaya, the giggling Tanima and a teary Koel  a gift of something they held precious.        
	Soon enough, the men arrived with their knick- knacks. Shankhadeep gifted Tanaya a pendant to keep her safe; Kunal presented a religious trinket to Tanaya (to ward off evil); Tanima received a mirror (or was it a picture frame?) from Atish; Pratim brought a pair of sunglasses for Tanima while Riddhi dabbed perfume on the wrists of all three women.         
	Meanwhile, as the gifts passed her by, Koel sniffled and claimed that she was touched by the presents the other two girls were receiving. Finally, there was something for her: Kingshuk brought a stole, and the girl beamed with renewed hope. Some of the gifts bore an ominous message. The divine pendant seemed to reinforce the clichd idea of feeble women in need of male protection. The danger lies in such protective supervision being televised as rightful affection. The sunglasses were equally illuminating, and represented the ties that bind beauty and the desire to own. Atish desires Tanima whose eyes he finds beautiful. But were the sunglasses meant to shield her beauty from the world, so that he could keep it for himself?         
	I could not dismiss what I saw as innocuous entertainment. The powers of reality television are such that they are capable of shaping minds, and this merits careful scrutiny. How damaging are the contents we consume, often passively, in the name of entertainment? Isnt this reality for sale, the product of intelligent commercial research? Most of all, what does our consumption tell us about ourselves and our voyeurism? But there was no time left to ponder, for the episode had reached a gripping climax. A letter had been found, informed the hosts, one which had upset the girls deeply: Tanima had stopped giggling, and even Koel didnt sniffle any longer. The culprit would be caught with the help of a handwriting test, and one of the suitors would also be eliminated by a vote.         
	The handwriting test confirmed that one of the suitors had indeed written the letter, but his identity was not revealed, possibly to sustain the healthy TRPs. Meanwhile, chirpy Riddhi found himself voted out as the girls complained that he had committed sacrilege by gifting the perfume not to one but to all three women.         
	Even as Riddhi bade goodbye, strumming a guitar and crooning Leaving on a Jet Plane, he looked happy. I thought he was glad that his fight for a bride was over. But no, it seemed he had bagged a stint in yet another reality show on a sister channel. Unlike life, there seems to be something for everyone on reality television.                          UDDALAK MUKHERJEE

	The prime minister used his keynote speech to the trades union conference last week to plaster over damaging treasury leaks on public-spending cuts and the cracks in government policy with pointless attacks on the Opposition. With his opinion poll ratings at rock bottom, playing petty politics and lying about public spending is not the way to go  he needs, at the very least, to appear to have a grasp on future policy and the economy, whether or not it is actually the case. The truth is, as we all know, the Conservative leadership and shadow government are as yet untested and only as appealing to floating voters as the government is not. Brown may be viewed as too flawed and depressed to remain Labour leader, but there are others around who could still give the Conservatives a serious run for their money.        
	The biggest egg in the Labour basket is Peter Mandelson, right in the middle of the wheeling and dealing he enjoys and is extraordinarily good at, so long as he doesnt overreach himself  this time, I suspect he wont. Mandelson remains as unpopular as ever with the Left and has never been short of enemies of any hue. Nonetheless, as he is pushed out on every occasion that we should be hearing from the prime minister, he is attaining the demeanour of an elder statesman, and sounds more as if he knows what he is talking about than anyone else. Well, he wont be leader and prime minister from his unelected seat in the House of Lords, but he can pull the strings and make the Conservatives look like inexperienced amateurs if he orchestrates a flawless Labour election campaign when the time comes. He certainly knows how.               
	That is all as may be, but my impression is that our politicians are currently shouting into empty rooms their audience isnt there and doesnt care. Perhaps this will change as Parliament revs up again. Members of Parliament were disastrously discredited by the expenses scandal, which may have gone quiet for now but will come back to bite one and all in an election campaign next year. We are about to hit party-conference season again, and a bit of interest will be drummed up, but probably not much in average British sitting rooms. Even news junkies would rather follow the international news that somehow seems, and probably is, so much more important than dreary domestic politics.        
	The international story is what affects us most over time, whether wars, climate change or economic highs and lows. The domestic political scene increasingly seems merely parochial, villagey infighting. We know that most of the major issues in our lives will be dealt with through international political consensus. Whether or not we agree with him on all counts, the leading role of President Obama in that consensus gives us a nice warm feeling, even if the gilt on his image at home has become a little less shiny.        
	Meanwhile, we are all out to play as the happy news pours in that the market economy, a year after the Lehman collapse, has survived. For the haves, it is true; the top executives are earning more than ever in basic salary even if publicly unacceptable bonuses have been reduced. Lesser survivors are bored with the gloom and are beginning to party again. The return to work at the end of a wet summer here has encouraged a general breaking out from numbing despondency  gallery openings, full restaurants all over London and a greater optimism, whether or not based on reality. God knows what is happening to the have-nots and the vast numbers of newly unemployed including this years school and university leavers. Those who can are out spending, and it is dangerously easy to put the blinkers on and think we are heading back to what we perceive as the good times.        
	It seems to me that there is a way to go for most people. Personally, I am still pinning my hopes on that one-in-however-many-million lottery win, but nothing like a few parties and free drinks to cheer things up. It will be interesting to see if delegates to the Party conferences over the next three weeks achieve a believable air of sober reflection and serious planning. The Conservative leadership must succeed in appearing humble in the face of general disaffection with politicians. David Cameron has made an art form of righteous indignation, even fury. He and his cohorts have to be deeply sensitive to the needs of the country as a whole, baiting their grimmer messages with something a little more upbeat for a Conservative future. They need to make very sure that their conservatism is seen to have a large, not a small, c. It may be unfair, but Cameron still smacks too much of old-world privilege for his own good and his man-of-the-people act has not been wholly successful.        
	Gordon Brown would do better if he managed to look less like the grim reaper and could appear comfortable in his own skin. He has to give a better impression of openness and honesty, to appear to have solid, reliable beliefs and policies, a vision of the country beyond the next election and a means to follow up words with implementation. I doubt it is possible for a leopard to change his spots to the extent that he will blossom anew in the image of leadership and regain public trust. As for the Liberal Democrats, who can tell? Currently, they look quite good, quite reasonable, relatively intelligent and completely irrelevant. They do seem to hold some appeal for the politically-minded young who see Labour as bankrupt and the Conservatives as overly exclusive, but I doubt any major effect on general-election results when young people must feel so completely let down by their elders and their leaders.              
	Many who will be first-time voters in the next general election left school this summer. The lucky ones have three years of university ahead of them before the horrors of the job search. A huge hike in university entrance numbers, together with more students staying to do further degrees in the absence of probable employment, has left others with the right qualifications disappointed and completely at a loss. The weight of numbers has caused huge problems with student loans, leaving some students who have places without the money to pay for tuition or maintenance. For others, there is no available accommodation. This is supposedly being rectified, but may result in more dropping out and more on the unemployment lists, adding their number to their immediate seniors who have lost their jobs on a first in, first out basis.         
	It is hard to see the attraction for them of any of our major political parties. They have all been tarred with the brush of dishonesty; their policies and agencies dont work and they continually mouth empty promises. There is an insistence from all parties that everyone should work, and yet there are no jobs to be had and life is too expensive to live. Why bother voting? In fact why bother at all? Im off to put the duvet back over my head until the next party.

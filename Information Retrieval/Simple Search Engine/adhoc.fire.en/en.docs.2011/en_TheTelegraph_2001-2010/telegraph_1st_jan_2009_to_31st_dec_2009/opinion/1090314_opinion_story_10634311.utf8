	The exhibition entitled Printing and Book Production in Bengal presented by the School of Cultural Texts and Records, Jadavpur University, at the Rabindranath Tagore Centre, Calcutta (February 14-21), adds quite a few details and fresh pieces of information to the already fairly well documented history of the coming of the book and the development of a rich book culture in Calcutta and eastern India. The origins, as documented in text, images, blocks, machinery etc. in the exhibition, go beyond the setting up of the first printing press in Calcutta in 1777 by James Augustus Hicky to the printing of Bengali characters from plates in Amsterdam in 1667. As the exhibition demonstrates so brilliantly within its limited scope and space, it was a culture that drew on a wide range of sources (indigenous and foreign), several languages and disciplines, several calligraphic and visual traditions, and above all, an evolving technology. The curators have taken care to highlight the personal contributions of the makers of this culture, the Europeans and the locals alike. The lucid captions (reproduced in the catalogue) tell the story illustrated in the carefully chosen images and objects.        
	The exhibition focuses on the slow evolution of the Bengali typefaces (Gwyn Headleys 2005 Encyclopaedia of Fonts makes the useful distinction: Typefaces are hot metal, fonts are digital) through a series of graphic innovations, every single one of them a triumph of intricate design and craftsmanship, particularly for the conjoined consonants. The story is brought up to the era of digital technology, with a set of samples of designs for Bengali digital fonts developed by Linotype-Hell AG, preserved at the University of Reading, and lent by Fiona Ross.        
	As the story unfolds in the meticulously designed exhibition, one reads the drama of the making of books, in which men and machines, the finest aesthetic sensibility and cold efficiency, meaning and design, the eye and the hand, and metal and heat are yoked together at every point. The exhibition identifies the masters and pioneers in this narrative, and records their individual contributions. The muster roll includes Wilkins, Ward, the Marshmans and the Careys and Lawson; Rammohun Roy, Vidyasagar, Radhakanta Deb, Rabindranath Tagore, the brothers Rangalal and Trailokyanath Mukhopadhyay, father and son Upendrakishore and Sukumar; Nrityalal Shil, Ramdhan Swarnakar, Annadaprasad Bagchi and Suhrid Chakrabarty. The exhibition throws up stories of historic transmissions, associations and collaborations: for example, the gift of a platen press received by Tagore at Lincoln, US (the press itself on display at the exhibition; picture), brought over to Santiniketan, where Sukumar Ray trained students in printing, leading to the development of the university press and the Visva-Bharati Granthan Vibhag that set new standards for the publication of Tagores own works and launched the Visvavidya Granthamala, a series of popular introductory monographs in Bengali on a wide range of subjects, almost all of them written by the foremost experts in the respective fields.        
	With its emphasis on the early history of printing in Bengali, and the development of the Bengali typefaces, the exhibition takes only a cursory look at the artistic achievements in the design and layout of pages and covers in Bengali publishing from the 1960s to the 1980s before the technological revolution of the 1990s radically transformed the making of the books  a limitation that opens up the scope for an exhibition focusing on the artistic creativity of Annada Munshi, Makhanlal Dutta Gupta, Ranen Ayan Dutta, Raghunath Goswami (particularly in the periodical, Saraswat), Shyamal Ghose (in his layout for the Nakshatraprakash playscripts), and, of course, Purnendu Pattrea (especially in his Pratikshan phase).        
	The competence of the School of Cultural Texts and Records in setting up an exhibition of this worth and standard will naturally prompt viewers and lovers of books (still a considerable community in this city) to expect more exhibitions from them  maybe on the new, post-Independence advertising agenda and book design, and the illuminated book, and painter designing/illustrating books (on the lines of the historic 1983 Berlin exhibition, From Odyssey to Ulysses).        
	I could detect only two typos in the captions with the exhibits, and seven in the catalogue  no mean achievement, given the declining standards in Calcutta and Delhi in correct publishing.

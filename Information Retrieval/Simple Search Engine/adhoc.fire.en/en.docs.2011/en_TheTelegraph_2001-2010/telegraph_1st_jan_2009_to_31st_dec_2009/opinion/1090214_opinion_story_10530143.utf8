The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | time for A reality check
                                                                                                                 TIME FOR A REALITY CHECK                                                          
	Those who wanted speed will grumble; those who looked for results have reasons for some satisfaction. Islamabad, after dragging its feet and contradicting itself since the end of November, has been forced to admit that part of the conspiracy to attack Mumbai on November 26 last year had been hatched in Pakistan. The verb, forced, in the previous sentence is used advisedly, since initially there was more than a little reluctance on the part of the Pakistan government and the Pakistan intelligence establishment to even countenance the claim made by India that the footprints went all the way back to the interior of Pakistan. India, over the last few months, has piled evidence upon evidence to substantiate its claim and to convince the Pakistan government that it could deny facts only at its own peril. There are good reasons to believe that there was considerable pressure on Islamabad from Washington to stop denying the truth.        
	The admission from Pakistan is a first and important step. While it is welcomed in India, it cannot result in complete satisfaction. The admission has to lead to action and to the ultimate dismantling of all terrorist outfits within Pakistan. There has to be a realization within the Pakistan establishment that terrorism is a threat to the region and to the globe. Any kind of encouragement to terrorists can only be a recipe for further, and bigger, disasters. It is perhaps not entirely a coincidence that the admission from Islamabad came in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist outrage in Kabul.        
	Indias obvious delight at the admission from Pakistan cannot deflect India from the main task of keeping the pressure on Pakistan. An olive branch of co-operation has been extended from across the border, and India should seize it and exploit it to the full. India too has a responsibility. If investigations unearth that the attack on Mumbai had some element of local and ground-level collaboration, then that should not be denied or brushed under the carpet. Terrorists and all those who sail with them, irrespective of their nationality, are people who should be charged and duly punished. Petty issues of nationalist ego and foreign- policy brownie points should not be brought into consideration.        
	As an afterword, all sceptics of Indias closeness to the United States of America should pause to ponder the benefits that have accrued to India from this relationship. It is doubtful if without the full cooperation of Washington, progress could have been made both within India and in Pakistan. Just as people in Pakistan have to wake up to harsh realities concerning terrorism, some people in India have to surrender their outworn anti-Americanism and accept that Indian foreign policy cannot be determined by ideology, but must be grounded in the furthering of Indian interests.

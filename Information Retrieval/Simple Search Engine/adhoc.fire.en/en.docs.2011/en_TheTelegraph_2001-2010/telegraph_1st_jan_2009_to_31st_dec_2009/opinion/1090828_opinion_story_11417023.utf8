	The decision of the Supreme Court judges to place information about their assets in the public domain is evidence of the judiciarys willingness to, and concrete attempt at, reforming itself. The Supreme Court had so far contested all suggestions to make such classified information public on the grounds that the step would undermine the credibility of the judiciary and compromise its independence. There are at least two recent instances of this reluctance. In the first, the apex court challenged the order from the Central Information Commission to disclose if judges were keeping the Chief Justice of India posted on their assets. Under a 1997 resolution, the Supreme Court had itself resolved to bring into effect such a norm for its judges, and the CIC was only asking for information on its compliance. In the second instance, the Chief Justice gave permission for the introduction of a bill in the Rajya Sabha on the controversial subject of the judges declaration of assets only on the ground that it would not make members of the judiciary amenable to public scrutiny. The introduction of the bill was stalled in the Upper House of Parliament for its manifest favouring of the judicial fraternity. By voluntarily accepting the publicizing of judges assets, the Supreme Court has not only removed what had been a bitter source of acrimony and tension between the judiciary and the legislature and resisted an imposition from outside, but has also improved its public image. Its dogged refusal to submit to what it had made mandatory for politicians was raising serious doubts in the public mind about judicial accountability.        
	In India, the judiciary has always held that it is accountable to no one but itself. If this dictum is necessary to uphold the independence of the judiciary, it also imposes on the judiciary the responsibility for self-correction. This fact is now being increasingly voiced from within the legal fraternity. Therefore, the Supreme Court, by relenting on the judges assets issue, has listened as much to itself as to the popular will. The Supreme Court should keep up the momentum of self-reform by systematizing the declaration procedure. The high courts, which are still beyond the ambit of this regulation, should also voluntarily accept the norm for its members. Only strict transparency and accountability can assure the judiciary its independence and sanctity.

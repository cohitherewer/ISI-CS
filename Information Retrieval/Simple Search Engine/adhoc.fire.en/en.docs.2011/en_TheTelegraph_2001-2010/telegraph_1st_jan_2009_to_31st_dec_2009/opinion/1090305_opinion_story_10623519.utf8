                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Outstanding performance                  
	Sir  Manini Chatterjees Goodbye, Speaker (Feb 27) is one of the best tributes to the outgoing Lok Sabha Speaker, Somnath Chatterjee. Often called the headmaster of the Lok Sabha, he rebuked members of parliament sometime back: I hope that all of you are defeated in the election I hope the people give their verdict properly. You have to be taught a lesson. But the very next day Chatterjee regretted this, saying that he had made the comments in frustration.          
	Winner of the Outstanding Parliamentarian award, Chatterjee began 39 years of his parliamentary career in the fifth Lok Sabha. I agree with the prime ministers praise that the Speakers office has been truly elevated and dignified by Chatterjees presence. When he refused to resign from his post as Speaker in spite of his party having withdrawn support to the government, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) expelled him, as if forgetting that he had been the leader of the party in the Lok Sabha for years. The prime minister rightly said that he had raised the bar for those to follow. If the country is proud of its democracy then we should not forget the contribution of a parliamentarian like Chatterjee.          
	Yours faithfully,        Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad            
	Sir  Somnath Chatterjee will be remembered for his admirable performance as the Lok Sabha Speaker. He had to face humiliation from his party when he chose his duty to the nation, that of conducting proceedings in the Lok Sabha, over dancing to the tunes of the CPI(M). The nation should honour him by upgrading the post of Lok Sabha Speaker to that of a second vice-president and making him the first incumbent to the post. Such a system is also otherwise necessary to ensure that a person above party politics presides over the Lok Sabha proceedings. If this is done, in future the president as well as the two vice-presidents may be simultaneously elected in the manner followed in the election of the president. In case there is a mid-term vacancy in the presidents post, the senior vice-president could be made president for the rest of the term. But every person elected president or vice-president must quit active politics or party affiliation for ever. Otherwise, all their post-retirement benefits, including pension and accommodation, may be forfeited.          
	Yours faithfully,        Subhash Chandra Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi            
	Sir  Somnath Chatterjee has set an example as a man of firm resolution, who adhered to his ideology and beliefs till the last day in the post of the Speaker of the 14th Lok Sabha. He was assailed by many difficulties during his tenure, and must have been mentally torn too, but the firmness of decision that he showed cannot be represented through mere figures of speech. He faced alienation from the Left in order to do justice to the Speakers chair. The House will remember this man for many years because of his strength of character and his courage in the face of challenges.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Sumita Sarma, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The manner in which Somnath Chatterjee handled the last Lok Sabha proceedings was really praiseworthy. He showed the way at difficult moments, for example, in the cash-for-questions case, when, as an upholder of the Constitution and a reputed lawyer himself, he respectfully returned the Supreme Courts notice regarding the expulsion of those members of parliament implicated in the scandal. It was unbecoming of his own party to heckle him for his refusal to resign as Speaker when the CPI(M) withdrew support to the government. Without Chatterjee, the performance of the party was actually lacklustre. If the top leadership goes through the performance of the 14th Lok Sabha, nobody would be found who could match Chatterjees initiative.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Jayanta Datta, Hooghly

                
	Sir  Somnath Chatterjee said that he wanted to retire and was not interested in contesting the Lok Sabha elections. But one of his admirers wanted to persuade him to contest by sending him a demand draft. I wish that more elderly politicians, like Arjun Singh and others, would follow Chatterjees example and make way for youngsters.           
	That would also help the country make proper progress by being freed of the divisions into minority and majority that are meant only to garner votes and to ensure the enjoyment of power.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
B.S. Ganesh, Bangalore

                
	Sir  For Pinarayi Vijayan, the state secretary of the Kerala CPI(M), Somnath Chatterjee is the biggest betrayer of the working class. In his comment, Vijayan, who has been implicated in the SNC Lavalin graft case concerning a deal brokered when he was state power minister in 1998, extolled the leadership qualities of the Kerala chief minister, V.S. Achuthanandan. The state party secretary was responding to another comment on betrayers made by G. Sudhakaran, the minister for co-operation. All this mud-slinging is associated with problems in the Kerala unit. Leaders of the CPI(M) say that there is nobody bigger than the party. Who is this party? Does it consist of just those who attend the area committee offices of the CPI(M)?          
	Yours faithfully,      
K. James Williams, Alappuzha, Kerala

                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Left without choice                  
	Sir  The founder-president of the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, Shibu Soren, took over as the chief minister of Jharkhand last August without bothering to give up his Lok Sabha seat. Now, quite expectedly, he has lost the assembly by-elections. Following his defeat, he should have accepted the peoples verdict and quitted office on moral grounds. However, taking advantage of a clause in the Constitution that sets a six-month time margin for a chief minister to step down on failing to get re-elected to the state legislature, Soren was unwilling to leave. He even started bargaining with the United Progressive Alliance for a ministerial berth in the Union government till collective pressure made him resign.           
	It seems as if the crisis Soren created, by refusing to budge initially, can only occur in a country like India, where rules are framed to favour politicians. The chief minister of Karnataka, B.S. Yeddyurappa, poached MLAs from the opposition by asking them to give up their assembly seats and seek re-election on his partys tickets, thus helping his government get absolute majority. Instead of raising objections, the Election Commission conducted those by-polls, wasting public money that should have been spent on other, more useful, projects.           
	Yours faithfully,      
K.R. Prem Kumar, Bangalore

                
	Sir  It was highly immoral of Shibu Soren to hold on to the chief ministerial chair even after losing the by-polls. Soren is one of those politicians who can go to any extent to gratify selfish interests. He did not resign his Lok Sabha seat even after taking oath as the chief minister and took unfair advantage of rules set by the Constitution. These regulations should be simplified so that a sitting MP or MLA is compelled to give up his earlier seat before filing nomination for a new one.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Subhash Chandra Agrawal, Delhi 

      
	Sir  It is heartening that voters have put Shibu Soren in his place. Soren should be debarred from contesting any further elections. The Congress should not try to play safe, but keep him out of the UPA. Politicians like Soren, with a criminal record, should be kept behind bars. There should be strict laws to prevent convicts from running elections.           
	Yours faithfully,         M.M. Kale, Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh             
	Equal opportunity          
	Sir  Indian doctors have expressed concerns over the possibility that the government might soon allow non-resident Indian professionals to practice in India (Offer to open doors for NRI professionals, Jan 9). It has been demanded that equal opportunity of employment on a reciprocal basis must be given by foreign countries before the government allows NRI professionals to work in India. A member of the Medical Council of India, the central regulatory body for practice of medicine, has even declared that Indian laws must be changed before NRIs (who have adopted foreign citizenship) are allowed to practice. I fail to understand the basis of such ridiculous demands. The practice of medicine has absolutely no link with the citizenship of the doctor. A doctor does not have to be a citizen of the United States of America to practice in there. Many NRI doctors, who have migrated from India but still retain their Indian citizenship, can practice in the US. All that they require is a registration number or licence from any of the state medical boards after successful completion of their residency programme.           
	Most NRI doctors living in the US have obtained their preliminary medical degree from India; in fact, they can get their registration number only after successfully completing MBBS from a recognized institution in India. So why should these doctors require permission to practice in India? Restrictions on earning money may be imposed on an NRI doctor with a foreign citizenship.           
	Indian law allows Overseas Citizens of India to work in the country with limited restrictions on some government jobs. Most NRI doctors who also hold the OCI status (or dual citizenship) should not have any problem working for private hospitals in India. And, by the way, the reverse is also true: as long as an Indian doctor is given a licence by a state medical board in the US and has a valid permit to work in America, he can practice there irrespective of the status of his citizenship.           
	Yours faithfully,         Kunal Saha, Ohio, US            
	Wishful thinking          
	Sir  As the article, Enter the laptop kids (Jan 12), points out, the global education experiment of having One Laptop Per Child is indeed a noble plan for integrating digital learning with classroom education. But the prospect of this idea taking off in developing countries appears to be slim. The economies of most developing countries are not conducive to launch such an ambitious plan. Moreover, implementation of the OLPC scheme would require uninterrupted supply of energy, especially in rural areas. In some states, even the cities do not have proper access to electricity.           
	If this plan is introduced at the primary level, children are unlikely to develop either the habit of reading or of writing longhand. Moreover, it is probably going to keep students increasingly confined to the classroom, making them lose interest in extra-curricular activities. The education ministry must critically review this proposal to see if it is at all necessity. Teachers are trying their best to make the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan work. In a country where certain basic infrastructure is lacking, can the quality of education be improved simply by replacing books with laptops ?                     
	Yours faithfully,        Kranti D. Khawas, Siliguri

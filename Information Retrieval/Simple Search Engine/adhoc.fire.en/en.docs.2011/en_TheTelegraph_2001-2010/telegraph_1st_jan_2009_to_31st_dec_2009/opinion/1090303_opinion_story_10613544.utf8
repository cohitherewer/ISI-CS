	No matter what politicians say, an electoral alliance is ultimately all about hard-nosed bargains over seats. No alliance is in place until the seat-sharing talks are concluded to the satisfaction of all sides. It would thus be premature to assume that the Congress and the Trinamul Congress have sealed their alliance for the coming Lok Sabha polls in West Bengal. The right notes have been struck, and an expression of intent exchanged between Pranab Mukherjee and Mamata Banerjee. But even Mr Mukherjees statement that the two parties have agreed in principle to jointly contest the elections is no more than a first step. Both sides know that the real work on alliance-building will start with the more demanding task of the sharing of seats. Both sides will have to weigh the peculiar political equations in the state. While the Trinamul Congress is unquestionably the biggest Opposition force, it now has only one Lok Sabha seat  held by Ms Banerjee herself. The Congress, on the other hand, is clearly the weaker of the two, but it had as many as six seats. It is easy for Ms Banerjee to argue that the two parties shares of seats in the last Lok Sabha do not reflect, therefore, their true political strength. But the Congress cannot buy such an argument. An alliance with the Trinamul Congress will make sense for the Congress only if it helps the latter get more seats than the last time.         
	All this is not to suggest that the alliance may not materialize. In fact, everything suggests that conditions are right for such an alliance. For all the unpredictability that Ms Banerjee has come to personify, she has finally made a clean break from the Bharatiya Janata Party. Such an unequivocal break has always been the Congresss pre-condition for an alliance with her party. Again, for all her high-sounding rhetoric, she knows fighting the Marxists along with the Congress is a better bet than fighting them alone. The results of the assembly elections in 2006 proved that once again. Add to these the current trend of the erosion in the Marxists vote and support base, reflected several times since last Mays panchayat polls and now by their humiliating defeat in the bypoll to the Bishnupur (West) assembly constituency. All these make it just the right moment for such an alliance. But alliances can fall through despite favourable conditions. If the Congress has its compulsions for the alliance, so has Ms Banerjee.

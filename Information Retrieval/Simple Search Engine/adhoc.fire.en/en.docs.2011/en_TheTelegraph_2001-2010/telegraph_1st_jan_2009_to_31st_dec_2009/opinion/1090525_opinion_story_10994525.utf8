	What follows is intended as a piece of entertainment. If it does not entertain, it should at least cause some outrage, which is not bad catharsis either.         
	Please take a close look at the names chosen for the teams participating in the just concluded Indian Premier League: Rajasthan Royals, Deccan Chargers, Chennai Super Kings, Kolkata Knight Riders, Delhi Daredevils, Kings XI Punjab, Royal Challengers Bangalore, and, finally, Mumbai Indians. They, at least most of them, offer a flavour of the Middle Ages: kings, super-kings, knights and cavalry riders jostle against one another. In the opening decade of the 21st century, T20 cricket is an extraordinary concoction of instant communications and instant entertainment, and yet it is impossible to get away from the make-believe of the medieval world. The name, Mumbai Indians, belongs to a slightly different genre, and provides a link with the United States of America  the centrepiece of the 21st century Indian dream  as well as with the most popular game in that country, baseball, being almost a buddy of the New York Yankees. Is not T20 in fact baseball in the garb of cricket? As in baseball, the coach is the supreme boss, hitting sixes is the surrogate of home-runs, dug-outs, time outs and double plays are direct imports from baseball, so are the vacant-looking cheergirls.         
	This is the puzzling part of it. The indolent medieval days have zero relevance to the IPL universe of high technology and American briskness. The Indian psyche moves with the times, but refuses to do so too. It insists on reserving niches for emperors, kings, princes and knights. Two into three may not go, but, in the Indian milieu, it is so arranged that the Middle Ages co-exist with high-speed fun; there is, we are being told, no contradiction between bang-bang cricket and the lugubrious grandeur of royal pageantry.               
	Has not precisely that kind of fusion emerged as the signature tune of the Indian polity? The worlds largest democracy votes, but, while voting, it cannot forsake the medieval legacy. Voters exercise their free choice, but they opt for medieval-type overlords, in many instances, for dynasties. The endeavour to establish a democratically elected monarchy at the national level has never had a surcease, the Nehru-Gandhis have played a most helpful role in this effort. Indira Gandhis Emergency was an aberration. Since then, the dynasty has not put one foot wrong.         
	There have, of course, been other problems  for India, pardon the sacrilege, is not exactly a nation, it is a conglomeration of nationalities made up of caste, clan, ethnic and denominational groups. In the medieval era, only two castes mattered: the priests and the warriors; the warriors set up the kingdom and the priests acted as their ministers. Kingdoms were usually modest-sized, and featured at most two languages, the language of the court and that of the subjects. The linguistic dichotomy was not much of a headache since the humbler folk as a rule kept their distance from royalty, the expression of adulation from afar was enough. In exigencies, the services of dubashis were called for.         
	Complications could have arisen in case kingdoms widened into empires. That happened only rarely. The Mauryas, the Guptas and the Mughals won wars and, in the process, expanded their command over far-flung territories where different languages were spoken. These empires, however, were, for the most part, loose-limbed entities; emperors limited themselves to extracting tributes from the chiefs of conquered lands. Non-involvement with local issues was the key element of imperial policy.        
	The situation changed with the advent of the raj. Once the British decided to build an empire in India, they really meant it. They set their heart on total administrative integration. The message went out loud and clear: one might speak a different language, or flaunt a different culture, from ones neighbours; no matter, all are nonetheless conqu-ered, subjugated people who must swear, together, undying loyalty to the British crown. The constituents of the Indian empire speaking different tongues and often bearing distinct ethnic attributes  had to go along with the arrangement. What came about in the wash was the phantom of Indian nationalism. There was, of course, always an empirical correlate of an imagined Indian ethos, just as there was, epoch after epoch, a European ethos. But Europe was never thought of as one integrated country or a single nation-state. Similarly, no such a thing as the Indian State existed before the British arrived on the scene. In that sense, the empire of India was a force majeure. True, Gandhi Maharaj tried hard to weld a nation out of the forced homogeneity engineered by the alien rulers. But the caste and denominational barriers frustrated him; besides, his choice of metaphor, Ram Rajya, was no help.        
	Once the British realized their time was up, they quit. While quitting, they read the signs in their own manner and trisected the empire. Even after Pakistan was separated, India, however, remained an almost unbelievable collage of languages, ethnicities, caste groups and other demi-nationalities.         
	Post-1947, these nationalities chose to live together largely because of inertia: the British had once brought them together under one administrative umbrella  there it was. During the first few decades following Independence, the distinctive personae of these nationality groups lay more or less dormant. That was a temporary situation though. Events have moved fast in the past quarter of a century. Different nationality groups, often wearing the mask of caste, linguistic or ethnic aspirations, have increasingly come to assert their presence. The country is in the process of returning to its pre-British geography: a cluster of settlements randomly distributed over so many thousands of square kilometres. These settlements share a vague Indian tradition, they have, in addition, an overlap of instincts, habits and prejudices. But, outstripping the attributes of commonness is the urge to assert the separate identity of each one.               
	The outcome of this years Lok Sabha poll may prima facie give a different impression. First impressions are most of the time not a true reflection of underlying reality. For  let us be candid about it  regional consciousness continues to be a basic issue of concern, which is why we get interested to know how Gujarat votes, how Tamil Nadu votes, and so on, it is no longer the people of India, but peoples.         
	With rising levels of awareness about their rights and prerogatives, the people constituting the republic of India could have walked away from one another. They have not, a special species of yeast binds them together. And this is where the IPL story comes into relevance. The linguistic, caste and ethnic nationalities are at odds with one another, but each of them loves to romanticize the Middle Ages. Each votes distinctly, but prefers to vote for a royalty or its proxy. A national dynasty has already provided three de jure prime ministers and one de facto one. The 2009 Lok Sabha poll outcome has paved the way for the installation of a fourth prime minister from the family. It has also provided confirmation of the hypothesis that, while the demi-nationalities inhabiting India may squabble among themselves, and now and then go their different ways, they are still impelled by a common passion: they must have royalty around. They are apart from one another, but joined on one particular issue: they are determined to present to the world, with a flourish, the concept of a new institution: a democratically elected monarchy.         
	There is just one residual problem. A democratically elected hereditary monarchy may tend to excite the imagination of copycats, particularly at the regional level. Signs are already evident of a development along these lines; local dynasties are tending to be a dime a dozen. In a distant future, some of them could coalesce and challenge the hegemony of the democratically elected monarch at the Centre. What could then ensue is a War of Roses, or a succession of such wars: we will then be back, with a vengeance, to the Middle Ages.

	In his May budget, Pranab Mukherjee repealed the fringe benefit tax, which his predecessor, P. Chidambaram, had imposed in 2005. It was a tax to be paid by the employer on all perquisites, including those whose benefit did not go to any particular employee. Mr Chidambaram then realized that he had left out certain employers, such as individuals, joint Hindu families and trusts; so, in 2007, he amended the rules to bring them into the net. Apart from the monetary burden, taxation of perquisites forces employers to maintain complicated records. So it was unpopular. Bearing in mind the exigencies of the forthcoming general election, Mr Mukherjee abolished the tax. But the canny revenue officials always keep a trick or two up their sleeves. They have a rule buried in their copious rule book, which makes perquisites taxable in the hands of employees. On December 18, they slipped in an amendment to the rule under which even contributions to a superannuation fund and stock options will be taxed as perquisites, not to mention the salaries of the driver and gardener provided by an employer. Now employees will have to recalculate their perquisites during this tax year, and pay tax on the entire years perquisites in the remaining three months of the year. They can still avoid the bother if they can persuade their employers to declare that the perquisite was given for an official purpose. But that will only make employers lives miserable. So, some pained confabulations between employers and employees are in order.        
	In effect, therefore, Mr Mukherjees repeal of the FBT was repeal of the name, not repeal of the tax; the revenue department had hidden provisions which made perquisites taxable anyway, and now they have called a few other things perquisites and subjected them to tax. Poor salaried men will soon be wondering if the FBT was not better than the complicated rules of the Central Board of Direct Taxes.        
	In principle, it is unobjectionable that income should be taxed by whatever name it is called. Taxation of salaries always creates an incentive to call them by a different name, so most countries tax benefits given under other names. But income should be taxed without making the taxpayers life a nightmare. Hence, if perquisites must be taxed, they should be taxed in the hands of the employer, who has to maintain accounts anyway. They should be taxed at a low, flat rate, to keep things simple. Instead of complicated rules specifying particular benefits as subject to tax, a general rule taxing all benefits should be introduced, and exceptions given therefrom. Amongst those exceptions must be all benefits given towards making the employees future more secure, whether they are called pension, superannuation, or employee stock ownership plan. For the government has given long and deep thought to their taxation, and settled upon the exempt-exempt-tax principle. Let it stick to its resolve for once.

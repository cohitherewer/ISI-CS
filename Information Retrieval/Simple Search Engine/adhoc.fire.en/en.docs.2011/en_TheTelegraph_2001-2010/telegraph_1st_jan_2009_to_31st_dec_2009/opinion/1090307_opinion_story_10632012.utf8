	The Madrigal Singers (Calcutta School of Music, February 18) were a delightful mid-week surprise. Founded 10 years ago by Neecia Majolly with the aim of reviving the glorious age of Renaissance music, the group consists of Carola Winnie (alto), Charan Raj (tenor and percussionist), Anit Kurien (bass and precision track button operator), Jonas Olsen (tenor/countertenor) and Majolly herself who sings an unbelievably high and pure soprano and plays a nifty descant recorder.        
	The voices are perfectly balanced and pitched, most significantly in the controlled, closely harmonized chromatic passages in Cease Sorrows Now by Thomas Weelkes. They sang religious, romantic and naughtily humorous songs, nicely distributing the motet, the ayre and the ballet to form a contrasting repertoire. Singing a cappella most of the time, they made an unusual entrance up the aisle with the Douce Dame by Guillaume de Machaut, creating an instant rapport with the audience.        
	Brief and witty introductions by Majolly preceded each song and her solo of eight miniature pieces for the descant recorder was precisely musical. One rarely hears music of this era anywhere in India, and this was an evening of different, yet beautiful, music from the Western classical repertoire of choral music.

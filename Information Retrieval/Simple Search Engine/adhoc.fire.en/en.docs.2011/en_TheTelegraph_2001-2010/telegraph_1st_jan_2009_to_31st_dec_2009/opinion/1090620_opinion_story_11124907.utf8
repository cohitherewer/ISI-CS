                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Please turn them off                  
	Sir  One morning I decided to take my morning walk outside the confines of our housing estate, and I had a lot of trouble believing what I saw. The streetlights were on in broad daylight  the time was 5.45 am. On another day, I again saw the streetlights on, at around 5.30 in the evening, along the stretch of Diamond Harbour Road from Shakherbazar to Chowrasta. These were sodium vapour lamps, rating at least 250 watts each. The municipal authorities are contributing to the waste of our natural resources and of the taxpayers money.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Dissent and distress          
	Sir  Malvika Singhs piece, A party in deep peril (June 16), perceptively reflects on the sorry state of affairs afflicting the Bharatiya Janata Party. The party messed up on many issues during electioneering and is now facing the consequences. The clamour for change in the leadership stems primarily from its clogged mindset on the question of ideological priorities. Its focus on paranoiac Hindutva under the pressure of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh has placed it in a spot in terms of fulfilment of its electoral expectations.           
	A large chunk of its cadre and leaders is visibly disillusioned with the culture of the coterie politics that has surfaced as the hallmark of the Advani era. The most articulate among those critical of L.K. Advanis style of functioning was the partys senior leader, Yashwant Sinha, who resigned from all party posts in a huff. Jaswant Singh and Sudheendra Kulkarni also raised strident voices of dissent.          
	Malavika Singh has made no bones about describing the BJP as an intellectually-closed party. The future will show where the party stands and how it comes to grips with reality to reverse its political fortunes.          
	Yours faithfully,      
P.B. Saha, Calcutta

                
	Sir  With sharp criticism of the BJP from Yashwant Sinha, the bickerings within the most disciplined party have come to the fore yet again. The post-poll period has been quite tempestuous for the BJP with different protagonists seeking to pull the party in different directions. This is uncharacteristic of the party that always claimed to be free from the baggage of the Congress, which is known for internecine fighting. It appears that having enjoyed the fruits of power, the party leaders cannot digest defeat, which is very common in parliamentary democracy. They are aggressively indulging in name-calling and blame-games to justify the unexpected defeat.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Bichu Muttathara, Pune 

                
	Sir  Both Yashwant Sinha, the former vice-president of the BJP, and Shyam Razak, the general secretary of the Rashtriya Janata Dal, have quit their parties despite enjoying important ministerial posts. This shows that these politicians are fair-weather friends, and have no principles.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

                
	Sir  At a time when the BJP has to consolidate itself into a powerful Opposition, it is sad that there is no cooperation and understanding among its leaders. A strong opposition is an important feature of an effective democracy, if only to monitor the irregularities of the ruling formation.           
	Members of the BJP have to jettison their egos and come together to maintain discipline. The Congress will only stand to gain if the BJP becomes any weaker. The BJPs weakness will allow the Nehru dynasty to flourish, supported by mini-dynasties in the states. Real achievements and qualifications will be ignored for the sake of family connections. The BJP should unite, and leaders like Advani have a major role to play in this.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Jay Dinakar, Pine Brook, US

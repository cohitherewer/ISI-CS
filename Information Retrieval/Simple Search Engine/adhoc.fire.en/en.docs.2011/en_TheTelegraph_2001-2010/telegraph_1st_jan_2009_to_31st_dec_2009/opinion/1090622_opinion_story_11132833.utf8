                                                                                                                 THE SECRET MUSIC                                  FIFTH COLUMN - Gwynne Dyer                              
	The rules for street demonstrations are different in Iran. Even in the most oppressive states, rulers know that outbursts of popular anger should be contained with as little violence as possible: the authorities always see deadly force as the final resort. Whereas in Iran, killing demonstrators practically guarantees that the authorities will lose in the end.         
	The demonstrations in Tehran have grown bigger every day since the presidential election results were announced. The police and various paramilitary forces arrested and beat up hundreds, but the first shots were not heard until a couple of days later. That was not just good luck. Most Iranians are Shia Muslims, and Shias have a great reverence for martyrdom. Kill a demonstrator, and you create a martyr. Kill a hundred, and you create a revolution. That was how the Shah was driven from power 30 years ago.        
	The crowds demonstrating against the Shahs tyranny, his brutal secret police and stridently secular policies in 1978-79, were almost entirely non-violent. Nevertheless, they were shot down in their hundreds by the forces of law and order which could not find any other way of dispersing them.        
	But the protesters kept coming back, with the dead in their arms  then 40 days later, when the mourning period was over, they were back on the streets again, offering themselves up once more to be killed. No regime can go on for long once that starts happening.         
	That is the secret music that drives the dance on Tehrans streets today. The regime of the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and the re-elected president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, knows that it must quell the protests without killing the demonstrators and triggering a cycle of martyrdom. And the demonstrators know (though they wont admit it openly) they need martyrs.        
	Did the regime really rig the election? There were no impartial foreign observers with free access to the polling stations to offer an unbiased opinion, but circumstantial evidence gives cause for suspicion. The normal three-day verification and declaration was skipped, and Ahmadinejads victory was proclaimed only two hours after the polls closed.                
	More like raindrops        
	There was a curious uniformity in the results from very different parts of the country. For example, even in Tabriz, the home city of the leading opposition candidate, Mir Hossein Mousavi, it was alleged that Ahmadinejad had won 57 per cent of the vote. Yet, the overwhelming majority of people in Tabriz are Azeris, who normally show a strong bias for ethnic Azeri candidates like Moussavi. Above all, the margin by which Ahmadinejad is said to have won  63 per cent versus 34 per cent for Mousavi  seems incredible to most urban, middle-class Iranians. They would have accepted a close result, with both the leading candidates coming in under 50 per cent and the other candidates dropping out for the second round. They would even have accepted a narrow victory for Ahmadinejad in the second round, but this just does not ring true for them.        
	If this is only a few days of protests about a stolen election in a country, which is only half-democratic anyway, then it doesnt matter very much. If it turns out to be the straw that broke the camels back, then it is a very big deal indeed.        
	It could be, because 30-year-old revolutions tend to have a big problem with a younger generation that benefited from some aspects of the revolution (the vast majority of young Iranians are literate), but which chafes at its restrictions.         
	History does not run on rails. Its more like raindrops running down a window-pane, their course determined by tiny imperfections in the glass or fly-spots on the surface. If more than a dozen or so protesters are killed on the streets of Tehran, then the regime will be in truly serious danger. Even if Ahmadinejad really did win.

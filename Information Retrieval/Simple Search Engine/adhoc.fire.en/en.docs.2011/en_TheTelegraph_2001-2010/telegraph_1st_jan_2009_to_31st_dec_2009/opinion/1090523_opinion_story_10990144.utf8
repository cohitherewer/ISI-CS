                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Saved by good sense                  
	Sir  The best thing to emerge from this general election is that corrupt, casteist and unprincipled politicians such as Lalu Prasad, Ramvilas Paswan, Mulayam Singh Yadav, Mayavati, J. Jayalalithaa or Sharad Pawar will not be able to call the shots in government-formation. The country has been saved from the leadership of this unscrupulous lot, any one of whom could have landed the top job had there been a fractured verdict. Voters in West Bengal have matured enough to show the door to members of parliament who regarded themselves kings of their constituencies.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Kajal Chatterjee, Calcutta

      
	Risk factor          
	Sir  The Supreme Court of India has awarded a crore of rupees as compensation for a botched-up surgery on Prashant Dhananka, a young engineer from Andhra Pradesh. He has been paralysed from the waist down since 1990, and the courts award is the highest in Indian medico-legal history (Record medical fine, May 15).           
	The judgment should set a precedent: it should inspire confidence in victims and ensure accountability on the part of the offenders. The shabby state of many public as well as private hospitals in India is widely known. Extensive media coverage of grave medical mismanagement has not perturbed doctors since there is hardly any system of checks and balances in place for the healers here.           
	The picture is very different in developed countries, such as the United States of America and the United Kingdom. The medical councils in India have shielded errant colleagues. There is a distinct lack of transparency and common human concern in the conduct of investigations. Moreover, doctors are unwilling to testify against their own kind. Small wonder then that disciplinary measures for medical negligence should be virtually non-existent in India .          
	Following the courts verdict on medical negligence in the case of Jacob Mathew some years back, a series of decisions in favour of doctors charged with alleged neglect had demoralized citizens. The latest judgment in favour of Dhananka may lift the sagging morale of the victims of medical malpractice.          
	Although consumer courts had found doctors guilty in recent times the penalties had been a paltry few lakhs. The apex courts penalty of a crore for causing disability should send a strong signal to the lower courts: a compensation must be hefty enough to deter the offenders. This would also demonstrate that the law holds human life at a high value.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Kunal Saha, Ohio, US

                          
	Not flying high          
	Sir  The report, Copter helpers in net, blame on labour row (May 5), is most frightening. Unrest by the labour unions in the aviation industry is very common, and they go on strike on petty issues. The workers are never fully satisfied with their salaries and so on.           
	Given this backdrop, there are bound to be some who can go as far as sabotage, as happened in the case of Anil Ambanis helicopter. The aviation ministry needs to be vigilant when routine maintenance work is being carried out, else such things might recur, risking other lives.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

                          
	Parting shot          
	Sir  One reason for the defeat of the Bharatiya Janata Party was its support of the Lefts programmes. This was evident in the no-confidence motion over the Indo-US nuclear deal. Its main voters, the urban middle class, became disillusioned with Hindutva and voted for its chief adversary, the Congress.           
	Yours faithfully, Arun Malankar,       Mumbai

	Not guilty        
	 A patient diagnosed with abdominal tuberculosis died during the course of the treatment in a hospital. The patients sister filed a case of medical negligence under the Consumer Protection Act. However, the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission dropped the complaint after citing the decision of the Maharashtra Medical Council which exonerated the doctors on the ground that they had tried their best to cure the man. The appellant then went to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court upheld the decision of the Commission and opined that indiscriminate prosecution of medical professionals on grounds of criminal negligence was counter productive and would do no good to society.

	Bailing out        
	 A person was accused of committing an offence of defamation. Since it is a bailable offence the Judicial Magistrate First Class, Indore, granted him bail. But, the High Court of Madhya Pradesh cancelled the bail on the ground that it was granted without hearing the complainant and remitted the case to a lower court. The accused then appealed to the Supreme Court. Setting aside the order of cancellation of bail, the apex court held that bail in such an offence could be claimed as a matter of right and that the court was bound to grant it if the person was willing to abide by the conditions imposed upon him and if he furnished the security demanded of him.

	Paid in full        
	 A part-time village assistant, in service from 28.06.1991 to 12.01.1995, was suspended on charges of rioting and murder. He was reinstated after being acquitted of the charges but denied back wages for the aforesaid period. The authorities contended that he was not entitled to any subsistence allowance granted under the Tamil Nadu Village Servant Rules as the rules did not apply to part-time employees. However, the Madras High Court directed payment of full wages covering the suspension period saying that in the absence of relevant rules, a person who was suspended for no fault of his, ought to be paid full wages.

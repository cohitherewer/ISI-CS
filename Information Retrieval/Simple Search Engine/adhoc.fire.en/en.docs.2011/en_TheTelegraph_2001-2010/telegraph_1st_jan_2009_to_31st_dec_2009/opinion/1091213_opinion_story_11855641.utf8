                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        THE RIBOSOME PEOPLE                                                          
	Before beginning his Nobel lecture, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan thanked his teachers, mentors and family. Then he projected an extraordinary collage of the faces of almost 30 young men and women from all over the world on the screen behind him. These were the young scientists in his laboratory in Cambridge. Without them, the results that won him a third of this years Nobel in chemistry would not have been possible. Mr Ramakrishnan thanked them all, moved that most of them were present in the auditorium. The faces kept coming back on the screen in smaller clusters throughout his lecture as he acknowledged their separate contributions at every stage of his research. What he was celebrating on this, most distinguished, platform was not only the advance of science, but also the essentially collaborative nature of this progress of knowledge and excellence. They were the Ribosome People, and were all there together. Science was more an international community of work and scruple than a theatre of towering individuals who become the stuff of national pride or general myth-making.        
	There are important lessons in what Mr Ramakrishnan impeccably stood for while receiving his Nobel  especially for a country like India and a state like West Bengal, in the grips of making, marring or re-making their institutes of excellence, old and new. An embarrassing number of stories of academic dishonesty and plagiarism seems to involve Indians working in their own country or abroad. The history of science is also full of instances of the dark side of collaboration, in which the path to fame lies through intrigue and discrimination fostered by hierarchy and ambition. Mr Ramakrishnans own work draws on the achievements of Watson and Crick. But few remember today that their story of the double helix has a less inspiring sub-plot: the quiet playing down of the role of Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins in modelling DNA. Einstein was famously generous to Satyen Bose, but the story of what Berlin owed to Dhaka has not quite become part of the legend of the Worlds Greatest Brain.        
	With assistantships becoming the primary mode of funding for students not only in America but in most research and teaching institutions of the world, and with the internet freeing collaboration from the constraints of geography, there is a new sort of integrity that scientists and academics have to cultivate, legislate and sustain in their pursuit of the gains of knowledge. This cannot be simply a question of individual ethics, but it also demands a certain institutional ethos. Combining research, teaching and administration is a difficult game, involving different, often conflicting, skills and ambitions. So institutions must be built to facilitate the maintaining of this balance, to even free their best minds from the deadening rigours of bureaucracy and politics. Mr Ramakrishnan describes, in an interview, the stable and supportive atmosphere that prevails in his laboratory, and which his work takes for granted. If India must find its place in the world, instead of losing it to the world, through the pursuit of academic excellence, then its keepers of learning must think hard about the relationship of the words, stable and supportive, to those bright young faces on the screen in Stockholm.

	Trouble is in the air                  
	Sir  The way private airlines tried to coerce the government into spending huge amounts of public money to bail them out was outrageous (Airlines threaten strike on Aug 18). Although they have called off the strike now on second thoughts, they should have remembered that it is their duty, rather than of the government, to figure out how to prevent losses. Private airlines are meant for the rich and the government should refrain from yielding to their unfair demands. Even with state-run airlines, like Air India, the aviation ministry should think hard before coming up with bail-out packages. The common peoples hard-earned money should not be used to fund the rich mans luxury transport.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The private airlines initial decision not to operate on August 18 did not augur well for the reputation they have built over the past decade. Instead of taking recourse to such arm-twisting, these airlines could have set an example of themselves by handling the crisis in a mature way. Although, like Air India, private airlines are suffering financially, it was not right of them to ask the government to help them out. Instead of causing anxiety to the passengers, it may be prudent of them to prune their administrative structures and temporarily stall operations on the non-viable sectors. They also need to slow down on publicity expenditures.          
	Anyway, it is illogical of private airlines to seek a bail-out package from the Centre. Did they offer the government a share of their profits when business was better?                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Although the August 18 strike by private airlines has been called off, under no circumstances should the government offer monetary help to private airlines in future. These airlines had started out by introducing low-cost air travel to reduce Air Indias business. They had succeeded to a large extent  forcing the government airlines to follow suit, and thereby suffer losses. So private airlines are in no position now to demand subsidies and financial help from the State.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The proposed suspension of flights by private airlines on August 18, now withdrawn, was clearly a form of blackmail. If the government had succumbed to the pressure and bailed them out, it would have set a very bad precedent. Soon, steel, cement, construction or hospitality industries might have posed similar threats if their demands were not met. It was only proper of the government to respond to this threat with a counter-threat. The bosses who own these airlines seem to have forgotten how the late Indira Gandhi had nationalized private banks to reach out to a larger section of the population.          
	Air Deccan, which first started offering low fares, was at the root of all the woes. Soon private airlines fell head over heels in a bid to offer lower fares until the situation got out of hands. Why should the government now lower taxes to support the rich at the expense of the poor? There is no need to bring air travel at par with the railways. Those who cannot afford flights should travel by train, as do millions in this country. Private airlines should co-operate among themselves to minimize expenses on fuel, crew overtime and so on. They must forget competition until the crisis blows over. The State could fix minimum air fares to create a level playing field for all parties while not compromising on the taxes. Private airlines are hard hit during the lean season. In this period, crew members could be asked to accept proportionately less salaries for lesser work.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The Mohanbari Airport near Dibrugarh, with regular flights to major cities all over the country, caters not only to the needs of the people of Dibrugarh, but also to the entire eastern Assam region and to parts of Arunachal Pradesh. The civil aviation ministry had sanctioned an ambitious modern terminal building and an extension of the runway for the airport. Although the terminal building is complete, work on the runway seems to have been stalled. This has led to several problems. Even a mid-size aircraft with full load cannot land at and take off from the airport during the rainy season, keeping in mind the issue of operational safety. Sometimes this happens even in normal weather conditions.           
	One incident, in particular, took an ugly turn. On November 12, 2008, ten passengers of the Dibrugarh-Guwahati-Delhi Jetlite flight were asked to disembark. The resulting altercation went on well after sunset, after which no flight is allowed to take off from the airport. This rule itself makes the existing night-landing and taking-off facilities appear questionable.          
	Yours faithfully,

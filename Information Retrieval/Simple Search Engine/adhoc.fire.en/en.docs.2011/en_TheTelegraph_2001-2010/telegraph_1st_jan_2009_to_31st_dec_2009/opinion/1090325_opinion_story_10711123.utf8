Westminster Gleanings - Anabel Loyd                                                        
	The foreign secretary, David Miliband, has been at the top table in Washington this week to discuss Afghanistan. His reputed intellectual abilities have been less than apparent since his appointment turned him into a Gordon Brown familiar and secondary mouthpiece for our leaders tunnel vision of the world. The truth is that we Brits only hold our seat on the back of our army, and, to a lesser and increasingly less successful extent, on the willingness of our local diplomatic and aid teams to attempt to build bridges between factions. Feel-good stories from Afghanistan are scarce as superpowers further destabilize the region in their variously inspired battles for supremacy and, in the case of the biggest players, for control over Pakistans nuclear weaponry. Muttering about a new Great Game is nothing new, but the so-called War on Terror has unleashed a vicious competition, devastating for local populations and with a game-plan so befogged and convoluted that a clear picture of individual objectives is almost impossible to see. The players in the latest game include the United Kingdom in, at best, the reserve; Russia, as always, on the team; with the United States of America, China, Iran, Saudi Arabia and of course, India deeply invested in the play.        
	Delhi pre-election conversation, when I was there a week or so ago, was alive with the sort of clubby gossip of Londons 18th-century coffee houses in the days of rotten and pocket-borough constituencies. The latest rumours from Pakistan, after the appalling attack on the Sri Lankan cricket team, are encouraging the most deluded to suggest a re-absorption of Pakistan into India by unspecified means. Those who take such a proposal seriously might find themselves up against more than they bargained for. Likewise, those convinced that a military leader will once again grab the power and the spotlight in a divided, divisive and distressed Pakistan juddering under its pseudo-democratic government are way off track. In London, Pakistanis in the know paint a picture of a corrupt and fearful leadership and an army struggling to fulfil its security role as the country is pushed and pulled by superpowers that hold the power and the purse-strings.              
	Had Bhutto survived, her understanding of American and global politics and the tolerance, her ability to compromise and to listen, learnt during her exile, combined with respect for her in Pakistan, would have united the Pakistan Peoples Party and made for a more stable country and conceivably a more stable region. As it is, the perception of her dealings with the US as a pact with the devil and ongoing distrust of her family among other geographical and political factions have been magnified by the certain knowledge that her widower, President Asif Ali Zardari, is corrupt to the marrow and in total thrall to his American paymasters. Nawaz Sharif, who might present a viable alternative and is seen as honest in relation to his country, is mistrusted by US purse-holders who wrongly perceive his party as aligned with Islamic extremism. There are others, like Imran Khan, the most internationally well-known voice sniping from the sidelines, but irrelevant in Pakistan, and the Muttahida Qaumi Movement, with a huge vote-bank in Karachi and the ability to ally with Islamic parties in the case of a hung parliament.        
	President Zardari survives courtesy of the American view of him as the least bad and most malleable option, while the Americans continue the Bush-initiated policy of the Balkanization of Pakistan. Their ultimate aim is the redrawing of borders to bring the small states with rich resources under their control. Their pretext is the recognition of the rights of minority tribal and religious groups. Americas deep involvement in Pakistan is demonstrated by the story, well aired by the local press, of the Marriott Hotel attack in Islamabad. The suicide-bombing, far from being a terrorist attack on foreign and Pakistani civilians, was directed against the US military using two floors of the hotel as the command base.         
	The army, always expected to take charge when political power fragments in Pakistan, opposes American policy that further destabilizes border areas by fomenting tribal hostilities. It is far too overstretched with the security on those borders, most of all with India, to have any wish to impose military rule once again or believe in its ability to deliver what the country needs. The decision to allow sharia law in the Swat valley is a direct indication of the need to free the army from at least one worsening and almost unwinnable situation and to save the civilian population from worse things than clerical dominion. In spite of an outcry from the mainline judiciary in the country, newly empowered by the reinstatement of the chief justice, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, the view of London observers is that the extremes of sharia law will be modified in the province, given time, local and government negotiation. For now, one of Pakistans geographical jewels has been, ideologically at least, sliced away from a country where central government and institutions have broken down and the army can no longer hold the balance or cope with conflicting internal and external demands.        
	Should India again have ambitions to be more than a lurking threat to Pakistani sovereignty, all hell would break loose. But Indias objectives, short of reunification, may fit well with those of the US and of Israel, the most shadowy players in the region. While the Chinese stand aloof, as ever patiently watching the turning of history, waiting for pickings from the maelstrom, America and Israels shared policy is to remove the Pakistani nuclear threat by weakening an army already mistrusted by them, circumvented through American direct dealing with President Zardari and stretched to breaking point. Remove the army as a viable force, and the Israelis are poised to neutralize the nuclear threat they most fear with the excuse that the weaponry may fall into the hands of strengthened Islamic extremists. There is a story that Israel has already been making threatening noises to test the reactions of the Pakistani military.        
	Americas security in the region is inevitably undermined by Russia, whose continued influence, under the guise of massive aid to the Stans, is increasing problems for the US/UK supply chain to the army in Afghanistan vide the closure of the US airbase at Manas, Kyrgyzstan. Russia is determined to keep a rein on Americas parade in Afghanistan, where its own military adventure failed so dismally, and has no wish to lose out to China in the competition for hegemony over oil and gas routes through Central Asia. Finally, Iran, far from supporting Islamic extremism, lives in fear of the fallout from American balkanization policies that spread the Wahhabi extremism, which destabilizes its own state and sows seeds of dissent between Sunnis and Shias on the countrys borders. Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, Benazirs father, and his successor, General Zia, were the first to give a voice to Islam and legitimize some areas of sharia law in Pakistan, encouraging the growth of extreme Sunni Wahhabi groups, resulting in sectarian violence between Sunnis and Shias.        
	The Americans are playing a dangerous game, in line with the Bush strategy of divide and rule in the Islamic world, but with no clear end. Tentative overtures to a rapprochement between President Obama and Ayatollah Ali Khamenei may suit all concerned once the propaganda is laid aside, but the Obama magic seems likely to be too bogged down in domestic economic catastrophe to conjure great change in more distant theatres.              
	This, like the 19th-century Great Game, is played for prizes of ultimate power and regional hegemony. Winners will be far outnumbered by losers. Islamic extremism will continue to fill vacuums left by further destabilization, and every lesser state will align with the international power most able to provide the wherewithal to guard its borders against its neighbours. The Americans, encouraged by Israels security imperatives, are getting it badly wrong and are, at the same time, becoming increasingly bogged down by policies that support bad leaders, ruin states that could become viable, and continue to destroy rather than build. The insecurity will deepen until all the players gather round the negotiating table. America has to listen and learn from the expert ground-based voices who have pointed out that the way to make headway in Afghanistan is to use aid to buy the whole poppy crop for much-needed medical use in the US and Europe. The crop currently supports the purchase of sophisticated weaponry for the personal armies of individual warlords. A longer-term education programme would encourage the growth of other crops over time.         
	In Pakistan, the shaky American toehold is vested in continuing support for Zardari as Hillary Clinton and Richard Holbrooke hold to the original policies of the War on Terror. Zardari is a man so hated by his people that he is barricaded into the presidential palace, lonely, depressed and unable to spend his US dollars. Were this to change, it is probable that Nawaz Sharif would negotiate with smaller opposition parties to form a coalition with a commonly agreed president, Sharif himself fulfilling his ambition as prime minister. With the army on his side, distancing himself from US influence and with the countrys US/UK-promoted image as a failed state, there is a chance that Pakistan could hold the lid on its own boiling pot, support the right processes of law, rebuild institutions, secure its own borders and become a positive player in the region. As a dream, that will do.

	Thus spake the mirror                
	Amen: The Autobiography of a Nun (Penguin, Rs 225) by Sister Jesme is described as A brave and shocking account of life within the enclosure on the back cover. The shock value of the book comes from the fact that its author left the Congregation of Mother of Carmel in August, 2008 after being a nun for thirty-three years. Her life inside the iron curtain of the Church had provided her with first hand knowledge of the corruption eating into the institution. Having witnessed how funds are misused, caste prejudices perpetuated and the vow of chastity broken repeatedly, Sister Jesme felt increasingly distressed and decided to quit the Church. She argues in the Authors Note that it is unfair to keep the internal activities of the Church a secret when the Church touches almost every aspect of peoples lives from birth to death. Her book reveals the petty politics and the vicious intrigues that darken the insides of the holy corridors. Sister Jesmes sense of a mission in what she has ventured to accomplish is evident throughout the book.                                   
	Mirror Mirror (Headline, Rs 595) by Gregory Maguire is an imaginative retelling of the Snow White tale. Maguire sets the story in Italy of the High Renaissance where Savonarola has just been burnt on the stake and Cesare Borgia is starting his campaign to become the ruler of Italy. The wicked stepmother of Snow White or Bianca de Nevada is replaced here by Cesares infamous sister, Lucrezia Borgia. Mirror Mirror is less about Bianca than about Lucrezia, whose glitter and splendour cause the other to literally pale into insignificance. Maguire keeps the original plotline intact and when he tries to squeeze in the larger-than-life Lucrezia within its framework, the story cracks. The events in the latter half of the novel seem too hurried, and once Lucrezia is eliminated, the steam goes out of the tale.                         
	Paths of Glory (Macmillan, 2.95) by Jeffrey Archer takes up the story of George Mallory, who undertook the first three British expeditions to the Mount Everest in the 1920s. He and his mountaineering partner, Andrew Irvine, disappeared during his final attempt to scale the worlds highest peak in 1924. More than seven decades later, his body was discovered. Ever since Mallorys disappearance, controversy has raged as to whether he had been successful in his mission. Archer makes Mallory and his fellow climbers come alive in this vivid recreation of his dangerous journey. Archer leaves his mark in the twist he gives to the Mallory legend.

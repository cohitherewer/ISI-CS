                                                                                                                 VERY OLD HAT                                                    
	The election manifesto of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) leaves people no wiser about either its role in the next government in New Delhi or the policies it claims to embrace. If anything, the manifesto and the comments by the CPI(M) general secretary, Prakash Karat, suggest that the party itself is no wiser on these issues. All parties fight elections to form or join a government. But the CPI(M) does not know, even this time, what it will do if any such opportunity comes its way. What Mr Karat said about discussing the issue within the party after the polls is only tiresome repetition of old stuff. The party discussed joining a government at the Centre twice before  in 1996 and 2004  and let the opportunities pass. The partys arguments justifying its decision did not convince many of its leaders, let alone the people. In 1996, the best-known party leader, Jyoti Basu, publicly called its decision a historic blunder. There are no signs in Mr Karats quizzical answers that the CPI(M) has moved even one step forward from its dialectical confusions. Yet, the voters in an election have the fundamental right to know what kind of government a party will make. With the CPI(M), they do not even know if it is willing to be in the government. By prevaricating on the question, one might argue, the CPI(M) has forfeited its right to be treated as a possible party for government.        
	Much the same confusions surround the economic policy prescriptions in the manifesto. It is littered with old, familiar rhetoric against capitalism and an obsession with the imagined virtues of the State sector. This is strange stuff considering the rise of the capitalist economy and the collapse of the State sector in China, Russia and former socialist countries elsewhere in the world. Some of the CPI(M)s economic propositions would leave even Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee uneasy. West Bengals chief minister has been trying everything to woo big capital in order to usher in a new phase of industrialization in the state. The CPI(M) manifesto continues to rant against big capital. Mr Bhattacharjee is keen to get investments  domestic or foreign  in the retail sector. His party wants to banish foreign investment in retail. Mr Bhattacharjee has to run a government, while Mr Karat is free to speak in the outdated language of agitprop. The CPI(M) manifesto is thus more a recipe for politics than for governance.

	Since he became the president of the United States of America, Barack Obama has been making a noble attempt to tread the fine line between ethics and expediency. Knowing full well the simmering anger in the Islamic world, he offered it friendship. That these were not empty words was reinforced by Mr Obamas decision to phase out troops from Iraq and to dissolve the secret prisons run by the Central Intelligence Agency, most notably Cubas Guantnamo Bay camp. No surprise, therefore, that Mr Obama has followed up his good intentions with a move to ease the age-old restrictions on travel and trade that the US has imposed on Havana. As a senator, Mr Obama had opposed such embargoes, echoing the sentiments of a new generation of Cuban exiles in Florida who do not subscribe to the harder line taken by their parents. Driven out by Fidel Castro, the first-generation Cuban settlers in Florida supported the US sanctions, though the US continued to trade with countries having even worse human rights records. As president-elect, Mr Obama fell in with this line by reversing his stance on Cuba. But he had also won the swing state of Florida; so he queered his pitch by promising to engage with Havana once he became president. Mr Obama is about to honour this assurance now.        
	Is this then an isolated move, merely the revisiting of earlier pledges? Mr Obamas Cuban policy appears to figure in a peculiar geopolitical triangle with Guantnamo and Russia as its other two arms. With the end of Guantnamo, the Obama-Clinton team had scored a real point over the Republicans. Now, after the US Secretary of States talks with the Russian foreign minister, the Democrats are on the verge of making history. It is no secret that Castros Cuba survived on Soviet subsidies, just as the world knows that the US and Russia are like delinquent children, forever at each others throats. But at last the two seemed to be growing up: discussing nuclear disarmament, deciding to share the oil bounty, and vowing to behave like adult professionals. This, despite the fury with which they faced each other months ago during the Georgian war. The times are changing, though it is still too early to rejoice.

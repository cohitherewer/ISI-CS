	Slippery pitch                  
	Sir  The last two matches of the Kolkata Knight Riders against the Chennai Super Kings and the Rajasthan Royals may have gone off well, culminating in two successive victories, but they do nothing to mend the overall performance of the team in the Indian Premier League (Shukla clinches thriller, May 21). There were times when one felt that Brendon McCullum should resign before he was asked to hand over the reins of the team. It goes without saying that McCullum has been a disaster. However, this is unlikely to keep McCullum out of the third IPL next year, and like this year, he would probably go laughing all the way to the bank. However, it would be unfair to put the entire blame for the teams sorry performance on bad captaincy. There was John Buchanan, the coach, and his bizarre ideas about captaincy that strained the team. Buchanan and McCullum have turned the KKR into a laughing stock. Sourav Ganguly could do precious little about this. Without captaincy, he did not have any say on the running of the team. With so many players who have little experience in the T20 format, McCullum should have known that his job would be difficult. The morale of the team went down immediately after the first defeat, and did not recover. The last two matches hardly mattered for the KKR, as by this time, the tournament was over. McCullum deserves a pink slip for his non-performance.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The owner of the KKR, Shah Rukh Khan, is a well-to-do man. He formed the team with the honest intention of entertaining cricket-lovers and making some profit to meet the cost of the team and fill his coffers. He picked a good team manager and appointed a captain. The owner, the manager and the captain attended the auction and bought good players. The manager arranged training very meticulously in India and South Africa. A week before the tournament was to start, he came up with a novel idea of having multiple captains. Initially, the plan was to have four captains. When questioned, he indicated that it might go up to eleven. He dropped Sourav Ganguly, the designated captain, from the list of four and brought Brendon McCullum from the sidelines to be the principal captain. The tournament started. The team won one match and earned another point for a washed-out game. Yet, they lost seven matches in a row before recuperating slightly at the end. In spite of this, they ended at the bottom of the slate. Most cricket experts have questioned the merit of the managers strategy. When Shane Warne, the Rajasthan Royals captain, stuck his neck out to mention that no coach is required for senior international players, Shah Rukh Khan failed to get the hint. Khan created unnecessary controversy by questioning Sunil Gavaskars judgment on T20 matches. The result is here for all to see. Ultimately, Khan had to depart from South Africa, where his team played, to skip the agony of seeing the KKR lose match after match. Yet, as the Rajasthan Royals have repeatedly shown, a competent captain can guide the team to the top.

	Sir  When John Buchanan said, One should not blame the captain alone, referring to the disastrous show of the KKR in the IPL, he perhaps forgot to add a line. The coach is equally responsible, if not more.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Nothing changes           
	Sir  One agrees with Ashok V. Desai that the Bharatiya Janata Party does not have the support of the people (Beginning of change, May 19). L.K. Advani, naturally, is disillusioned. No one can deny that he has made more contributions to his party than Manmohan Singh has to the Congress. Advani failed to get the popular mandate because of the lack of a populist agenda. The Congress has pandered to its Muslim vote bank, which has led to a soft policy on terrorism. Further, the Congress is nowhere close to fulfilling its fabled promise of removing poverty. So Desais idea of the beginning of change does not hold, so far as the Congress is concerned. As for Advani, his campaign against black money may not have taken off, but he is likely to go down in history as a strong man.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Subrata Pal, Karimpur, Nadia 

                
	Sir  Soon after the election results came out, a horde of corrupt politicians rushed to the Rashtrapati Bhavan with letters of unconditional support for the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government. Ajit Singh has yet again proved himself to be the biggest opportunist. He switched over to the UPA even though he had campaigned with the National Democratic Alliance. Lalu Prasad, Mulayam Singh Yadav and Mayavati now have no option but to unconditionally support the UPA to ward off the Central Bureau of Investigation enquiries against them. Does this mean that though the people gave such an unexpected verdict in favour of the Congress, the new government will not act strongly on corrupt politicians who provide support to it? The Congress should remember that the assembly polls are not far away. It is time the CBI was directed to take stringent measures against the wrongdoers. The litmus test would be to see if these politicians would continue to give their unconditional support to the government even with the CBI at their back.           
	Yours faithfully,

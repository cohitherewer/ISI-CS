	Urgent plea                  
	Sir  Jyoti Basus indirect appeal to Congress supporters to help the Left Front win the forthcoming assembly elections for the sake of peace and development in the state is rather frivolous (Help, CPM cries to Cong voters, Nov 2). Basu has accused the Trinamul Congress and the Maoists of being in a nexus. It is ironic that Basu thinks that Bengal needs to be saved from murder and destruction caused by the Maoist-Trinamul combine. After all, the Left Front is not without its share of activists who have destroyed life and property in the name of promoting the partys interests.          
	Thirty-two years of Left Front rule have only increased the helplessness of the people. Local goons are enjoying a free run under this government. This has happened primarily because there has never been a consolidated Opposition from any other bloc in the state. West Bengal, consequently, has gradually become a fiefdom of the anti-social elements who are patronized by communist party leaders. The names of personages such as Marx and Lenin are taken in vain in order to mislead the people.           
	Basu had once been found sharing the dais with Atal Bihari Vajpayee at Esplanade East in Calcutta many years ago. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) later called the Bharatiya Janata Party a communal outfit. It extended support to the Congress at the Centre, only to withdraw it later on flimsy grounds. Basu and some other members of his party continue to vociferate that the Maoists are in some kind of an alliance with the TMC. But the Maoists act according to a political ideology that differs vastly from that of the TMCs, or of any other democratic party. They are typically against the State and the established powers. Moreover, the TMC, led by Mamata Banerjee, aspires to be the alternative to the Left Front government.          
	Basus admission that the Left Front has made some mistakes sounds quite sincere, but then the attitude of the CPI(M) towards the Congress and other political forces in the country have looked dubious on a number of occasions. Further, the so-called communists cannot deny the fact that they have failed to behave like dedicated members of the party. They have become opportunists who change colour anytime they wish. Basus appeal to the voters, prior to the elections, smells as much of political cunning as of helplessness. Time will tell if a viable alternative to the Left Front can be found in West Bengal. But the general feeling seems to be that the unscrupulous leaders of the Left Front are no longer wanted by the people.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Othello Mazoomdaar, Barasat

                
	Sir  No useful purpose will be served by Jyoti Basus appeal to Congress voters since he has been out of active politics for a long time. Basu should realize that the CPI(M) is in the dumps because of its leaders own follies and high-handed manners that have alienated them from the masses.           
	With regard to violence and murder, there is no point in blaming the TMC for the sorry state of affairs as it is the CPI(M) that is chiefly responsible for the violence in Lalgarh, Salboni and in other places. If Basu wants the CPI(M) to survive, he should ensure that corrupt elements are rooted out from the panchayat to the cabinet levels.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

                
	Wrong move          
	Sir  With reference to the report, Land sop to wean tribals off Maoists (Nov 2), the ministry of environment and forests was right in blocking the move to reduce the cut-off time to 50 years to prevent tribal people from exploiting the forests. The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act of 2005, which gives tribals the right over forest land, is now set to be amended and the cut-off period reduced from 75 to 60 years.          
	The concept of giving forest land to tribals is a faulty one, as is the belief that the Maoist menace can be stopped by this step. Forests are a natural resource that need to be preserved. Forests belong to the people as a whole and should rightfully be under government ownership. There is a strong possibility of massive deforestation once tribals become the sole custodians of Indias forests. Illegal trade in timber and poaching would increase as well. The act is also unfair to non-tribal forest dwellers.          
	Dispensing land as largesse is no solution to the Maoist threat. The latter may even exploit the land given to the tribals to set up more bases. It is doubtful whether giving land to tribals will have the desired effect. More schools, medical centres, regulated markets and small industries would mean a great deal in terms of development of backward areas. The Maoists, whose aim is to wage war against the country, should be dealt with as a law-and-order problem.                     
	Yours faithfully,

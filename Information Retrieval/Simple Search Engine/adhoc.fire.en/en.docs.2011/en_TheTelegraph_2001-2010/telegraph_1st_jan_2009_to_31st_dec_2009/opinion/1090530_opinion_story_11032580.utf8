The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | The poet and his daughter
                                                                                                                 THE POET AND HIS DAUGHTER                                  This above all - Khushwant Singh                          Friend from yore                                        
	Last week, Hasna Maudud, the only Bangladeshi friend I have, dropped in to spend the evening with me. She used to come every year on her way to Ajmer on pilgrimage to the shrine of Khwaja Mueenuddin Chishti, Ghareeb Nawaz. For the last three years, she did not come nor wrote to me. She told me why.        
	When the army staged a coup, it put her husband, who had been the prime minister of Bangladesh, behind bars. He was tortured, and freed to sign documents. He was a barrister with a handsome practice at the high court, and member of parliament for six consecutive terms. Hasna herself had also won elections to the nations parliament. She was also a professor with academic distinctions from foreign universities. After he was released, Maudud stood for election again for the 7th term from his constituency. His being imprisoned without trial for two years made him a hero, and he expected to win back his seat without difficulty. The army command saw that he was defeated.        
	Hasna was bitter about her experiences. I asked her what had brought her to Delhi. To see you and tell you about my new book, she replied coyly. Her book, to be published soon, is Where Women Rule: South Asia. I looked over her list of women rulers: Indira Gandhi, Benazir Bhutto, Khaleda Zia, Sheikh Hasina Wajed, Sonia Gandhi, Sirimavo Bandaranaike, Chandrika Kumaratunga, Mayavati and, oddly enough, Phoolan Devi, the dacoit queen. She also does not include women rulers of the Philippines. I did not question her choice. She admitted that most of the women rulers inherited their crowns from their fathers or assassinated husbands.        
	My introduction to Hasnas family had an interesting start. Long before Bangladesh became independent, I ran into her father Jasimuddin, a distinguished poet, at a writers conference in Edinburgh. We were lodged in the same boarding house along with other writers and poets. We introduced ourselves to each other. On the first day, he was a little cautious in his approach towards me. Then he realized I was a harmless sardar. He greeted me in his Bengali accent Shordarji aap ko bara baj gaya? I acknowledged my personal clock had struck twelve. It is a big joke in my country, he explained to others. We became friends and sat next to each other at all the sessions.        
	When Dhaka was liberated in 1971, I followed the Indian Army to report the event for The New York Times. The first thing I did was to ask my escort to put me in touch with Jasimuddin. He was a celebrity known to every Bangladeshi as Kobi Jasimuddin and his house, Palash Bari. I was invited for dinner and introduced to the rest of the family, including Hasna and her husband, Barrister Maudud.        
	When Maudud was elected prime minister of Bangladesh, my wife and I were invited to be state guests. We spent a week going round Dhaka. Jasimuddin had died, but we were royally entertained by Hasnas mother and the rest of the family. That was good reason for me to have warm feelings for all Bangladeshis.                
	Word games                
	Some weeks ago, I published an anagram made of letters in the name of George Bush. It was Bugger Shoe. Krishnan Aiyar of Dombivli East, Thane, has sent me some made out of the name of Osama bin Laden. Here they are: A Bold Man in Sea; One is a Bald Man; Bad Man is Alone.        
	He has also written about the difference between anagram and antigram: While in anagram, the re-arranged letters of a word, phrase or sentence produce another new word, phrase or sentence, in antigram, the rearranged letters of a word, phrase or sentence produce a new word, phrase or sentence having an opposite meaning to the original. For example Real Fun is an antigram of Funeral. He has also composed a small poem of antigrams:      
	Real Fun, You will miss, at a   
	Funeral.  
	Evil Fast is broken at Festival  
	Dirty Room is not found in a   
	Dormitory.  
	Happiest inscriptions in Epitaphs  
	of cemetery.  
	Nice Love may end in Violence.  
	Woman Hitler is Mother-in-Law  
	 in a sense (in essence)!  
	No more stars can influence  
	Astronomers.  
	Bad credit is incurred by Debit  
	Card users.  
	Evil rsquo;s agent masquerades   
	Evangelist  
	Direct I pay cash for purchases  
	not availing Credit.                        
	(Note: Words underlined on the left are antigrams of those in right not underlined.)                
	Herd behaviour                
	Santa was elected chief minister of Punjab. He had no difficulty in forming the cabinet. He followed the tradition of his predecessors and appointed his wife, sons, daughters, sons-in-law as ministers. His only trouble was that few people outside his constituency knew him. He sent for his press adviser and asked him to do something about it. No problem, sarkar! he replied. I will have your photograph with your cabinet sent to all the papers which rely on government advertisements, and will order them to put it on their front-pages. Santa sensed that might be counter-productive. No, dont do that. People will accuse me of kumbaprasthi (nepotism). I will have myself photographed with my herd of prize buffaloes. People will know I am a progressive farmer and cattle breeder. So Santa was photographed alone standing amidst the herd of prize buffaloes and the photograph was sent to all journals. Next day it appeared on the front-pages of newspapers. The caption beneath read: The new CM can be seen standing third from the left.

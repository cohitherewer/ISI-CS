The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Many cities in one 
                                                                                                                 MANY CITIES IN ONE                                                             
	Perhaps few other Indian metros are as richly interlaced with history as the national capital. Despite rapid urbanization, Delhi remains a majestic conundrum, embracing a wide arc of time across dynasties, ages and civilizations. Walking along the streets of Delhi one is as likely to be dazzled by towering shopping malls as by lofty monuments from a bygone era. DELHI: INDIA IN ONE CITY (Academic Foundation, Rs 3,750) captures the fabled spirit of cosmopolitanism of Delhi, as suggested in the title. Lavishly illustrated with pictures gathered from archives as well as recently photographed by Uday Sahay (also the photo editor of this volume), this is an attempt to tell the story rather than simply a history of Delhi. The text is provided by Malvika Singh, who puts Dilli in perspective in her inimitable style. There is also a brief, anecdotal note by Sheila Dikshit, along with historical commentaries and personal reminiscences by William Dalrymple and Pavan K. Varma.        
	Singh looks at how the city of Delhi, battling with the many challenges of urban planning, has evolved into Dilli, a vibrant, modern city getting ready to host the Commonwealth Games next year. The challenge is to realize and integrate the divergent strands of modernity and existing traditions to create a composite vision of a restless city  forever absorbing shocks waves of violence, stretching itself beyond its bounds and moving inexorably into an unpredictable future. It is this restive nature that makes Delhi so enduringly mysterious and charming. It is a marvel, for instance, how a city notorious for traffic congestion could sort itself out so easily and produce something as efficient and convenient like the new metro rail. Just as interesting is the convergence of architectural modes and styles, harmoniously coexisting all over the city: the lofty grandeur of Lutyens Delhi giving way to the glittering new settlements in the west, with crumbling slums and suburban villages bordering the fringes of the city and spilling into Uttar Pradesh and Haryana, which, together with Delhi, constitute the National Capital Region.        
	An exciting hotchpotch of cuisines, fashions, cultures and religions, Delhi has grand colonial edifices like the Rashtrapati Bhavan (top, right) as well as the newly developing commercial hubs (bottom, left). Then there are spectacular historical monuments strewn all over the city that have now become graciously integrated with the daily lives of people. In the beautiful Lodhi Gardens, amid the humdrum of life, stand haunting tombs of the pre-Mughal, Lodhi dynasty (bottom, middle). Another attractive popular destination is the Indraprastha Park, stretching along the edge of the Ring Road (top, left). Bottom right is the Bakhtiar Kaki Ka Mazaar in Mehrauli near Qutub Minar, where sacred threads are tied on the lattice and wishes made in the belief that they will bear fruit.

	Loose ends                  
	Sir  The family of Atindranath Dutta, the officer-in-charge of the Sankrail police station, as well as the people of West Bengal waited with bated breath to see if the Maoist leader, Kishanji, would actually release Dutta unharmed (Win some, lose some in bargain, Oct 24). Everyone, including the chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, heaved a sigh of relief when Dutta was set free. Dutta, expectedly, was in a hurry to meet his wife, his young child, and his aged parents who had gone through hell during the period of his captivity.           
	While talking to journalists, Dutta stated that he had not decided whether he will continue working in his present capacity. He further added that he will take a decision only after consulting his family. This too is quite understandable under the present circumstances.          
	But what is amazing is that the administration, particularly the intelligence agencies, seemed to have forgotten about their duties in the euphoria of Duttas return. In any other country, Dutta would have been whisked away by intelligence officials for de-briefing before he met others. The Criminal Investigation Department met Dutta for questioning days after his release from captivity (CID quizzes officer, Oct 27). Little wonder then that Indias security and intelligence agencies are groping in the dark to combat internal insurgency.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The abduction of Atindranath Dutta and his subsequent release seemed like a predetermined drama staged by dexterous actors. Dutta has stated that he heard gunshots from within the police station. Being a trained police officer, why did he then come out in open unarmed? Or, for that matter, why did he not try and contact his superiors to report the incident? He should have also attempted to hide so that he could monitor the Maoists unobserved. There are some other questions that need to be answered. Why was Dutta not in uniform when he was taken away by the Maoists? Moreover, he had also allowed his subordinates to report to work in a lungi. All this makes it evident that the police force lack discipline. The lapses should be investigated and the guilty punished.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The episode that began with the Maoist raid and kidnapping of the OC of Sankrail police station ended on a pleasant note. After this incident, a new dimension has been added to the war between the army of the have-nots and the State. It could be debated whether the Maoists won this round of the battle, but there is no denying the truth that the erosion of State power has put the common man, including government servants in Bengal, at the mercy of Maoists.          
	Experts agree that the rise of the Maoists is a direct consequence of the total failure of the State to provide the basic needs to the people. Yet, none of the states where the Maoists are gaining in strength seems willing to address the problems faced by the tribal people living in and around the forests. The menace of Maoism cannot be abolished by force alone. The fact is that the State  the bureaucracy and the various government agencies  has failed to deliver because of corruption and the lack of will on its part. The government must therefore involve the private sector in setting up developmental projects in the neglected areas. The active participation of all those people who have lost faith in democracy in such an exercise will convince them that their votes, though few, still matter.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  It is still not clear why the Maoists killed two policemen but kept Atindranath Dutta out of harms way. Appearing before the media, Dutta showed no remorse for his failure as an OC. In fact, everybody in the police department, including those at the highest level, is guilty of dereliction of duties. The West Bengal police have become a laughing stock in India.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Bhubaneswar Ghosh, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Atindranath Dutta was released after the government freed some women who had been arrested for their alleged links with the Maoists. This incident seems to indicate that if the Maoists manage to abduct an authoritative person and then ask for something in return, the government will be willing to meet their demands. It is quite clear that the government had no other option but to release the women to free Dutta. The government was rendered helpless in front of the Maoist leader, Kishanji, and his demands.          
	The Lalgarh incident has brought to light severe lapses on the part of the State. It has failed to protect the people from the Maoists despite the introduction of the Central forces. Now, it seems that the government is also incapable of protecting its own servants such as the police.          
	Yours faithfully,

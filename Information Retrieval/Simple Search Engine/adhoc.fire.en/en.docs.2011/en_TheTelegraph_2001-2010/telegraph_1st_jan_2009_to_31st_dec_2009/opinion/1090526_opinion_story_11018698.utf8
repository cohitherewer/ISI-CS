	M. Karunanidhi should have known that politics does not follow the logic of arithmetic. Had it done so, the combined strength of the alliance stitched by the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam would have trounced the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam front, which was left with only one major ally  the Congress  and two other smaller parties on the eve of the Lok Sabha polls. As the poll results showed, that was not the case. Yet, Mr Karunanidhi did not think twice before pushing the enhanced figures for his party  18 seats, two more than the 2004 count  before the Centre to argue for a proportionate increase in the number of ministries for his party and family. He also failed to see that even the arithmetic did not warrant the claim for nine ministries. In 2004, he had returned an unprecedented 40 seats and singlehandedly propped up the wobbly United Progressive Alliance government at the Centre. This time, the figure for the DMK front has shrunk to 28, and it is not the only one to lend a helping hand. There is the Trinamul Congress alliance with its tally of 26 seats. Besides, the 200-plus tally of the Congress itself in the 15th Lok Sabha has reduced the health risks for the UPA government. The prime minister is now less vulnerable to armtwisting by allies. He may have issued character certificates for some of the DMK men under pressure from his southern ally, but he is under no compulsion to give more than he wants to.        
	The Tamil Nadu chief minister, however, is still unwilling to acknowledge the changed circumstances at the Centre (and the unchanged ones in the state, where, despite the DMK stealing a march on the Congress, the former continues to depend on the Congress to run the minority government). This is evident from the haggling that goes on, even after a climbdown, over the choice of portfolios and their specific nature. A nation that has shown enough maturity to choose the same government twice successively has already begun suspecting the political maturity of the leaders it has chosen. Mr Karunanidhi obviously has problems accommodating the aspirations of his family members, many of whom have been instrumental in giving him this victory, and those of his partymen. But that is something he has to solve himself, and within the confines of his home or party office. He cannot hold up a democratic process nor should he be allowed the chance to do so.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Prisoner of the past
                                                                                                                 PRISONER OF THE PAST                                  MIND THE GAP      For police reforms to work, legal and political systems must change                                                  
	The Human Rights Watch report on the Indian police, titled Broken System  Dysfunction, Abuse and Impunity in the Indian police (August, 2009), is a slashing indictment of the police system. It exposes the ills afflicting the police and details instances of brutality, especially against the downtrodden. The abuses highlighted are well-known, but little action has been taken to set things right.        
	The report highlights the poor conditions in which police officers work and the woeful lack of amenities in police stations and outposts. Many police stations in rural areas lack electricity. Long working hours without overtime allowance, absence of recreational facilities and sorry housing conditions demotivate the police.        
	The National Police Commission dealt with the problem of police housing in its first report (1978). Of late, both the Central and the state governments have taken some steps to improve housing facilities for the police, but these remain drops of relief in an ocean of distress.         
	The report details the lack of a human-rights culture in the police. The National Human Rights Commission receives on an average more than 70,000 complaints annually, and half of these are against the police. Victims of police highhandedness are mostly from marginalized groups.        
	The report is not correct in saying that there is total lack of accountability. In 2007, disciplinary inquiries were initiated against 19,187 personnel and 665 policemen were either dismissed or removed from service. Major punishments were awarded to 4,650 and minor punishment to 15,275 personnel.        
	The HRW report emphasizes the lack of political will to reform the police. Comprehensive reforms of the police have been on the national agenda for years. The NPC recommended comprehensive structural reforms, but the government did not implement them. The Supreme Court in the Prakash Singh case issued a seven-point directive to Central and state governments to introduce some of the major reforms recommended by the NPC. The HRW report also mentions how Central and state governments are dragging their feet.        
	The report deplores the lack of training among the police in investigative skills and techniques. This is not strictly correct. Professional training for crime investigation is given to senior and junior officers in police training institutions. There are capable investigating officers in state police forces, but the pressure to produce quick results and the malfunctioning of the criminal justice system are behind coercive investigation. Police reforms will not be possible without reforms in the criminal justice system.        
	HRW recommends change in the police manual to make failure to register a first information report ground for disciplinary action. While this holds true even now, HRW fails to note that the rub lies elsewhere. The performance of the governments in maintaining law and order is judged in state assemblies and Parliament. Any chief minister will frown upon free registration of cases, indicating a sharp escalation of crime, which shows the state in a poor light. No police officer will dare incur the displeasure of the minister.        
	The NHRC recommended the establishment of district complaint authorities to ensure speedy response to complaints against the police. But both the state governments and the police leadership are unwilling to establish such mechanisms on the specious plea that these will demoralize the police. They forget that an accountable police will command greater respect from the public than an unfriendly police. The report does not mention that there are many upright officers across the ranks rendering yeoman service against titanic odds.

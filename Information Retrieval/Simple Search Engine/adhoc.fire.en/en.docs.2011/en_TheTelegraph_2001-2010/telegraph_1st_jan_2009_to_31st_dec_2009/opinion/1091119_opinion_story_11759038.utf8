                                                                            Thursday , November 19 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                              STILL THE SAME                                  Dipankar Bose                              
	More than a year has passed since the world was rocked by the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Stock markets crashed and credit stopped all over the globe. Employment dropped sharply, first in finance, then in the real sectors. Predictably, the advanced economies (where the crisis originated) have somewhat absorbed the shock while the weaker ones, such as Russia, Iceland, Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Greece are still paying a high price. And Asia has been suffering a steep fall in exports.        
	Going by the criterion of credit flow or revival of the markets, the world economy has come a long way, though quite unevenly. The human suffering in the weaker economies is still very high, and people have been left without much hope for an early revival. In terms of employment or wage rates, even the advanced countries fare poorly. Take the United States of America, which has registered a growth of 3.5 per cent in the third quarter of 2009, thanks to a $787 billion stimulus package. This, of course, is no mean achievement considering the colossal scale of the crisis. Yet, the unemployment rate was 9.8 per cent in September, and it is still rising while wages are falling all over because of the weaker bargaining position of labour. Since December 2007, 6.9 millions have lost their jobs, and if the young people joining the army of job-seekers are taken into account, the total comes to about 9 million.        
	The rich and the mighty take good care of the law, as a rule, before embarking on any project. The US has not been an exception to this general rule. The Great Depression produced a number of safeguards against excessive speculation, epitomized by the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, which debarred the use of commercial bank deposits by investment banks, thereby protecting household savings from the clutches of speculation.               
	Old game        
	These lessons were forgotten over the next 50 years, and the safeguards began to be dismantled with the enactment of the Garn-St. Germain Depository Institutions Act in 1982 by President Reagan. Finally, in 1999, the Glass-Steagall Act was annulled under President Clinton, paving the way for a complete deregulation of the financial market. Thus, both the Republicans and the Democrats had contributed to the genesis of the meltdown.        
	The irony is that those who caused it, whether in the government or in finance, on either side of the Atlantic, are not paying for it. Thanks to the massive stimulus packages, more of which have been spent on bailing out the banks rather than on infrastructure and thereby on job creation, finance has begun to play its old game of lavishly rewarding the bank executives for delivering big short-term profits but not punishing them even if bigger losses are suffered later. This automatically encourages high risk-taking, the bane of the system. Thus, one of the most important factors that generated the crisis has returned. And it is perfectly legal because the law has remained the same. Neither has the Glass-Steagall Act been reinstated nor has the Garn-St. Germain Act been annulled. Only the Federal Reserve has been given more power to oversee the financial institutions. So, everything depends on who controls the Fed.        
	It seems that the finance-industry complex is using President Obamas charisma and message of hope to fool the American people and to continue with its old game. And so the seeds of another crisis are being sown.         
	Any change in law would need the Congresss approval. And herein lies the rub. Let alone a change in law, even getting another stimulus package passed by the Congress would be difficult for Obama, given the opposition of almost all the Republicans and the conservative Democrats. And all this, because the political-economic power structure has not altered despite the worst financial recession in the last 60 years.

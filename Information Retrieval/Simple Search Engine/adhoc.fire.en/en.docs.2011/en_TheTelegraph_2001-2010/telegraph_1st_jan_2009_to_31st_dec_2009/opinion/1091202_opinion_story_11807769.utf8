	Does a corruption charge make any difference to an Indian politicians career or votebank? The arrest of Madhu Koda, the former chief minister of Jharkhand, raises the old question yet again. His political career has been brief, but it gave him enough time to amass wealth said to be to the tune of Rs 2,000 crore. The charge against him became something of a cause clbre of the current polls in Jharkhand. But Mr Kodas story is hardly that of an individuals crime and punishment. It shows how the virus of corruption has spread through the body politic of the new state. Both the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party have tried to make the case against Mr Koda a campaign issue against each other. But that is how politicians usually see corruption  not as a crime in itself, but as an issue for partisan campaigns. The Congress can hardly absolve itself from its responsibility in Mr Kodas case. Although an independent member of the state assembly, he survived as chief minister only because of the Congresss support to his ministry. And the corruption charge against him dates from the time he was the mines minister in the BJP ministry led by Arjun Munda. Both parties are now fighting the polls, promising to give the people a corruption-free Jharkhand. There are obviously no limits to absurdities in Indias political theatre.         
	But there is also a deeply saddening side to the episode. Jharkhand is among the poorest of the Indian states, where hunger, illiteracy and lack of basic healthcare stand far above the national average. The majority of the people belong to tribal and other communities that have been left out of the countrys development agenda for decades. The new state was carved out of Bihar in the hope that it would help the poor people see a better life at last. But the dream remains distant, thanks largely to the ways of its politicians. If the Maoists have a free run of large areas of the state, it is because of the failure of democratic politics.

                                                                                                                 UNIVERSAL PRIDE                          - The Paris gay pride parade and the court ruling on Section 377        The Thin Edge -   Ruchir Joshi                                                        
	I have never been to the Kumbh Mela, but I have been in massed crowds both in India and abroad. There was the huge anti-nuke rally in New York, many years ago, there is the unbelievable crush of the Notting Hill Carnival in London every year and, as recently described in this column, there was the Baishakhi Mela in Brick Lane with its hundreds of thousands of people. This crowd was different. A swelteringly hot June Sunday in Paris and the huge roundabout of Place de la Bastille was packed: it was the last major monument the gay pride parade would pass before dispersing.        
	Me and my friends secured a ring-side seat at the Caf des Phares (which proclaims itself as the first caf Philo in France: on normal Sunday mornings, the caf hosts a crowd of antels who sit and have an adda about a chosen topic of philosophy; there is a mobile microphone which passes from speaker to speaker, and in the old days, the ideas and arguments would have to compete with swirling clouds of smoke). After ordering our beers we began that classic and time-honoured Parisian activity of watching other human beings walk past. Normally, Bastille would give you a catwalk of the beautiful, the fashionable and the bohemian, but again, today, the pretty and the chic were completely submerged, the weird and crazy outnumbered by the deliberately, celebratorily bizarre. I tried to make categories but it was a Sisyphean task  no sooner would I settle on one label, when people would come along, singly or in groups, to destabilize my slotting system.              
	There were posses of typical gay boys, uncovered torsos gleaming, the nether regions encased in sailor trousers or hot pants, muscular arms entwined. There were the Bears  large men, again topless, but fat with hairy bellies spilling over their waistlines  the complete antithesis of the beautifully-sculpted homoerotic ideal. There were the clich-lesbians, butch women with crew-cuts and leather. There were the transexuals, regendered, rendered in amazing garb: we were especially transfixed by a black couple, already extremely tall but with six-inch heels stilting them close to seven feet, two Brancusi-like spikes with the shiniest deep-brown skin, stalking above the crowd in tight, flowing gowns and colourful plumage in their hair which wasnt too far below eight feet above ground. As they walked up and down the pavement their hands moved in the most beautiful mudras; they were there to be watched and indeed, people were riveted. There were beautiful women walking with partners who were clearly prophylactized against any hetero male gaze that might alight on them; there were nerdy couples with minimalist design on their shoulders and noses, readers of Foucault and Bordieu but maybe readers also of Marie Claire; there were typically French-looking people and there were people of almost every nationality; there was colour, there was spangle, there was flowing cloth and everywhere, on this gift of a summer evening, with the huge column in the middle of the roundabout catching the slowly setting sun, there was skin, skin and more skin.        
	It took me a while, though, to register something: there were as many, if not more, straight people like me and my friends than there was openly queer janata. Also this crowd, unlike some other gay celebrations Ive seen, didnt seem to comprise only of the fit and the young  there were people of all ages, all classes, all colours, with all kinds of bulges and sags, and of every kind of sexual orientation.        
	At some point, my friend, LH, who is a leader in the Green Party in this area, went up to a tall woman, clearly a supportive constituent, and began talking to her. My other friend, FM, and I began to wonder whether the woman LH was talking to was actually a woman. We decided s/he was either a man dressed as a woman or someone who had had a sex change operation. When LH came back accompanied by the tall one, we were none the wiser, and she was introduced to us as P, one of those French names that can belong either to a man or a woman depending upon the exact spelling. P was dressed in a stylish black number, a skirt that fitted her body just so, and from her bag she took out a purse and showed us the feather boa it housed. For a tall, big-built wo/man, P had a very soft voice and, whatever her exact status, she spoke exactly like a well brought-up upper-class Frenchwoman  thoughtful, considerate, eloquent (as far as I could make out with my extremely limited French)  about her work as a film actor working with some of the biggest names in French cinema today.        
	After a while, FM and I decided to go and watch the the parade pass by. The boulevard the trucks were about to take was thronged with people but we wove our way to the side of the road and waited. The whole avenue was lined with the scariest cops in the world, the CRS, in full dark blue regalia: body armour, helmets, visors, batons, holstered pistols, radios. Looking at them you would have thought the parade was about to make an attempt on Sarkozys life and out his wife as a lesbian. Now they almost never use normal Gendarmerie, FM told me, any massing of people and they bring out these heavy pigs, anti-G8, pro-environment, fte de la musique, gay pride, anything. Looking at them it felt as if the French State needed to show the revelling public who was the ultimate boss even, or rather precisely, at the site where the French Revolution began.        
	Their hands on straps, the CRS watched impassively as the big articulated trucks began to pass, each with its own blaring music, its own particular sub-set of queeriety  Montmartre Lesbians, Toulouse Bears, Techno Trannies  the crowd danced and cheered. People ran between the trucks, waving banners, blowing whistles, dancing, the evening sunlight tracing their outlines. I wondered how many of the CRS cops were gay, or at least wishing they were out of uniform and dancing here with very few clothes on. Watching this speeded-up circus, FM and I had the same thought at the same time. What if the whole world becomes gay in fifty years? And then we both answered again simultaneously: Naah, not possible! Though later we both agreed that a few more millions of gay people would be no bad thing for the world, or for our culture, our population, and our ecological survival.              
	The news of the Delhi High Court judgment on 377 came a few days after Id returned from Paris to London. The feeling was uncanny, not elation exactly, but as if a long-term virus had lifted from this society to which I belong. But it was, perhaps, a little premature to allow that thought. It might be more accurate to say a long overdue first injection was delivered to begin the cure of the serious malaise of homophobia in India. The reactions of the religious mafias, the alacrity of their jumping into bed with each other across faith-divides, the stupid, stupid statements, all point to the fact that the battle has just been joined and far from won. Yet, this is a great and valuable gift from the Indian judges when you look at the judgment in the context of the increasing criminalization of homosexuality in African countries where there has been no previous history of such legislation, the ruthless campaign of various churches, the ceaseless leveraging by the Vatican and other reactionary cluster-flocks. It is easy for autocrats in large chunks of the world to dismiss what happens in the evil and debauched West, to dismiss liberal laws and attitudes in Europe as belonging to the other. It will be much more difficult for these countries and these governments to dismiss what happens in India. So, long may the gay pride parties fill the streets of Germany, France and Holland, but the real party has finally begun to be put together, and this beginning has been constructed by a pair of men who would never be caught dead wearing nothing but tight black leather hot pants on a summer evening in Paris.

	The girl who kicked   the hornets rsquo; nest By Stieg Larsson,   Maclehose, Rs 495  
	This is the third and concluding volume of The Millennium Trilogy. Readers who have not read the second volume, The Girl Who Played with Fire, will find themselves somewhat in the middle of a story. The two principal characters, and many of the other important ones, remain the same throughout the trilogy. These two are Lisbeth Salander and Mikel Blomkvist, both in different ways quite unforgettable.  
	The plot of this volume centres around a conspiracy within the Swedish secret service to protect a Soviet defector, Alexander Zalachenko, who is Salanders father and the torturer of her mother. A small group within the Swedish secret service worked as a service within the service to ensure that nothing happened to Zalachenko, and they had Salander interned as delinquent with serious psychological disorders. This conspiracy is revealed in its fully gory details and dead bodies are strewn across the narrative. The outcome is the freeing of Salander from all kinds of institutional control. She emerges as a free and responsible citizen.        
	If this outcome is predictable since Salander is the heroine of the trilogy, the process of its arrival is convoluted and the main attraction of this book.        
	At the very beginning of this book Salander is dying, with a bullet embedded in the surface of her brain. A brilliant surgeon saves her life. For a better part of the novel she is in a hospital room from which she is moved to a prison cell, awaiting trial, charged with the attempted murder of Zalachenko which, and the injury to Salander, occur at the end of the second volume.        
	Zalachenko is also in the same hospital, two rooms away from Salander. His demand on the secret service is that his daughter be killed or put away permanently. Unable to meet this demand, his former controller kills Zalachenko and then shoots himself.        
	Away from the hospital, Blomkvist works overtime to help Salander by getting his sister to be her lawyer, by putting together a story for his magazine to expose the misdeeds of the group within the secret service and, most importantly, by smuggling, with the help of Salanders very sympathetic doctor, a palm-top computer to Salander. This last move proves to be critical for the full unfolding of the conspiracy. She uses her own skills and those of her friends in the Hackers Republic to unearth evidence and secrets of many of the persons involved in the plot to ruin her life.        
	Blomkvist is helped in his investigations by a handful of officers within the secret service and the police force who, like him, are convinced that something is seriously rotten within the secret service.        
	Larssons novel is powerful because of its commitment to a world that is transparent, free and just. He shows up, through his research and intelligent asides, the seamy and the gristly sides that often go unnoticed because of Swedens affluence. Even in the competitive and crowded field of crime thrillers and bestsellers, his is a distinguished achievement.        
	He will be remembered above all as the creator of Salander and Blomkvist. The former  immensely talented but a tortured soul; the latter  a tireless worker, a free spirit who wants to find himself. They are made to be friends.

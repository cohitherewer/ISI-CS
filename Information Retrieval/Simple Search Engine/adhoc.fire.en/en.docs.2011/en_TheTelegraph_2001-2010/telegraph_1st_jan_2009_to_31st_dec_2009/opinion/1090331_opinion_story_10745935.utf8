The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | The idea that isnt India
                                                                                                                 THE IDEA THAT ISNT INDIA                              MALA FIDE - Malvika Singh                              
	India seems poised to initiate another war for freedom  freedom from fanaticism. This absolutely careless chatter, which seems to have become the chosen political rhetoric of some members of parliament, of a handful of legislators and of a bunch of aspiring candidates hoping to win a seat in the forthcoming elections, is inhuman and goes against the law of this land. For any senior, elected leader to imply that a specific community is anti-national, and that there is nothing wrong in articulating such truths, is insidious, to say the least. Every community, faith and nation has its share of fringe lunatics who run amok with their fanatical agendas and therefore need to be reined in with ruthless precision. To allow them a free run, as they threaten peace by trying to polarize the vote, is akin to actively condoning and sponsoring meticulously crafted false charges, riots, and targeted killings of innocents in the name of nationalism.        
	The last weekend made one restless and uncomfortable because of the news that kept hitting us all in the face. Rabid anti-people positions, unthinking distortions of realities, the inability of public personages to bring calm and sanity to a volatile situation and more were like a scary premonition of what is in store for India and Bharat over the next few weeks, and what could well disrupt ordinary life and bring a different form of terror into our lives. While the Bharatiya Janata Party reaches out to the Feroze Varun Gandhi syndrome, supporting and disowning it in the same breath, the Congress cannot shake off its oft-failed strategy to try and win votes.                
	Polluted nation        
	The political roadshows, using actors and actresses to gather crowds, only go to show how insecure the contenders for power are about their own abilities, how bereft they are intellectually, and how unexcited they are with ideas related to development, growth and change. No party is different when it comes to campaigning. The citizens have been privy to the most shameful and embarrassing narrative, one that diminishes India as a nation. Maybe we have to descend deeper before we are motivated to rise up with determination, much like the kid in Slumdog Millionaire jumping into human excreta to reach out to the world beyond.        
	The old guards in the BJP, the Congress, the Samajwadi Party and the Nationalist Congress Party must all exit for true change and renewal. The entrenched generation of politicians, insecure and desperate to survive a wee bit longer, is making sure that the next generation endures and swallows a great deal of what is intrinsically unacceptable to it, both in terms of ideas and action, thus diluting what could have been a very positive impact on the electorate this time round. The politicians bend low, and then dig their heels in as they stab every new idea and endeavour in the chest. A radical purge is imperative, and with it all the acolytes must be removed as well.        
	It is truly shameful to hear political opponents engaging in personal attacks and issuing cheap diatribes against one an-other. To think that there is an entire generation of young people growing up, watching the news on television, waiting to become genuine voters, who are being compelled to witness leaders participating in all that is wrong, illegal and disruptive is disheartening. What are the values and ethics India is instilling into its future generations? Is this what our philosophy, faiths, cultures, traditions and civilization have bequeathed on us? Why are we not ashamed of this horror? Why is no leader speaking out against this crime against our society and our national discourse? What we are passing through is clearly not the idea of India. It is an all-consuming disease that has allowed poisonous maggots to pollute the bloodstream of this great living treasure.

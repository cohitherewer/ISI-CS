The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | When an economist is also a teacher
                                                                                                                 WHEN AN ECONOMIST IS ALSO A TEACHER                                                                      
	The Collected Works Of A.K. Dasgupta (Three volumes) Edited by Alaknanda Patel, Oxford University Press, Rs 2,985        
	In pre-independence India, there were many economists. The necessity of an economic discipline to analyse the impoverished state of Indian society justified their relevance. Naturally, most of the economists were concerned about applied economics with bits of advice on policymaking put in. There were, however, some striking exceptions like J.K. Mehta, B.P. Adarkar and A.K. Dasgupta who showed a new path in economic theory, despite the unfriendly intellectual environment at that time. While Mehta remained an academic recluse and Adarkar left the academia out of frustration, A.K. Dasgupta persevered and produced his work on high theory.         
	In spite of the absence of worthy peers with whom A.K. Dasgupta could discuss his work, something that is indispensable for the the development of theories in the social sciences (Partha Dasgupta calls this the sociology of scientific research), A.K. Dasgupta proved himself to be a theorist of rare scholar. The collection of his unparalleled work in economics, edited by Alaknanda Patel, bears testimony to that.         
	A.K. Dasguptas long, intellectual journey began with his first major work, The Conception of Surplus in Theoretical Economics. In this, he departed from the traditional terminological conventions to focus on the division between the social or distributional surplus and a consumer surplus. However, this important theoretical critique remained pigeonholed, since it did not contain scholarly citations unlike its counterparts in economic literature.         
	Undaunted, A.K. Dasgupta, although past his middle age, pursued his interest in theory by writing an insightful treatise, Epochs of Economic Theory, where he challenged the established beliefs that there is a continuity in the development of economic science, and that it progresses from particular to the general. He started with the realistic premise that the propositions of economic science do not satisfy what one might call the universality criterion as in the case of the natural sciences. Every tectonic change  what A.K. Dasgupta calls an epoch  comes from the change in questions addressed with a shift in circumstances. In his framework, there are three epochs  classical, marginalist and Keynesian. Each of these threw up different questions and economists endeavoured to come up with suitable answers to those questions. Although the systems of economic theory grew out of these efforts, they differed from each other. One distinguishing feature of A.K. Dasguptas taxonomy is that marginalism is separated from the classical economic model. So he disfavoured the term Neo-classical to describe marginalism.         
	The book made waves, unlike A.K. Dasguptas treatise on surplus, because it was conceived during his visits to English universities and after his intense discussions with other noted theorists, proving Partha Dasguptas remarks about the sociology of scientific research true.        
	The next leap in A.K. Dasguptas creative thinking came when he analysed John Maynard Keyness (picture, left) General Theory. He treated this as an effective instrument to solve the questions posed by Keynesian economics itself vis--vis its relevance to underdeveloped economies.         
	A.K. Dasgupta perceived an overt similarity between the economies of developing countries and the depression economies in the West during the 1930s. In the Keynesian model, the supply of labour is perfectly elastic at the current rate of wages because of under-utilized capital equipment, and there is a gap between the current real rate of wages and the subsistence wage rate. But in backward economies, labour is perfectly elastic only at the current rate of real wages and there is no excess production capacity. Therefore, if a policy of fiscal deficit is adopted, as in the depression economies, the real wage rate, which is already at the minimum subsistence level, will dip further. A.K. Dasgupta therefore postulated a lag between a rise in monetary income of the newly employed through recourse to deficit financing, and a consequent surge in consumption would come until new investment fructified. This would yield an increased output of consumption goods. Of course, this meant price control during a transition period that was alien to the liberal economy in the Keynesian system. A.K. Dasguptas ingenuity in tailoring the Keynesian model to the problems of developing nations brought him out of the cocoon of theory to the real world of policymaking.        
	When a theorist becomes a policymaker, he changes the very perspective of the exercise. A.K. Dasgupta said in his Planning and Economic Growth that Arthur Cecil Pigous (picture, right) warning to the social scientist tempted him to mould his views in order to seek public acceptance, and not to sell his birthright in the household of truth for a mess of political pottage. A.K. Dasgupta wrote in his essay, Economic Adviser, that an economist, if he is to be useful to society, has to be more than an economist. It is not enough for him to draw economic conclusions from given data; he has to know how data themselves would be affected by a policy measure. To him, an economic adviser should be a public intellectual, as defined by Paul Baran, who can perceive prevailing social and political reality in its interconnectedness or as a part of historical process.        
	The volumes on A.K. Dasguptas life and work, talk of his versatility, originality and humanity, his unimpeachable integrity and honesty. When he was invited by P.C. Mahalanobis to join the Indian Statistical Institute, he refused because he had noticed that Mahalanobis had tended to fell out with him at a Planning Commission meeting. Likewise, he resigned from the chairmanship of the Sameeksha Trust of Sachin Chaudhuris Economic and Political Weekly when the majority of trustees sought to impose an ideological bias on the weekly. The collection brings out the best of A.K. Dasguptas life as a scholar, a teacher and a humane individual.

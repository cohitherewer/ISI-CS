The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Letters to Editor
                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Mad about the boys                  
	Sir  Why this madness over the Indian Premier League? I am sure many, like me, would want to know. At the auction of players, there was no sign of the recession blues when Englands Kevin Pietersen was snapped up for $1.55 million and Andrew Flintoff for the same amount despite the fact that they will be playing 21 out of the total 44 days of the IPL matches. Cricket-lovers are unable to understand what is so special about the Bangladesh fast-bowler, Mashrafe Mortaza, that he fetched $600,000. Did it not have more to do with the ego clash between Juhi Chawla and Preity Zinta than cricket (Ladies fight for Bangla boy, Feb 2)?           
	Lalit Modi is reputed to have said once that the objective of the IPL was to promote cricket. But cricket requires commitment and hundred per cent fitness. With the money and the media hype, cricket is likely to take a backseat in the IPL. It is also not possible for players to give themselves cent per cent to the game when they have such an overburdened schedule. Actually IPL cricket, with all its moolah, media glitz and the Bollywood Midas touch, is inching towards acquiring industry status. A media survey last year revealed that a majority of people thought that the biggies like Shah Rukh Khan, Preity Zinta and Vijay Mallya had come to IPL not for the love of the game but to make money out of it. There are many sports which require sponsors like them. Why not give them a helping hand? The government should heavily tax the sponsors on their earnings. A fund created out of that taxed amount should be used as a pool to develop other sports.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad 

                
	Sir  The IPL auction conveyed images of an indolent class throwing money while its target audience is worried about the future. If you have it, flaunt it may be appropriate during the boom years, but in todays India, it would have been more sensitive had the IPL auction been conducted discreetly, without the fawning media in tow. Quite unwittingly, the bidders ended up mocking the less fortunate people of India.           
	Forgive me for being a fuddy-duddy killjoy and a spoilsport, but I was thoroughly nauseated at the sight of glamorous men and women trying to outdo one another in bidding for star cricketers.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
J. Akshobhya, Mysore 

                
	Sir  Sometimes it is frustrating to cope with the nave attempts of the media to generate hype over non-issues. The experience becomes all the more painful when a national daily like The Telegraph indulges in such mindlessness. The screaming headline of February 2, Ladies fight for Bangla boy, together with the graphics, was a thoughtless exercise in seeking to arouse the passions of the readers about a piece of news that should have been placed in the Sports section of the paper. Mashrafe Mortaza, the Bangladeshi pacer, is surely not as big a name as Andrew Flintoff or Kevin Pietersen, who were bought by Chennai and Bangalore respectively. Mortaza is at best a budding pacer, yet to prove his genius. One wonders if the same coverage would have been given to this episode had the competing buyers not been two of the most glamorous of Bollywood actresses.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Srikanta Bhattacharjee, Calcutta 

                
	Narrow concerns           
	Sir  In the article, Energetic flailing (Feb 10), Ashok V. Desai rightly observes that democracy has become Indias holy cow. Also, in breastbeating about democracy, Indians do assume that politicians are the root cause of corruption. It can scarcely be otherwise when we see political leaders expressing concern for the poor and weak, and yet caring for nothing other than power for themselves. Democracy in India is all about the political survival of politicians, their personal gain and the creation of financial resources for their future battles. The present scenario, which requires the two main nationalist parties to accommodate unpredictable allies, makes things more difficult. The country is bound to have a coalition government again with help from regional parties, which will cause political instability in the pursuit of their narrowly localized and sectarian causes. This is the reason why the Indian democracy will never function as successfully as that in the United States of America or the United Kingdom, both of which have the participation of a maximum of two or three major political parties and, thereby, promise a stable government.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Dilbag Rai, Chandigarh 

                
	Parting shot           
	Sir  We have experienced frequent discontinuation of electric supply at the Yuva Bharati Stadium during important matches and other occasions. Every time, the West Bengal State Electricity Board comes up with an excuse of some sort. Why should the authorities not think about an alternative supply arrangement from the Calcutta Electric Supply Corporation that is stable and reliable? Often, residents of Salt Lake City find their localities plunged in darkness owing to a cable fault while the Dattabad fringe-land along the EM Bypass, catered to by the CESC, remains lit up. The frequent cable-faults which disrupt electric supply in Salt Lake are unthinkable in the CESC-supplied areas.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Asit K. Bhattacharya, Calcutta

	Over the past few months, Pakistan has been making quiet changes to its body politic. Two months ago, the long-neglected northern areas, which include Gilgit and Baltistan, got their self-governance package. This time it is Balochistan, which has often been dubbed Pakistans Kashmir for its problematic relationship with the federation. As in Gilgit-Baltistan, the Aghaz-i-Haqooq-i-Balochistan is a beginning of the acknowledgement of the rights of the province. In the case of Balochistan, a beginning (actually a second beginning) was imperative not only because the province had figured prominently in the electoral rhetoric of the Pakistan Peoples Party and a placatory gesture was overdue. But any serious attempt at meeting the threat from the Taliban also requires that the Pakistan government begins to try and find a political solution to the lingering problems that are a drain on precious resources, both human and material. The incessant finger-pointing at India for messing in Balochistan also may have made it important for the Pakistan government to be seen as doing something constructive in Balochistan, where China has made major investments.         
	For Pakistan to make any headway in this region, which has fiercely resisted co-option into the federation, it needs to do a lot more than just wave an olive branch. The package announced for Balochistan talks about the release of political prisoners, the withdrawal of the army from key areas, a temporary halt to the building of cantonments, the handing over of law enforcement to the Frontier Corps, the payment of gas royalties, the offer of jobs, initiation of inquiry into the murder of the Baloch leader, Nawab Akbar Bugti, and the promise of a political settlement with the involvement of the stakeholders in Balochistan. It goes without saying that apart from the sops, the package holds no concrete assurances on Balochistans autonomy, which has been the central demand of the insurgents, who, incidentally, are not recognized as stakeholders by the State. Apart from the historical legacy, a warped taxation structure and the lack of development have worsened Balochistans relations with the State. Unless the federal government relents and allows locals to have more say in administration and more control over the resources, Pakistan may not be able to make peace with Balochistan and heal hearts.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | The hundred million who refuse to be invisible
                                                                                                                 THE HUNDRED MILLION WHO REFUSE TO BE INVISIBLE                              The disabled in India have to bring themselves out of the political wilderness. Mithu Alur writes about a political manifesto that asserts the potential of the disability vote-bank                        Unheard voices				                                       
	While politicians of every hue give us the impression that India is shining, in the rural and tribal areas of Pelhar and Dahanu in Maharashtra, disabled children are simply hidden away. An eight-year-old boy was locked up and has no access to services, no health visitor, no counselling for parents, no provisions. There are innumerable stories of abuse and oppression in the cities too, even in a place like Goregaon West in Mumbai. A deaf girl from this area is not allowed to go out.         
	Who is at fault? The system or the parents?         
	The stigma and rejection that parents face daily, largely because of a retrogressive system, push them into utter despair and isolation. Ministers in Maharashtra are busy hanging on to their seats of power. There are no programmes to initiate awareness, sensitize and bring about a change of attitude. Most frustratingly, there is little or no pressure from elected authorities to rectify this dismal situation affecting more than 70 million people.         
	If the government does not care, where do we go?         
	The poor and the socially disadvantaged, especially the disabled, all of whom constitute 600 million people or more, are lumped together in one ministry of social justice and empowerment. It is impossible to figure out why the most vulnerable and disadvantaged sections of our society  people with a dire and urgent need for education, healthcare, housing and employment  have been clubbed together under this ministry since Independence.         
	Numbering a 100 million people, mainly in the poorer parts of the countrys rural, tribal and urban slum areas, the disabled have no representation in Parliament, and are haunted by political apathy and indifference. The disabled community in India is still looked upon as largely asexual, and politicians think they are not voters of any consequence.        
	Therefore, we have formulated our own political manifesto that hopes to bring the disabled out of the political wilderness and turn them into an influential voters lobby. We have drafted a political charter for the disabled vote, under which the voter will be appealed to vote for the party that will support disability.              
	Traditionally, governance in India has been weak over the last two decades, although the ruling parties have formulated a plethora of policies and legislations. Implementation, sadly, is another matter. I have been involved for three decades in addressing the issue of a better quality of life and education for the disabled. The United Progressive Alliance government has certainly been responsible for some significant changes.         
	A policy of zero rejection of disabled people in the Integrated Child Development Services and the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan is part of the UPAs policy formulations. A new ministry  the ministry of women and child development  has been formed to look after specific needs in the poorest areas of the social sector. Montek Singh Ahluwalia has given a boost to this sector by making a specific allocation in the 11th Plan. The prime minister, Manmohan Singh, and the home minister, P. Chidambaram, have been talking about 3 per cent job reservation in companies. Sonia Gandhi has encouraged and supported these programmes. I have been functioning in the UPA governments key national committees dealing with education, namely the Central Advisory Board of Education and the SSA National Executive Mission. But sadly, policies remain largely in the realm of rhetoric and have not been operationalized at the ground level.         
	A glaring example is the governments flagship programme of Universal Education for All, another name of the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan. Most of the SSA schools are not accessible to the disabled. Despite the ICDS  the governments main early-childhood programme  physical inaccessibility and problems of mobility, coupled with a kind of apartheid system practised and perpetuated (perhaps unwittingly) by the government have been responsible for the fact that 75 per cent of children with disability do not receive any service. These facts are reflected in major reports as well as in the World Bank Report 2007, done in conjunction with the ministry of social justice and empowerment.              
	With two separate ministries (the ministry of social justice, welfare and empowerment and the ministry of human resource development) dealing with the problems of the disabled, there is a fractured mandate. The lack of connection between stated policy and enacted policy, of co-ordination and political will, and the fragmented Centre-states relationship have perpetuated institutionalized discrimination against the disabled people, resulting in a complete systemic failure. Non-governmental organizations have been acting as service-providers and delivery agencies. But, with limited resources and lack of infrastructure, their outreach has been microscopic. This leaves about a hundred million people out of the ambit of government services and programmes.        
	All over the world, countries have adopted an entitlements approach to the disabled community. In India, we need to move in this direction. Nobody has heard our voices as we are not on the agenda of any political party. The political system, which often operates only to keep politicians in power, clearly does not address this silent, powerless constituency. Considering that 70 per cent of India lies in its poorest rural, tribal and slum areas, how will the India Shining slogan we constantly hear be translated to be of relevance to this group?        
	This exclusion is a gross violation of justice and human rights. We are nameless, faceless, depoliticized. We are silent and do not have a constituency. How long will we roam this prejudiced wilderness of political neglect?        
	We have, therefore, decided that we will no longer remain invisible. We have a right to vote and we know that every vote counts. And we can and will swing the votes during the elections by supporting the party that meets our justified demands. We want our basic civil rights  our right to education, health services, nutrition, job opportunities, to inclusion and to dignity. The government has to rise to its prime responsibility of ensuring this.         
	We cannot remain silent bystanders any more. Our main goal now is to get the disabled included in the political manifestos of the main political parties and in their common minimum programmes. Our charter, addressing disabled persons, will assert the right to vote, the right to education, the right to health services, and the right to suitable employment.              
	We have a vote-bank of over a lakh, and we will respond to the party and to those candidates who promise to include our issues in their manifesto and their governance agenda. To ensure the seriousness of this intent, the government should appoint a national disability commission, working under the jurisdiction of the prime minister, in the Prime Ministers Office, to bring about effective public-private partnerships. A disability vote will voice the collective needs of the community  and this voice must be heard.

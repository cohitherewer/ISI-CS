                                                                                                                 MAKE POWER                                                    
	The agreement between Tata Power and Reliance Infrastructure to trade electricity in Mumbai has not made headlines. That is due to the fact that the press has a proverbially short memory. The Tatas are the premier business house of India. That title came close to being contested by Reliance, a house almost a century younger. Dhirubhai Ambani started with nothing, and built up his company into an industrial powerhouse starting in textiles, going on to polymers and plastics and finishing with what today is the worlds largest petroleum refinery. The success was evidence of his acumen, but was also partly due to his skill in dealing with the government in the age of controls when every licence called for extensive lobbying. The Tatas made a name in that age for never lobbying, never kowtowing, never courting politicians. Theirs was an exemplary style. Then, unexpectedly, came the reforms of 1991 which swept away licensing and left the field open for free and somewhat fairer competition. They also coincided with the boom in software services, in which Tata Consultancy Services excelled. The fortunes were not reversed, but they became less unbalanced. A decade later, the Reliance empire passed into the hands of the next generation, and broke up into two pieces at war with each other. The war has seen the use of savage weaponry; at times, it looked as if Anil Ambani would not have a leg left to stand on. Who has been the aggressor and who the victim depend on which side one is on; who has won and who has lost, it will take time to emerge. But the damage to the Ambani brand and reputation has been enormous and irretrievable.         
	This rivalry is what relegated the race between the Tatas and Ambanis to history; the new alliance between Tata Power and Anil Ambanis Reliance Infrastructure is a sign of regrouping of forces. It is said that business knows only money. The Ambani feud has shown that saying to be wrong. It is also said that ones enemys enemy is ones friend. To apply it to the new deal would be far-fetched. What is being witnessed is a new configuration: so new that it would be a mistake to try and sum it up in a proverb. The development no doubt bears lessons for the parties concerned. They can be left to draw the lessons. Observers can watch this grand Indian show with fascination.

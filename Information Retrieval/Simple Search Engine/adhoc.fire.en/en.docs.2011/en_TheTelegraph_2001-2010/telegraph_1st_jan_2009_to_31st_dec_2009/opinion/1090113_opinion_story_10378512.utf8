The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Moral duty and all that garbage
                                                                                                                 MORAL DUTY AND ALL THAT GARBAGE                                                                  
	Diseases and discomfort, especially when caused by pollution, are great levellers. Yet, they fail to do anything about Calcuttas penchant for divisiveness and taking sides. Be it about the more political issue of the ban on two-stroke autos, or the more banal one of garbage disposal, the city never runs short of conflicting positions and allegations. For the self-righteous citizen, being a critic or pointing a finger is a favourite habit.         
	This is not restricted to individuals; public institutions like the Calcutta Municipal Corporation also have the same tendency. In the section on solid waste management on the CMC website, the responsibility for keeping the city pollution-free is the citizens moral duty. Is this insistence on the citizens duty an attempt to cover up the major omissions in its fact-sheet and the gaps in its performance? The pollution of the Ganga owing to the immersion of idols, the illegal use of plastic bags or medical waste management do not find a place in the site; domestic garbage disposal is mentioned only once.        
	However, morality is not an adequate bulwark against the avalanche of garbage the city produces, especially because this affects both land and water, wherever the garbage is disposed, also filling the air with harmful gases. The literate, urban populace is aware of the hazards of public littering. But since being aware and having awareness are not the same, dumping garbage on the road, littering public spaces with bus-tickets and food-wrappers, spitting and urinating in public are common practice. There have been reports and seminars on the adverse effects of idol immersion in the Ganga and in other water bodies. The toxic paint on the idols is no less harmful than industrial waste when it comes to polluting the river. Flowers, bamboo frames, adornments made of plastic and other non-degradable materials make for a pathetic sight at the ghats of the river after Durga Puja. Yet, the immersion of idols does not stop because we cannot imagine religious customs as inimical to public health. We are aware of the hazards of polythene, yet we are not ready to compromise our convenience by switching to more bio-friendly options. We choose to blame others for all the wrong actions and their consequences, while keeping ourselves clean.         
	It is often the CMC that gets most of the blame. The irregular attendance of sweepers with handcarts (spelt handcraft in the website), their early-morning visits, and their demand for a bribe to carry extra loads are become excuses for dumping domestic garbage on the road. In the areas where the CMC sweepers visit thrice every day, no one is willing to compromise household hygiene by keeping the rubbish indoors until the handcarts come. Haran Biswas, a sweeper at College Street, unlike his colleagues working in decent areas, is not handed over the garbage, but has to shovel it up from the road. He denies ever having taken bribes, for if he throws a tantrum and stops working, they will continue littering the streets rather than coaxing him to resume work  eder manoshikotatai eirokom (the mentality of these people is like this).         
	The CMC, however, is no saint. It has placed open vats at the markets but does not clean them every day because of a shortage of hands in the less important areas  as Prabir Chatterjee, assistant director of the solid waste management department, explains. He seems to be strangely unaware that heaps of garbage with a suffocating stench of rotten vegetables are part of the normal character of most markets in the city, although he does not forget to keep some work for the pollution control board to do.         
	For medical waste management, the ball is put in yet another court. It is the responsibility of the hospitals and nursing homes to properly dispose of their waste in the cars hired by the municipality. For recycling, some NGOs and the Jadavpur Universitys Centre for Rural and Cryogenic Technology have been doing a commendable job. But Chatterjee admits that the CMC has not played a significant role in any recycling project, so far.         
	Meanwhile, the illegal recycling of plastic disposables has flourished. Plastic bottles are reused to fake popular brands of packaged drinking water. In the suburbs, polythene bags are burnt in the open, emitting toxic fumes, to manufacture cheap plastic toys. Diseases spread, pollution increases, the city turns uglier, but the elusive moral duty of keeping the city habitable never finds its proper agent.

	Varied rhythms                
	Kalahridaya presented a Bharatnatyam performance at Gyan Manch on April 24. The artists of the evening were Satyen Sur, Dipika Das, Arpita Saha and Saju George SJ. The programme commenced with alarippu, an invocation to Lord Ganesha, by Saju. Set to ragamnattai, the presentation was neat and earnest. Saju created a suitable ambience through his dedication and devotion. Sajus dance to a Christian keertanam in Tamil, set in ragam sanmukhapriya and talam adi, demonstrated the power of Indian classical dance. This was followed by jatiswaram, which was performed by Dipika. The performance, composed and choreographed by C.V. Chandrashekhar, featured crisp footwork and some graceful movements. Next, Arpita and Satyen presented a padam, an abhinaya narrating the beauty of Lord Krishna as girigobardhana. The strength and beauty of the supreme force were beautifully depicted with the help of lyrical movements and subtle expressions. Choreographed by Khagendra Nath Barman, the performance clearly showed that the dancers were in fine mettle.

	Sincerely disappointed        
	Bose Pacia gallery usually stands out for its good taste and discerning selection of contemporary Indian artists. However, the solo exhibition by Hema Upadhyay (Yours Sincerely, March 23-April 19) seemed to have been a deviation from this gallerys otherwise impeccable standards. For one, there was scant evidence of curating; on top of this, barely four paintings and one installation comprised the entire offering. Had the quality of the work been superior, there would have been little reason to complain about the quantity. Upadhyay let the viewer down even on that count. The exuberant colours and patterns that jostle for space in her mixed-media work looked singularly unimaginative. Had all the four paintings not seemed such close echoes of one another, the series could have been a little less tedious. The cluster of humanoid figures (near replicas of Chintan Upadhyays hideous dolls) juxtaposed with a lone photograph (presumably of Hema herself) looked rather paltry. Whatever little point it made, if any, need not have been made so tritely. To her credit, Hema scored far better with the installation of an expanse of houses with tinned roofs. The touching details and rusty colours tempted the viewer to spend time on this sprawling composition. Although this was not work of the highest calibre, at least it could not be dismissed as easily as the paintings.

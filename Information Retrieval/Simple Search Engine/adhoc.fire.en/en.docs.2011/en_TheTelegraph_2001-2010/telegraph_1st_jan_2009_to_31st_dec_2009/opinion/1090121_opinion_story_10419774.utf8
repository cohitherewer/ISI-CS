                                                                                                                 STREET LEGAL                      Age factor  When the government of Tamil Nadu fixed 50 years as the age limit for admission to speciality courses at a medical college, a 64-year-old doctor challenged the eligibility criterion. The authorities contended that since a lot of money had to be spent on the course and those who completed it were expected to render a minimum of five years rsquo; service before retiring at the age of 58, fixing a cut-off date for entry to the course was essential. The Madras High Court agreed that setting an age limit for a professional course was entirely justified. While the court lauded the elderly man rsquo;s desire to pursue studies, it maintained that it would not interfere in a case where the government had fixed an age limit to fulfil certain objectives.   (Dr M.A. Bose vs State of Tamil Nadu and others)  They rsquo;re special  The Government of India announced a loan waiver scheme for farmers who owned less than five acres of land. Contending that the condition was discriminatory, a writ petition was filed to make the loan waiver available to all farmers. Dismissing the petition, the Madras High Court held that there was a distinction between farmers holding more than five acres and less. It added that a decision on this scheme involved considerations such as revenue mobilisation, budgetary allocation and the condition of the farmers concerned. It added that under the circumstances, any interference by the court could be an instance of overreaching its jurisdiction.   (R. Kaaruppan vs Government of India and others)  Fair share  A husband filed a suit for the restitution of conjugal rights when his wife started living separately along with their daughter. The wife filed a claim for maintenance at the same time. The parties were referred to a counsellor in a family court for settlement. During the settlement, it was decided that the husband would pay his wife and daughter each 
  Rs 750 per month. The husband challenged the settlement, saying that the maintenance might affect the suit for the restitution of conjugal rights filed by him. The Kerala High Court held that the agreement on the maintenance would not fetter the legal process for the restitution of his conjugal rights.  (Joseph George vs Mary Thomas and another)

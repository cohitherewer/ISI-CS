                                                                                                                 RIGHT NOTE                                                    
	Gunfire is probably the worst sound to greet the ears of a willing listener. The coordinated Taliban strikes on government buildings in Kabul on the eve of the visit of Richard Holbrooke were perhaps intended to ensure that what the special representative of the United States of America to the region heard was certainly not music. The serial Taliban offensive in Afghanistan is special in its tactic, target and timing. It should be read together with the increasing frequency with which the militia has struck, plundered and decimated precious supplies meant for the Nato forces in the area and the humanitarian aid sent by the United Nations. The raids, which have been single-minded in their pursuit across the border of what are seen as symbols of Western power, have also systematically targeted aid-workers in the Northwest Frontier Provinces and Balochistan in Pakistan. Given the alarming nature of the sound, it is but natural that the US envoy would not restrict himself to just listening. Mr Holbrooke has already politely told Pakistan  the country which he took leave of before visiting Afghanistan and into which the attackers in Afghanistan seem to be disappearing  that it has to stop providing safe haven to the Taliban in order to get access to the untold riches promised by the Kerry-Lugar bill.         
	Pakistan, however, has other, equally compelling, voices to listen to. These voices are bound to get louder as the US multiplies its troops in the region and increases the drone attacks along the infamous Durand Line. This region is inhabited by the Pashtuns, who have their own claims to the land beyond Pakistans borders. Pakistan has exploited the passions of the Pashtuns to keep Afghanistan at war with itself. This has also helped Pakistan gain strategic depth against India in the region. The US may manage to talk Pakistan into training its guns on these insurgents, but religion and tribal loyalties are likely to make the job difficult for the soldiers (who are regularly brainwashed by the Taliban into quitting the army) and for the peculiarly divided establishment in Pakistan. A similar problem assails the administration in Afghanistan. Mr Holbrooke might hear the right note if he trains his ears to listen to some unusual voices in the wilderness  perhaps those coming from the moderates within the Taliban.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Going behind the curtain 
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        GOING BEHIND THE CURTAIN                                   
	The hour past midnight 
  By Salma, Zubaan, Rs 350        
	Many books are being written in different Indian languages. A number of these works are rich in content, and have been read and appreciated by readers who follow the respective language. The need of the hour is to translate them into English so that they acquire a new and bigger readership.         
	The translation of this novel from Tamil to English is an exercise in this direction. The translator, Lakshmi Holmstrom, has done a commendable job. She has gone about her work with such finesse that it is difficult to make out whether we are reading a translated version or the original itself.         
	The novel is set in the southern part of India and deals with a conservative Muslim society. It is interesting to see that the work deals with the lives of Muslim women living in a male-dominated society. These women not only conform to the norms that have been thrust upon them, but they also manage to find shelter in a private world that is their own creation. There are so many women characters that it is difficult to keep count of them. Every individual has her own story, but one story is not very different from another.         
	The novel begins with Rabia, a schoolgirl, attending the funeral of a relative. This is the starting point, and a series of characters emerges with the progress of the plot. There is Rabia, and the reader is also introduced to Rahima, Zohra, Nafisa, Firdaus, Wahida, Sherifa and a host of other women who are trying to solve their own problems.         
	Each woman is a rebel in her own way. Fatima vanishes on the eve of her marriage to be united with a young man, a Hindu, whom she loves. Her mother, Nuramma, is distraught at her daughters conduct but when she is ostracized by the religious leaders she reacts violently. Wahida marries Sikander, but her first taste of the forbidden act is mingled with pain and horror. Firdaus refuses to live with her husband whom she considers ugly and falls in love with another man. Sherifas husband is dead, but she refuses to remarry. Even the school-going Rabia acts like a rebel: at the end of the novel, she dares to spend a few moments with Ahmed who soon goes away.         
	Salmas work does not follow the rules of fiction. There are also three deaths in the novel, which depicts the lives of Muslim women in the southern part of India. However, some inconsistencies have crept into these pages: Fajr (prayer) is written as bajar and zohar as luhur. Salmas strength lies in her accurate depiction of a small world peopled with different kinds of women. The authors portrayal of their lives, aspirations and frustrations is as poignant.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | the great wall
                                                                                                                 THE GREAT WALL                                                          
	The Left Front leader who asked the indulgence of the Election Commission regarding the use of wall graffiti could have made his meaning clearer. He called such writing the the staple of election campaigns in Bengal; he could have said that coercion was the staple, not graffiti. The concept that the owners of walls should be asked permission before political parties deface them during campaigning and leave in a grimy, runny mess when elections are over is so novel as to be shocking to West Bengals politicians and their devoted followers. A blanket law forbidding wall graffiti may have been easier to implement. Campaigners may not have had the time to hold up traffic and create mayhem in protest because there is just too much to do before the elections. But a slight softening on the part of the EC, that the owners permission be taken 72 hours before messing up the walls, has immediately been seized upon to be twisted to advantage, with the usual bullying, lying and exercise of silent menace.         
	Coercion entails the imposition of the perceptions of political leaders. For example, a leader who compares the use of huge cut-outs of candidates in the South  quite amazingly garish, but removable  with not-so-transitory damage to private property has obviously not quite got the plot. Or is acting obtuse. Certain parties would argue that private property is an aberration anyway, everything that moves and does not move is the property of the party. Since that is the end of the matter  and all pronouncements from such parties are axiomatic truths  there can be no question of asking house-owners or inhabitants whether or not they want their walls to look as though barbarians have suddenly discovered that painting is fun too. But the staple of this campaign culture is not rudeness, it is menace. Few people will insist on their right to a clean wall in a city where political parties have come to represent simple terror. The Calcuttan-next-door is unwilling to speak up; he would rather that the police and the EC do their jobs without his having to object or complain. No one is sure that he will be left in peace or even allowed to stay on in the locality if he wants to keep his walls clean. He will sign in silence the consent form long after the damage is done, and keep his peace when his name is brazenly used on the form without his signing it. He does not own his signature, the party does.         
	Perceptions about property and propriety are matched by perceptions about pollution. Visual pollution is a myth created to irritate busy politicians. More than that, leaders in government actually like making the city ugly, and are far above noticing filth. For them, walls plastered with multi-coloured political messages are the acme of transcendental beauty. It is quite possible they like breathing the citys poisonous air too, since they take to all forms of pollution like ducks to slimy water.

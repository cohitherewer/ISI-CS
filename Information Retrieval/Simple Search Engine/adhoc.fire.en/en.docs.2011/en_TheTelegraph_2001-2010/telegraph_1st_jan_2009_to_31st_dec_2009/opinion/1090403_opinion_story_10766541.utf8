	Has the fashion for extravagant advances finally arrived for Indian writers in English? Has the auction of authors  another name for a bidding war  come here too? Should advances be treated as a necessary amount that the authors need in order to prepare for their work or as an amount given against future royalties? And finally, do they pay off for publishers in the long run?        
	To begin with, here are some recent examples as reported in the press. Precise figures are always a closely guarded secret between the commissioning editor and the chief accountant, but give or take a little, here is the score.         
	Nandan Nilekani  Imaging India: The Idea of a Renewed Nation (Rs 25 lakhs).        
	Ramachandra Guha  Rs 1 crore for a package of seven books, a two-volume biography of M.K. Gandhi that would be published between 2012 and 2015, and reissues of older books.        
	Amitav Ghosh  Rs 55 lakhs for a three-book deal beginning with Sea of Poppies.        
	Tarun J. Tejpal  Rs 15 lakhs for The Story of My Assassins.        
	Aravind Adiga  Rs 3 lakhs for The White Tiger, the Booker prize winner.         
	Just how much N.R. Narayana Murthy got for A Better India: A Better World is anybodys guess but given the kind of man he is, it would be very modest, if at all.         
	Let it be said straightaway: this is good money but it isnt anywhere close to the advances paid to British and American writers, especially for mass-market fiction that is made into films and television sitcoms, or for political memoirs that get serialized in papers and magazines.         
	Are these advances a viable commercial proposition for publishers and/or for the authors who do all the writing? Look at it from an Indian authors point of view. The writing of any book involves time and money for research, travel and secretarial expenses. No author can possibly bear all these expenses on his/her own; he/she needs financial assistance or subsidies to prepare a decent manuscript for the press.        
	Books for the serious reader, such as the titles mentioned above, involve research in libraries and archives that boils down to travel expenses incurred in addition to the cost of extensive photocopying. And travel means not just that within the country but often abroad simply because all the material, especially private papers, is not here. With very few grants available, who would foot the bill?         
	Publishers realize this and therefore come up with advances. In the swings and roundabouts, authors dont walk away with the entire advance; they have to part with a fair amount of it in preparing the work. All the same, an advance is still something without which the work would probably never be done.        
	Are publishers paying vast amounts of money for books against preposterous odds? Of course, a large advance does not necessarily make a book unprofitable since a significant amount can be absorbed into the general costs. But that is poor salesmanship. Having said this, publishers take a calculated risk; many books with unearned advances have bombed. Thats all in the game, you might say.

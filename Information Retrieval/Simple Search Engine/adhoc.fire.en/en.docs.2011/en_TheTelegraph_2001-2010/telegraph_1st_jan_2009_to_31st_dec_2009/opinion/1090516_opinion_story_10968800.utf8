The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | use of discretion
                                                                                                                 USE OF DISCRETION                                                          
	A fractured popular mandate is a presidents nightmare. It is one of the few occasions when the president is forced to use her discretion. Pratibha Patil will find herself in an unenviable situation from Sunday morning when the election results inform her  as is most likely  that the 15th Lok Sabha will not have any party or political formation with a clear majority. There is no clear guideline about what she should do when faced with such a situation. That hallowed document  the Constitution of India  will not be of any help to her since it says nothing concrete. It merely states that the government should enjoy the confidence of the House. The moot question regarding how this confidence is to be demonstrated or determined is not addressed at all. It was assumed that on this matter  as in many others  the conventions of the British parliament would be followed. That injunction does not offer any great help to the president of India when she has to decide which formation to call first and how the majority is to be determined.        
	The issue of who to call first is left entirely to the discretion of the president, and it is also related to the demonstration of majority on the floor of the Lok Sabha. In 1996, the then president, Shankar Dayal Sharma, invited Atal Bihari Vajpayee because he led the single largest party. The result was that Mr Vajpayees first prime ministership lasted only 13 days, since he was unable to command the confidence of the House. Many other instruments have been called for by previous presidents  list of members of parliament offering support to a particular formation or actual letters of support from individual members or parties. But none of these is foolproof. The ultimate test of majority is a vote in the Lok Sabha; that alone can determine confidence or otherwise. This still leaves open the question of who the president should call first.        
	The simple solution of calling the single largest party has become a trifle complicated by the formation of pre- and post-poll alliances. Under the present circumstances, the various parties under the umbrella of the National Democratic Alliance have contested the polls on a common manifesto with L.K. Advani as their prime ministerial candidate. But the United Progressive Alliance no longer enjoys its previous configuration. Many parties have walked out of the formation; in some states like West Bengal, new parties have formed an understanding with the Congress. It is possible that once the results are announced, some parties would like to regroup. So when the president uses her discretion to call the single largest party/group, does she compare the NDA (which has a pre-poll understanding) with the Congress alone or with the UPA (which has no firm pre-poll alliance)? Or does she compare the NDA with a new group formed (maybe under the banner of the UPA or in some other name) after the announcement of the results? Ms Patils decisions will be important for Indian democracy.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | When palaces become homes
                                                                                                                 WHEN PALACES BECOME HOMES                                          
	Beyond the sheer splendour of grand palaces and ancient forts, what is most fascinating about these edifices is that these were home to real people in a distant, though equally real, past. This human dimension makes The Lallgarh Palace: Home of the Maharajas of Bikaner (Dev, Rs 1,800 ) an interesting book. Lavishly illustrated  although the design leaves much to be desired  this is as much an intimate history of a family as a record of a daring architectural venture made in the early years of the 20th century. The text is supplied by Rajyashree Kumari of Bikaner, who grew up in some of the most beautiful palaces in Rajasthan, and is a living repository of anecdotes. Some of these invariably relate to family matters  the whims and fancies of kings and queens  which impart a lively excitement to her narrative. However, there is also a core of historical analysis in her account, informed by her awareness of the architectural value of Lallgarh Palace, one of the best examples of the Indo-Saracenic style, incorporating a striking blend of Rajput, Muslim and European features.        
	Built in 1902 by Sir Swinton Jacob as the residence of Maharaja Ganga Singh, Lallgarh Palace is the modern successor of the Junagarh fort. As the traditional seat of Bikaner, Junagarh was not only the centre of archaic customs and matchless extravagance, but also replete with intrigues. Moving away from this medieval ambience, Lallgarh Palace ushered in a spirit of modernity. However, there were problems about how to accommodate the zenana quarters without ruining the effect of the domes (Top left shows the south wing, known as Laxmi Niwas, which was made to house the women). These were not simple architectural questions, but issues that had to be approached sociologically. So, at every step, the royal family collaborated with the team of British engineers to see this magnificent sandstone dream come true.        
	As with many accounts of royal households, this, too, is full of photographs documenting banquets, shikars, ornate halls and the paintings that adorn them. There are a great many vignettes from family albums, depicting weddings and travels abroad. These do not strictly enhance our admiration of Lallgarh Palace or of its inhabitants. Top right shows Maharaja Ganga Singh with Lord Minto, the Viceroy of India, and his wife and daughter at Suratgarh in 1908. Two black bucks shot by the viceroy glare chillingly out of the picture. Bottom left is the assemblage of arms and armour displayed along the corridors of the Junagarh fort. On the extreme right is the guest wing of the Lallgarh Palace called Sajjan Niwas. In the middle is a hand-carved sandstone panel from the porch of Laxmi Niwas.

                                                                                                                 KILLER HOME                                                    
	A child who is mentally handicapped and has no family to claim his body after he dies asks of his carers nothing more than humanity. It would be easy to starve him to death and dispose of his body without being accountable to anybody. And there are people who almost manage to do precisely that  not to just one child, but to 31 such children. Twelve-year-old Sarod was not the only boy to have died of malnutrition at the Bireswar Memorial Home in Baruipur, run by an NGO called Jatiya Jaradhi Sansad for the last 14 years. There were two, or perhaps even three, other children who died of similar causes in this privately run, but government-sponsored, home for mentally handicapped children. The thirty-odd children who have managed to remain alive are all severely malnourished too, some to the point of going blind, apart from suffering from skin diseases and other chronic illnesses from the unspeakably unhygienic condition in which they live in the home.        
	It is only now, after Sarods death, that the State is sitting up to what has been going on for years. The local panchayat, legislators, officials from the state social welfare department, the district magistrate and ministers are investigating the NGO and the people in charge of the home. The government wants to know what was happening to the money being given to the NGO for the running of the home. But most such homes (together with the government-run juvenile homes), run under the juvenile justice scheme in West Bengal, are in an appalling condition, and most of them are run like prisons. They are closed institutions into which very few members of the public are admitted, so that it is impossible for ordinary citizens to know what is going on inside them. The structures of accountability are therefore undermined with impunity, and at every level. It is only after an incident like this that there is a short-lived public outrage, the government makes caring or punitive noises and gestures, inquiries and inspections are promised, and then it is time to forget about the poor, mad orphans once again.

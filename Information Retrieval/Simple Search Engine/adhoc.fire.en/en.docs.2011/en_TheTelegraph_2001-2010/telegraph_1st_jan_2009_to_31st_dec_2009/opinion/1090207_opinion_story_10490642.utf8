The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | The West for the masses

Datta-Ray                        Love in the time of markets				                                             
	Hearing a Gariahat shopkeeper mention a jewellery store down the road as he struggled to give directions to a stranger, I suggested that the Ramakrishna Mission cultural centres massive domed bulk directly opposite was a more recognizable landmark. The shopkeeper smiled indulgently at my navet before explaining in Bengali, Everybody knows a jewellery shop! He had a more realistic measure of popular taste and would probably understand why Westernization today means shopping malls and fast food joints instead of the libraries and reform movements of the 19th century.         
	Its this difference that the Sri Ram Sena hoodlums may unwittingly have helped to expose. Lets ignore the red herrings dragged across the trail by self-seeking politicians. Also the gibberish of the National Commission for Women worthies who were horrified by the nude clothes worn (or not worn?) in Mangalores Amnesia bar  pub is a misnomer. Despite these extraneous excitements, the violence should focus attention on the transformation India is undergoing. This is the inevitable outcome of the combination of majority rule, relaxed governance, higher disposable incomes, greater exposure to global trends and insufficient education. In a perceptive analysis nearly 50 years ago, the late Asok Mitra, the scholarly civil servant, called this the Plebeian Revolution. The process is irreversible. Evolution is a one-way street. Inevitably, however, many responsible Indians  not just cranks, bigots and goondas  find some of the changes disturbing if not objectionable.               
	But this is not the first time that diehards have objected to contaminating foreign influence. Resistance was no less vehement in the 19th and early 20th centuries when the Bengal renaissance gave birth to social reform movements in favour of monotheistic worship, widow remarriage, female education and abolition of suttee and the caste system. Brahminical orthodoxy regarded these innovations with as much outrage as Rajasthans chief minister, Ashok Gehlot, apparently regards the culture of boys and girls going hand-in-hand to pubs and malls for drinking. Opposition forced the Brahmo Samaj to camouflage its meeting places in many mofussil towns as prarthana sabhas or non-denominational prayer halls. Several of my ancestors were asked (but refused) to perform the prayaschitta  penance  ceremony after returning from their studies in England.         
	The nature of protest has kept pace with modern times and the Ram Sena activists are also a feature of the emerging India. Earlier critics of Western ideas and practices thundered at public meetings, issued stormy manifestos and ensured that offenders were denied such traditional services as of the dhobi and barber. The ritual boycott thrived in Bengal before Captain Boycott, an absentee English landowners agent in Ireland, was a victim of the strategy that commemorates his name. Todays objectors indulge in abuse and beatings. A widely published picture from Mangalore shows not a greybeard with matted locks but a modishly long-haired youth in bush shirt and flares. His lips are pressed menacingly as his left hand grips another mans shirt while the right is poised to strike. It could depict any brawl outside a saloon in a Wild West film. Western cinema (direct or via Bollywood) influences posture, mannerism and diction in the unlikeliest circles.        
	It would be profanity to equate the Bengal renaissance with what Karnatakas chief minister, B.S. Yeddyurappa, calls pub culture. But just as Heaven and Hell are both states after death, these two also have one thing in common: both reflect Indian absorption of Western trends. The qualitative difference between earlier change and the Westernization that is now sweeping the young in cities and towns is a reminder that an open window lets in the fresh air but also brings flies and other pests.         
	The Bengal renaissances social and cultural effects or the Anglicism that was also born of interaction with England were confined to the elite, whereas the impact now is on a broad mass of people whose adoption of alien lifestyles is not leavened by the enlightenment that comes of education. The recipients own state in life and cultural orientation determines the level of his access to foreign lifestyles. Mitras Plebeian Revolution cannot be exclusive. The elite was shaped in a privileged Western crucible and accessed the highest echelons of Western society. Hoi-polloi soak up the mass entertainment offered by Western television and its Indian imitations. No fare would satisfy the multitude if it did not have a vulgar dimension. Vulgarity is universal. So is the cell phone, that contemporary symbol of modernization, now also flaunted by both toddy tappers and rickshaw pullers. The Tamarind Court, scene of a famous murder, and Amnesia bars are fruits of the same synthesis.        
	Some might call this wider spread of Western influence deterioration. Its really democratization, representing the transfer of the decisive role from the few to the many. It is most dramatically evident in political personnel  Lalu Prasad, Narendra Modi and Mamata Banerjee instead of Surendranath Banerjea, Jatindra Mohan Sengupta and Tej Bahadur Sapru; barristers and zamindars replaced by operators with more than a sprinkling of criminals; interests instead of causes. Not a gradual transformation born of cultural osmosis but commercially driven instant change that demands publicity and is at once advertised throughout the country by an electronic media that is ever alert for sensation.        
	More friction can be expected next week as those who feel they are with it celebrate Valentines Day which Pramod Muthalik, the Sri Ram Sena founder, a former Bajrang Dal luminary and president of the Rashtriya Hindu Sena, has vowed to prevent because Valentines Day is definitely not Indian culture. Nothing could be more spurious. Far from being a Christian ritual, Valentines Day celebrates the triumph of marketing and consumerism. The profits are mopped up by small traders and manufacturers, many being foot soldiers of the Hindutva crusade.         
	The custodians of the mythic Indian identity would be hard put to draw a line and say this custom is alien or this practice is not indigenous. After David Beckham and Roger Federer (and others like them) set the fashion, Yuki Bhambri and Ishant Sharma (and others like them) also celebrate a triumph by clenching their fists and letting out bloodcurdling yells. J.B.S. Haldane, the eminent scientist, sharply reminded us that the officially favoured sherwani was as foreign as the lounge suit, being adopted from another conqueror. All people mean when they insist that something is not Indian is that they have not come across it in Indias vast diversity. Its tempting to regard ones own milieu as the norm and every deviation from it as foreign or unnatural. Its the particular hallmark of small-town thinking.              
	Individual and group agendas complicate matters. Liberals accuse Hindutva activists of cultural talibanization. While trying to distance themselves from the Ram Sena, Hindutva activists point out that even an old communist warhorse like West Bengals deceased PWD minister, Jatin Chakraborty, took up the cudgels against what he called apasanskriti and objected to Usha Uthups performances. Rajasthans Congress government accuses its BJP predecessor of fostering a liquor culture. Though its own excise and licensing policy invokes piety and prohibition, the effect of greatly increased levies may be to increase government revenue from alcohol sales. Having been elected on a Hindutva plank, Karnatakas BJP government cannot come down too hard on Hindutva activists.         
	These are contributory factors. The nub of the matter is that now, as always, Westernization is synonymous with modernization. It affects the dress, speech, behaviour and responses of a much wider spectrum of Indian society than before. If the multitude is going to adopt something, it can only be at the level that is meaningful to the multitude. The refinement of an Oxford Senior Common Room cannot be expected at a mass level. It has to be the raucous boisterousness of a music hall or pub. More people know a jewellery shop than a cultural centre. Its the price of exalting political emancipation above social enlightenment.

	If anyone had told me two weeks ago that Senator Edward Kennedy was one of the greatest Americans of my lifetime, my first reaction would have been to ask the person who made such a statement if he was from Massachusetts. For the vast majority of people in Massachusetts, the Kennedys could do no wrong. When Edward Kennedy was assumed to be down and out politically, after an accident in 1969 on Chappaquiddick Island, which killed a woman passenger in the senators car, an accident which Kennedy failed to report for ten hours, he handily won the re-election from Massachusetts with 62 per cent of the votes cast.        
	But that was two weeks ago. Because Edward Kennedy has been a Senator since I was ten years old, many of those, like me, who have followed his public persona have been tempted to take his lifetime of service for granted. But in death, there has been a widespread realization that the youngest of the troika of Kennedy siblings, who set out to change the United States of America in the 1960s, was, indeed, one of the greatest Americans of the last half a century.         
	There are few aspects of American life today that were not touched by the third-longest-serving senator in US history. Forget the big initiatives. Edward Kennedy had time for things on his long legislative agenda that senior politicians of his standing would baulk at. Sixteen years ago, he took up an initiative that resulted in expanded funding and airtime for childrens programming on public television. Today, when computer games and chatting on the Internet are taking an increasing toll on childrens reading habits, KIDS Raising Readers is focusing on building reading skills in kindergartens, in schools and in homes, especially in communities across America with children from low-income families, through the Public Broadcasting Service.              
	During his 47 years in the Senate, Edward Kennedy led the effort 16 times to raise the minimum wage. For eight years of the Bush presidency and concurrent 10 years of the Republican Congress, the minimum wage, on which the poorest of American workers subsist, had stagnated at $5.15 an hour. With a change of guard in the White House on the horizon and both chambers of the US Congress drifting back into Democratic control, Kennedy redoubled his efforts to raise the minimum wage to $7.25. When President Barack Obama signed into law the minimum wage bill within 100 days of assuming office, 13 million US workers benefited from the raise. There was a Kennedy stamp also on legislation that gave women the right to equal pay for doing the same jobs as their male co-workers.        
	Edward Kennedy was the author of the anti-apartheid bill of 1985 and a follow-up legislation a year later, which mirrored Commonwealth sanctions on South Africa. President Ronald Reagan vetoed the legislative action, but Kennedy assiduously courted Republicans and ensured that both houses of Congress mustered enough votes to override the White House veto. The Lion of the Senate never hesitated to take positions that were morally right even when they were unpopular. When much of the US was convinced by propaganda that Chiles elected president, Salvador Allende, was a communist who was out to destroy American values on the Western hemisphere, Kennedy had the courage to tell President Richard Nixon that the right of the people of Chile to elect their leader ought to be respected. Almost immediately after the military coup and the death of Allende, Kennedy began his efforts on Capitol Hill to link US aid to the restoration of democracy in Chile. In 1986, Kennedy risked hostility from the Pinochet government and travelled to Chile to meet opposition leaders, a trip that eventually acted as a catalyst for a referendum that restored democracy in Chile.        
	But his truly historic contributions were in the areas of civil rights and immigration. Edward Kennedys maiden speech in the US Senate was in support of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and was made only four months after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. This law sought to end discrimination in the US on the basis of colour in employment, education and housing. In that speech, Kennedy held a mirror up to fellow Americans to expose a pattern of discrimination in their history and urged them to shed prejudice. In 1780, a Catholic in Massachusetts was not allowed to vote or hold public office, he pointed out. In 1840, an Irishman could not get a job above that of common labourer. In 1910, a Jew could not stay in places of public accommodation in the Berkshire Mountains.        
	A year later, in 1965, he was the prime mover of legislation that turned American immigration policies on its head, ending a set of nearly half-century-old practices that favoured potential immigrants on the basis of their national origin quotas, race or ancestry. During that period, Kennedy enabled tens of thousands of Indians, among others, to come to the US by making it possible for members of divided families to join their spouses or children who were already in America.         
	He also initiated laws that allowed people to flee persecution and emigrate to America, upholding values that led to the founding of the US in the first place. In 1970, Kennedy sponsored legislation that brought down the voting age from 21 to 18, arguing that if Americans were being called upon to fight in Vietnam at 18, they ought to be able to vote by that age as well.         
	Who will now inherit such a formidable legacy and carry the family beacon in American politics? At the time of writing this, there is talk that Edward Kennedys widow, Victoria Reggie Kennedy, should be drafted to fill the Senate vacancy caused by his death last week. Victoria was Edward Kennedys second wife, his junior by 22 years. Her pedigree is political, but her roots have been in the deep south, in Louisiana, which may not sit well with the Boston brahmins who have traditionally controlled Massachusetts politics. Besides, she is of Lebanese descent: the Kennedys have always made much of their Irishness. Victorias grandparents, both maternal and paternal, were Maronite Christians, although they later converted to Catholicism.         
	Her great asset, among those in Massachusetts for whom Edward Kennedys loss is still raw, is that she brought stability to the senators life, which was falling apart in the late 1980s and in the beginning of the 1990s from bouts of drinking, womanizing, his divorce from an alcoholic first wife and a string of incidents in his personal life that cast him in a poor light. But indications yesterday from Kennedy family sources were that Victoria may not want to enter national politics at this time.              
	If Victoria refuses to be drafted, a substitute from the family may be Joseph Kennedy II, the eldest son of Robert Kennedy, whose fall to an assassins bullet 41 years ago propelled Edward Kennedy on his long journey as the familys patriarch. Joseph Kennedy II is 56, but he quit politics in 1998 after serving six terms as a member of the US House of Representatives, when his estranged wife published a book that portrayed him unfavourably as a husband. He now runs a charity in Boston and has rejected recent efforts to be drafted for the job of state governor. His sister, Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, once appeared to be a rising star in politics, having successfully migrated to Maryland and served two terms as lieutenant governor of that state. But in 2002, she bungled her career with ill-judged political decisions that cost her the governorship of overwhelmingly Democratic Maryland.         
	Caroline Kennedy, who endeared herself to the world as a baby playing on the White House lawns during her fathers tragically short-lived presidency, was to have succeeded Hillary Clinton this year as senator from New York, but the states Democrats mishandled her nomination and she eventually withdrew from contention. Among Edward Kennedys children, Patrick Kennedy, 42, is a member of the US House of Representatives from Rhode Island, the youngest member of the Kennedy family to have been elected to public office at the age of 21. But he has health problems and lacks the charisma to be catapulted into his fathers shoes.         
	But who knows, with the senators death a new political star may have been born. His son, Edward Kennedy Jr., impressed one and all with his demeanour, his voice and his perfect delivery of remembrances during the funeral service for his father in Boston on Saturday. The Kennedys have often surprised the world. Edward Kennedy Jr.s induction into politics may be yet another family surprise.

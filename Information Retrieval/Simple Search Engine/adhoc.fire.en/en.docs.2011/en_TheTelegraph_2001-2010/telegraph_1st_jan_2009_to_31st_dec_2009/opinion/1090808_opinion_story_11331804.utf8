	Srishti Dances of India, an US based Odissi dance company, presented Shatarupa, an evening of Odissi dance, at Gyan Manch on August 1. Initiated into the Odissi style by Guru Mayadhar Raut, Sreyashi Dey, the guiding spirit of the institution, staged traditional Odissi numbers in solo as well as group compositions. The most remarkable feature of the programme was various types of choreographies done by the eminent gurus of this dance style.         
	The evening started off with shivapanchaka mangalacharan, an invocatory number. Choreographed by Gangadhar Pradhan, it set the mood for the evening. It was followed by ahe nila saila, a famous abhinaya composition by Kelucharan Mahapatra, and almost synonymous with Sanjukta Panigrahi, the doyen of the Odissi dance style. Pallavi, a pure dance number where rhythm and footwork were of vital importance, was based on raga Ragesree and performed by Sreyashi. The artist blossomed through intricate movements and picturesque postures.        
	The second half of the evening began with Nabadurga, in which the dancers described the nine forms of Durga through graceful movements. Their basic positions, nimble footwork and neat hand gestures proved an adequate understanding of the dance form. The programme concluded with ardhanarishwar, an unforgettable creation of Guru Kelucharan Mahapatra.

	No cure                  
	Sir  A vital item missing from Amartya Sens list of the things that have wrecked our health services, especially in West Bengal, is corruption (Sen lists deficiencies behind failing health, Dec 31). Corruption at almost all levels is preventing common people from getting proper care in hospitals, both government and private ones. Doctors, nurses, ayahs, attendants as well as the managerial staff are irrevocably corrupt. A conspicuous absence of effective measures has resulted in such widespread corruption among health officials. There are often reports of misuse of funds and illegal sale of clinical equipment by the staff in government hospitals. But it is seldom heard that stern action has been taken against the guilty. As a result, corruption continues unabated.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Mainak Chatterjee, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Amartya Sen has always provided his wise counsel on matters ranging from economics to health. The economist emphasized the implementation of political will, be it in improving health services or in the case of land acquisition. But the rulers seem more interested in upholding political agendas rather than in constructive programmes to fulfil their commitments to people. Coordination committees in hospitals are aware of this fact. The Opposition too is unwilling to change things for the better. Consequently, India lags behind nations such as Bhutan, Sri Lanka and even Ethiopia in the allotment of funds to healthcare.           
	While pointing out the lapses in this sector, Sen identified a few methods that might turn around things in hospitals. I would like to add a few more suggestions in this context. A major problem plaguing government healthcare institutions is the uninhibited access of outsiders to the premises. There is no security, the corridors are often crowded with patients and their families who jostle for space with dogs, cats and rats.The picture is not very different even in prestigious hospitals like the Calcutta Medical College and Hospital. To prevent this, government hospitals should institute a dress code and take steps to flush out outsiders. All clinical instruments should be kept in order and in running condition. Patients should also not be prescribed medicines unnecessarily, while the quality of meals needs to be raised. There should be a team to supervise the standards of hygiene in the hospital wards and kitchens. Finally, the hospital administration and the services section should function independently of each other.          
	When I hear of people from Bengal going to the South or the West for treatment, I am not surprised. The trained nurses and paramedics in state hospitals can do precious little, given the woeful lack of infrastructure here.           
	Yours faithfully,      
R. Subhranshu, Chandernagore

                
	Air alert          
	Sir  I am an Australian national of Indian origin. I feel it is my moral responsibility to share my experience of lax security at a time when the countrys airports and other strategic installations have been put on alert owing to threats from terrorist outfits. I recently travelled by an Emirates flight to Dubai from Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Airport in Calcutta. Right from the entrance to the airport till the transfer area (before the security hold), all the passengers were allowed to proceed without their handbags being checked by either the security men or machines. These handbags could have carried explosives, arms and ammunition, enough to cause a disaster such as the one in Mumbai. I was able to express my concerns about the airport authoritys apathy to the manager. I also put my complaint in writing in the suggestion box. I strongly feel that India will have to show a greater respect for the lives of its citizens if it is serious about defeating terrorism. Significantly, the discussion I had with the airport authority was not very encouraging. Security in Indian airports can only improve if every piece of baggage, including handbags, is checked at the entrance itself.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Neither modernization nor the addition of new facilities is likely to improve the condition of the airport in Calcutta. The entire staff should be replaced as the present employees get paid despite doing little work. On a recent visit, I found the toilet near the boarding gates dirtier than the ones at Howrah station. Groups of men roamed aimlessly, and talked coarsely in a loud voice. At the departure lounge, officials at the immigration desk insisted that my family members, even the children, had to go to different desks. I protested, saying that children should not be separated for the sake of their safety, but the staff remained adamant. I eventually stopped arguing, as there were many other passengers in the queue. Worse was to follow. As I was waiting for my wife and children to complete their turns, one of the staff came up to me and said that I could not stand there without a purpose. I told him that I was waiting for my family, but he was not willing to listen to anything I said. I have never come across such ill-mannered airport staff anywhere. There have been reports of other problems as well: power cuts and aircraft surviving head-on collisions on the runway, that may have led some airlines to discontinue their services. Calcutta perhaps does not deserve to have an international terminal.          
	Yours faithfully,

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | killer roads
                                                                                                                 KILLER ROADS                                                    
	India has won another dubious distinction  topper, beating China, in the fatal road accidents list published by the World Health Organization. Calcuttans are in a specially privileged position to assess the extent to which Indian roads are a health hazard. The city is an ideal case study for everything that causes 90 per cent of the worlds road deaths to happen in low- and middle-income countries, even if these countries have just 48 per cent of the worlds registered vehicles. Think of the endless succession of people killed by speeding buses in the city and its suburbs. Various factors dovetail in the city to cause these deaths, brutal speeding being only one of them. Non-existent traffic management and engineering, callousness towards pedestrian rights, pavements taken over by illegal hawkers, flouting of laws regarding helmets, seatbelts and drunken driving, corrupt and inefficient policing, bad road maintenance and lighting (especially in rural areas), an inordinate number of homeless poor living and sleeping on the streets, politicized indiscipline  everything comes together in every possible combination to make roads full of fatal peril. And the responsibility will have to be shared between the citizens and the authorities.        
	A shocking lack of civic sense and, more important, of the common human fear of death characterize the average Indian on the road. Men, women and children will blithely break rules that exist for their own safety out of a mix of ignorance and senseless bravado. Yet, at the other end of the spectrum, the civic authorities remain just as shockingly indifferent to modern notions of traffic management and urban planning. Indian cities are turning proudly global. But one just has to recall the mayhem in the vicinity of the South City Mall in Calcutta in the evenings to realize how rapid urban development happens here without the overhauling of the other systems within which such development has to be contained.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A familiar and sinuous trail of violence
                                                                                                                 A FAMILIAR AND SINUOUS TRAIL OF VIOLENCE                              The mutiny by the Bangladesh Rifles was not just sparked off by old grievances, but was also abetted by certain Islamist elements, writes Sankar Sen                        Simmering discontent				                                       
	The mutiny by the Bangladesh Rifles personnel, which ended on February 26 with the surrender of arms by the rebels, was profoundly disturbing. The mutineers revolted against their commanding army officers who had gathered at the BDR headquarters in Pilkhana, Dhaka, for the BDR Week celebrations. They killed more than 80 army personnel, including the BDR chief, Major General Shakil Ahmed, and his wife. The horrors of the carnage came to light when security forces discovered mass graves of the slain army officers in different parts of the BDR headquarters. A number of officers are still missing.         
	The BDR is the paramilitary force guarding Bangladeshs 4,427 km border with India and Myanmar. With a force of nearly 67,000 troops, its primary task is to patrol this border. Its remit also includes lending support to the military and the civilian government during war.         
	While serving in the Border Security Force, first as the inspector-general of the West Bengal Frontier and thereafter as the additional director-general of the Eastern Frontier, I had many opportunities to interact with the BDR officers and men, and also to view their functioning from close quarters. The average pay of a BDR constable is meagre (about $70 a month) and conditions of service far from satisfactory. All the senior posts in the BDR are held by army officers, who come on deputation. Many of them want to have a cushy time and show little concern for the welfare of the BDR troopers serving under them. Standards of professionalism and discipline among the BDR men are poor compared to their counterpart in the BSF. Many of the former are up to their necks in smuggling and trafficking operations in the border areas. They also nurse other grievances. Some of the BDR rebels have complained that army officers repress them physically and financially, often misbehaving with them. This deeply rankled many of the subordinate officers and men in the BDR. They also level serious corruption charges against the army officers.         
	These long pending grievances of the BDR men over their pay, leave, posting, deputation and so on should have been redressed by different governments in Bangladesh and not allowed to fester. It should be mentioned, in this context, that in the police and in the paramilitary forces, subordinates are always given opportunities to vent their grievances in the alochana sabhas, and steps are taken to redress them promptly. In the BSF, one of the prime responsibilities of senior officers is to look after the welfare of the men serving in distant bordering areas and exposing themselves to many hazards. But these simmering grievances and bread-and-butter issues cannot explain the violent mutiny that broke out and the brutality that accompanied it.               
	The cold-blooded brutality with which army officers, and some of their wives and relations, were massacred by the rebels implies prior planning and preparation. It recalls the atrocities perpetrated by the Rajakars during the 1971 war. The gruesome massacre of so many army officers bears the tell-tale marks of a well-planned conspiracy. Elements from within and without the army sparked the conflagration. It is reported that some outsiders with covered faces carried out the attack on army officers along with the BDR men.        
	The prime minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina Wajed, visited the BDR headquarters on February 24 for a meeting with the BDR top brass. She asked the BDR to step up the vigil on the border and made clear that she would not allow Bangladeshs soil to be used for launching terrorist attacks on any country (implying India). The mutiny started just 24 hours after her visit. Senior army officers did not have any clue about it and were totally unprepared to confront such a catastrophic situation.         
	It bears recall that the infiltration of the fundamentalist Jamat-e-Islami elements, both in the army and in the BDR, started in the 1980s, and the process was quickened and legitimized during the regime of Begum Khaleda Zia and her Bangladesh Nationalist Party. The Jamat is the countrys largest Islamist political party and the fountainhead of hard-line Islamic elements in Bangladesh. The sustained anti-India and anti-Hindu campaign had poisoned the minds of many BDR men. The ghastly killings of 16 BSF personnel and the mutilation of their bodies at Boraibari in 2001 were an ominous indicator of the growing influence of the fanatical elements among the BDR. Earlier, BSF or BDR men intruding into Bangladesh or India were invariably returned after a flag meeting without any harm done to them.        
	The caretaker government had previously tried to cleanse the administration off the BNP elements but the decision of the Sheikh Hasina government to put the 1971 war criminals on trial set the alarm bells ringing, frightening the pro-Jamati elements. Hasina also ordered an official investigation into the role of the Jamat chief, Matiur Rahman Nizami, and nine others in the massacre of freedom fighters during the war of independence in 1971. It seems that intelligence agencies, particularly the directorate general of forces intelligence, either had no clue about the meeting or had deliberately kept the government in the dark. There is a distinct possibility that elements in the intelligence agencies may have lent support to the mutineers by not communicating hard intelligence to the government in time. The DGFI has had a long record of close links with the Inter-Services Intelligence and some of these links may have remained intact. Sheikh Hasina had sacked the previous DGFI chief, Major General Golam Mohammad, whose proximity to Jamat and Khaleda Zia was well known. But there are elements still embedded in the DGFI who are hostile to the present regime.               
	Similarly, the present army chief of Bangladesh, Mooen U. Ahmed, has tried to rid the army of pro-Jamati and BNP elements, but it is not known how far he has succeeded in this cleansing operation. There are strong pro-Khaleda elements in the Bangladesh army which view the Awami Leagues return to power with anger and apprehension. Unless these are thoroughly defanged, they will bide their time and strike once again.        
	A committee headed by the home minister of Bangladesh has started a probe into this gruesome massacre. Some of the BDR personnel who have been captured and interrogated have, as reported in the press, given the names of some of the ringleaders, including a few officers of the BDR. They have also pointed fingers at the BNP member of parliament and business tycoon, Salauddin Qadeer Chowdhury, who has several graft cases against him. A thorough probe will unravel the nature and the extent of the conspiracy as well as confirm the identities of the conspirators.         
	The conspirators, who perhaps include sideline officers and Jamat-e-Islami supporters, may have calculated that the massacre of a large number of army officers would provoke violent reprisals by the army, creating confusion and instability, thereby providing an opportunity to throw out of gear the fragile civil administration. Fortunately, this did not happen, and the army officers and men heeded the call of the prime minster instead of storming the BDR headquarters. Had they chosen the latter, it would have caused heavy casualties on all sides. The commander-in-chief of the army has also categorically declared the armys loyalty to the government.         
	The situation in Bangladesh remains volatile. This is the first major challenge Sheikh Hasina faced after her landslide victory in the election. Military coups are not uncommon in Bangladesh but this kind of deliberate massacre of army officers had never taken place before. Initially, Hasina had declared amnesty for those conspirators who would lay down their arms, but with the mounting anger of the army officers, the government has had to harden its stand. The government has declared that the conspirators would be tried in fast-track courts and severely punished. A special tribunal would be set up to try them. Unless tough action is taken against them there would be resentment in the army, and that cannot be allowed to grow. The army has also been deployed to trace the BDR mutineers, some of whom have fled to India. But a fledgling democracy will not be able to function effectively by relying only on the armys support. Sheikh Hasina will have to mobilize the support of the democratic forces and of civil society to thwart the fundamentalists.               
	The restoration of the normal functioning of the BDR would be a tough job. A few BDR personnel are limping back to duty. But it would not be easy to restore confidence among the army officers commanding the BDR troopers. The relationship will remain surcharged with suspicion and tension. Mature and imaginative leadership is needed to heal the wounds. It is also to be seen how far the army chief succeeds in building up a professional and political army wedded to democratic norms and principles.

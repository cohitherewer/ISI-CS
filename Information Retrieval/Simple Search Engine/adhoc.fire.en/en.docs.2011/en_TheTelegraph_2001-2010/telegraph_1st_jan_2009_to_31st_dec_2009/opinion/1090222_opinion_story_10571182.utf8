The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Knock on the right door
                                                                                                                 KNOCK ON THE RIGHT DOOR                                                          
	It does not cost much to appear concerned. The problem is to act on it. The West Bengal government is obviously concerned about the welfare of senior citizens. As a token of this, it has instructed the police to make house-to-house visits in a bid to find out whether elderly parents are being treated well by their children. Wherever adult children are unwilling to look after their parents, the police have to compel them to do their duty. This is hardly a practical plan. Whatever the criticisms against the police, house-to-house checking for selfish children is an enormously time-consuming job to be added to their regular duties. If the state government is serious in its concern, it should direct either the police or the department of social welfare, or both, to train a wing of social visitors to protect senior citizens in their homes. To be convincing, concern has to be expressed through viable plans.        
	The plan is not only impractical but also useless. Almost immediately after the governments directive, an old couple petitioned the Calcutta High Court against ill-treatment by their son. The court is their last resort. The police have not only ignored their complaint, but are also allegedly helping the exploitative son, who, according to the parents, wants his fathers bit of land. The parents complaint is informed by their perception that the police are helping their son because he belongs to a particular political party.        
	The perception is keenly relevant. The governments direction to the police to be helpful to the citizen is undermined by the way they appear to the people of West Bengal. In everyday life, the police are perceived as lackadaisical at best, and opportunistic at worst. That is sad, because there are upright, courageous, highly professional policemen and women in the force, whose work is obscured by the more visible effects of the inefficiency, bullying, dishonesty and partisan behaviour of their colleagues. Once again, much concerned, the chief minister, also the police minister, has instructed the police to be people-friendly. But the success of his own party in creating a committed police force has been remarkable: being friendly to people and being friendly to a party are two vastly different things.        
	There is no need to go far for proof. In response to another recent case, the Calcutta High Court has concluded that one reason that Calcuttans nowadays shy away from helping ill or injured people on the roads is the fear of police harassment. A passer-by who took a sick man to hospital when some people had been poisoned by drinking unlicensed liquor has since been on the run from the police, who allegedly wanted to arrest him as one of the illegal manufacturers. As long as the police keep reconfirming peoples fears about their abuse of power, they will be quite useless as the instruments of the governments concern.

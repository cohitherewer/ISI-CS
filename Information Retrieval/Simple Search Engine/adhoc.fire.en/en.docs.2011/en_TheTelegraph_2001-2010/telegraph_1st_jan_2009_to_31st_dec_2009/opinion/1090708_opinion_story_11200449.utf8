                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Fatal rides                  
	Sir  Autos and minibuses are the worst nuisance on the roads. They have no regard for traffic rules (Flyover death race, July 5). In this case, the death toll would have been higher if the power of the overhead wires, carrying nearly 25,000 volts of electricity, had not been turned off in time by the railway staff. Calcuttans are forced to ride these buses as they are the easiest and most cost-effective means of commuting.           
	The transport ministers indulgence and empathy have allowed bus drivers to keep breaking the rules. I do not expect any stern action to be taken against these law-breakers this time either. Being a minister, he has the power to ensure that reckless drivers are punished according to the law. Depending on the bus drivers good sense, if any, is not a good idea.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Subhayu Saha, Khagra, Murshidabad                     
	Sir  The transport minister, Subhas Chakraborty, is one of the most ineffective ministers in Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees cabinet. He has totally failed to control rash drivers of autos and buses, many of which are not even fit to be on the roads. Even the state buses are in a ramshackle state and spew poisonous fumes. The government must take steps to ensure that the motor vehicles department is made more efficient and free of corruption.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  The Citu-controlled bus union is responsible for most of the accidents involving private buses. They vie with one another to get passengers. Accidents involving state buses are fewer for the simple reason that the state transport employees get a regular monthly remuneration. The real problem is the commission system introduced by Citu to enhance the earnings of the bus crew. The owners of the buses hardly have any say. A fixed monthly salary will not only reduce the number of accidents, but will also prevent the buses from stopping unnecessarily. The transport ministers ineffectuality has only managed to aggravate the problem that Citu has created.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Tusar Kanti Kar, Howrah

                
	Sir  What can be more shameful for the police department than rogue bus drivers losing all fear and regard for the police? This is mainly because the bus workers unions are backed by political parties, bribes are regularly taken by the police and the motor vehicles department, and the police lack motivation and a sense of duty. For many of the people handling this situation, it was just another accident.           
	The policemen seem to be eager to grill the seriously injured driver who has little chance of survival. They are waiting for him to recover so that they can slap a dozen charges against him. What will happen if the driver dies? Will the case then be brushed under the carpet and everything return to square one? Who is going to grill the policemen who failed to implement the law? If the flyover is a death trap and the police have miserably failed to stop the men- ace, why cant some speed break- ers be built on the flyover?                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Nothing has changed since the accident on the Bankim Setu. Even now ruthless drivers are overtaking one another on busy roads without any concern for the lives of helpless passengers and pedestrians.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Ankita Neogi, Hooghly

                
	Sir  It is shocking that Dhirubhai Makwana, a Gujarati bus driver, should end his life in repentance for having caused a terrible accident claiming seven lives (Usual event, unusual act: guilt kills driver whose bus mowed down 7, July 1). Reports in The Telegraph show that 421 people had been killed in road accidents in Calcutta in 2008 alone, but not a single offender confessed his guilt. The practice is to decamp from the spot of the accident and run away from the law as well as the wrath of the public.           
	Punishments for traffic violations in Calcutta are too lenient. In 2005, the Calcutta Police had proposed a penal structure for the violation of traffic rules by jay-walkers, drivers and others, but the proposal is stuck in red tape. It needs to be cleared and implemented so that road accidents can be checked. Similarly, the public vehicles department should become more strict so that ill-trained drivers cannot get a driving licence by forking out a bribe. The callousness and a lack of accountability in all this is worrying. Ignoring traffic signals and talking on mobile phones while crossing the road or while driving go unpunished. Moving in a leisurely way on a busy street is also not uncommon. We have an inherent love for flouting rules. A safety week once a year is not the remedy for this illness embedded in our psyche. Only properly imposed punishments will do the job.          
	Yours faithfully,         Subhankar Mukherjee, Burdwan

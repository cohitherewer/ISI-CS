                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	After the party                  
	Sir  Recently, the chief minister was outraged because there was a 20-minutes power cut during the peak hours on a Durga Puja night (Puja power cut shock wave in govt Sept 27). He publicly reprimanded the Calcutta Electric Supply Corporation for this. We would like to ask Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee why he has woken up so late to the reality in his state. Power cuts have become a routine affair in Calcutta. In fact, Calcuttans have become used to a host of problems related to civil services, such as erratic drinking water supply, potholed roads, a crumbling public distribution system of both foodgrains and LPG cylinders, collapsed healthcare and so on. Why does Bhattacharjees heart bleed now, so late in the day? Is it because of a certain Mamata Banerjee and her party readying themselves for the final assault on the red bastion?                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Imtiaz Chowdhry, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  All people shopped to the hilt before Durga Puja and Eid. Although the huge crowds in the shops failed to deter the shoppers, they were daunted at the prospect of the journeys by buses or the Metro to their destinations. After the ban on old buses, the number of buses on the city roads has decreased considerably. It is difficult to get an auto rickshaw as well nowadays. I asked an auto driver to explain why so few of of his kind can be seen on the roads. He pointed to an LPG station where there was a long queue of autos waiting for a refill. Once there used to be extended queues of autos awaiting passengers. Now people have to run to catch an auto, if available at all. The Metro used to be the safest and the most comfortable medium of transport. The mad rush in the Metro after the extension is becoming more dangerous by the day. If one happens to see a person without shoe on one foot, with his spectacles broken, with the wristwatch kept in the shirt pocket and his body wet with perspiration, one will know he has travelled in the Metro.          
	People were somewhat relieved when the government promised to provide extra buses during the Pujas. Now that the Pujas are over and the dhakis have bid goodbye, will the traffic situation go back to square one?           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  One of the biggest shopping malls in Calcutta turned out to be one of the most unsafe places this Puja. The day after Dashami, I went for my friends birthday treat to a mall on the Bypass. There, at 12 noon, Rs 7,000 was stolen from my friends wallet in the ground-floor washroom. We suspect the cleaner on duty to be the one responsible for the theft since she was the only person present with my friend in the washroom at the time of the loss. On discovering the theft after coming out of the washroom, my friend informed the security personnel at the mall. The management did respond at first. But then they did not continue the probe seriously, probably after viewing the closed-circuit television, which must have shown some incriminating evidence. So we had to turn to the local police and sign a first information report. But even after a great deal of harassment, the investigation went nowhere and the money was not found.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  As residents of the housing complex, Fortune City, we were happy to see the picture of the Durga Puja held in our apartment in The Telegraph Hand in Hand (Sept 26) feature of the newspaper. Now that the Puja days are over, we would like to state certain facts relating to the puja at our place. We have a beautiful landscape garden in the complex. The lawn has been maintained by the developer with our money till now as the handover process is not yet complete. The Durga Puja pandal and a big stage for cultural functions had been erected right on the green turf. Many of the residents had anticipated that the puja and associated activities would damage the greenery. So they had forwarded complaint letters to all possible authorities beforehand. Since there are already strict directives from the state environment department regarding the maintenance of greenery, the developer gave a conditional permission for organizing the puja anywhere inside the complex except on the lawn. Unfortunately, the so-called Puja committee manipulated the local authorities and somehow obtained permission for having the puja right on the green patch. We would like to point out in this context that there is ample concrete space inside the complex for such activities. After the puja, the beautiful greenery has been damaged beyond repair. Even during the Pujas, the organizers have repeatedly flouted sound pollution rules by playing music at an unbearably loud pitch till late at night.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Navratri is finally over. Such festivals are all about extravagance. They are sponsored generously by spendthrift organizers and formidable political leaders who want to thus channel the funds extorted from business organizations. These influential people would spend lavishly on celebrations but do nothing for the thousands of people living in misery. If one wanders through the streets of Nagpur, one can witness poor persons or those with mental disability lying in the street corners. It is a pity that the samajik mandals, which are so taken up with religious festivities, do not bother about the destitute.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Pankaj Kumar, Dhanbad

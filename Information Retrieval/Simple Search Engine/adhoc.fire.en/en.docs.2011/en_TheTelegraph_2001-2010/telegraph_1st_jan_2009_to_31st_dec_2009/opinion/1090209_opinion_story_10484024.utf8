   S.L. Rao                        Protest against Satyam				                                                   
	A promoter head of a company in India who went to sleep in 1996 and woke up today would be aghast at the limitations on his freedom as owner. He cannot frequently change accounting policies relating to depreciation, recognizing revenues or expenses to suit the companys performance in any year, freely use company money for his personal and family expenses, postpone or advance the booking of profits in a year depending on what results he wanted to show, and instead must conform to rules laid down by the regulator, the Securities and Exchange Board of India, if his company is listed on a stock exchange. He cannot pack the board with his relatives or those beholden to him, his remuneration has to be cleared by a remuneration committee with independent directors, there is an audit committee to oversee whether the companys accounting policies are adequate and are being followed, he has to declare promoters equity holdings, show the companys transactions with his other business interests or with people connected to him. If he has raised money abroad, especially in the United States of America, he is subject to more stringent requirements and severe penalties for violation. He has to adhere to the insider trading code that prevents trading on his own or through specified relatives for weeks prior to consideration of results. As the director of companies that did not file annual accounts for three financial years, failed to repay deposits and interest on debentures or did not declare dividends, he is liable. But there are practically no limits to what he can pay himself or his employees.              
	In reality, the new requirements do not stop extravagant remuneration to managing directors, expensive capital assets purchased for their use, close friends and relatives of theirs being hired and paid extravagantly, accounting policies lawfully being frequently changed, related party transactions taking place at a less-than-arms length basis, boards of directors being packed with yes men, compliant auditors, and so on. Many promoters use their position to start other businesses using the companys resources, or encourage retainers to set up enterprises on their own with help from the company while continuing to run the original enterprise.         
	No regulation can allow for the ingenuity of a crooked manager or managing director. It is for the auditors and board to be vigilant. A vigilant media can help expose wrongdoings in some cases. But speedier and more severe penalties than laws allow at present must be imposed on promoters, managers, auditors, rating agencies or merchant banks that helped violations to occur.         
	The requirements of Clause 49 of the Listing Agreement from Sebi bring transparency in disclosure only if owners or promoters want it. Otherwise they remain tick marks on corporate governance reports submitted every quarter. As of now, Sebi has issued notices to about 20 companies, mostly public sector units, mainly for default in the composition of boards.         
	Some companies employ rating agencies to evaluate their corporate governance. This is deeply flawed since the rating agency is paid by the company being rated. This is also for credit rating. A rating can be truly independent only if the agency is quite independent of the company being rated. If Sebi selects the agencies, or gives the company a list to choose from, and remunerates them from fees charged by Sebi, the ratings might be independent.         
	This has also been suggested for selecting auditors independent of the management of the audited company. Sebi could choose the auditor and pay the audit firm directly, later charging the company. Auditors must be rotated every few years. If knowledge of the company built up by the outgoing audit firm is not to be lost, the new auditor could work in tandem with the old one on his final audit.         
	Satyam had a glittering board of directors, among whom the independents included a world-renowned scholar on strategy and corporate governance, another head of two outstanding business schools, a great inventor and a former top bureaucrat. Their service providers included one of the Big Four among the worlds auditors, the best-known banks, merchant bankers and rating agencies in India. Ramalinga Raju himself studied in two prestigious American business schools including Harvard. Satyam received the Golden Peacock award for good governance a few weeks before its collapse as well as other awards. The lesson is not to trust any awards.         
	But the mindset of the owner/promoter/principal shareholder, who controls the company, is the key to whether good governance is a series of tick marks on a form submitted to Sebi or is so in truth. If rules and regulations can make people honest, India would by now be a socially reformed country, with no dowry, no sexual harassment at work or elsewhere, no child labour, universal education, and no discrimination on account of religion or caste. Not laws or rules, but willingness to obey them, and a State ready to severely punish non-compliance will lead to better governance.         
	The many reports of corporate misbehaviour by CEOs in some of the largest and best-known companies in the US demonstrate non-compliance by a few. But the punishments meted out to those who are caught ensure that more comply than defy.         
	Independent directors can and must closely question every piece of information and proposal placed before them. They must make themselves available to anyone who wants to convey something to them about the company. If they suspect any information or proposal they must be willing to initiate an independent study (at company cost). But ultimately they are as effective as the information they are given. So long as they are not involved in fraud or in suppressing knowledge about fraud or any activity not in conformity with agreed company policies, they cannot be held liable.              
	The constraints include the suitability of independent directors invited to join a board. Far too often we have celebrity directors, for example, Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw in his nineties was on 20 boards. Despite nomination committees consisting of independent directors, the promoter chief on most boards chooses the new directors. Appointments from a list prepared by an independent regulatory body like Sebi might mitigate this. Another problem is the business, not technical, competence of the appointed director. He must understand the essentials of how a business is run  which means an adequate knowledge of accounting, finance, human resources and so on. Perhaps every new board member (without exception) should go though a one-week programme to understand these matters, and that be repeated every three years.         
	Further, most independent directors in India tend to be in their sixties with a lifetime in some career. For many of them (whether business managers, civil servants, army officers, academics or other professionals), their remunerations were subject for most of their working lives to low government imposed limits. The present remuneration available to independent directors is therefore a considerable improvement on anything they have been paid in their careers. This could make them less willing to ask awkward questions or even to oppose an incumbent head of a company, for fear of losing this income. This problem will disappear over time since salaries are now much higher. But independent directors must not be remunerated lavishly. This can help them resist the temptation to subservience. They could have definite terms of, say, three times three years, that is, a maximum of nine years. Confidential evaluations by directors (and even by managers who are in contact with them) of one another can eliminate directors obviously unable to contribute.         
	There are few suitable people who can contribute to a companys better governance. Independent directors are there to ensure good governance. They need not be entrepreneurs. But they must have knowledge and understanding of the principles of social, political, economic and business environments.

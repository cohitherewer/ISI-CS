The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A dream of low noise
                                                                                                                 A DREAM OF LOW NOISE                          - Taxi drivers, ahimsa and subtle games        The Thin Edge: Ruchir Joshi                          Coming through                                              
	At this critical juncture of human history, I am surrounded by people who are doing things to make the world a better place; I have close friends who would describe themselves variously, individuals who, without rest or respite, are engaged in the fight for human rights, some keeping the womens struggle in the foreground, others filtering their work through issues facing urban or rural working classes, others who are on the frontlines of the Environmental World War, others still, who through the examining and documenting of history, give us the continuity and context we need as a society in perpetual development, and so on. When I see these people around me, I feel utterly useless  as superfluous to the convoy of Inevitable Progress as a hubcap on a punctured spare tyre.         
	It has been pointed out to me that this feeling of complete uselessness is a self-indulgence behind which people like myself hide in order to avoid doing anything difficult and constructive. Recently, Ive taken the point. Ive reminded myself that, at the beginning of his political career, Ho Chi Minh was an anonymous chef in French restaurants and that Gandhi was first engag as a campaigner for vegetarianism in the World Headquarters of Meat-Consumption that was late 19th-century London. Ive taken note of my friends advice that I should start working with and around my roots. Ive looked at my daily routine, the core areas where I can begin to struggle and operate, and Im happy to report to readers that I have begun my first campaign to challenge and subvert the oppressive forces.               
	The other day, when I boarded a taxi, the usual thing happened: I sat down and the driver took off, machine-gunning his horn. My usual reaction to this is to loudly order the driver not to use the horn, which is like playing Russian Roulette with a fully loaded gun: there is no greater lover of personal freedom of expression than the Cal taxi driver and all that my peremptory command does, usually, is to increase the frequency of honking. That day I decided to do things differently. I asked the man how old he was and he said he was in his thirties. I asked him whether he was at all afraid of going deaf and whether he had heard of something called brain damage. Once I had his attention, I very seriously quoted completely fictional statistics about taxi drivers in Buenos Aires and the huge study that had been done on them and the effects of over-honking. Between Minto Park and Hazra, I convinced him that the most dangerous honking was ones own and not all the surrounding ones, the way the cigarette you smoke damages you more than all the passive smokers around you (banal, cheap-level truth had nothing whatsoever to do with this). Between Manohar Pukur Road and Hiland Park, driving mid-morning, the driver didnt use his horn once.        
	The next taxi ride, I tried a different tack: I told the cabbie I had a special brain disease which came from working in a loud disco for many years, I told him it hurt me like a knife everytime someone hit a horn in the car I was in; the man laid off the horn, partly out of sympathy but partly out of fear of catching the same disease. Later, in another taxi, I tried a challenge game: I bet you thirty rupees you cant take me from here to Dharmatolla without using your horn once. I happily paid out the money, leaving the cabbie with positive associations between non-honking and profit. Then I tried a variation on the betting game, twenty rupees for total horn-silence versus five rupees for each time the driver hit the horn  I won forty but didnt, of course, demand my winnings. Another time, same deal, but I helped the driver by anticipating each time he was about to honk and saying, Maat karo (Dont do it)! As I handed him the twenty bucks I pointed out to him how much he would have lost (Rs 55) had I not helped him, Next passenger, play the game just with yourself! I urged the man as he drove off. After a few days of this, I raised the game to a subtler level, but only when I found a really intelligent taxiwalla (and lets face it, as in any profession, not everyone is smart): I asked him to give me a reason for each hit of his horn. We discovered the horn had been completely unnecessary seven times out of ten; two times it had been in counter to other drivers trying to honk their way through and once, just once, it had been to warn a stray dog that wasnt looking.         
	The basic principle I followed was of ahimsa, that is, never using my notional power-of-the-customer to order compliance, but making an effort, through argument, story-telling and game-playing to elicit some level of self-realization in the addressee. Also, only low-level untruths were deployed; anything that could take on the shape of dangerous rumour was also avoided; for instance, I fought off the urge to connect over-honking with impotence, or sperm becoming solely girl-child-producing.        
	The behaviour thats emerging from the whole exercise is fascinating. People who drive cars will understand the following better than non-drivers but, hopefully, everybody will pay attention. The urge to slam your way through all obstacles is usually preceded by a watch out Im coming through! push on the horn  once you stop honking you cant as easily go for that famous Calcutta manoeuvre, the overtake from the wrong side. Equally, the non-honking driver is forced to be much more considerate towards pedestrians, there being no warning horn available to scatter soft targets. Frustration-honking being taken away, drivers automatically keep to lanes better. Drivers in front of us, who dont have cacophony climbing up the backs of their necks, make slightly better decisions at crossings, though this will only be verifiable once the overall honk-toxicity goes down. Lastly, the chief benefit I can see is that the non-availability of honking (which is closely associated with speeding and the desire to speed), means the drivers have to slow down and use their their brakes more generously and, therefore, their accelerators much more judiciously.              
	********              
	Having conducted my experiments with non-honking, I now call upon all drivers of private cars and all employers of drivers reading this to put a clamp on honking. I call upon all taxi-using citizens to find the energy to engage with cab drivers in a humorous and creative but insistent way: imagine you are contributing the drop of a non-honking taxi ride to what will eventually become a beautiful ocean of silence.         
	If we all do this, it will only leave the motorbikes, buses, minibuses and freight vehicles. As we learn from Marx and other brothers, it takes time to build revolutionary critical mass.               
	Of course, I have no complete solution and, of course, this is only a small beginning, but I do have a more comprehensive programme to back these first steps. For instance, all buses and heavy vehicles should be issued with speed-locks to which could be added horn-locks which do not allow more than one honk per ten minutes and that too only when the vehicle is moving at a certain speed (necessary because of possible emergencies); there could also be strictly patrolled no-horn zones and no-horn hours; there could be tamper-proof horn-meters in each vehicle and a steep fine for exceeding allotted horn limits, etc. etc. There should also be strong workshops for drivers, especially the ones who have no business being behind a wheel, and there should be programmes to create alternative employment for the many thousands who need to change profession from being drivers to something a lot less dangerous. But, before I unfurl that plan, we should give space to whoever wins the forthcoming elections, an invitation and a challenge to the winning MPs from Calcutta to quickly implement a people-friendly traffic policy. If they dont, we unite and move. The first people to suffer will be those multinational companies whose ads equate electronic horns with freedom and crowd-scattering tasers, ads they would never dare run in their own immaculately autobahned countries.         
	I have a dream and it is a beautiful, low-noise one. If we need to come together on this, its a campaign we can win, yes we can.

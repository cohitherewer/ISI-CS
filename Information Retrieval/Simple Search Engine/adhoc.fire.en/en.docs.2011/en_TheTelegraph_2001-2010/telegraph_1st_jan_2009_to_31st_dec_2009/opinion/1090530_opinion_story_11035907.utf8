	Bengal is in for a rough ride as it begins the painful process of exchanging the CPM that an old-fashioned communist friend calls Communist Party (Marwari) for what might become the Communist Party (Mamata). Didi remains the Left Fronts implacable enemy but the gulf between one rumbustious localized force and another is likely to become increasingly narrow.        
	The two Lok Sabha election manifestos were strikingly similar. Mamata Banerjees Maa, Mati, Manush slogan, taken from Bhairab Gangopadhayas 1975 jatra, has robbed the Left Front of the emotive, even xenophobic, appeal that swept it to power in the late Seventies. Her promise to take up the cause of Bengali retail shopkeepers threatened by supermarkets and shopping malls owned by the Ambanis and Goenkas capitalized on the ethnic factor. Some cadres are already deserting the sinking Marxist ship for the boisterously sailing Trinamul Congress vessel; others are accused of hijacking Trinamuls agitation against a mining project in Birbhum. There is considerable overlap with a Left that long ago abandoned its revolutionary mission.        
	The silver lining is that Bengal might eventually gain from a change of guard. New Delhi might be more helpful to Trinamul than to the Left Front, which has in any case grown jaded in office. Two Central cabinet ministers and several junior colleagues, of whom Saugata Ray gained ministerial experience in New Delhi 30 years ago, might direct investment to the state, create jobs and improve the infrastructure. Much will depend, however, on Mamatas ability to go beyond gimmicks like a Rs 20 monthly ticket for passengers who never buy tickets.              
	Meanwhile, knives are being sharpened for inter- and intra-party warfare. Competitive relief for cyclone victims, with Mamata at Namkhana trying to upstage Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at Nimpith, provides a benign glimpse of the race ahead. Approaches to R.P. Goenka, the Calcutta Electric Supply Corporation chairman, by both provides another. The CESC chairman may be anxious to do his duty, but business instinct will determine how he responds and to whom. He was prominently there with other captains of industry when the Indian Chamber of Commerce entertained the up-and-coming Mamata only two months before Jyoti Basu stepped down  or should it be stepped aside, as with Lee Kuan Yew?  in 2000. Big business, represented by the ICC, hedged its bets then, hosting Basu in the morning and Didi the same evening.        
	These are entertaining features of the battle for Bengal. But though the present chief minister, a bhadralok to his fingertips in the best sense of the word, cannot match the born-again railway ministers penchant for histrionic self-advertisement, the cadres behind him are as vicious as Mamatas mob. Its there that danger looms for ordinary folk.        
	Bengals land and land revenue minister, Abdur Rezzak Mollah, understandably presented only the CPMs version when he warned that a victorious Trinamul would repeat the bloodbath that engulfed Indonesia in 1965-66. Others know that unlike the Partai Komunis Indonesia, whose three million members made it the worlds biggest communist party outside the Soviet Union and China, Alimuddin Streets battalions can give as good as they get. The battle will not be just one-sided butchery as in Indonesia where the murder of six senior generals was the cue for the army under Suharto, backed by the Americans, to slaughter between 500,000 and a million communists. A Central Intelligence Agency study concluded that the anti-PKI massacres in Indonesia rank as one of the worst mass murders of the 20th century.         
	Such carnage may appear inconceivable here until one recalls the Great Calcutta Killing. There have been enough murders since  Sainbari, Bijon Setu, Garbeta and Nandigram  to say nothing of all those young lives lost pursuing the illusion of the Debra-Gopiballavpur liberated zone one day encompassing the country, to tear to shreds the myth of a cultured people who express themselves only through poetry and painting. Even if Trinamul launches the offensive, as Mollah fears, Marxist determination to cling to a 32-year monopoly of power means turmoil.        
	Violence is certain if Didi tries to gain office through the backdoor. Her charge that the Left Front has lost the moral right to continue in power echoes Morarji Desais justification for dismissing nine state governments in 1977 and Indira Gandhis for following suit three years later. Manmohan Singh could not be more unlike either prime minister and would be loath to be so unprincipled. But he does not fashion party strategy, and Mamata has powerful patrons in high places. Her threatened movement against CPM terror tactics can force the governor to report a breakdown of government under Article 356.        
	Didi has acquired an unexpected ally in Mollah whose comments on outsiders last year set the cat among the pigeons of the All-India Marwari Federation and Rajasthan government, while the CPM frantically distanced itself from his communal heresy. Given the peasant composition of his constituency, Mollah also opposed Bhattacharjees land acquisition policy as openly as he dared. Now, he takes the high moral ground to argue that although the Left Front controls 235 out of 294 legislature seats, the CPM has lost its majority in 198 assembly segments and the Congress-Trinamul alliance made serious dents in the constituencies of 27 ministers. He wants Bhattacharjee to seek a fresh mandate.         
	The growing clamour against Prakash Karat and the politburo extends friction to another plane, recalling Bengals long history of resentment against New Delhis diktats. It rankles that the politburo ignored Basus recommendation to support Desais government in 1979. Worse, the politburo would not countenance a Bengali prime minister 17 years later. Bengali Marxists, who would have preferred the parliamentary Left Front to continue supporting the United Progressive Alliance, were anguished and angered at Somnath Chatterjees expulsion.        
	State leaders will explain their stand on these matters in political terms. But todays resentment recalls the 1939 Tripuri congress and Gandhis famous comment about Subhas Chandra Boses victory over Pattabhi Sitaramaya. The response to Shyama Prasad Mookerjees arrest and death in custody, and the current pride in so many ministers in New Delhi reflect the same mix of sentiment and reason.              
	As prominent Calcutta Marxists have pointed out, neither the Karats nor Sitaram Yechury speak with the authority of an electoral mandate. The pursuit of a mythic Third Front proved as disastrous as the unwarranted break with the UPA. What Chatterjee and Subhas Chakrabarty leave unsaid is that the CPM central leadership committed political suicide by toeing Beijings line. Unable to kill the Indo-American nuclear agreement in the Nuclear Suppliers Group after George W. Bush twisted Hu Jintaos arm, China sought to sabotage it through obedient satraps in the politburo.        
	Communists with long memories believe betrayal has a hoary lineage. Pro-China elements in the undivided CPI opposed S.A. Dange, the party chairman, when he defended Indias stand on the McMahon Line and Aksai Chin. Those elements broke away in 1964 to form the CPM, thereby establishing a tradition of thwarting Indias interests to placate China. It would be a miracle, indeed, if labouring under this burden of suspected guilt, and riddled with corruption, the communist movement ever regains anything like its past pre-eminence.         
	Politicians generally being up for grabs, Didis local commitments will probably be greatly watered down under the force of the persuasive pressure of the ICC bosses who were ready to do business with her in 2000. Bhattacharjee accuses her Trinamul of lacking any ideological mooring. She retorts that the CPM is politically bankrupt. Both are right. The brewing storm has nothing to do with programmes or policies. It is about power. But it can yield some benefit for a state that has been criminally abused by its leaders if Mamata Banerjee and her team set aside their ambition till the 2011 state election and get down now to cooperating with a chastened Left Front in the interest of the greater Bengali good that both claim to serve.

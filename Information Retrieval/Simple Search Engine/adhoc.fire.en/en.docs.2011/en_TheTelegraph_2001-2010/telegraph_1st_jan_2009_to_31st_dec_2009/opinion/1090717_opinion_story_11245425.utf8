	Europe is very close to realizing a pipe dream. The intergovernmental accord between Europe and Turkey signed last Monday in the presence of four other transit countries  Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary and Austria  gives the first transfusion of blood to Nabucco. Till this moment, Nabucco had been more an idea than an actual project intended to reduce Europes critical dependence on Russia for gas supplies. Since it was thought up in 2002, a complex web of political intrigue has prevented it from actually taking off. But the primary reason for which Nabuccos grand plan of bringing gas from the Caspian and Middle East straight to Europe, bypassing Russia, has been delayed is that certain political equations had not fallen into their right places. Take Iraq, which has now sought to singlehandedly solve Nabuccos first problem (the lack of adequate suppliers) by offering 15 billion cubic metres or half of Nabuccos gas. Could such magnanimity have been expected or been made possible  of course, by Americas sleight of hand  any earlier than now? Several other suppliers, Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan, have coughed up but only now, and that too in order to slight Russia. But the thrust to Nabucco would probably never have come had eastern Europe not faced the acute lack of gas it did last year because of the conflict between Ukraine and Russia making Ukraine stop the transit of gas from Russia. The European Commission has since tried its best to mend matters. But Russias highhandedness and Ukraines wily politicians have made the situation irreparable. But even then, Nabucco would perhaps have got off the ground had Turkey  from the borders of which the pipelines will be laid  not changed its mind about demanding 15 per cent of Nabuccos gas. Its flexibility will probably be rewarded with a smoother accession to the European Union than hitherto possible.         
	Nabuccos unique selling point is the fact that it is going to be handled by many companies and many governments, quite unlike Russias Gazprom, which functions under government control. But this could also go against Nabucco as it tries to handle the often-conflicting corporate and national interests among its myriad members. Of course, there will be Russia as well and its South Stream, which is coming up fast as Russias answer to Europes dreams of liberation.

	The pilots of Jet Airways will be returning to work after ending what the companys management called a simulated strike. But the episode has raised questions that may not be settled with the end of the strike itself. The airline faces additional losses  some have put it at as high as Rs 200 crore for five days in lost revenues  besides taking a beating on its brand value. Passengers will have less faith in the reliability of Indias leading private airline. The strike also highlights the fragility of labour relations  last year, the airline announced layoffs of over 1,000 employees, but was forced to backtrack after government intervention, underscoring the political sensitivities that prevail during an economic slowdown. The airlines pilots have agreed not to unionize, but plan to be part of a committee along with the management that will address labour-related issues in the future.        
	The companys stock price fell as a result of the strike  which made shareholders of the company even unhappier  though the price did recover as the end of the strike came nearer. But Jet Airways shares now trade at just around Rs 250, compared to Rs 1,100 when the stock was first listed on the exchanges. The losses of the company, and of the others, including the government-owned carriers, are not likely to be any less in the next couple of years at least; is it possible that the current business model of the airline industry as a whole is flawed and will have to be rethought?        
	Looked at from a per-passenger revenue perspective, airlines of all kinds are losing money, and will continue to do so. That is true not just for the Indian context, but has been happening on a global basis since 2001. For the last two years, the global aviation industry has lost almost $5 billion a year. As competition continues to grow  whether between carries, hubs or even between low-cost carriers and the so-called legacy carriers of which Jet Airways is one  the current revenue model will not deliver profitability when only passenger fares are taken into account. If anything, airline fares have fallen, or grown less than consumer inflation; it seems very unlikely that airlines can become profitable enterprises under these circumstances without being able to raise fares. A case can be made for consolidation; but many attempts at combination, like the aborted attempt to share routes between Kingfisher Airlines  the other large private airline  and Jet Airways, have failed spectacularly. As losses continue to mount, should airlines be allowed to die? Letting large businesses fail does not sit easily with the Indian government. But it must be an option; no single airline has a dominant market share that renders it too big to fail. That appears to leave just one option: maybe the future for privately owned commercial aviation is low-cost or budget airlines. If airlines do not start thinking about that, they may not be left with any other choice.

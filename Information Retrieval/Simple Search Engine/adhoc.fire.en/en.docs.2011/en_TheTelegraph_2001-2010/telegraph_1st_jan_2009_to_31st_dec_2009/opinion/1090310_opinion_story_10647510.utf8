The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Dangerous complications
                                                                                                                 DANGEROUS COMPLICATIONS                                  The mutiny by the Bangladesh Rifles can have unforeseen consequences for India, writes Abhijit Bhattacharyya                          From doom to despair                                  
	Any discussion on a revolt by soldiers is usually anathema to serving generals of the armed forces. This comes from the ethos that stipulates that officer-like qualities consist of several features: a prospective general is advised to be cool, fair and objective, keep his ears to the ground, eyes on the enemy, possess the probity of Caesars wife, and be optimistic even in the face of defeat. However, there has been no significant training as yet on how a general should face an internal crisis.        
	The mutiny by the Bangladesh Rifles is not just unique, but also creates a dangerous complication with far-reaching consequences. As reported, hundreds of BDR personnel opened fire on unsuspecting senior officers and on their families. But why were these officers unsuspecting? Why did they fail to take note of the gathering cloud on the horizon? Why did they not try to curb their own arrogance about the grievances of the low-paid soldiers?         
	To understand the problem, one has to delve into the history of soldiering in Bangladesh. The Bengali-speaking Muslim soldiers, even in the days of the united Islamic Republic of Pakistan (1947- 1971), were looked down upon by their Punjabi, Urdu, Sindhi and Pashto-speaking West Pakistani comrades. To make matters worse, the Bengali-speaking soldiers in the Pakistan armed forces became internal suspects in the months preceding the independence of Bangladesh. Indeed, quite a few Bengali-speaking soldiers did not enhance their reputation as apolitical professionals owing to their open defiance, dissent and desertion, all for the cause of an independent Bangladesh.         
	The birth of Bangladesh failed to solve the problem, as less than four years after its independence, the civilian institutions collapsed in ignominy and bloodshed. The nation fell back on the army to defend the emerging order. With coup, counter-coup and endless confrontation between the begums, the seeds of anarchy were sown in Dhaka.         
	As things stand today, the prime minister, Sheikh Hasina Wajed, faces one of the gravest challenges of her career. Her failure to handle the situation can put the lives of some of the top leaders in grave danger. In any civil war between two branches of the uniformed personnel, the threat to the safety of the so-called incompetent, biased or weak leaders cannot be ruled out. Ironically, an unusual fall-out of the revolt is the beating that the image of a powerful institution like the army has taken. Nobody in Dhaka, until recently, dared abuse a serving officer. Now hundreds of officers have been butchered by their subordinates.         
	As serious charges of corruption, nepotism and inefficiency have been levelled by the soldiers against army officers, it would be wiser for the military to set its own house in order instead of crossing swords with the killers or taking revenge on the civilian bosses, during whose recent ballot victories the Dhaka garrison played an exemplary role.        
	So far as India is concerned, fire in Dhaka is bad news for Delhi. India needs to be extra careful about what it does or says. With Bangladesh riddled by erratic public opinion, rebellious para-military, vengeful army, quarrelsome leaders, poverty-stricken rural labour, cross-border prostitution and rising fundamentalism, India is sure to receive SOS calls from some quarters, including some sections of the rebellious BDR, who face a grim fate in the hands of an army smarting with wounded pride. If India makes one wrong move, then the fire can spread within the country. The problem gets magnified by the fact that there are great many illegal Bangladeshi immigrants in India, as also Bangladeshi voters on the electoral rolls of Indian states bordering Bangladesh.              
	Bangladesh also has lessons for India. The Indian army has been afflicted with corruption in recent times as well. Generals pinching the soldiers ration in the forward areas have been reported in the media. Also, fratricidal shootings in high-tension areas have created all round embarrassment in the defence establishment. Like the BDR personnel who revolted for better pay, Indian soldiers too were in the news recently, with ex-servicemen returning their gallantry medals to the government to press their demands for enhanced pay, promotion and prospects.        
	A serious situation has already arisen in Indias eastern neighbourhood. Although it is too early to decipher who did this, why and how, New Delhi surely cannot feel comfortable, because from now on, it is likely to be a delicate war on multiple fronts for India. India has realized that a friendly Sheikh Hasina is no guarantee of peace, owing to existential threats to the democratic establishment in Bangladesh, and the proliferation of Indias own internal enemies operating with impunity. Blood in Dhaka cannot be the road to peace and prosperity for a worried New Delhi.

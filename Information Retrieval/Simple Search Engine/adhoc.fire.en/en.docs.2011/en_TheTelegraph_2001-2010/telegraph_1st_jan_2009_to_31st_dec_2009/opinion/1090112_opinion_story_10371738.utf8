	It was not nine days this time, but still not long enough. Maybe that is why Shibu Soren, Jharkhands chief minister since last August and chief of the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, cannot help making an exhibition of himself after losing the crucial assembly by-election in Tamar to Gopal Krishna Patar or Raja Peter of the Jharkhand Party (Anosh). Mr Soren had gone ahead even though Mr Patar had a strong hold in Tamar and the area was not keen on the JMM anyway. Having lost, Mr Soren was planning to contest another by-election by getting a seat freed  a loyal friend moved aside in Jamtara  so that he could keep his chair. He needed to get into the assembly to remain chief minister, but his desperation is more embarrassing than the results. For the Congress, Mr Sorens defeat augurs more worries. The Rashtriya Janata Dal, its other alliance partner, does not support presidents rule. Yet that would have been the best of a bad job from the Congresss point of view; the party could have at least retained the moral high ground after Mr Sorens defeat. But the RJD wants another stint at governing with another chief minister  someone it likes. The Congress had reluctantly gone along with Mr Sorens desire to be chief minister last year, since he made it clear he was calling in a debt. This time the party has asked him to step down, although he would rather stretch the deadline to its limits, trying to ensure the elevation of one of his own loyalists in his place. The Bharatiya Janata Party has quickly cast its line into the muddied waters, asking the governor for fresh elections.         
	In all this, what is remarkable is the complete indifference of Jharkhands politicians to the peoples need for a stable government that allows them to devote their time wholly to the tussle for power. Mr Patar, the Tamar victor, may be popular as the saviour of the poor, but that image needed a lot of money in the making. As long as Jharkhand is afflicted with leaders who have no time to govern, it will remain a site riven by conflicting interests and rocky political fortunes.

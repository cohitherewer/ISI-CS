	A nations history is often shaped by tricks of telling. Any account of the past involves remembering and forgetting in equal measure  which, in turn, become the perfect excuse for governments all over the world to serve up one version of national history over another. Vladimir Putins first decade as the Russian premier has been spent tweaking crucial moments, if not facts, related to his countrys chequered past. Moving away from Mikhail Gorbachevs glasnost  the closest that Russia came to a Truth and Reconciliation Commission  Mr Putins rise saw the resurrection of controversial figures from the past often dressed in a garb of power and glory. The latest Soviet-era memento to have resurfaced in Russia is a plaque singing paeans to Josef Stalin. Reinstated in Moscows Kurskaya metro station, this monument not only makes the tyrannical years of Stalinism look idyllic but also, in the process, disavows the suffering of countless ordinary Russians who perished in the gulags.        
	Evidently, such thoughtless revivalism is best dismissed as ignorant, but the worrying bit is that historical distortion often has its roots in present interests. Russias self-aggrandizing enterprise is motivated, to a great extent, by its desire to have the upper hand in the geopolitics of oil and natural gas. So the architects of modern Russias destiny are also keen on staying in the good books of the West by playing things safe. This agenda explains Mr Putins clever double take. Although he has invoked a particularly horrific ghost from the nations past, he has also made some shrewd concessions by way of making apologetic noises to Poland for his countrys earlier denial of its role in the Katyn massacres of 1940. Even as Russia labours to hang on to its supremacist zeal in its immediate neighbourhood  by threatening Ukraine and Kiev over gas supply and asserting its imperial designs on Georgia  it aspires to redefine Eastern Europes past as well as its present.

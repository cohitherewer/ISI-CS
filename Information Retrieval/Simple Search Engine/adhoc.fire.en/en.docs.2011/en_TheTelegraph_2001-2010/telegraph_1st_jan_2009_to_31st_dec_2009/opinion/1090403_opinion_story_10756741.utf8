The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | The topsy-turvy world in which right and wrong become one
                                                                                                                 THE TOPSY-TURVY WORLD IN WHICH RIGHT AND WRONG BECOME ONE                                                      Real India                            
	The Story of My Assassins By Tarun J. Tejpal, HarperCollins, Rs 495        
	Tarun J. Tejpals novel, The Story of My Assassins, is, among other things, a satire on Indian society. It is sometimes harsh, at other times incisive, written in an unconventional, racy idiom that is as irritating as it is thought-provoking. Tejpals language is offbeat. It is straightforward, journalistic, crude, bordering on the vulgar, and yet it will be difficult to put down the book once you have started reading it, at least till the fifth part. Tejpal has divided the novel into thirteen parts and every part has further divisions to facilitate smooth reading. But the narration is not intricate at all.        
	The Story of My Assassins begins with an attempt on the life of a journalist that never takes place. The reader at least does not get to know till the very end how or why the attempt of assassination was planned, although the novelist takes enormous pains to describe each and every event of the book in detail. The irony is that even the character who was the target does not know about the design on his life till informed by his mother, who rings him in the office and asks him to switch on the television: You fool, turn on the TV! Turn on the TV immediately! and then, Again, Breaking News! The ticker said: Scribe survives murder attempt. Delhi police foils bid.        
	Readers may or may not be perplexed by such a beginning, but the story does start with a bang, and then meanders around characters and events that sometimes seem disjointed. As expected, the novel ends with a whimper, with the narrator coming back from Muscat, where a character pops up suddenly from nowhere to solve the puzzle of the story. There are several stories within the story and innumerable characters  too many, in fact, to keep a count, and they keep coming till the end. Almost every character has two names and the pseudonym is bound to be bizarre.         
	Tejpals main narrative is about five men who are dispatched on a secret mission to kill a scribe who unfolded a case in a manner similar to the Tehelka expos. The first person narration seems perfect till the story delves into the lives of the scores of characters living on railway platforms, towns and villages, and tries to depict their day to day struggle for existence. It is better not to expect twists of techniques in this novel since Tejpal never aims at them. He is more interested in the story-telling than in the creation of memorable characters. The characters keep coming and going, and they cannot be taken seriously. The binding force of the novel is the offbeat language of the writer.         
	All characters, be they cops or criminals, journalists or custodians of law, men or women, use an abusive vocabulary, both Hindi and English, to such an extent that one wonders which facet of India Tejpal is bent on portraying. A woman like Sara in the novel uses words that would put to shame even the most foul-mouthed man on the streets. As for the story, it begins abruptly and ends in the most unexpected way, with revelations from the mouth of the police, from Sara  the only woman character worth remembering  and from a man in a faraway country.        
	But Tejpal exposes the harsh realities of modern-day life in a way that makes us feel ashamed of our own selves. The mocking way in which the narration leads us to the ills and inadequacies of man and his society is compelling. Initially, the story is set in Delhi but it could be any country of the world where corruption, fraud and dishonesty have penetrated so deeply into the social set-up that there is little hope left for future generations. Tejpals depicts a system gone awry, a country suffering from an ailment that no medicine can cure.         
	And yet that country refuses to die. From villages to towns and cities, each and every individual, whether in business or in the bureaucracy, is so steeped in vice that nobody knows the difference between right and wrong. As one of the characters explains to the protagonist, in our line of work nine right and one wrong is wrong, but all ten wrong is right. And so we do what we are told and we are always right even though we are often wrong. This is the world we are led into  a topsy-turvy world where the victim may be held up for a wrong reason and assassins become victims. It is a world gone terribly wrong. Behind the facade of the tale lies the picture of the real India that most of us willingly close our eyes to. There is poverty, corruption, death and decay all around; Tejpal holds up the mirror to the coarser life, which exists close to the civilized one. Yet we pretend not to see it. The novel speaks of power, sex and crime. It is a tale not only of an assassination but also of the meanness of modern existence.

	I have never entered a government hospital for the mentally ill. But the nearest to its kind I have entered in West Bengal is a government-run childrens home where children in need of care and protection are kept, supposedly according to the prescriptions of the Juvenile Justice Act. This was about three years ago, but I remember vividly how difficult it was for me to get in there. The NGO I am involved with was going to take me in, but I was strictly instructed not to reveal my identity as a journalist under any circumstances. I was to go in as a social worker, and mingle innocuously with the other (genuine) social workers. From the prison-like front gates, through all the little intermediary offices, until the final entry into the premises, I was repeatedly questioned, searched for cameras, phones and other recording devices, and the officials looked askance even at my notepad and pen. I also felt, though I wasnt told in so many words, that I shouldnt get into any arguments regarding what I saw inside (which turned out to be worse than appalling).        
	I understood perfectly then, and still do now, the reason for this caution, although it took me a while, as I went in and the horrors started unfolding, to get into a benignly smiling mode. The NGO taking me in had built up over the years  painstakingly, using all their reserves of diplomacy and cunning  a relationship of trust and goodwill with the important people in the home and with their bosses in the state departments. On this relationship depended everything that the organization wished to do with the children inside the home, like improving the quality of food, and overseeing healthcare, holistic education and development. None of this could be put to the authorities as reform or change, for that would imply criticism of the system  which is inadmissible. The work had to be packaged as help or support, as merely furthering what the government had already been doing. The best way to win approval and easier entry was to convince the authorities that all this would mean less work, and more glory, for them. Picking up and perfecting this art of gaining access are crucial elements in a social workers job, if he or she has been assigned a government institution like a childrens home or a mental hospital.        
	It was just as crucial for me to understand and honour these unspoken rules. So I played along, got in, spent a day, and then the NGO and I jointly decided not to write directly and in detail about what I had seen and felt in there. Years of tightrope-walking would come to nothing in an instant if my article came out the next day in the papers, pushing back by almost a decade what the NGO had achieved in this home. Indeed, this is exactly what happened a few months later, when one of the social workers changed jobs, became a journalist and did a news story on the home, using photographs he had taken on his mobile phone when he had worked inside.        
	There is almost nothing in the laws that specifies that a childrens home or a mental hospital should be a closed institution. Yet, invariably stashed far away from the heart of the city, they remain forbiddingly closed spaces, grimly and inflexibly guarded and cordoned off from the ordinary life of the State and of civil society, except for a few patently symbolic occasions. And this suits everybody  of course, everybody other than the inmates. For those who run these places, transparency and accountability can be dispensed with at every level. And for most of us, this is one area where impenetrability and invisibility are convenient, for these spare us from having to engage or be involved with, or even to look at, what we would rather not be confronted with at all. The Right to Information Act is supposed to have begun revolutionizing the concept and practice of active, inquisitive citizenship. We are learning now that we can legitimately demand to know how public funds are being used to improve roads and water-supply, how scrupulously examination scripts are being marked, whether private hospitals are cheating us with inflated bills. This is a form of empowerment that makes the right to see and to know central to existing in a civilized and modern democracy. But how far do these new ideas of access and visibility extend to those public institutions, the gates of which wed like to find securely shut and the walls impossible to scale, and from which can escape no images that would make our lives less tidy? It does not matter that we have grown up surrounded by the mad, the shelterless and the wretched in the public spaces of our cities and villages. That makes it even easier, by teaching the eye at once to see and not see  a habit that helps us keep outside our ken the things of darkness wed rather not acknowledge as ours.                    AVEEK SEN

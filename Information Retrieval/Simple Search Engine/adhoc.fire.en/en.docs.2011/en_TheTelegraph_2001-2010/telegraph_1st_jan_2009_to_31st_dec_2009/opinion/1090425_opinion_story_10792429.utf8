The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A school for democracy
                                                                                                                 A SCHOOL FOR DEMOCRACY                          - The Congress taught India to vote and to speak its mind freely					 					      Politics and Play - Ramachandra Guha                        Jawaharlal Nehru with Vallabhbhai Patel				                                                   
	A charge often laid at the door of the Indian National Congress is that it has doctored the school curricula to diminish the role of other actors in the freedom struggle. Thus the part played by the Bengali revolutionists in opposing British rule, or the struggles and sacrifices of Bhagat Singh and his comrades, do not always feature in textbooks written under the aegis of Congress governments. It is further alleged that these books also ignore or underplay the contributions of individuals and groups to the right of the Congress, as for example the liberals or the Hindutva-wadis.        
	These accusations are not altogether untrue. The Congress under Gandhis leadership was the major strand in the nationalist movement, but there were other tendencies too, which, in works written by or under the supervision of Congress governments, do not always get the attention they deserve. But the Congress should also be charged with a more curious crime  which is of not properly acquainting schoolchildren with its own role in the making of modern India. The textbooks sponsored by it may devote excessive space to the contributions of the Congress before Independence; at the same time, they lay inadequate stress on the contributions of the Congress after Independence. For the party of Gandhi and Nehru was not merely in the vanguard of the freedom struggle, but it also helped to create and nurture the democratic Indian nation-state.               
	It is said that when the British left these shores, Gandhi told his colleagues that freedom has come to India, not to the Congress party. This statement was immediately acted upon by his two chief lieutenants, Jawaharlal Nehru and Vallabhbhai Patel. Thus Patel played a key role in peopling the Constituent Assembly with legal experts who had no previous party or political affiliation. Nehru, on his part, inducted, into the Union cabinet, men who belonged to parties that had, in the past, vigorously opposed the Congress. They included B. R. Ambedkar of the Scheduled Caste Federation and Syama Prasad Mookerjee of the Hindu Mahasabha. In this ecumenism, the Congress was being faithful to the spirit of its founders, who sought to reach out to all Indians, regardless of caste, class, religion, gender or ideology.         
	In the gossip that circulates in such places as RSS shakhas, as well as in some internet chat rooms, Nehru and Patel are made out to be rivals. To be sure, they had differences, as any two individuals would, even husband and wife or mother and daughter. But what united the two men was far more important than what divided them. We Indians who came after them owe Nehru and Patel an enormous debt for what they did together, in partnership, in the years 1947 to 1950, when they helped construct a nation from its fragments and give it a democratic Constitution. In this heroic and noble task, they had many helpers and associates, most of whom belonged to their own Congress, but also some who didnt, such as the chief architect of the Indian Constitution, B.R. Ambedkar.        
	I have spoken above of the disagreements between Nehru and Patel. On two occasions, the differences threatened to split the Congress  in January 1948 and again in the autumn of 1950. Each time, the two men had the sense to work together in the common cause. Each time, the decision to submerge their differences was made partly in homage to their common hero, Gandhi, and partly to save the organization to which both men owed a lifelong allegiance. For both Nehru and Patel, the Congress was their family and their pride. It had given them a home, and it had given meaning to their lives. Both men knew that a schism between the partys two top leaders would have dealt a body blow to the Congress itself. When they chose, on both occasions, to make peace among themselves, they helped save the Congress, and possibly, the idea of India itself.        
	The first years of Indian independence were very fraught indeed. Had there been lesser men at the helm than Nehru and Patel, or a lesser party than the Congress, the Centre might very well have given way. India could have come under military rule, or broken up into several different parts, or been subject to mass scarcity and famine. But the Centre held. In January 1950 a new, republican Constitution came into being. Two years later, India held its first national elections based on the principle of universal adult suffrage.        
	Through the 1950s and 1960s the Congress ruled at the Centre and in most of the states. The elections it won were mostly free and fair. The Congress came out successful because it was the legatee of the freedom struggle and because its leaders were seen, for the most part, as individuals of character and probity. Despite this Congress hegemony, the voters had the option of choosing other individuals and parties. Thus, in 1957, they sent the communists into power in Kerala and, in 1963, they sent three remarkable opponents of the Congress into the Lok Sabha to harry Nehru after his humiliation at the hands of the Chinese. (These anti-Congressmen were the socialist Rammanohar Lohia, the liberal M.R. Masani, and the Gandhian J.B. Kripalani.) Even if such successes were few and far between, by participating in these regular elections, the people of India were acquiring the habits and mores of democracy.               
	The Congress established a democratic Constitution, and oversaw a series of mostly fair elections. Another great gift it gave the people of India was a positive ideology of hope. Some other new nationalisms consolidated themselves on an ideology of fear and paranoia, seeking to unite the citizens on the basis of hatred of a particular community or of another nation. On the other hand, the Nehruvian Congress sought to unite Indians in pursuit of the common goals of secularism and economic development, assuring citizens equal rights regardless of their caste or religion, and working to end the endemic poverty to which most of them had been subject.        
	For this historian, the Congress of the 1950s and 1960s is best regarded as a school for democracy. Under its capacious umbrella, Indians learnt to vote freely and to speak their minds freely. They learnt also to craft and trust independent, impersonal, rule-bound institutions such as the judiciary and the press. Like any school, there was a gap between precept and practice. Not all Congressmen were squeaky clean. There was inadequate stress on land reforms. And there was a shocking failure in the field of primary education.         
	The post-Gandhi Congress could have done somewhat better. And it could have done a lot worse. A fair measure of its achievement lies in the fate of other countries in Asia and Africa that obtained their independence at the same time as ours, many of which came under military rule, or disintegrated into civil war. The Indian National Congress may not deserve all the credit for the British leaving the sub-continent. But it does deserve more credit than it has thus far got for laying the foundations of a somewhat united and somewhat democratic Republic of India.       ramguhahotmail.com

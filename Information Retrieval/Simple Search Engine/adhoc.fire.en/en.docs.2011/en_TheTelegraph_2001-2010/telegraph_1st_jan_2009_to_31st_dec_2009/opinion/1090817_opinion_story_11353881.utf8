	Passport service                  
	Sir  I am surprised by Stephen Hugh-Joness article, Stuck with English (Aug 5). The author should have gathered more information before using words such as rubbish about other peoples views on the future of languages, in this case of Esperanto. One sentence angers me particularly: And few but the most eccentric humans will spend their time acquiring a language that enables them to communicate with, for all practical purposes, nobody. One wonders on what basis Jones could write this.           
	Esperanto does have practical uses. One such use is that while travelling, there are many Esperanto-speakers who are willing to host fellow speakers in their homes. This hospitality service is called Pasporta Servo (Passport Service) and many people, including myself, have had very pleasant trips using that service. I used it, for example, in Hungary and Finland, and was able to communicate much better than in English, which is not my mother tongue. Many things about the world, including the way we communicate with one another, need to improve; to just accept the existing order of things, linguistic and otherwise, is not enough. We have to find better ways to communicate. In this regard, English is too hard to learn as a second language, while Esperanto is much easier. Not too long ago, the World Esperanto Congress took place in Poland with nearly 2,000 participants from 60 countries. Can all these people be called the most eccentric humans because they speak Esperanto and find many practical advantages of doing so?           
	Yours faithfully,

	Disturbing truths          
	Sir  Signs of a continuous, methodical and willing surrender of Indias sovereignty to the United States of America mark a sad phase in the history of a nation that was brought into existence by a long and arduous struggle for independence. Indias dependence on the US for guidance on the countrys internal matters today is a matter of concern, all the more so since it has not evinced discernible opposition from the citizenry. In spite of soothing words from Washington, one must remember that this supposed benefactor of Indias defence and security possibly regards all foreign countries as aliens and potentially threatening forces.          
	The new American ambassador, Timothy Roemer, has informed Indians that ensuring justice in the case of the 26/11 Mumbai terror attack is a top priority for his countrys president (26/11 justice a priority: US, Aug 13). But at another level, such displays of concern clearly show how much reliance the government of India, and perhaps its people as well, place on US intelligence bodies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, in deciding the course of investigations into such crimes against the nation as the Mumbai blasts (FBI confirms Mumbai gunmen from Pak, Aug 13). The evidence provided by the US bodies appears to be guiding Indias security policies and its judicial processes as well.          
	The Indian media, and the people at large, need to oppose this political trend. At the same time, citizens must also oppose the conduct of Indias business elite class that can compromise the nations greater interests in order to satisfy its own. It is worrying that the upwardly-mobile middle classes subscribe to the elites misplaced, profit-driven values. The situation calls for no less than a movement, for it is the nations future that is at stake.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Admiral Sureesh Mehtas candid acknowledgement of Indias military weakness, especially when compared with China, was disturbing (Aw, India is less macho now, Aug 12). Chinas policy of subtle destabilization of India can be experienced not only in the neighbourhood but also within the country. Instead of strategic policies to counter the threats to the nations sovereignty, the self- seeking politicians of India are involved in scoring political points against one another. It is time to set aside political differences to secure the country against threats. All political parties have failed the citizens in their own ways. It is a pity that in spite of its position of importance in world politics and its economic progress, India still cannot get a Security Council seat. The politicians have let the country down badly. They should shed their greed, and defend India from the possible threat of fragmentation, or colonization by mightier world powers.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Dilip Mahanty, Sydney, Australia 

                
	Sir  Admiral Sureesh Mehtas remark that Indias military strength is no match for Chinas might has come as a shocker for many, but, in essence, it has only confirmed the doubt looming in the minds of many as to the effects of the defective weapons India is procuring from countries such as Russia, France, Israel and the US. It seems that India has become the dumping ground of the faulty weapons from these countries.           
	Mehtas remark brings up a burning question  why is the country acquiring useless weapons knowingly? The issue here is not why China is incurring huge defence expenditures but rather why the Indian tax-payers hard-earned money is being wasted on faulty weapons. The stain of corruption has penetrated deep into the government and the military. Although it would be unfair to regard every person involved in the process as corrupt, there are, undoubtedly, bugs in the system that conceal or distort facts, resulting in confusion, bad decisions and bad investments. Blame game between bureaucrats, politicians and the army will not benefit anyone but our enemies.           
	Our weapon experts should concentrate on quality, and not merely on quantity. A thorough assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of our own security forces, as well as those of our enemies, would go a long way in ensuring that the purchases made are worthwhile. Cutting-edge technology, rather than malfunctioning weapons, can protect the nation.           
	Yours faithfully,

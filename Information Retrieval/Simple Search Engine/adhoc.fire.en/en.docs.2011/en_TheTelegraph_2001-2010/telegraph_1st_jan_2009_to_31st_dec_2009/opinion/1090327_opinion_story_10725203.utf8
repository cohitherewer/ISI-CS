	The Courilof Affair By Ir egrave;ne N eacute;mirovsky, 
  Vintage, pound;3.50  
	Irne Nmirovsky is one of the great literary discoveries of the 20th century. She died in Auschwitz, but her manuscripts survived in a suitcase with her daughters. Readers now have a number of novels from this highly talented and sophisticated writer. This small book is taut in its writing and irresistible in its suspense.  
	The story is set in pre-revolutionary Russia. The Tsarist regime and its officials were threatened by assassinations by various groups: communists, narodniks and other extremists. These groups were spread out all over Europe  historians described them as the romantic exiles. When arrested inside Russia, they were either executed or sent off to Siberia. This world has attracted novelists, and this book immediately brings to mind Joseph Conrads Under Western Eyes and J.M. Coetzees The Master of St Petersburg.        
	A young man born into the party, of parents living in exile in Switzerland, is given the task of going to Russia to murder the oppressive minister of education, Courilof. He succeeds in insinuating himself into the family of the minister as his physician. In fact, he earns Courilofs trust.        
	At the core of the story is the relationship between the murderer and his victim, and the problems that this creates for the former. The murderer, working under the alias, Leon M, gets to know of the ministers failing health, his marriage that threatens his career and of the atmosphere of intrigue and patronage that runs through the Tsarist administration. The novel, despite its limited scope, is both a study in power and a study of human relationships and their motives.        
	The novel begins in Nice where Leon M lives in retirement and where he died. Among his papers is discovered a file marked The Courilof Affair. The novel then becomes a first-person narrative. It is preceded by a short prologue where in a bar in Nice, Leon M accidentally meets the detective who was Courilofs bodyguard. They discuss the past, and its violence, and part ways. This simple opening gives no indication of the suffocating nature of what is to follow.        
	Nmirovsky recreates the atmosphere of suspicion and fear in which the terrorist groups lived in exile as well as in St Petersburg. Todays friend could be tomorrows police informer.        
	From Switzerland, the narrator travels to Kiev to meet his contact, Fanny Zart, a medical student full of hatred and fanaticism. Both of them travel to St Petersburg where they see for themselves the brutality practised by Courilof.        
	Once Leon M enters the service of Courilof, he is on his own, waiting for orders for the assassination which has to be carried out in public to make the biggest splash. He discovers how ill Courilof actually is: he is probably dying of cancer. His doctors are unwilling to tell him this or even to operate upon him. Leon M only looks after him to relieve the pain.        
	Courilof speaks to him about his sense of duty to the Tsar. Yet, when the Tsar asks him to divorce his wife because she, it was alleged by Courilofs rivals, was once a prostitute, he refuses and loses his job and falls from favour. Leon M is relieved that he may not have to kill a man who is now powerless. But Courilof gets back his job, and Leon M gets his orders for the assassination.        
	The novel ends with Leon Ms arrest. The theme of terrorism has obvious contemporary resonance. But this was written in the Thirties by a fugitive from Nazism, another variety of terrorism. The novel has no bitterness but a cool, almost frightening, objectivity. It warns about the absurdity of violence.

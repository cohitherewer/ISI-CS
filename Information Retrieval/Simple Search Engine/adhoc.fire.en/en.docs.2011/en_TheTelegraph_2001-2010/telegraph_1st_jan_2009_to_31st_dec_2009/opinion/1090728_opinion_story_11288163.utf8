                                                                                                                 OPEN SECRET                                                    
	The politician-criminal nexus is an old story in India. In the Northeast, the criminals often masquerade as militants. Few in the region, therefore, would be surprised to know that several major political parties not only use the militants but also fund them. The R.K. Manisana Singh commissions report has only confirmed what had always been public knowledge. It has found that the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party were among the parties that had funded at least one militant outfit in order to get their help during elections. Official reports of similar deals between political parties and insurgent groups had earlier come from other states such as Tripura, Manipur and Nagaland. The report on Assam exposes once again the dirty side of electoral politics. But what is even more worrying is the commissions finding that huge sums of money meant for rural welfare projects had been misused or simply stolen. It is possible that part of the stolen money was used to garner the militants support during the polls.        
	Yet politicians fall regularly to militants bullets not just in Assam but also in other states in the region. The longer an insurgency survives in the area, the more it becomes a vested interest for the parties, and the harder it gets to fight militancy. The commissions report would suggest that despite their anti-insurgency rhetoric the parties in Assam are not serious about weeding out the menace. This may not be unknown to the security forces or to New Delhi. It would be too optimistic to expect politicians to mend their ways. But the report should make the security forces wary of politicians. The battle against insurgency in Assam has much higher stakes. Its success is important not only for national security but also for the states economic development. Politicians may reap small benefits from their links with the militants, but the big losers are the common people, whose security and livelihood are threatened by the militants. Assam has suffered long at the hands of mercenaries belonging to several illegal outfits. It now needs to save itself from its politicians. The commissions report shows why the search for peace in Assam is too important to be left to its politicians. It is a wake-up call to both New Delhi and Dispur.

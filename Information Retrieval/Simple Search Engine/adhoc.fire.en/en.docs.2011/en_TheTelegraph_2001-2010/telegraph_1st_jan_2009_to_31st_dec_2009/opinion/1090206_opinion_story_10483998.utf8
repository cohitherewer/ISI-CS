The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | New stars on the rise
                                                                                                                 NEW STARS ON THE RISE                                  BONA FIDE - Malvika Singh                              
	The most positive aspect of the political universe and its many planets, stars and satellites is that the youth Congress is beginning to assert itself and demand its legitimate space among the old and fading stars. This has thrown many of the static planets into disarray as they grope about trying to see how they will survive in the forthcoming churning even if they have to revert to being satellites in orbit around the newer, brighter stars. Some know they will crash and disintegrate. A prowling cat has been thrown amidst the comfortable, homing pigeons.         
	Today, the Congress, unlike other ageing and stuck-in-the-mire political dispensations, has a great opportunity to break out of its confines and project a fresh and action oriented leadership that will resume the process of change, leading to growth.        
	The last few decades were shorn of dynamism and vision. The partys leaders  those who have crossed into their late fifties and the numerous geriatrics who occupy the high table  must be put to pasture, discouraged from giving unsolicited advice, and be prevailed upon to stop playing the politics of numbers that has corroded true partnership in coalitions and has hindered the building of a sane, civil society. The corruption of those who buy and sell, fiddle with and personalize the distribution of tickets, often perversely, to allow the opponent to win for private gratification, needs to be purged. Someone has to bell the bullies who have successfully destroyed the foundations of a liberal party.        
	Loose talk to win seats, reactionary speeches and statements to appease one community, exasperating rhetoric that is regressive and socially divisive, the ban culture based on personal predelictions, all these afflict our democracy and, therefore, must be reined in and leaders severely reprimanded for being parochial and fundamentalist with archaic views and attitudes. It speaks badly for the only party on the horizon that is poised to represent the future of this extraordinary civilization, which has absorbed diverse cultural norms and pluralities over centuries.                
	Young rulers        
	To straitjacket an open, inclusive and all-embracing polity is sacrilegious. To have Manmohan Singh, Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, Sheila Dikshit, Kapil Sibal, P. Chidambaram, and many other highly intelligent and committed men and women working in the party and in government, juxtaposed with a set of men spouting archaic sound bites makes for a bizarre political scenario. It hampers the party and its potential to break new ground and take this languishing nation into a modern millennium. Some senior leaders are sounding much like their counterparts in the Bharatiya Janata Party. They need to be stopped from speaking out of turn and against the party ideology.        
	Let the young rule. Let them think out of the box without being influenced by redundant, heavy, generational baggage. Let common sense get precedence over the endless pontification we are overwhelmed with day in and day out. Let us have a clean and straightforward engagement between the politicians and the people. It is time for inclusive transparency, for speaking with, and not talking at, citizens, for sharing ideas and solutions to problems that threaten civil society.         
	An agenda for change needs to be spelt out, and a modern form of karseva and shramdaan needs to be evolved to make the experiment participatory, one that will generate collective excitement and make us all shareholders of the endeavour. The system  political and administrative  needs to be shaken up, the rules rewritten with accountability as the primary imperative. Simple procedures that protect civil liberties and democratic choices need to be reinstated in our democratic, secular republic.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Looming threat
                                                                                                                 LOOMING THREAT                                                          
	The United States of America is racking its brains. Since Madeleine Albright described Pakistan as an international migraine, several top-ranking American officials have come up with more ingenious terms. Pakistan has been identified as the most dangerous place on earth and a mortal threat to the US. But apart from bettering the wordplay, the Americans do not seem to be making much headway with Pakistan, which happens to hold the key to the USs deliverance from Afghanistan.         
	The Barack Obama administration does realize the crucial link between Pakistan and Afghanistan. The much-acclaimed Afpak strategy is supposed to be working with Pakistan as its fulcrum. Yet, despite its profundity, the Afpak policy has failed to enunciate a precise policy framework for Pakistan. Other than increasing non-military aid and more concerted drone strikes, there is nothing that the US has in mind for Pakistan. The weakness of this strategy has been laid bare by the steady incursion of the Taliban into Pakistans heartland. Ever since the Taliban started spilling over from Swat, where the provincial government signed a deal with the pro-Taliban Tehreek-e-Nifaz-e-Shariat-e-Mohammadi in a bid to control the violence, the Americans have watched with dismay the speed with which sizeable parts of Pakistan have fallen to the Taliban. The Obama administration has now come to the conclusion that there is some problem with Pakistans understanding of the scenario. Pakistan, it insists, is unable to understand that it is not India but the internal threat that is more alarming. Hillary Clinton, the secretary of state, believes that a change of perception would require a paradigm shift in Pakistan, and that, of course, would take time. Meanwhile, since Pakistan has to be saved from itself, the aid flow should continue. Despite the 12 billion dollars that have gone into Pakistans coffers, two more billions have been promised at the Tokyo donors conference.         
	The US is pushing the limits of credulousness. It is preposterous to argue that Pakistan is unaware of the threat posed by the coming together of the Taliban within its borders. The assembling of the Taliban in Pakistan has already established a clear pattern. Forces from beyond Swat have merged with the existing forces inside the borders and are gradually pushing into Punjab, where they are joining hands with fighters for the liberation of Kashmir. It is definitely a pan-Pakistan movement, taking advantage of social and economic divides and religious faultlines. The reason the Pakistani establishment, both the army and the civilian leadership, is allowing this is the multiple advantages of the movement. Pakistan can still sell its victimhood to wring out financial concessions from its donors and retain its strategic advantage. If push comes to shove on the eastern borders, it can have a steady line of defence, made up of non-State fighters, stretching right into neighbouring Afghanistan. A paradigm shift is still a long way off.

	The capture of Arabinda Rajkhowa is a major step forward for both New Delhi and Dhaka. It could prove to be a defining moment in Indias long battle against armed insurgencies in Assam and elsewhere in the Northeast. With the ceasefire in Nagaland, the insurgencies in Assam and Manipur have long posed the gravest threats to peace in the region. It was never a secret that Mr Rajkhowa, chairman of the United Liberation Front of Asom, and most of his senior comrades operated from bases or shelters in Bangladesh. If the leaders of the previous government in Dhaka had denied this, it only reflected its policy of baiting New Delhi. But hiding or using another countrys terrorists and rebels as a possible tool of diplomacy rarely works. Not just rebels from Indias Northeast but also other terror groups are known to have used Bangladesh as shelter or training base for their cadre. In helping the capture of the Ulfa leaders, Sheikh Hasina Wajed, Bangladeshs prime minister, has shown remarkable political acumen. Her decision will help India but it will also assure the world of a refreshing change of policy in Dhaka.        
	However, the capture of Ulfa leaders or their surrender is winning only half the battle. The Northeast has seen the fall of several insurgent groups and new insurgencies being born. Even before the capture of Mr Rajkhowa and several of his Bangladesh-based colleagues, the Ulfa had lost most of its popular support. The chief of its armed wing, Paresh Barua, who is still at large, may continue to delude himself by hoping to create a sovereign Assam with his armed struggle. His opposition to peace talks is a desperate gamble to keep the outfit and its movement alive. The Centre and the Assam government should ignore Mr Baruas ploy and engage the captured leaders in a renewed peace initiative. Fighting the Ulfas rebellion is only half the task; winning peace for Assam is the real challenge.

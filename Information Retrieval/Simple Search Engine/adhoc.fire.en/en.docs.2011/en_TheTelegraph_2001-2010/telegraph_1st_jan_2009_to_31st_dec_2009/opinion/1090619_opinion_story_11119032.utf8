	THE GIRL WHO PLAYED WITH FIRE and THE GIRL WITH THE   DRAGON TATTOO																														 By Stieg Larsson, 
  Quercus, Rs 299 each  
	An investigative journalist has often been compared to a detective because of the manner both assemble evidence and seek to arrive at foolproof conclusions on the basis of deductive logic. Stieg Larsson was one of the leading investigative journalists of Sweden and became one of the leading authorities in the world on anti-democratic, extremist and Nazi organizations. He died of a heart attack in November 2004 when he was only 50. A few weeks before his death he delivered to his publisher the manuscript of The Millennium Trilogy. Two of the three volumes have been published in English. These show that lurking behind the investigative journalist was a talented thriller writer, who had an eye for the science of detection and a sense of adventure.  
	It comes as no surprise that one of the principal characters in these novels is an investigative journalist, Mikael Blomkvist. The other is a young girl, Lisbeth Salander, who is delinquent but an extraordinarily able researcher and a genius at computer hacking. She is a loner and is totally enigmatic.        
	Both these characters and a few others appear in both the novels. It needs to be said that the first volume of the trilogy, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is by far the better book. In fact, it is a superb thriller. In comparison, the second volume, The Girl Who Played with Fire is a big disappointment. It stretches the powers of credulity.        
	The novel opens with Blomkvist in disgrace. He was found guilty of libelling the financier, Hans-Erik Wennerstrm by the court. Blomkvist, despite his long experience as an editor and journalist, had a very weak defence. He knew he had made mistakes and even had the suspicion that he may have been set up. While he is trying to reorganize his career and preparing himself for a stint in jail, out of the blue comes a job offer from the patriarch of an industrial corporation.        
	The man is Henrik Vanger of Vanger Corporation, a family-owned business. Henrik Vanger is convinced that a member of his family murdered his grandniece Harriet. He is further convinced that the murderer has been tormenting him from that day by sending him a flower on his birthday. He wants Blomkvist to find the murderer.        
	Blomkvist takes on the job after initial reluctance. His problem is that the murder, if murder it was, took place many years ago and the police, after a detailed investigation, found no evidence for it, not even the body. But Henrik Vanger is convinced.        
	Blomkvist is helped in his investigations by Lisbeth Salander whose amazing skills as a researcher and as a computer hacker produces most unexpected results. There is human drama and some sex thrown in, but at the heart of the story is the mystery of Harriets disappearance and its solution. Obsessions and arcane rituals and perversions come to light as Blomkvist and Salander try and recreate what happened on the afternoon when Harriet was last seen. The mystery is unravelled through a peppering of violence. The end has an element of surprise.        
	If the centre stage of the first volume is held by Blomkvist, the second volume belongs to Salander. Her life and the reasons for her delinquency come to light. Through a series of circumstances, she is suspected of three murders and is on the run. As she tries to rescue and acquit herself she encounters a world of brutality and greed that takes her back into her own tortured childhood. Blomkvist plays the gallant saviour.        
	The writing is racy yet rich in details about the worlds of high finance, journalism and hackers. Blomkvist brings to his writing his knowledge about the seedier sides of Swedish society. English readers are left in high expectation about what the third volume will bring, and also of a sense of loss. It is difficult to accept that the trilogy will be the only books we will have from a fine writer like Larsson.

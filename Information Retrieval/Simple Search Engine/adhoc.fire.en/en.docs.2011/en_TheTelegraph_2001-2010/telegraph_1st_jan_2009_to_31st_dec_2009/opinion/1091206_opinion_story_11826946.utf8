	 How many miles must one travel from home before feeling homesick? None at all, and the answer seems to be blowing in the cold December wind in Bengal. Mamata Banerjee has had correspondence from the Cambridge University, which has invited her to a round-table discussion with luminaries so that they can get a glimpse of her ideas on social, economic and industrial development that have held Bengal in thrall for some time now. That was months ago. Till now, the university has not heard from her or her office about the dates. That is not surprising. When the cabinet itself sees so little of her in the crucial weekly meetings, there is little reason why another congregation, that too in distant shores, should be thought to possess enough magnetism to draw her away from Bengal. According to the speculations that abound on her constant presence in Bengal, three things seem to be exerting their pull  intra-party politics, the state of the railways in Bengal, and, of course, the Left Front. Didi herself has a disarmingly simple explanation ---- she is homesick. Of course, one can get a different kind of homesickness if one were to stay on and on and on....          
	 The USP of the Indian delegation to Copenhagen is supposed to be the fact that it is bubbly and young. But despite all the noise, the minister for environment, Jairam Ramesh, has not been able to have all things his way. The buzz in the Congress is that the PM has not been able to keep complete faith in the abilities of Ramesh ever since he started giving his own twist to Indias campaign on climate change. In fact, the PM is believed to have got sufficiently perturbed to call for the inclusion of senior ministers in the team. The delegation, this time, also includes veterans from the Opposition parties. Hopefully, together, they will be able to keep Rameshs hyperactivity in check.                            
	 Talking of Jairam Ramesh, one cannot but go back to a little incident that happened last week. Amar Singhs misbehaviour in Parliament has now become a part of folklore in the cow belt. What had prompted Singh to lunge at SS Ahluwalia was the latters shout of Jai (Shri) Ram. Ever since that episode, Ramesh is believed to be wondering if he needed to do something about his name in order to assist speakers in preserving Parliamentary decorum.                            
	 For some senior officials in the PMO, happy times are back again. Many of them think that SM Krishna is the Shivraj Patil of the UPA II government which makes the national security advisor, MK Narayanan, dominate decision-making in the foreign ministry. During the short stint of Pranab Mukherjee, Narayanan inevitably had to adopt a hands-off policy. Not any more. With Krishna unwilling to exercise his authority and the new foreign secretary, Nirupama Rao, too demure to protest, Narayanan is alleged to have got busy poaching on core MEA territory. Narayanan, apparently, takes the top billing in negotiations related to the PMs foreign visits, forging ahead of both the foreign minister and the foreign secretary in matters related to foreign policy. Some men, they say, never learn.                            
	 Down, but not out. That is what Amar Singh established by his deft use of the media for much of last week. In his most extensive interview to a TV channel owned by a Congress MP, Amar Singh sounded alternately hurt and angry for being sidelined so unceremoniously by the extended family of Mulayam Singh Yadav. He also handled with elan probing questions on why he was such a spoiler of families, be it the Bachchans, the Ambanis or the Nandas.      
	After the interview, Singh became the only topic of discussion in the Central Hall of Parliament. However, the wily politicians master-stroke became evident a little later when Mulayam Singh Yadav himself reached out to him. Amar Singhs troubles, many think, are yet to be over within the Samajwadi Party. Some SP leaders have accused Singh of turning the party into an outfit dominated by paisewallahs and filmwallahs. They also allege that the party has changed so much that it is now difficult to believe that it once belonged to the toiling masses.                 
	FOOTNOTE
      
	 Where the big and burly Somnath Chatterjee failed, the dainty Meira Kumar is going great guns. Since the first woman Speaker of the Lok Sabha took over, there has been a perceptible change in the behaviour of legislators. For one, no one has been able to make a rude comment against the lady. Social conditioning still comes in the way. On her part, Kumar behaves with extreme politeness. Politeness is often a clever weapon, and it can have devastating effects when used in Kumars shrill, school-girl-like voice. When the House turns unruly, Kumar says, Shaant ho jaaiye.....sab ke sab shaant ho jaaiye ( Calm down, everyone please calm down) . The statement invariably has its desired impact.       
	A BJP leader from Madhya Pradesh, who has had to give in with the rest, has a different take on the matter. In colloquial language in MP, Shaant ho jana is a phrase used to describe the dead. Is that the imagery that quietens legislators when Kumar cries out in her shrill voice?

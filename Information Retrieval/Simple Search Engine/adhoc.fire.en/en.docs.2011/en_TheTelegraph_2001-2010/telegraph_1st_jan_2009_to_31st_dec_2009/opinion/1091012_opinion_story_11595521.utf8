	Doctor in the dock                  
	Sir  The report, Britain bans Indian doctor (Oct 8), brings to light one of the major problems of the Indian healthcare system today. A doctor, who graduated from Calcutta, has been banned from practising by the General Medical Council in the United Kingdom after she failed an examination in child healthcare six times, and also failed to attend a competency examination. Can such action ever be taken against any doctor, under the present medical system, in India?          
	There is no mechanism in India to interdict a doctor for such failure. Medicine being a complex science, it may not be fair to expect that a student will pass every test at the first attempt. But failing the same examination six times clearly points to a lack of knowledge about the subject. In a profession that literally deals with life and death, allowing an incompetent person to become a doctor cannot be an option. But then, in India, where private medical colleges are mushrooming everywhere  apparently to help inept but wealthy students become doctors by paying a hefty capitation fee  one cannot even find a way to impose a stringent regulatory system on the teaching and practice of medicine.          
	The medical council in England found serious deficit in the banished doctors record keeping as well as in her diagnosis and treatment over a long period of time. The punitive action taken by the council was not a result of any specific complaint by a victim of medical negligence. The medical councils in India would not even consider looking into a doctors practice unless a complaint is formally lodged against him. There is reason to believe that most complaints of negligence are dismissed by the members of the medical council in order to shield their errant colleagues. Even on the rare occasion when a doctor is adjudged guilty by the council, either a warning or a token suspension of license for a few months is imposed as punishment. So, there is hardly any reason for even the most incompetent doctors to be careful and act responsibly in India. Medical councils in India should follow the GMCs example and keep a close watch on the performance of doctors.

	Violent ways          
	Sir  It was disturbing to read that Maoists have killed 17 policemen (Maoists kill 17 cops in west, Oct 9). The governments efforts have failed to contain the Maoists and Naxalites, active in parts of Chhattisgarh, Orissa and Andhra Pradesh. Lalu Prasad has said that West Bengal is a university for Maoist activities. The chief minister of the state, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, should take a cue from Prasads comment and ban the Maoists. The government should also initiate poverty-alleviation programmes so that young people are not misled into joining such terror groups.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Once again, policemen have been killed in an ambush by a Maoist group on the Maharashtra border. There was no casualty on the other side, though. This shows the poor state of the police force. The arms and ammunitions they use are outdated. In most cases, they lack combat skills and are physically unfit as well. These account for the heavy casualties security personnel suffer during such encounters.          
	The killing of police officers at regular intervals should be an eye-opener to the government at the Centre as well as at the states, as it affects the morale of the forces and emboldens the extremists.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Name game          
	Sir  The launch of fountain pens named after Mahatma Gandhi by Montblanc seems to have generated controversy (Gandhi pen stirs protest, Oct 4). While releasing the pen, Montblanc donated $145,666 to the Mahatma Gandhi Foundation.          
	Gandhi seems to be remembered only on his birth-anniversaries, and forgotten thereafter. The present government, however, seems generous in releasing huge sums to perpetuate the memory of the Nehru-Gandhi family, and in naming countless airports, stadia, universities, and government programmes after members of that dynasty. Mahatma Gandhis name rarely features in these programmes. So, by naming a pen after Gandhi, and making a donation to the Mahatma Gandhi Foundation, Montblanc was only following the Congresss principle.                    
	Yours faithfully,

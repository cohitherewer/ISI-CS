	Friends, fraudsters and freaks      
	CHE: A MEMOIR by Fidel Castro (LeftWord, Rs 350) edited by David Deutschmann is a collection of responses to the life and times of Che Guevara, delivered as public lectures, interviews and articles. The book has been misleadingly called a memoir. Even more audaciously, it has been called a classic biography. It is undeniable that a loose portrait of Che emerges from the various bits that have been collated here, but it is absurd to claim any structural unity among the disjointed, rambling and often self-interested chapters. Coming from a wily dictator like Castro, who was once accused of orchestrating the murder of Che, some of the pieces reek of propaganda, hysterically reiterating the war cry against class enemies or justifying the guerrilla violence adopted by the revolutionaries.                                  
	THE DOUBLE LIFE OF RAMALINGA RAJU (HarperCollins, Rs 250) by Kingshuk Nag recounts, yet again, the story of Indias biggest corporate fraud. In present-day India, disasters  from terrorist attacks to financial scams  tend to invite copious chronicling. The Satyam fraud that reduced a $2 billion company to bankruptcy has not only been exhaustively written about in the print media but has also spawned a cottage industry of documentation. Every Tom, Dick and Harry who has ever had anything to do with business reporting have seized the day, offering their two cents, most often in rather unpalatable prose. This book, however, is an exception as it explores the entire saga from unexpected angles, focusing on aspects of Ramalinga Rajus character while decoding complex economic ideas in eminently readable prose.                        
	Zero percentile: Missed iit Kissed Russia (Rupa, Rs 95) by Neeraj Chhibba could be easily mistaken for a novel belonging to the Chetan Bhagat school of bestsellers if one goes merely by its title. However, this is not another IIT lads self-congratulatory account of his exploits. On the contrary, the hero of this novel, Pankaj, though destined to be an IITian, fails to make the grade as he is waylaid by a freak accident that lands him up in Russia. The plot turns even more bizarre as Pankaj ends up in a hostel of horrors, frantically tries to lose his virginity and has to deal with the trauma of his best friend getting infected with HIV. Neither the pedestrian prose nor the insufferable clich of true love that saves Pankaj in the end betokens any literary promise.

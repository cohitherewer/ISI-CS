	Unveil the mind                  
	Sir  Cambridge University has permitted Muslim women to wear the burqa during the graduation ceremony (Safely covered, Nov 2). However, the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, has stated that the burqa undermines womens dignity, and called it a sign of subservience. The burqa has been banned in French public schools since 2004. It is strange that the Cambridge University made such a debatable announcement all of a sudden. The Cambridge University Islamic Society, which has a huge number of members, may have influenced the decision. But the university has also added a clause, which makes the implementation of this new rule difficult. The burqa will be allowed only for those students who wear the same on a daily basis. It is unlikely that many would wear a burqa regularly.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The Cambridge Universitys decision to allow Muslim women to wear the burqa below their mortar boards is not acceptable. As Nicolas Sarkozy said, the burqa is indeed a sign of subservience, forced upon Muslim women in the name of religion. France has rightly banned the burqa inside school premises. Wearing this dress also involves security risks. A terrorist can easily use a burqa to hide himself.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Lengthy saga          
	Sir  An 11-year-old boy from Boston was enthroned as the reincarnation of a Buddhist monk who had passed away in 1250 AD (From Boston, 759 years on, Oct 29). The boy has now become a rinpoche (high priest) of a Buddhist sub-sect. With due respect to Buddhist culture, I must say that the ritual of naming a rinpoche, once it is proved that he is a reincarnation of a past monk, seems to display a certain amount of naivet on the part of Buddhists. A drastic change in lifestyle and environment may have an adverse effect on the boy, Jigme Wangchuk, who has been named the high priest. Had the boy been allowed to grow up in a developed country with better facilities of education, he may have had a better career. But now he is being confined within a monastery. This is not a good decision. Every culture has its own beliefs, but these should not interfere with the choices of an individual. Wangchuk should have been trained in Buddhist doctrines in Boston, and then given a chance to decide whether or not he wanted to become a monk.          
	Reincarnation is not a scientific concept. It is based on mythological beliefs. One should consider the future prospects of Wangchuk. It is a matter of great pride to receive this title, but this kind of conversion may limit the concerned persons possibilities of leading a normal life. The parents of the boy may be basking in their sons glory, but they should rethink the fact that this ritual will separate their child from them since Wangchuk will not be allowed to speak to lay persons during his training period in the monastery.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Speak out          
	Sir  The government is leaving no stone unturned to let the controversial painter, M.F. Husain, return to India (Delhi keen to pave Husain way, Nov 1). But even if Husain succeeds in returning to the country, he will hardly get any respite, since he will continue to be hounded by extremist Hindutva groups in India. Considering Indias eagerness to let Husain come back, it is ironic that Taslima Nasreen was not allowed to live in India because her progressive opinions offended the minority community. She was forced to seek asylum in another country as a result.           
	People of all faiths are entitled to have their own views. But they must realize that others too have an equal right to voice their opinions. It is unfortunate if a particular religious community tries to prevent others from expressing their views. People should respect the modern age of science and technology, even when holding on to age-old values. The government should take initiatives to enlighten the common people, so that religious leaders do not exploit their blind faith in religion.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  A large number of voters in India do not exercise their voting rights. The peoples lack of faith in the major political parties seems to be the main reason behind this. For greater participation of people in the democratic process, the government should make changes in the electoral laws and allow voters the option of pressing the none of the above button during elections.                    
	Yours faithfully,

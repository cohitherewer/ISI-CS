The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Letters to Editor
                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Glory in the hills                  
	Sir  I have begun to pity Jaswant Singh and the Bharatiya Janata Party, although I held both in high esteem till the other day. But let us have some mercy for L.K. Advani and his now-or-never predicament. The partys campaign started on a wrong note, with Arun Jaitley and Rajnath Singh behaving like spoilt brats, although Varun Gandhi pulled an ace out of nowhere, much to the lauh purushs relief.          
	But Advani may not be able to make it after all as the BJP has put the wrong foot forward again. It defies logic that such a smart political entity, lured by a single parliamentary seat, should promise the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha that its demand for a brand new state will be considered. The BJP may as well promise 250-odd new states to get closer to a simple majority. This myopic act is bound to backfire on the party in the long run.          
	Has the BJP completely given up on West Bengal that it felt the need to stoop to such desperate levels? Those demanding a separate homeland already have one, which happens to be not just a state but a full-fledged sovereign nation. The claim to a homeland must have some logic (imagine what would happen to a multi-ethnic society as that in the United States of America if Bimal Gurung and his brigade were to set foot there). My earnest request to the BJP is  please put up a candidate by all means but do not accept support from a divisive outfit.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Pinaki Roy, Siliguri

                
	Sir  Darjeeling and Jalpaiguri districts are parts of West Bengal. Yet the GJM feels no qualms in branding the minister, Asok Bhattacharya, an outsider in the hills. But when Jaswant Singh is nominated as the BJP candidate for the Darjeeling Lok Sabha seat, the same party promptly calls him our candidate (500-car reception to greet Jaswant in hills, April 4). By providing moral support to the GJM, the BJP  a declared nationalist party  is encouraging the fragmentation of West Bengal. Its citizens should protect their state from disintegration. Since the Gorkha-led hill vote is likely to go to Singh, voters in the plains should defeat the BJP, and ensure that the anti-BJP vote is not split. The West Bengal electorate should reject the BJP in all constituencies in the state, where it is seen as lending support to a separatist movement.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Kajal Chatterjee, Sodepur

                
	Sir  The GJM leadership must be lauded for bringing a BJP leader of Jaswant Singhs stature to contest the Lok Sabha seat in Darjeeling (Sholay script for Jaswant and Gorkhaland  few miss Gurung at Hema show, April 27). Singhs presence in Darjeeling has resulted in the Congress and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) developing cold feet. They are vainly trying to put a brave front in the face of the overwhelming popularity that Singh has been able to garner both in the hills and the plains.           
	Singhs sincere and unambiguous stand on the demand for a separate state of Gorkhland has struck the right chord among the electorate. The BJP central leadership is wholly convinced about the legitimacy of this age-old demand. It is with this conviction that Singh has assured the people of the Darjeeling hills, the Terai and the Dooars that the demand for a separate state would be sympathetically looked into.          
	The CPI(M) has been reduced to a party non grata in the hills. About the false promises of the Congress, the less said the better. In this scenario, the BJP and Singh come as a breath of fresh air and hope for the long-suffering and misunderstood Gorkha community, for those who have for years been on a relentless quest for dignity, security and, more important, for an Indian identity. One does not have to be a clairvoyant to predict Singhs victory in the Darjeeling constituency.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Abel (Eddie) Rai, Darjeeling

                
	Yet to change          
	Sir  As Mukul Kesavan shows, it would be simplistic to consider the current general elections as an aggregate of provincial elections (A parochial election? April 23). The incumbent home minister, P. Chidambaram, while in the former Tamil Maanila Congress, had once said, Ours is a regional party with a national outlook. It may also be worth remembering here that regional representations in the national cricket selection committee made it possible for the Souravs and Dhonis to blossom.          
	The relationship of the regions to the Centre can never be simple. Perhaps the chattering classes are yet to understand the compulsion of different regions to challenge the political feudalism of the leaders of the so-called national parties in Delhi. However, this does not include parties like the Shiv Sena or the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena. Even L.K. Advani, when he mentioned the important role played by regional parties like the Akali Dal, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and the Telugu Desam Party in national politics (Advani courts region parties, April 24), conveniently forgot to mention the Shiv Sena, which replicates the BJPs majorityism at the state level. After all, Hindi-speakers were not too amused with what happened in Mumbai recently.           
	The relationship of the regions to the Centre is driven by changing compulsions. Just as we have grown used to the less-than-perfect language skills of our cricketers, our ideas about politics and politicians will also change.                     
	Yours faithfully, 
  Md. Aslam Parvez, Calcutta

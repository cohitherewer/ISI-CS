                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        States fall apart         Bona Fide - Malvika Singh                              
	Andhra Pradesh has become the scene of a tragic farce. Some of its fallouts have given a fillip to the declining fortunes of a few political entities. Failed leaders have been made heroes overnight. In Uttar Pradesh, the consistent hard work of the Youth Congress that had put pressure on the Bahujan Samaj Party and the Samajwadi Party has been temporarily diluted by Mayavati. She has seized on the opportunity to usurp some of the positive responses to the allocation of funds by the Planning Commission for Bundelkhand by asking for a bifurcation of the cumbersome state into smaller, manageable units, where the disbursement of funds, and therefore growth and development, will become more equitable. Canny and alert, she has deftly turned the Congress boo boo in Andhra into an opportunity for herself.        
	As an outsider in the realm of political manoeuvring but watching the many scenes unfold with keen attention, it appears to me as though some in the Grand Old Party are dead intent on destroying the rejuvenation India has seen over the last six years, for reasons best known to them. After being in a limbo for years, the Congress was steadily gaining ground with its good sense and improving governance. To commit hara-kiri and become so utterly suicidal is peculiar.        
	Maybe it is time to make the operators accountable for their follies. Maybe this is the time to introduce a new methodology of inviting diverse sets of information from the field instead of depending wholly on small core groups. Over time, these groups manipulate the decision-making authorities with ease because the top bosses are isolated from public opinion. This modus operandi needs to be replaced by a more liberal mode of functioning that is open to thinking individuals with no axe to grind.        
	Many thought that the future spelt hope and change. There was a palpable sense that the old, failed manipulations and predictable blackmailing techniques were being discarded by a new generation of politicians who represented a changing aspiration and ethos.                
	Road to change        
	Is this unacceptable, devious politicking the last resort of a tribe that knows its days are numbered? Is that tribe deliberately corroding the foundation and infrastructure of the party in a desperate attempt to make the passing of the baton difficult? Small-minded and intellectually insignificant, these political operators have mastered diverse tactics of manipulation. They would like to divide India into smaller states as that would allow them a better scope for blackmail and horse-trading. These are the unsavoury realities of a young and struggling democracy.        
	Is this the right moment for Sonia Gandhi to overhaul the leadership of her party, retire those who have ruled the roost for far too long, and introduce the first-timers into the high office of general secretary? After all, the newcomers must determine their future course and that of this young nation. We have had enough of the archaic politics that the present lot brings to the table.        
	Are small states economically viable? Will they be politically and socially stable in the larger context of India and the world? Both these questions have numerous sub-questions, which, when analysed, give rise to unnerving possibilities. Good governance entails an intelligent structuring of development plans and the devolution of resources. It is not imperative to break down states for this to be accomplished. What India requires is leadership, truly competent and committed leaders, who believe in delivering the goods and services that civil society demands. We must cease condoning criminals, crooks and incompetent candidates, who have failed every test, in every other profession, and have joined politics to make good at the cost of the people. That, alas, is the reality of India circa 2009. It was not the case circa 1947.

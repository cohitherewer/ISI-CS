The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | In ones own backyard
                                                                                                                 IN ONES OWN BACKYARD                          - Neocolonialism in its latest form        Cutting Corners - Ashok Mitra                                                  
	Who says neocolonialism exists only in the imagination of senile ideologues? A report carried by the media the other day suggests quite the contrary.        
	Principals of 42 schools located in Calcutta, the report says, were summoned to the headquarters of the city police. They were harangued by the police bosses on how to improve the security environment of their institutions. A long roster of dos and donts was posted with them. They must submit to the police the full list of their teaching and non-teaching staff. They must strengthen their watch and ward personnel. The principals and the teachers should exercise due vigilance to ensure that no outsiders ever intruded into the classrooms and the school premises. The schools should consider installing close circuit cameras to televise goings-on during school hours as well as after hours. Each school must endeavour to raise a volunteer force from among its students. This force should be taught the rudiments of security surveillance. Members of the volunteer force are to reach the school half-an-hour before classes commence and carry out a rigorous search of the school compound, classrooms, washrooms and so on, and report on any unclaimed bag, package or other material lying about. A further suggestion was mooted: the volunteer force may be assigned the responsibility of reporting to the authorities in case they suspect any student or member of the staff of keeping doubtful company or behaving in an unusual manner. These are difficult times, global terror has sneaked in right in our midst, the police expect the educational institutions to rise to the occasion and do the needful.               
	The United States of America has its problems. George W. Bush has been repudiated by the American electorate, but it is not so easy to cope with the consequences of his doings. American voters have given a mandate to the new president to wind down the West Asian war and bring the boys back from the minefields of Iraq and Afghanistan. There are, however, crucial issues of logistics involved in carrying out the mandate. The military-industrial complex has a mind of its own. The Central Intelligence Agency too has; it also loves to indulge in reveries. Breaking past conventions concerning division of labour, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has now moved out of the domestic groove and has set up outposts in different parts of the world, including West Asia; its counsel on what is to be done in West Asia cannot be ignored either. The ego factor is at work in the case of all these entities; each of them also knows ways and means of sidetracking the wishes of the electorate. Moreover, because of a private deal which persuaded Hillary Clinton to withdraw from the contest for the Democratic Party nomination for the post of president, she had to be named the secretary of state in the new administration. She was a vociferous supporter of Bushs West Asia policy and had voted in the senate for the war in Iraq. She too has her prejudices and preferences.        
	Barack Obama therefore has to compromise. His first priority, nonetheless, is to fight the demon of recession threatening to destroy the American economy. He needs to mobilize all the resources that are there in that effort. He is keen to cut back on defence commitments. To save precious American lives, he has made one concrete proposal: the natives of Afghanistan could be recruited to take over the load of fighting the Taliban. He himself must be aware of the absurdity of his suggestion. Apart from Kabul, the Americans have no control over the rest of the landmass of Afghanistan. It would also be altogether foolhardy to hand over AK rifles to even supposedly loyal Afghans; the rifles might in no time be turned against the Americans themselves.        
	Pakistan has been a great disappointment. Its administration is wobbly, and its military and intelligence have actually been infiltrated by the Taliban. Given these circumstances, Obama has been forced to appeal to the magnanimity of such countries as Russia, China and India: they must, please, come forward and participate in the war against global terror, meaning they must agree to fight the Taliban alongside the Americans.         
	Nothing can be more amusing. The Americans did not seek the prior concurrence of Russia, China and India when they invaded Afghanistan; they rushed in, because Osama bin Laden, who had masterminded 9/11, was, they were convinced, hiding in some cave in the mountainous tracts of that country. They invaded Iraq because Bush hated the face and demeanour of Saddam Hussein; the US president had to invent a blatant lie to justify that invasion, and once more went in without advance consultations with Russia, China and India. And, of course, the Americans did not seek the approval from others when they decided to distribute free arms to the Taliban in the 1980s.        
	Russia and China are smart cookies. They have ignored the presidential invitation to bail out the US. The Indian authorities evidently have another definition of smartness. In their view, since the US remains the wealthiest and the mightiest nation, it makes sense to toe the American line; rich dividends can be expected to accrue from such demonstrated fellow-feeling. Therefore, the decision to enter into a strategic partnership with the US with all its implications. The prime minister did not waste one moment to respond positively to the Obama overture, and has rushed to propose a joint Indo-Pakistan expedition to weed out the Taliban. It is only bashfulness which prevented him from mentioning that a joint expedition of this nature has to be guided and monitored by the US administration.         
	As part of this rapidly developing closeness between fighters-of-global-terror in the US and their more-than-willing followers in India, American espionage agencies, including the FBI, have begun to offer streams of advisories to Indian officialdom. The central aim is to scare the daylights out of Indian citizens. This supposedly can be done most effectively by planting stories about impending attacks by terrorists on Indian targets including rail stations, old-age homes, hospitals and educational institutions. The Americans should know; in Iraq, these were their favourite targets. Their intelligence agencies are hard at work; they make a cocktail of market gossip, preconceived notions and airy-fairy advice, and pass on the stuff to the authorities in New Delhi, who routinely pass them on to those in charge of security and law and order in the state capitals.               
	It is a two-tier colonial order. New Delhi accepts whatever half-junk is offered by the US agencies, and functionaries in Calcutta, Chennai, Mumbai and other locations accept as holy writ whatever garbage comes down from the nations capital. The rest of the story is in the image of Gogols Inspector General story. The Calcutta Police summon school principals and give them a sermon on global terror and how to confront it. Among other things, the schools have been advised to recruit some of their students to spy on their teachers and classmates. Once such mischief is afoot, teachers and students belonging to a particular denomination will, rest assured, be instant suspects merely because of the names they bear.         
	True, we have in our country groups of discontents who believe in the cult of sporadic acts of violence. But the problems they present have nothing to do with the doctrine of global terror the US administration is hawking around. In the rush to oblige the Americans, this basic fact is brushed aside.         
	Neocolonialism is present right here, at this very moment. The politicians in charge, busy with other concerns, are possibly not even aware of all that is taking place in their precincts. This is the bizarre part of it: at the macro level, you rail against the strategic alliance New Delhi has signed with the US; at the micro level, that policy gets operationalized under your very nose.

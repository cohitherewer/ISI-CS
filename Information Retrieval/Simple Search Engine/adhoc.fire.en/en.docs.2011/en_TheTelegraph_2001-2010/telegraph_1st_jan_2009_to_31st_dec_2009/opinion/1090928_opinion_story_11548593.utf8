                                                                                                                 GOOD EVENING                                                    
	Business with a social face can have truly positive effects. The Federation of Hotels and Restaurants of India has an excellent plan to make the elderly happy while bringing in more business for restaurants. The plan is to offer discounts for families or younger people bringing in relatives who are senior citizens. This might give younger people a mental nudge: not only are old people useful to take out to dinner, they may be happier if they are remembered when the family is having a good time. While the plan shows a wise understanding of family dynamics as well as a sensitive nose for business and goodwill creation, implementing it may need a little preparation. The federation realizes there must be some special training for the members of staff, so that senior citizens feel wanted and comfortable. Restaurants may also need to adjust their furniture and facilities a little if the elderly become regular visitors. But the real responsibility lies elsewhere  with the families themselves. If older people are often unwilling to go out because they feel they are not wanted, or are a source of embarrassment to others, will they feel differently if it is clearly a case of a discount on a family dinner? To be a ticket to a good time for others may not be quite the route to feel useful again; it is possible to be ignored by children and grandchildren in a restaurant as much as in the home.         
	It would be interesting to watch if the offer of a discount does prompt a new consideration among families and a new confidence among senior citizens hesitant to go out in spite of family encouragement. A change of mindset might do wonders, and this goes for restaurants as well. They could make a special effort to welcome and accommodate differently abled persons, those whom India finds so difficult to remember at all. The old, the ailing, the differently abled: all of them would appreciate a good time once in a while.

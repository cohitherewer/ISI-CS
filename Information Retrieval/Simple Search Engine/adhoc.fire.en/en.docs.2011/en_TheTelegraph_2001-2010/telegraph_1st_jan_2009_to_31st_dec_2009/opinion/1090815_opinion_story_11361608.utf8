The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Fear, fun and fantasy
                                                                                                                 FEAR, FUN AND FANTASY                              VISUAL ARTS       Soumitra Das                        Detail from Uproar by Kartick Chandra Pyne				                                       
	Elusiveness and ambiguity are the hallmarks of the works of both Kartick Chandra Pyne (born 1931) and Partha Pratim Deb (born 1943), who had for a long time not received any recognition for their original vision. One easily identifiable reason for this is their refusal to act according to the dictates of the market. Pyne has been ill for quite sometime now, yet his work has not lost any of its mystery, its childlike candour that at times verges on the weird, its simplicity, and its sense of awe, as if at having discovered the world anew.        
	Long before he became part of the gallery circuit, Deb had gained a reputation for creating the most amazing things with odds and ends that one never thought would have any utility. What Deb created could not be categorized easily, for one could not be sure if they were mere playthings or if the former teacher was dead serious. But Deb was never one to take either himself or his work seriously, although he painstakingly created the effects he desired. Deb is equally innovative when it comes to painting, and his canvases and drawings in which lines play a vital role can never be mistaken for any other artists work, so strong is the stamp of his personality.        
	It was for these outstanding qualities that Aakriti art gallery brought the two senior artists together in an exhibition entitled Leela (August 3-14). This exhibition was curated by Pranabranjan Ray, who has written a short piece explaining the concept of leela expounded in Sanskrit texts on aesthetics discourse. The word, leela, comes close to carousing, or being sportive, although it has a deeper, and more profound, meaning as well, often associated as it is with the dalliances and feats of the blue god in Vrindavan. Krishna was a rather ambivalent character associated both with the abandon of a lover as with the sagacity of a politician. Rays explanation, however, may seem redundant, for both artists can be playful and inventive without any prompting, and honestly, their works that were on display were no different from what we have seen in previous exhibitions.        
	Pynes works seem to have been conceived in a dream. But he is not a surrealist the way Salvador Dal was a surrealist. Pynes works look like they could easily have been painted by a child  so simple are the forms he depicts. His works have none of the high finish one associates with the works of most Calcutta painters, known for their skill, or even with Dal. Pynes brushstrokes are uneven, as if some impulsive child had rubbed crayons on paper without bothering so much about anything else but the brightness of the colours chosen. But, of course, there is more to it than meets the eye.        
	His sophistication is noticeable in the way he has created the creature with two heads (of a man and a woman, presumably), large, round breasts, and legs sprouting from the torso in a manner that defies the anatomy of the human body. The figure subverts the academic training art college students are subjected to till today. Calcuttas secret life reveals itself in the shape of a peacock that spreads its fantail before a gaslight. It is as magical as the opening sequence of the novel, Herbert, where the fairy hovers outside the window as the eponymous hero bleeds to death. The fish-like boats on the dark river waters are steeped in mystery. Yet Pyne can be as artless as a child. Durgas lion is a rag-doll patting Asuras knee, while the cotton duck looks on.        
	Deb, it seems, quite methodically explores the madness inherent in life. He does not employ the strategy of distortion like the modernists, but as in Alice in Wonderland, reason seems to have taken its leave from Debs world. Deb plays around with colours and lines, often with spectacular results. He showers multi-colour polka dots on the canvas; bold strokes of acid green singe a molten red ground. Dabs of red, yellow, green and black are transformed into a pigeon. Like his lines, Debs colours, too, have a life of their own. A Hokusai-like tsunami of yellow striped with red leaps to reach the even brighter lemon yellow moon.        
	This could be easily termed abstract or non-figurative but the viewer can never be sure whether this is just an exuberant play with colours or if the artist really intends to depict something tangible. For he often places Lilliputs in this minefield of colours and lines. A group of tiny men sit on banks of bright red and green, as if trying to pilot them, while, in another canvas, a man puts his hands on his eyes as the sky rains fire. There is a lot of fun but fear is always lurking round the corner.

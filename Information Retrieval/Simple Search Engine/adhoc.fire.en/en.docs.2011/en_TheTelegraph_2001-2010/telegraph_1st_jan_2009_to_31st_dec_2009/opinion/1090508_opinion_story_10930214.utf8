                                                                                                                 LOVE AND MONEY                                                    
	The word, dowry, does not have any magic charm surrounding it, said one of the two judges of the Supreme Court, who ruled that the anti-dowry law would apply in the case of live-in partners as well. This strong thrust among the judiciary to address all routes of exploitation of and violence towards women has been in evidence for a while, and is always welcomed. This ruling is in step with the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, which covers any woman who lives in the family, whether married or live-in, or not even in a sexual relationship with the accused, such as his mother or sister. By invoking dowry  it is just the label given to the demand of money in a marital relationship, the judges have reportedly said  the court seems to be seeking to protect the woman in a live-in relationship from the mans avarice.         
	The principle behind the ruling is reassuring, and its premise  a man may demand money of his live-in partner as he would of his wife  is undeniably realistic. At the same time, a change in context in the use of a specific word may cause confusion. An example is the use of the word, rape, to describe consensual sex when the woman is deceived into believing that her lover will marry her. She can charge him with rape if he refuses. But the use of the word, rape, for what is fundamentally a breach of promise  in order to emphasize the full scale of the womans injury  ultimately confuses the basic definition of rape by eliminating its essentially coercive, non-consensual nature. Dowry implies families on both sides and this gives the concept a different dimension. Also, living together implies choice on the part of both partners and an equality of status. Extracting money under these conditions could be a different type of crime altogether. Unless, of course, the live-in bit is a complete sham, and the arrangement is just an evasion of bigamy or is some other form of cheating. There are laws enough against that.

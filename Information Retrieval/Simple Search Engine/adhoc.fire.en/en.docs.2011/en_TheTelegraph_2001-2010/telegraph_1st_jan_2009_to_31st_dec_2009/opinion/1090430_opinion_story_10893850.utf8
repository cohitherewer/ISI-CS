	Democracy and high-handedness do not go well together. And if elections are to be an affirmation of the spirit of democracy, then it is the Election Commissions duty to see that the use of force plays as small a role as possible in conducting them. But it appears now that the EC itself runs the biggest risk of embodying the high-handedness against which it must be vigilant. In Calcutta, this has been most clearly evident in the ECs attitude to the National Library. The EC has outraged the very people whose democratic rights it has been empowered to protect. It is the nature and extent of the ECs empowerment by law and by the State that need to be looked at again in the light of the ongoing National Library episode. Is it in the best interests of democracy for the EC to have a sweeping mandate to requisition for any premises? The Representation of the People Act, 1951, defines any premises as any land, building or part of a building including a hut, shed or other structure or any part thereof. From the humblest to the grandest, this empowers the EC to take over, if it wishes and if the state government deems, just about any sort of property. Moreover, the process of requisitioning happens by an order in writing served to the owner or person in possession of the property.        
	The law seems fully aware of bringing face to face the machinery of the State and an individual or institutions rights of proprietorship. Yet, the former is assumed to be important enough, and powerful enough, to override the latter. It therefore becomes crucial for the EC to exercise the utmost discretion in how it makes use of such a law, and this is where the ECs dealings with the National Library leave ample room for scepticism regarding its capacity for such discretion. The party-political ethos of West Bengal thrives on coercion and the abuse of the rights of individuals. From the defacing of private and public property (graffiti, rallies on the Maidan) to the question of exit and opinion polls, there is a knee-jerk tendency to disregard or control the voters right to independent action and opinion. It is crucial for the EC to distance itself from this coercion and abuse of power and not end up colluding with it, even if it does so with the best of intentions. The law cannot afford to legitimize the disruption of normal life and its valued institutions, empowering the electoral machinery in ways that are inimical to the spirit of democracy.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | wITHOUT A CLEAR ROADMAP
                                                                                                                 WITHOUT A CLEAR ROADMAP                                  sumanta sen                              
	The situation in Nepal continues to be uncertain. A little over a year ago, there was the palace rule which had ceased to enjoy support among the masses. Today there is popular rule, which is popular only in the sense that the rulers are commoners. Beyond that, the present disposition is only a shade more representative than what the palace had been. The government of Madhav Nepal had been cobbled together in a hurry after the Maoists walked out: it is a compromise that is constantly in danger of falling apart. The situation is certainly not what the Nepalese had wanted when they celebrated the ouster of King Gyanendra from power.        
	The first casualty, it seems, will be the constitution that the elected parliament was to draft, and without which there cannot be a republic. Drafting a constitution is certainly not easy; in India, the task took two years to be completed, even though there was no tension caused by diametrically opposing views. In Nepal, the situation is exactly the opposite. Right now, not even the most optimistic person in Kathmandu can say for certain when the constitution will see the light of day. Things will continue to remain in a flux unless the basis for constitutional rule is put in place. Yet, such a rule was in the minds of all those who had wanted a representative government, including the Maoists.        
	The problem would have been of lesser magnitude had the Nepali Congress, the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist-Leninist) and the Madhesis presented a united front against the Maoists. Right now, they are together but only on paper. In reality, there is no love lost between them. The communists want to keep the Maoists at bay, and so do the other two forces. But apart from that, the three parties do not have a common agenda.                 
	Unclear picture        
	The CPN (UML) wants to usher in socialism through the parliamentary path.The Nepali Congress believes in a free economy and the Madhesis are primarily interested in a better deal for themselves vis--vis the majority community. When the Maoists walked out of the government, the other two forces thought that the moderate Madhav Nepal would be the best choice for a caretaker prime minister who would be able to keep the administration functioning. But that is not what the Himalayan nation needs: what it needs is a definite road map for the future.        
	Unfortunately, providing Nepal with a definite roadmap would have been difficult even if the Maoists had remained in office. The traditional ties of the Nepali Congress with India, and its relations with the Indian National Congress, have always made it a suspect with the communists and the Maoists. The Maoist attitude towards India is well known. Similarly, it should not be forgotten that the communist leader, the late Manmohan Adhikary, had often railed against New Delhi during his stint as prime minister.         
	India is significant to both parties, as also to a sizeable section of Nepalis, in a negative sense. Small countries are always wary of their bigger neighbours, particularly those that are intricately linked to the countrys daily life. If this shared perception had united the two parties, then a clearer picture would have emerged. But they have nothing in common so far as Nepal is concerned.         
	The situation today appears too complex to be resolved. But this has always been the case. What had raised hopes was the initial display of willingness to jointly transform Nepal into a republic. The willingness perhaps is all that there is, but basic differences continue to plague inter-party relations. The irony of the situation is that ultimately, India may have to play a role in sorting out things. Confusion in Kathmandu does not help New Delhi, which always has Beijing in mind.

                                                                                                               DIARY
                  
	 Have SM Krishnas prolonged stay in the Raj Bhavan in Maharashtra earlier and Shashi Tharoors considerable international exposure made it impossible for them to adjust to the mediocre comforts of Lutyens Delhi? Perhaps this is indeed the case because other leaders seem to have no complaints about the lack of amenities or privacy. Take three other Congress leaders  the Haryana chief minister, Bhupinder Singh Hooda, the Union science and technology minister, Prithviraj Chavan, and the Gurgaon member of parliament, Rao Inderjit Singh. All three of them prefer to sweat it out in New Delhis modest VP House club. In addition to being more politically correct, the VP House club has other facilities to offer to the more politically-inclined: it provides the right ambience and the right excuse to strategize. The three may be doing exactly that over the forthcoming assembly polls in Haryana. Five-star gyms may be cool, but by refusing to rub shoulders with hoi polloi, politicos may be losing out on much. Mind it, Tharoor!                 
	 Sharad Pawar may not have managed to become the convener of the United Progressive Alliance, but he still manages to lead from the front. The other day, when the prime minister focused on austerity, Pawar struck a note of dissent. He announced that Union ministers were not required to be told about cost-cutting because they were mature and responsible creatures. And contrary to what appeared (no names were taken here), ministers were not usually spendthrift. Pawars stand found ready acceptance. Farooq Abdullah, Dayanidhi Maran and some others did their best to pick holes in the austerity drive. Pawar, naturally, is delighted.                             
	 It is not as if members of the government alone are picking holes in government policies. The Opposition, quite expectedly, is also at it. It has been trying to find out how many MPs included in the parliamentary committee have a conflict of interest in any particular ministry. So far, three such members have been located who are somehow related to highway projects, a subject Copu  as the committee of public undertakings is popularly known  has taken up. Look out for more crossfire in the next parliamentary session.                            
	 Now that the spotlight has shifted to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the otherwise reticent men of Jhandewalan are busy using the opportunity for an image-makeover. The new RSS chief, Mohan Bhagwat, has already made it apparent that he is not as rigid as his predecessor. These days, Bhagwat is even seen giving television interviews with his sleeves rolled up, and offering suggestions to the Bharatiya Janata Party with a smile. This is different from the sight of K Sudarshan giving a tongue-lashing to the Vajpayee-Advani duo. In an attempt to appear media-friendly, Bhagwat has increased the number of RSS spokesmen to six. Also, the medium of communication is being upgraded. The door-to-door knocks by old men in khaki shorts are being replaced by e-shakhas and prachar by appointment. This, apart from the uploading of content that the RSS is doing on various social networking sites. Live it up!                             
	 While SM Krishna and Shashi Tharoor got the brunt of the austerity drive, another man quietly slipped the net. Anand Sharma, the busy Union commerce and industry minister, is said to have shifted to a five-star hotel, which was functioning as the venue of a meet. The reason? Sharma didnt want to shuttle between his residence and the venue. Sharma, it seems, has moved up the political ladder. He is apparently addressed as CM, though his party sits in the Opposition in his home state, Himachal Pradesh. Any call to his office is responded to with a polite CMs Office greeting. Udyog Bhawan babus say CM stands for commerce minister. The other portfolio, industry, obviously has turned less important.                             
	 Recently, the distributor of Mercedes-Benz in Delhi asked its clients to keep off the water-logged roads. Perhaps the makers of Merc should learn a few tricks from the humble Ambassador to run on Indian roads through out the year.                   
	 Vasundhara Raje Scindia should thank the bad times for her good fortune. The inauspicious shraadh fortnight is said to have prevented the BJP high command from pressing for her resignation. Apparently, Rajnath Singh believes that a resignation during shraadh could be harmful for the party. Shraadh earned its infamy after Kalyan Singh took oath as the UP CM during the period and never returned to power. But the BJP is not the only party gazing at the stars. The period has brought all poll-related activities in Haryana and Maharashtra to a standstill. Parties are reluctant to name their candidates and ticket-seekers are visiting their constituencies for a change to keep their chances afloat. Evidently, its not such a bad time for all.

	A lady who claimed that she was a Thakur Scheduled Tribe was appointed as a bank clerk in 1981 in a post reserved for Scheduled Tribes. In 1999 a scrutiny committee found that she did not belong to any such tribe and so her service was terminated. The employee challenged the order in the Bombay High Court, stating that the committee had taken too long to come out with its report. The high court held that she had served the bank for a long time and hence should not be sacked. The bank appealed to the Supreme Court. It held that the very foundation of the appointment was invalid as the employee had admitted that the certificate was false. The court obs-erved that the woman had usurped a post meant for a reserved candidate by misrepresenting facts. It upheld the order of termination.

	Living space        
	A landlord sought the eviction of his tenants on the grounds of personal requirement, arguing that his son and daughter would soon get married and need more space. During the pendency of the case they did get married. The tenant argued that if the landlords son required the premises, he needed to mention that in a special plea. He added that the Haryana Urban (Control of Rent and Eviction) Act required the landlord to apply to the rent controller of the state for extra space to be used as a consulting room only if his son were a doctor, lawyer etc. The Supreme Court held that such a plea was not needed as the landlord simply required the space for his sons wife and children.

	Woman violated        
	A man was convicted for committing an offence under Sections 366 (kidnapping and forcing a woman into marriage) and 376 (rape) of the Indian Penal Code. The Allahabad High Court directed his acquittal, stating that the victim was a major who had consented to the liaison. It observed that no injuries were found on her, indicating that she was used to sexual intercourse. When the state appealed to the Supreme Court, it observed that even if it was argued that the victim was not a virgin, the law could not give anybody the licence to rape. It remanded the case to the high court for rehearing. (State of U.P. vs Munshi)

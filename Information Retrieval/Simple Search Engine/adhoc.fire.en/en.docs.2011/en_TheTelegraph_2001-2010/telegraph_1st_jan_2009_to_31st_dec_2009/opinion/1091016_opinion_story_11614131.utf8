	Too Much Happiness By Alice Munro, Chatto amp; Windus, 17.99        
	In one of the stories in Alice Munros new book, the protagonist is disappointed when she realizes that the book she has picked up from the bookstore is a collection of short stories. It seems to diminish a books authority, making the author seem like somebody who is just hanging on to the gates of Literature, rather than safely settled inside. This wry observation is quite misleading as Munro herself has been lodged within the gates of Literature for decades now. The recent Man Booker International Prize only re-established her credentials as one of the best practitioners of the short story.        
	Too Much Happiness comes two years after Munro announced her retirement, and the septuagenarian demonstrates that her mastery over the short story genre remains unmatched by younger writers who tend to overuse the open-ended conclusion in this form of fiction. As always, Munros stories are not about ordinary people leading extraordinary lives. Rather, they are about unusual people  damaged goods as she sees them  and how they accommodate the ghosts of their flawed past into their seemingly ordinary lives. Two ageing women deal with the secret of unimaginable cruelty in their childhood in their own separate ways in Childs Play; a traumatized mother finds salvation in the most unexpected circumstances in Dimensions; a terminally ill widow bluffs a killer by fictionalizing her own past in Free Radicals. Myths about the innocence of childhood, the rewarding nature of parenthood and the serenity of married life are systematically debunked through these ten stories. The childhood trauma in Face and in Childs Play is particularly chilling, especially since the protagonists have lived full, unexceptional lives after that one terrible moment in their childhood.        
	Other than in the last story, Too Much Happiness, Munro sets her plots against the stern, rugged landscape that Canada offers her. The landscape and the spare language add to the sense that Munro is writing with an economy  almost an austerity in expression  that expects the reader to be intelligent enough to read between the lines and understand what is left unsaid. In Free Radicals, Nitas take on her own past shows her as a home-wrecking opportunist. Is this a ploy to outwit a dangerous murderer, or is it the sense of guilt that Nita has carried inside all her life?         
	Of late, the open-ended short story has doomed this particular genre by making it predictable. Munros stories always have a sense of closure, jagged edges, in the form of regrets, grievances and unanswered questions. Marital problems appear as a theme that recurs without being repetitive. Parenthood, temptation, jealousy, all of these cause couples to drift apart, and Munro is more resigned than judgmental. It may be granted that there were other couples living separate lives in one house, other men and women who had accepted the fact that there were differences never to be mended, a word or an act never to be forgiven, a barrier never to be washed away. It is a bleak view on marriage that keeps recurring in almost every story.        
	Parenthood is also dealt with in an ambivalent manner. The obsessive father in Dimensions, the clueless mother in Childs Play, the guilty yet neglecting mother in Too Much Happiness, the disillusioned father in Deep Holes, each of their experiences shows how difficult it is to raise a child, and how disappointing it can be in the end. Many stories reflect Munros own septuagenarian point of view because they are written from the perspective of someone who, at the fag end of her life, is looking back at the one moment that she might have lived differently. Surprisingly, some of the stories have melodramatic moments of violence and tragedy, although Munro is a little uncomfortable when it comes to accommodating them in her spare, unadorned style. This is possibly why Dimensions proves to be the weakest link in this collection of 10 stories.        
	However, when Munro moves out of her other comfort zone  Canada  to set her story in 19th-century Europe, she produces a gem. Longer than the other stories, Too Much Happiness offers the readers a fictionalized biography of the 19th-century mathematician, Sophia Kovalevsky. A woman ahead of her time, she is a widow who wants career, love and more. Her lover, Maxsim, takes up too much room, on the divan and in ones mind. But Sophia also possesses a multi-tasking brain that continues to tick. She hates her bitter brother-in-law, feels for her neglected daughter, cares for her ageing mentor and achieves brilliance in a field that was a male domain at the time. At the point of her happiest moment, destiny intervenes, and Sophia dies by her own diagnosis of too much happiness.        
	In the epilogue, made up of short, staccato paragraphs, Munro reveals more about Sophias time and the norms by which she lived and died. Her lover, Maxsim, grieves for her but emphasizes that they were only colleagues and not lovers. A crater in the moon is named after her  which is a fact  but by the end of Sophias story, it becomes a symbol of not only what she achieved but also of what more she could have accomplished had her fate and the time she lived in been different. Munros expert style of revealing a story, non-linear and yet not jumpy, remains matchless. It has often been compared to going from one room to another in a house with surprises and shocks awaiting the visitor at every turn. For Munro, the brevity of her chosen form is not an excuse to shy away from creating complex characters and detailed plots. Too much Happiness may not be Munros best work, but she is in good form here.                    MALAVIKA R.

                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Empire in ruins                  
	Sir  The confessions of the chairman of Satyam Computers, B. Ramalinga Raju, of falsifying the account statements of his company have shocked investors (Raju confesses to biggest corporate fraud in India, Jan 8). But it reflects the failure of the entire system. The auditors, independent directors, internal audit teams and regulatory agencies did not detect the errors in the forged balance statements of Satyam, and thus helped Raju dupe investors for years. This also proves that the regulatory agencies were not doing their duty. It is a collective failure. So if Raju is punished, the auditors as well as the officials of regulatory bodies should also be put behind bars. Investigation into the scandal when investors have already met with losses functions merely as a post-mortem.          
	But some steps can still be taken. Accountability and transparency need to be a made a significant part of corporate ethics. Many CEOs occupy the post of chairmen in their companies, and thus have access to documents and can tamper with the firms records. A group of directors or stakeholders who will remain answerable to one another should be put in charge of operations instead. All those who gain from falsifying or concealing information should be punished by law. Can we have stringent action soon so that such corporate fraud is not repeated?          
	Yours faithfully,      
R. Girish, Mumbai

                
	Sir  Ramalinga Rajus confession and untimely resignation are unfortunate. The directors on the board should be grateful that Raju has not blamed them, but only himself. And if it is only Raju who is responsible for the loss, he alone can mend it. So the board must take back Raju as the chairman considering his background, performance and contribution.           
	Besides, arresting Raju is not a solution to the crisis. Even the chief minister of Andhra Pradesh, Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy, realizes this. He urged the Centre to send a team of experts to assess the situation and to make arrangements to run the company. A new board has been formed now (Government deputes respected trio, Jan 12). The chief minister should be praised for his positive thinking and his efforts to control the damage and protect Satyams employees.          
	Yours faithfully,      
N.V.S.N. Murthy, Hyderabad 

                
	Sir  Making the confession and also being apologetic in the resignation letter after fooling investors must have been Ramalinga Rajus ploy to save his skin (Litany of inflated profits and non-existent cash, Jan 8). In the letter, he projected himself as a helpless person. But one should not be deceived again by his suave rhetoric, for if a person can forge the financial statements of his own company for years, could he not lie about the extent of his guilt? His claim that neither he nor his family members removed a single penny from the companys treasury should be investigated too.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Satyams scandal has stunned the nation. However, one heaves a sigh of relief if one recalls that the firm had decided to defer its intended investment in West Bengal in the wake of Mamata Banerjees Singur campaign and Ratan Tatas withdrawal of the Nano project from the state. The future of a few thousands more would have been jeopardized had the firm opened a branch in the state. One now wonders what induced Satyam to take that decision. Was it its fear of West Bengal politics or its own unstable finances?           
	Yours faithfully,      
Arindam Ghosh, Nagpur

                
	Sir  The Satyam scandal has damaged India Inc.s goodwill in the international market. Multinational giants like Swiss Finance Corporation, Morgan Stanley Mauritius and Merrill Lynch Capital sold their shares of Satyam Computers soon after Ramalinga Raju resigned. To add to the sore, Wipro too now admits to have been banned by the World Bank (World Bank ban on Wipro adds to gloom, Jan 12). Fraud in big companies is not new in the international market. The United States of America has borne its own share of misfortune through major financial scandals in establishments like Xerox or Enron. But India is politically and financially not as powerful as the US. So the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the National Association of Software and Services Companies, and the Confederation of Indian Industry should convince the international clients that Satyam does not represent the entire nations ethical standards. Besides running a thorough probe into the fraud, the government must make an effort to regain the trust of the foreign institutional investors. That is the only way to redeem India from this disgrace and save millions of IT and BPO jobs.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  It is not just Satyam Computers but also the much respected profession of chartered accountancy that has fallen into disrepute. Satyam must have hired competent chartered accountants and auditors, all of whom had sworn to ethical conduct before being inducted into their profession. It passes my comprehension how such fraudulent manipulation of the companys accounts and balance sheets, that too on a massive scale, could have been done for years without the active connivance of all these so-called professionals.           
	Yours faithfully,

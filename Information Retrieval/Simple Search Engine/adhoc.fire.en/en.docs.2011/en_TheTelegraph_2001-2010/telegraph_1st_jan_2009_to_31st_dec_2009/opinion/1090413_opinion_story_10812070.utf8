The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | stars go to war
                                                                                                                 STARS GO TO WAR                                                    
	There has been a stable equilibrium between catty reporters and jealous filmstars for as long as one can remember. The simmering war of words between Aamir Khan and Shah Rukh Khan is too well known to need repetition. But this unlikely pair came together last week against a common enemy  owners of multiplexes. Both are so fed up with the peanuts they are getting that they made common cause against the exhibitors. They would like to collect half of what the multiplex-owners are earning from their films. The latter are not unduly perturbed by the combined might of the Khans; they do not see why they should change their current formula, which is known only to them. They say that what they pay film producers varies with box-office receipts: that the more successful a film is, the more they pay. They argue that it is none of their fault that so many films fail, and that they are so large-hearted that they do not make the producers pay them when a film flops. Six months ago, there was a war on another front: all the workers in the film industry from Amitabh Bachchan down had gone on a three-day strike in October. They were protesting against what producers were paying them  and often promising and not paying. Now the producers have persuaded the workers that it is none of their fault  that it is the unreliability and stinginess of the multiplex-owners that make the producers poor paymasters.        
	What these two wars suggest is that suddenly, for the first time in a century, the Indian film industry is hurtling into a depression. None of the players  whether it is actors, cameramen, directors or exhibitors  none understands what is happening to them all, and each is looking for a scapegoat. But the real culprits are not amongst them, they are the film-watchers. They no longer have to go to a multiplex and pay an absurd price for seats; they can stretch out on their settees and watch films on a wide screen at home. They do not have to confine themselves to the old films the television channels dish out; they can go to the neighbourhood video store and borrow a pirated copy of the latest film. In other words, Khan is no longer King; the Khans can stop squabbling about which of them is king. The consumer is the monarch, before whom the rest had better bend their knees.        
	That includes multiplexes. Their audience is not captive either; it has to be lured and seduced to come. Once they understand that, they too will go the way they have in the West. They will become components of malls where visitors get as much entertainment from cruising around and watching fellow-visitors, from eating, drinking and gambolling as they do from watching films.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Not so capital
                                                                                                                 NOT SO CAPITAL                                                    
	For those looking for evidence of sustained green shoots in the economy, the much higher than expected growth in industrial production  the index of industrial production numbers grew 7.8 per cent in June 2009 when most expected it to grow by just 3.8 per cent  was great news. The surprise performance is even greater when industrial production in all other emerging markets and the rest of the world has been declining rapidly, with the exception of China. Investment banks upped their gross domestic product growth estimates for the year to over 7.5 per cent from 6 per cent, and the stock market rocketed. All components of the IIP, from basic through intermediate and consumer goods to capital goods, all grew at a healthy rate. From this to draw the conclusion that the Indian economy is recovering would be premature.         
	Disaggregating the numbers suggests that it seems unclear exactly how that big jump in industrial production was achieved. The IIP can be dissected in two ways. Sectorally, it comprises electricity, mining and manufacturing. Another way of decomposing it is dividing it into basic, intermediate, consumer goods and capital goods. The biggest surprise, and the hardest to explain, is the jump in capital goods. Growth in the production of these goods implies that companies are investing in capacity which, in turn, drives economic growth. The IIP number for capital goods went up by 11.8 per cent, after a three-month contraction and having declined to minus 3.4 per cent in May. Capital goods carry a 10 per cent weight in the IIP, and include almost 50 other sub-components, none of which are easily tracked because of their size relative to the whole IIP. Usually, capital goods growth shows a steady trend, but for over a year now, there has been wide fluctuation, and no one seems to be able to explain the causes satisfactorily.         
	Outside of capital goods, two other sectors have shown greater than average growth: mining and construction. There is a spike in activity in both these sectors ahead of the annual monsoon every year. The weakness of the monsoon in June meant less weather disruption and thus greater activity. The high inventory build-ups in the first two quarters of the fiscal year 2009 led to production cuts in the next two quarters. As inventories got sold, companies began to rebuild inventory in the first quarter of this year, which could be another explanatory factor. Yet, none of these explanations either individually or collectively can account for the 100 per cent jump in industrial output, more so the jump in the capital goods segment. This creates a predicament, because it is not clear if this upsurge in industrial output is sustainable over the next two months or quarters if the recovery in growth is real.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Old Order Returns
                                                                                                                 OLD ORDER RETURNS                                  China Diary -Neha Sahay                              
	Sixty years ago, China, under Mao Zedongs leadership, became a new country, free from foreign as well as feudal rule. The poor peasants, whose centuriesold oppression rivalled the plight of Indias Dalits, became the new masters; the old elite bore the brunt of Maos policies. It wasnt uncommon for rich landowners to be humiliated and even killed by the vanguard of the revolution  the liberated peasants.        
	The wheel has come full circle now. Sometimes, it seems the old order has completely taken over. Incidents wherein the poor are humiliated and even killed for no fault except their refusal to cow down are being reported. Government officials  all of them members of the communist party founded by Mao  are the ones most frequently involved in beating up low-level workers who stand up to them.         
	The attempted rape of a waitress by two officials  one of whom was stabbed to death by her  has already been reported in this column. In another incident, officials beat up a waiter who refused to give them a discount on their food, insisting that the discount card they had did not apply to that establishment. The angry officials pushed him out of the restaurant and kicked him repeatedly even after he fell. When a waitress went to his rescue, they punched her too. All this was caught on the restaurants surveillance camera.        
	But now, even private citizens feel emboldened to pounce on the poor. Last month, a woman was beaten to death in Chongqing by a hotel owner and his employees because she had dared to save her three-year-old son from them. The woman was in the hotel lobby, trying to find customers for the mini-taxi service run by her husband. Meanwhile, her little boy picked a plastic flower from a bowl. He was immediately berated by a female staffer and sent out of the lobby. The mother intervened; it soon degenerated into fisticuffs.                
	Bloody exchange        
	The woman and her son left the place, but were seen late at night, outside the hotel. The woman was again soliciting passengers. At that point, the hotel owner, accompanied by four female staffers, came out and all of them began beating her up. She fell down and was rushed to hospital by her husband who works as a counter clerk at the railway station opposite the hotel. Three hours later, she died. The owner turned himself in the next morning.        
	A week later, the husband received 2,85,000 yuan in compensation from the owners family in return for agreeing not to press criminal charges. The couple, migrants from a nearby province, had another child, aged six. The husband hopes his wifes killer would be punished; but lawyers feel the punishment would be light because he turned himself in and paid compensation.        
	The latest incident of this kind involved Wal Mart employees, and hence has sparked mass outrage. Five employees  four males and one female  of the US giant beat up a customer whom they suspected of shop-lifting. They followed her out of the store and demanded to see her receipt. She did show it to them; but seeing that they were not in the Wal Mart uniform, she snatched it back. That set them upon her. She managed to call her family. Her home was close by, and when her family rushed to the scene, she was already coughing blood. The assailants disappeared as the woman was rushed to hospital. She died two days later. Her brother revealed that she had been a hotel-room cleaner for the last four years, cleaning 16 rooms a day, and was in good health.         
	Wal Mart initially said that the cause of death was under investigation, but later offered 500,000 yuan as compensation, mostly as an allowance for the womans child. The police arrested all five assailants, but released three of them.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Reduced to Dust
                                                                                                                 REDUCED TO DUST                                  MALA FIDE - MALVIKA SINGH                              
	Full-page stories in the newspapers declare that there are only 400 tigers left in this country, which was once the land of the tiger. It is scandalous how we, as a nation, have allowed the open and blatant breaking of statutory Indian laws, and the deviations from the acts passed by Parliament, indulged in by representatives of the Central and state governments whose mandate is to protect, conserve, and prevent transgressions. Complacent babus  in cahoots with greedy land, timber and other mafias who have been busy raping India in the name of development, acting in defiance of the law  have reduced our forests, water-catchment areas and more to dust. With this destruction, we have lost valuable flora and fauna, we have poisoned our rivers, we have transformed a rich and wonderful country into a vast cesspool where diseases and shortages plague our lives and those of our children.         
	The legacy we shall bequeath to the next generation is one that leaves much to be desired. Short-sighted, faulty policies, political diktats meant primarily to extract votes from some bank or the other, administrators operating in denial, turning a blind eye to the endless wrongs, are responsible for the overwhelming pollution of the mind, body, soul and space that has engulfed us. The diminishing number of tigers is symbolic of the fast-approaching state of degradation. A desperate desire to participate in the make-a-quick-buck scheme, regardless of right and wrong, has suffocated true entrepreneurship and good governance, ensuring Indias slow-growth trajectory. In the name of the poor and the disadvantaged, politicians and businessmen have looted the treasures of the forests for their personal aggrandizement. Others in power have handed over vast tracts of such land to schools, universities and institutions another easy way of grabbing land.                
	Passion play        
	Corruption in India is complicated, and tied up in knots with those who make the laws and are expected to enforce them. Those who contest the fraud are hauled up and deemed lawbreakers. That is the sad truth in India. Till date, no national leader has had the gumption to stand up and denounce the wrong by staunchly defending that which is right and within the law. Creating new addenda to existing environmental laws, thus bringing forth another interpretation of the existing rule, for instance, is one of the ways in which the authorities beat the laws they have formulated themselves. In the process, they have poisoned our natural lungs, and with their bad decisions have ensured that the life-giving, abundant rivers become thin streams breeding killer bacteria. Why is there no accountability?        
	Swine flu is the current obsession of the electronic media. At the rate we are destroying our natural environment, the new flu and its various mutations will take the death toll to unimaginable proportions in the near future. Undrinkable water, disease and more will pervade India. Water will stop first in the highrises, in the Americanized habitats affluent people have created without adequate infrastructure, or for that matter, without careful thought and planning. How come the media do not debate and discuss these fundamental issues while they are so obviously interested in the sensational superficial stuff they peddle?        
	Those in power and others who wield influence in those supposedly exalted but actually sterile, isolated and insular quarters, will have to face the wrath of a long exploited nation. The restoration will happen at some point. But why does our leadership not have the passion to start the renewal? Why this protection of all that is illegal, wrong and inappropriate? Why are they not excited by the challenge of real change? Why are they so uninspired? Where is the passion?

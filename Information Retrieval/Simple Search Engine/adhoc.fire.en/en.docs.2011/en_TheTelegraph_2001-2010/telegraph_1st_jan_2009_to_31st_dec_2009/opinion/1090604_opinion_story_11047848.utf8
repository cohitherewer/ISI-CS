                                                                                                                 HONOURABLE MEMBERS                          - Britain urgently needs to clean up its House of Commons        Westminster Gleanings - Anabel Loyd                          Playing favourites                                              
	I was disappointed not to find a good excuse to be in India during the elections, but with several of our better known historians and authors adding scholarly commentary to the already swollen ranks of British journalists following the campaign, the market for writers was oversubscribed. Nobody, however, predicted quite the result that has been achieved and, as we scuttle like dung beetles in the political and economic mire here, we look with some envy towards an optimistic India where a consolidation of political continuity may enable the government in the battle against political corruption and poverty and boost the country out of the pit of global economic depression.        
	We badly need an election here, although the events of the last few weeks have hardly encouraged the electorate to get out and vote at all, and the prime minister looks set to hang on to the last rags of his government. There is not much to be said about our members of parliament that has not been emblazoned in huge headlines over the past weeks as the fourth estate does its work to hideous effect. The level of corruption and the numbers of MPs on the take have come as a massive shock to a public that had, whatever its political fealty or complaint, generally assumed that Honourable members were just that. It seems that much of the problem has been that the Fees Office of the House of Commons, the accounting office for MPs expenses, had also assumed that to be the case. And it had not checked expenses that appeared to be within a set of all too unclear rules.              
	We are not all complete innocents, convinced of the saintliness of our democratic representatives or caring much whether they are particularly nice or quite nasty, but we had imagined a certain level of probity that does in reality exist in many cases that have been entirely overshadowed by the dishonesty now revealed. It could not have happened at a worse time. The government is beleaguered and barely led, the economy is in pieces and ordinary people are hurting badly. Talk of MPs claims for the cleaning of castle moats and floating islands for duckponds is beyond most peoples imagination, but tricky machinations over mortgage payments and, oddly enough, the use of taxpayers money for groceries and disposable nappies, huge essential costs to struggling young families, have twisted the knife.         
	Our politicians have traditionally lived by the spirit rather than the letter of the law. It worked of course in the days when MPs were generally of independent wealth and came to parliament to serve their country. Not that they were never serving themselves too, but usually more to gain power than cash. Old Labour MPs came from working-class backgrounds and were supported by the trade unions; they would no more have taken money that was not their due than fly over the moon. Parliamentary pay has always been a hot potato; it was vital for representative democracy that men and women without personal means could enter parliament and, in the end, it has been a fear of MPs being seen to be well-paid fat cats that has fostered the current situation where hidden expenses made up the shortfall for generally hard-working individuals who, to serve their constituents and their country successfully, had to live in two places and uphold a suitable image of British respectability in both.        
	How and where the rot started is a moot point: Margaret Thatchers fostering of a society of greed, the growth of political careerism, very bright young men and women entering parliament as their primary career when their contemporaries where making millions in parallel lives in the private sphere, the spread of a sort of middle ground of MPs with few of the loyalties of either the grandees or the workers and who wanted it all, also encouraged during the Eighties and finding its apotheosis under New Labour. These were the ambitious men and women with whose expense accounts the parliamentary rules of a less competitive time, a more honourable tradition and the badly policed Fees Office were ill-equipped to deal.        
	So, we need an election to clear out the rotten wood and rectify a situation that has already gone on far too long and too disastrously with an appointed, not elected, prime minister, who has proved that he lacks the ability to lead and at whose door we can lay a good deal of blame for current economic woes, the fruits of his policies as chancellor of the exchequer. David Cameron is coming on strong, dumping Conservative MPs who have been seen to bend the rules excessively, some of whom the products, too, of traditions that allow them no excuse for their behaviour. Others will be deselected by furious constituency associations as will members from other parties.         
	New and untried candidates may persuade voters in their favour, but they will still have a lot to prove and from now on parliament will be forced to live by the rules in a way that has never been previously seen to be necessary. Whether we want Cameron as prime minister is another question. He comes from an old-style Conservative background that some in the country will consider a relief in the present situation. But for others he will be seen as a step backwards, and that a divisive one, to the days of privileged Old Etonian leaders smugly cushioned by wealth and background from the vicissitudes of ordinary lives.        
	Small parties, including the most extreme right, are laughing all over their faces, largely because they havent actually got members in parliament to join in any of the scandals. The fact is that the appalling British National Party barely operates inside the law of the land in terms of its racist policies and slogans, and the United Kingdom Independence Party has a former member of the European parliament in prison on benefit fraud. In the end, while the Liberal Democrat Party, number three in the country, may swell its parliamentary ranks from other parties as has happened before, the disaffected, barring the lunatic fringe, are unlikely to vote in any great numbers for the extremists. The last thing we want is something nastier than what we already have.              
	The Speaker of the House of Commons has, to everyones great relief as one of the most unpopular and ineffective ever holders of the office, fallen on his sword and will be the first Speaker to leave office involuntarily since 1695. His own expense claims do not bear close scrutiny, but he is going for his lack of leadership, his lack of care for MPs and at the same time his blindness, designed or otherwise, to the growing culture of corruption in the House of Commons. In theory, he is sticking around for another month to help start the clean-up, but he would be better out straight away so that a new broom can be seen to be sweeping out the dirt. Senior members of the government are implicated in a variety of housing and mortgage scandals, and should remove themselves rapidly too, but Gordon Brown is playing favourites there and, as light relief, the government has been routed by an actress  admittedly Joanna Lumley is a national treasure and a highly articulate advocate  over the question of retired Gurkhas rights to live in this country. Hooray for that, but the image of our current shilly-shallying legislative process has suffered further, the opposition have scored a few points for supporting Lumley, and the cup of respect for this government is empty. What to do?        
	We have to have an election to clear the decks at least and begin afresh. There can be no confidence in the country internationally as this beaten and battered administration limps on to the end, and no confidence within the country in the abilities of our politicians to do anything more than feather their own nests while the economy bumps along the bottom. More jobs are lost by the day and people are dispirited, disenchanted and depressed. The last possible date for the next general election is not for another year, the doom-mongers predictions of civil disturbance may well come to pass before then.

                                                                                                                 TERROR RIDE                                                     
	The sanity of a society is often tested in unusual ways. The hold-up of the Rajdhani Express on Tuesday has forced such a test on not just the political class but also on the people at large. There is only one way in which a sane society can react to the incident  by condemning it in no uncertain terms. Any attempt to dilute the condemnation by referring to the demands of the trains hijackers can only be irresponsible. Dissent and protests are part of a thriving, democratic system. But what the hijackers did does not qualify as democratic dissent or even civilized behaviour. Endangering the lives of several hundred innocent people and forcing them to suffer hours of physical and mental agony cannot conceivably be part of any strategy for any democratic agitation. The Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities, which publicly claimed responsibility for the train hold-up, has often been accused of Maoist links. The incident is irrefutable evidence of the fact that the outfits leadership has been taken over by the Maoists. It also shows that the rebels can engage in political polemics but actually act like a terror group.         
	It is not enough, though, to simply condemn the Maoists or those who act as their people in mass fronts. A more important lesson from the incident is for the political class. It is not uncommon for political polarizations to sharpen in certain situations or over some issues. West Bengal currently faces a situation in which the ruling leftists and their opponents are increasingly taking to violent means in order to extend or defend their political territories. The terror on the train should now awaken them to the limits of this vicious strategy. Political violence rarely stays limited to the parties and their activists; it threatens the lives of ordinary people in unpredictable ways. It must be a dangerous situation if the peoples own elected representatives act like their worst tormentors. The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government has rightly refused to give in to the train hijackers demand for the release of the PCAPA leader, Chhatradhar Mahato. But the train hold-up has a message for leaders of all political parties. They must realize that the Maoists threaten not only the government of the day but also the entire democratic system. Using terror groups for narrow gains can be as costly as not fighting them in right earnest and at the right time.

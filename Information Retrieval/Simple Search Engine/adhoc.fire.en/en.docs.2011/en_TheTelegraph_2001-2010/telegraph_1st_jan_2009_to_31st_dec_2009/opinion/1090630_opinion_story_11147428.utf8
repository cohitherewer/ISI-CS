                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Come soon                  
	Sir News of a delayed monsoon and below-normal rainfall this year in India is troubling for all of us (Rain scare for breadbasket, June 25). With the precarious condition of water supply in cities and the drying up of the water table in rural areas, we are in for difficult times. A late monsoon will defer the sowing of kharif crop seeds, resulting in a late harvest. Prices will soar as demand requirements exceed supply.           
	Farmers debt will increase and they will ask for governmental intervention, which, in turn, will affect the way the next Union budget is formulated. Inflation will probably rise again. Power cuts may become an everyday affair all over the country. Since electricity tariffs for domestic and commercial users are likely to witness an increase very soon, costs of industrial products will also rise. This will add to the woes of the consumers at a time when recession is already taking its toll on them. Overall, the situation appears grim and gloomy.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Ashok Jayaram, Bangalore 

                
	Sir  Agricultural operations in large parts of our country are fully dependent on the monsoon. Many a time, the country is faced with difficulties due to inadequate rainfall, as it is happening this year. A permanent solution to this problem would be to store rainwater. Our forefathers, with great foresight, had done this in many parts of the country by digging lakes and tanks. Unfortunately, most of these have become shallow and dry today.           
	Even when there is water, the lakes are usually choked with weeds and vegetation as a consequence of decades of neglect. If every state government undertakes programmes to de-silt and deepen these lakes and tanks, and clears them of weeds, then these water bodies can become a dependable source of water for the people who live in their proximity. Cleaning the tanks periodically will also keep the water table high which will be beneficial for irrigation. The Central government could monitor these water management programmes.           
	Yours faithfully,      
S. Chidambaresa Iyer, Mumbai

                
	Sir  We are anxious about a late monsoon. But if total rainfall comes to around 95 per cent of normal rainfall, as predicted, then there is not much to worry about. It has been observed that in a cycle of five years, India gets two years of heavy rainfall, two years of below-normal rainfall and only a year of normal rainfall. The government must plan on the basis of this pattern . Furthermore, in recent years, the entire cycle of seasons has advanced by 15 days to one month. Hence the monsoons one-month delay is not unusual.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Mahesh Kapasi, New Delhi

	Sir  I am 78 years old. Today, I sent my man to lodge a complaint with the Calcutta Municipal Corporation about the low pressure of filtered water supplied to Suhasini Ganguly Sarani, where I live, along with a request for cleaning the ferrule. I found that there is no telephone in the corporation office and no complaint number is given to the complainant. The letter of complaint I sent was registered in a book by the complainant himself. There is no way one can make sure whether action has been taken on the basis of the complaint unless the complainant personally goes over to the office. There is also no system to officially acknowledge the duplicate copy of the complaint letter. The CMC might take a leaf out of the book of the Calcutta Electric Supply Corporation in this regard. A complaint may be registered with the CESC over the phone and a follow-up on the basis of the complaint number is also possible. Last year, I had written a letter to the mayor expressing my grievances about the malfunctioning of major departments of the CMC, but to no avail.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Dhriti Kanta Lahiri Choudhury, Calcutta

                
	Sir  A few weeks ago, the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai had decreased water supply in Mumbai by 10 per cent and again on June 19, by a further 10 per cent. In a span of just two weeks, the MCGM has thus cut water supply by 20 per cent. And this when Mumbai, especially its pockets in the suburbs, has been facing water shortage for the last five years.           
	The problem of water shortage has arisen in Mumbai not because of lowered water level in the sources but because during the last 15 years, the Maharashtra government has been steadily increasing the high floor space index granted to constructors. The Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority and the Slum Rehabilitation Authority are also carrying out innumerable projects. The builders of Mumbai fund the politicians, and the politicians reciprocate by passing laws in their favour. If this builder-politician nexus is not broken, more and more buildings will pop up in Mumbai and the citizens will be faced with acute water shortage.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Paul DSouza, Mumbai 

                
	Parting shot          
	Sir  In the report, Party and govt in need of cure, under the subhead, Wanted: a makeover for Bengal ministry (June 19), an official of the department of commerce and industries, while reacting to the performance of the minister in charge o f this department, Nirupam Sen, is quoted as saying, The chief ministers repeated emphasis on industry initiatives is likely to suffer because of Sens frequent indisposition but the CPM cant afford to knock down a politburo member. We would like to state here that none of the senior officials of the department of commerce and industries  the principal secretary, the special secretary or any of the joint secretaries  was contacted by the reporter for their reaction to be incorporated into the article. The view attributed to an official of this department therefore does not, in any way, represent that of the department on the issue, and is denied.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Jiban Ch. Chakraborty, Joint Secretary to the Government of West Bengal, Commerce amp; Industries Department

                
	The Telegraph stands by its story and the quotation in it about Nirupam Sen. Journalistic ethics prevent us from revealing our sources.          
	 The Editor

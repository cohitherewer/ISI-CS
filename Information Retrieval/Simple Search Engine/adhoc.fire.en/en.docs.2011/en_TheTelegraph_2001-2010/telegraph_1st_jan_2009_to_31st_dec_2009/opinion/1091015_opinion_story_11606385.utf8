The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Letters to Editor
                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Flip side                  
	Sir  The editorial, Growing pains (Oct 1), says with admiration that Not even the worst critics of Chinas communist rulers would deny them credit for its stunning economic success. Stories of such stunning economic success of the communist giant, Russia, were popular from the late Forties till the Soviet Unions collapse in the Nineties. Everything in communist Russia then was perceived as spectacular  bigger, brighter, better and taller  than in the United States of America , Russias main rival, which it was determined to beat in every aspect of development. Tragically, Russia, with more geographical space and almost the same population as that of the US, could not match the American standard of living. It soon collapsed like ninepins.           
	Similar praise is now being heaped upon China, as proved by the observations made in the editorial. But it may not be appropriate to call Chinas progress stunning. It is true that China, with its torture and tyranny, has progressed more than India  Indias per capita gross domestic product at purchasing power parity is almost half of Chinas according to the list published by the International Monetary Fund. But doing better than India does not mean stunning. India too has done better than many countries of, say, Africa. But does that mean India has made spectacular progress?           
	Then again, can it be said with certainty that without communism, which bans the right to dissent, China would not have developed? Many countries have developed even with slavery and colonialism, which, of course, cannot be praised as aids to development. True development, after all, must have a human face.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The editorial, Growing pains, classified Pakistan, Iran, North Korea and Sudan as rogue states, but did not mention India. The latter has carved a permanent niche for itself in the highest levels of the worlds corruption index, as Malvika Singh clearly brings out in her article, Spin out of control, (Oct 2). The editorial should have provided the exact definition of the word, rogue. Should the US and the United Kingdom not be considered rogues for invading Iraq and Afghanistan, thus boosting imperialism? The only way a country can save itself from being invaded by these superpowers is by building a nuclear arsenal, as Iran and North Korea have done.          
	Indias record of human rights abuse is rather high too. Repeated attacks on Sikhs, Muslims, Christians and Dalits confirm the existence of State-sponsored terrorism in this country. Moreover, Indian politicians sometimes protect convicted criminals to appease their voters. India has implemented very few counter-terrorism measures till date. As a result, its citizens continue to be slaughtered since the past two decades. All that the leaders do is make false promises while ensuring their own security. How long will Indians accept this? The growing discontent of Indians may actually be one of the reasons behind the success of the Maoist movement.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Wrong message          
	Sir  As the article, Wake up and smell the fear (Oct 3), points out, some politicians in Maharashtra are making an issue of the insignificant subject of using the older name of the states capital in Karan Johars film, and are violently attacking the film industry on this pretext. The Maharashtra Navnirman Senas resentment towards the film, Wake up Sid, followed by the protests, and then a formal settlement between the MNS leader, Raj Thackeray, and Karan Johar in the form of an apology have all been ignored by the states disciplinary body. This has sent a wrong message to these ruffians that it is legitimate for them to raise hell over the mere use of Mumbais old name.          
	The MNS thinks that it is proper to drive people from other states out of Mumbai. But could it save its own people from starvation? Could it display its patriotism by fighting the terrorists who caused the Mumbai massacre? Instead of doing anything constructive for the state, all that the party does is blow its own trumpet. The party that goes by the name of Maharashtra Navnirman Sena should involve itself in a serious effort to rebuild the state. It should rise over regional sentiments to achieve a national identity.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Himanish, Singapore 

                
	Sir  It is unfortunate that the MNS forced the filmmaker, Karan Johar, to apologize for a dialogue in his latest film, Wake up Sid, in which the city of Mumbai was referred to as Bombay. The Bollywood filmmakers should be strong enough to take up challenges and make films on controversial or sensitive issues. Petty political parties, which are trying to curb the filmmakers efforts, are only interested in playing with peoples feelings and exploiting them in order to win elections. They act against national interest, and do more harm than good to ordinary citizens. Bollywood must face these politicians with courage, and show the truth fearlessly.           
	To protect their own ideals, and for the sake of justice, filmmakers should refrain from surrendering to the whims of selfish politicians. It is true that the consideration of monetary factors often prevents filmmakers from acting freely. They should learn to rise above commercial interests.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Mahesh Kumar, New Delhi

                
	Parting shot          
	Sir  The high salaries drawn by chief executive officers in India have become an issue of discord between the CEOs and the government (PM rules out CEO salary cap, Oct 12). CEOs are paid well despite the downturn because their companies are making profit. This is fair enough. If the salaries of CEOs are to be questioned then the profits the netas make can also be seen as unfair. The government should cut the ministers salaries before targeting the CEOs.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Punit Mishra, Ghaziabad

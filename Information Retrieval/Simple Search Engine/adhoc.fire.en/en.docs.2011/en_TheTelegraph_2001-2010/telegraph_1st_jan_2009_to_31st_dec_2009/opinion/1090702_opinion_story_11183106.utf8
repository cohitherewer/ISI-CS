	The appointment of Nandan Nilekani to head the project to give every Indian citizen a unique biometric identity card has tended to deflect attention from a genuine debate regarding the project itself. Like the curates egg, the idea of a unique biometric identity card is good only in parts. Used properly, such cards could lead to the reduction of frauds and result in greater transparency. Theoretically, it could also facilitate the better delivery of social security benefits. The word, theoretically, is used deliberately since not many such benefits exist in India, especially among the section of the population that most needs such benefits. There is also no doubt that the project will give an enormous stimulus to the Indian information technology sector and this will have some cascading effects. It could also result in the empowerment of citizens and thus make governments more accountable. But these positive aspects cannot eradicate all doubts about the scheme. A question that arises immediately concerns logistics: how far will it be possible to implement the scheme in a vast country like India with its variegated population? Will the poor and the uneducated understand the value of such a card and be able to use it to their advantage?        
	More profound problems lurk behind the grand project. Once in place, the unique biometric card could dramatically alter the nature and the character of the State by extending its reach and its powers of intervention into the lives of citizens. A large element of surveillance is, in fact, embedded in modern regimes of power. But a democratic polity has to work actively to check and counteract such propensities of surveillance because they run counter to libertarian principles. As philosophers of liberty have pointed out, there should be spheres of activity which should remain outside the interference and the surveillance of the State. The proposed card will enhance the powers of the State to know more about citizens lives and activities. It is nowhere clear what checks and balances will be put in place to guarantee that the State will not unnecessarily intervene and that it will not record information without the prior consent of the citizen concerned. The plea of national security should not be used, since there already exist other methods to preserve Indias security. These worries and concerns should temper the enthusiasm about the proposed project.

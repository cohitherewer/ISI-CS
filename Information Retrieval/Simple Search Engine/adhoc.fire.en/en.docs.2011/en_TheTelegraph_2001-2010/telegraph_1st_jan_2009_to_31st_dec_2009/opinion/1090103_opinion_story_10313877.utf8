	Diplomacy over patriotism                  
	Sir  Ashok V. Desai has exposed the nexus of criminals, police and politicians, and the inability of our judiciary to deal with this menace (Some other reactions, Dec 30). In India, we have socialism, under which all sorts co-exist. Every search for a solution leads the trail back to our rulers. The murder of an engineer, who refused to fund Mayavatis birthday bash, shows the depth of corruption here. It is human nature to play things safe. Be it politicians or the aam admi, everyone prefers diplomacy to patriotism.          
	Yours faithfully,        Tapas Biswas, Calcutta
        
	Not human          
	Sir  The report about the death of a patient, Kanak Kumar Auddy, at the Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital after he was allegedly left untreated for two hours as his relatives fell Rs 50 short of the admission fee, serves to reinforce the widely held notion that government hospitals are run by people for whom words like compassion or service have no meaning (Denied bed for Rs 50, patient dies, Dec 28). It is surprising that despite a standing order to all state-run hospitals to start treatment of critically ill patients even if their relatives cannot pay the admission fee, some of the hospital staff declined to admit Auddy. It is needless to blame the hospital authorities alone for negligence. The state health minister must also accept responsibility for the way hospital officials all over West Bengal treat patients. If he is unable to discipline the hospital staff, he should put in his papers. That would be the most honourable course of action for him under the present circumstances.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The ward master at the Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital refused to admit Kanak Kumar Auddy despite frantic requests from his family. As horrific as this incident sounds, the feud between the medical superintendent at the hospital, S.K. Saha, and the director of medical education, S.N. Banerjee, following the patients demise, is even more incredible. While Banerjee asserts that there is a standing order in state-run hospitals making it mandatory to initiate treatment of patients even if their family cannot pay the admission fee, Saha has defended the hospital staff by saying that the fee must always be paid. Obviously, both these high-ranking medical officers cannot be right at the same time.           
	All doctors must take the Hippocratic Oath, which says that the foremost concern of all healers is to provide treatment to patients, and any financial consideration is secondary. Members of the Indian medical community today are probably oblivious of the oath they take when they start practice. Saha not only went against the ethics of his profession, but by refusing to admit Auddy he also flouted the standing order of which Banerjee speaks. As such, Saha is guilty.           
	The state health department has promptly ordered a probe into Auddys death. It is common knowledge that these probes are just eyewash, intended to quell the fury of the victims family for the time being. Despite frequent news of medical negligence, how many delinquent doctors have been taken to task till date? Radical changes in the state healthcare system are necessary if peoples trust in it is to be restored.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Kunal Saha, Columbus, US 

                
	Sir  The hospital authorities at the Calcutta National Medical College, could not, of course, bend the rules for an ordinary citizen like Kanak Kumar Auddy and admit him if his relatives did not have the money needed for a paid bed. In India, all rules apply only to common men and they can be broken with impunity for powerful or moneyed people.                     
	Yours faithfully,

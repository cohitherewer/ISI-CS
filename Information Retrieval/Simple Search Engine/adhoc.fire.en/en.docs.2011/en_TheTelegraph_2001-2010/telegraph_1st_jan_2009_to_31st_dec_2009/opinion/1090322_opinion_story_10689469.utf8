	Inflated satisfaction                  
	Sir  Inflation is nearing zero (Inflation near zero but food bites, March 20). No one can be happy at this downward rate because at the same time food prices are rising way beyond the reach of common people. The calculation of the inflation rate seems to be ridiculous, since towards zero has no meaning in this context. Inflation may be seen in two ways: the actual rate and the price of foodstuff. The second one will reflect how the common man is suffering because of the high prices of food.                    
	Yours faithfully,         Sudarsan Nandi, Midnapore 
                  
	Almost terminal          
	Sir  A bus terminus as filthy as the one adjacent to the Howrah Station is rare in any city of international standing. The entire terminus is almost wholly occupied by stalls or by hawkers illegally selling tea, fruits, fast food, pan masala and so on. Members of the stallowners families and other people live in the sheds. They cook there and litter the space with their clothes, household items, bed-rolls and so on. There is dirty water, mud, food waste, plastic bags and urine all around.          
	One would find it impossible to walk through the place, especially during the rainy season. Bus drivers, conductors and stall owners urinate openly in the shed and on the pavement. The stench is impossible. For the past 10 to 15 years I have not seen the bus stand being cleaned. One is not sure which civic authority is responsible for its upkeep  the public works department, the urban development ministry or the municipal corporation. However, it is time some initiative was taken to maintain the depot.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The Calcutta Municipal Corporation seems to pay little attention to the public in its Behala office on Diamond Harbour Road. The counters for the receipt of property tax open at 11 am. On June 11, 2008, when I reached the office at about 10.50 am for the payment, there were two long queues already  one for senior citizens and the other for the rest. I chose the former because I belong to that privileged category.           
	However, I managed to make my payment only at 1.20 pm. This was because only one counter was opened for senior citizens while payments were being accepted by three or four counters for the rest. Although the number of senior citizens was far lower than that of the others, they did not deserve to have only one counter to make their payments. Strangely, there were two more counters open, but they remained idle because they were not assigned work. It was apparent that a matter of public convenience had been left without supervision.           
	In contrast, when I had to pay a similar tax at the New Alipore office on May 6, 2008, my experience was altogether different. I reached a little after 10.30 am and found, to my pleasant surprise, that one counter had already opened  I was told since 10 am  one hour before schedule because of the expected rush. There was only one queue and I could still complete payment by about 11.05 am.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Noise and air pollution, the destruction of greenery, lawlessness  all seem to have become the distinguishing features of Calcutta. I was thus surprised at the prompt action taken by the Lalbazar and the Bhowanipore police stations after I complained to them by telephone about the disturbance caused by loudspeakers. Taxi drivers in my locality were agitating for some reason and the noise of speeches made on the microphone continued till late into the night. After I complained, the noise was reduced. I would like to thank the Calcutta Police for this.                     
	Yours faithfully,

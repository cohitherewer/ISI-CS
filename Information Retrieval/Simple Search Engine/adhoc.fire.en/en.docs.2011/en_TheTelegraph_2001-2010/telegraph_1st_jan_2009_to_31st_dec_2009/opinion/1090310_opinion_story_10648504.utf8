                                                                                                                 BUDDING THIRD                                                    
	The first wind of spring seems to have caught the buds of the third front of Indian politics. The dramatic departure of Naveen Patnaik from the alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party has made this possible. It was becoming clear over the last few months that the chief minister of Orissa and his party, the Biju Janata Dal, were uncomfortable with the BJP and its policies. To be fair to Mr Patnaik, he had made no secret of his discomfiture regarding the attitudes of the BJP towards certain critical issues that affected his state and the country. The immediate result of the divorce between the BJP and BJD has been the opening up of the possibility of a different kind of partnership. The leadership of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) began talking to Mr Patnaik about the prospects of a pre-poll alliance in Orissa. This dialogue has obvious ramifications since Prakash Karat, the general secretary of the CPI(M), has been working overtime to create a non-Congress-non-BJP political forum, which has come to be dubbed as the third front of Indian politics. To his credit, Mr Karat has been successful in winning over Chandrababu Naidu and the Telugu Desam Party. Mr Patnaik will further enhance the range of the third-front bouquet.        
	The emergence of the third front is at the cost of the National Democratic Alliance, which is now a coalition only in name. The collapse of the NDA can only be attributed to the BJPs failure to fashion itself as an inclusive party capable of appealing to all sections and communities of Indian society. Muslims and Christians have been the victims of the sangh parivars Hindu fundamentalism and the BJP has failed to come out in strong condemnation of such outrages. It has remained committed to playing the Hindutva card. This has made leaders like Mr Patnaik and Mr Naidu, who have no communal colours to wear, apprehensive of continuing their association with the BJP whose leadership did nothing to assuage those fears. Away from communal issues, the BJP has revealed itself to be a party without any moorings. Nowhere was this more manifest than in the BJPs opposition to the Indo-US nuclear deal. This opposition was nothing more than a piece of sheer opportunism since the BJP has no history of being anti-United States of America. It is too early to predict the full flowering of the third front, but the BJPs isolation on the political stage is becoming all too evident.

	Too good to be true                  
	Sir  The results of this years Indian School Certificate examinations were revealing. It was astounding to see so many score highly in the languages. The scores in English have been next to impossible. How can anyone lose just 1 or 2 marks in essay-type answers of 25 marks? Students must have got almost full marks for subjective answers in these papers. It may be possible to score highly in the sciences, but how is this possible in the language papers? This is unjust on students of previous years who may have been as deserving but were unfortunately not marked by such generous examiners.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Sudeshna Mitra, Calcutta

      
	Lost the touch          
	Sir  The Communist Party of India (Marxist) state committee meeting seemed to have ended inconclusively. (Land impact on CMs lips May 25). The CPI(M) is still in doubt whether it lost the recent Lok Sabha elections because of its withdrawal of support to the Central government or owing to local factors. It can be safely said that both these factors contributed to the failure of the CPI(M).           
	The reasons cited by the party for its withdrawal of support to the United Progressive Alliance government failed to impress the common people. In the local front, more than the much-emphasized land acquisition issue, the partys failure to stay in touch with the people and the arrogance and bias displayed by its local leaders annoyed the common man. This seems to have been responsible for the debacle.           
	The image of a harassed, dull and incompetent administration baffled and scared the people. Therefore, they chose to look at the alternative. The electoral gain of the Trinamul Congress-led Opposition was largely due to the negative votes cast against the ruling front.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
S. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta              
	Sir  The chief minister of West Bengal has admitted that the governments style of functioning has to change to make it more accountable to poor people. This is justified, as its earlier style of functioning over-pampered the bureaucracy and seemed to favour a particular state department over the others.           
	Any reconciliatory measure to make the government proactive and responsive should start from narrowing the psychological and financial divide between the various government departments.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Md. Motleb Ali, Calcutta

                          
	When healing hurts          
	Sir  Instances of medical negligence in Indian hospitals and nursing homes have become a routine affair these days. A young mother with no apparent previous ailment died from alleged malpractice two days after giving birth to a child at the Max hospital in Delhi (Neglect cry in mother death, May 24). A preliminary post-mortem report has failed to identify the exact cause of death. Of course, the hospital has denied all allegations of negligence but has assured that an internal inquiry would be conducted in a transparent manner.           
	The leaders of the medical community frequently claim that the entire medical fraternity is accused of negligence only because of a few bad apples. But there is no useful system to identify and punish the errant doctors.          
	The mutual trust that used to exist between doctors and patients in India has been deeply eroded in recent times. A mere assurance of an impartial internal investigation by the hospital authority after each allegation is not going to restore that trust. In order to reinstate public confidence, medical authorities would have to stop shielding their wayward colleagues.          
	Yours faithfully,         Kunal Saha,Ohio, US

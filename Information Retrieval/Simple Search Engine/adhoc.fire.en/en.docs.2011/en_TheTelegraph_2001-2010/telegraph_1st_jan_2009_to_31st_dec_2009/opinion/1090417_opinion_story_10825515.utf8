										      BOOKWISE                        Bad strategy				                           
	Lets begin with a true story. For nearly 10 years, between 1975 and 1985, Macmillan India ran a Hindi publishing unit for tertiary level textbooks. Most of the books published were translations of standard English texts in wide use in universities and colleges, with a few originals thrown in. An impressive list of over 100 titles was published, including A.R. Desais Social Background of Indian Nationalism, Harold Laskis Grammar of Politics, some sections of R.C. Majumdars Advanced History of India and so on with an investment of about 15-20 crores. The programme was wound up because the books didnt sell.        
	In a painful post-mortem, three basic reasons were attributed to the failure: first, the wrong titles were published or the translations were poor; second, the prices were too high for a price-sensitive market and the trade terms (discounts and credits) unattractive; and third, the marketing and sales teams didnt do their job. There could be some truth in each of these cases, but these are the standard excuses for failure of any publishing programme. But far more fundamental was the intellectual apathy that Macmillan encountered in the Hindi heartland  UP, Bihar, MP, Rajasthan and parts of Haryana. Teachers who are the catalysts for recommending texts were simply not interested because students made do with pass notes and guides. And in the absence of academic support, booksellers continued stocking English-language titles. It is against this background that we need to examine Mulayam Singhs threat to make English a non-compulsory subject, along with a ban on computers in work places because they rob clerks of jobs. Of course, pre-poll promises are just so much wind but the threat could have the effect of downgrading the importance of English in schools and with it, in all science subjects.         
	Hence, some disturbing questions arise. What happens to students whose basic aim is to get a job at the end of the day? Is it possible to give a modicum of primary and secondary education that would prepare them for school leaving and beyond without a working knowledge of English? Or to teach science subjects without English and shun computer applications without which nothing can move these days  from e-tickets for airlines and railways to accounting, design, layout and much else?         
	Look at the overall education scenario to see whether a future without English can work. Primary education up to the fifth standard can be taught in Hindi provided there are trained teachers to do so, though some elementary texts would be a useful supplement. Secondary education (classes 6-8), too, can be done at a pinch, but basically only in the social sciences. What are available (not always easily because of poor distribution and the numbers involved) are NCERT texts which are, by any standard, much better than what private publishers have to offer.         
	The real problem arises at the end of Class 10 when students have to choose their specialization among Arts, Commerce and Science. What are available in Hindi are NCERT textbooks, but these are simply not enough to help students pass competitive examinations or qualify for professional courses like Accountancy, Medicine and Engineering. NCERT texts have to be supplemented with other books or private coaching institutes that prepare notes from standard English texts. Let it be said, loud and clear, that without a reasonable working knowledge of English, a student is doomed, especially in the professional world.        
	But at the end of the day, what matters is a job. Can students who do not know English find a reasonable job for themselves? They can, in narrow specialized areas in the Hindi heartland; they cannot in the wider market of business, commerce and, of course, the professions. The man-on-the street realizes this and hence the mushrooming of English-teaching institutes in small-town India. Perhaps Mulayam Singh and his supporters dont realize that even a waiter in the hospitality business is required to know two simple English words thank you and sorry.       RAVI VYAS

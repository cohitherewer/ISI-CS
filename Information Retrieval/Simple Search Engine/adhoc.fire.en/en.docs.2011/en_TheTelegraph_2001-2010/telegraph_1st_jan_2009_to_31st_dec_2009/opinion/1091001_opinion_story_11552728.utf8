The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Forgotten storyteller
                                                                                                                 FORGOTTEN STORYTELLER                          - The many dimensions of T.N. Mukherjee        Tapas Majumdar                                                  
	I have said this before and am saying it again. We are a remarkably forgetful nation. Some of our greats we remember on their birthdays. Tagore is very special in our lives, so we remember the poet twice a year on his birthday and death anniversary. And, of course, since he almost created the modern Bengali language, we find ourselves using his words several times in a day. But many of the rest will be forgotten  those who could also make us feel proud if we only remembered them.         
	All this possibly gives us a guilt complex of a special kind, and we compensate by renaming streets and lanes after people. However, the important point is not that we still continue to use the old names for a long long time, as one of The Telegraphs correspondents has rightly pointed out. There is a more tragic fate awaiting the new names. Very soon some of the persons we honour today will be forgotten. After all, whats in a name? Who remembers today who Choku Khansama or Kalidas Patitundi were?        
	All this crossed my mind when I saw that at long last, Trailokyanath Mukherjees A Visit to Europe, published in 1889 and translated into Bengali by Parimal Goswami only eighty years later, has been republished this year in Bengali with annotations. My heart leapt for joy and I am eagerly waiting to see the Bengali edition but, frankly, I also feel a bit apprehensive, for the words of approbation in the publishers notice are as follows, in my translation, The readers will surely taste the flavour of traveling in Europe in the late 19th century, looking at it through the sharp eyes of Trailokyanath. I have not read the book, but the notice did not bear any testimony to the original purpose of Mukherjees travels in Europe.               
	Did they know who this man was? He was not only the creator of a new genre of Bengali literature, he was also a pioneer in the study of Indias industrial evolution in the 19th century, as D.R. Gadgil had described the phenomenon in his book of 1920. T.N. Mukherjee  that is the name by which the Western world knew him  was, of course, much more than that. It would be sufficient to say here that he organized the famous international exhibition of Indian industrial products in Calcutta in 1883 where he was reportedly awarded a medal by the visiting Russian tsarevich. Mukherjee also created a descriptive catalogue of Indian produce contributed to the Amsterdam exhibition of 1883. He was quite possibly responsible for organizing the Indian portion of the 1886 colonial and Indian exhibition in London at the height of Queen Victorias reign.         
	Trailokyanath was nothing if not versatile. Many years later, he would be giving evidence before the International Opium Commission on the different kinds of addiction to opium and the consequences. He was considered by the English to be their expert on narcotics. One has to remember that Mukherjee was considered an authority on Indias trade channels, both open and clandestine, with the rest of the world. At that time, of course, India was the largest supplier of opium and opium products to the world.         
	In the course of his duties, Mukherjee must have travelled through Europe not once, but several times. Apart from the travelogue that was translated into Bengali and has now been annotated, Mukherjee wrote two highly valued books in English on Indian industrial products in the 19th century. In 1883, came A Handbook of Indian Products and in 1888, Art Manufactures of India.        
	But this was not all. Apart from Trailokyanath, the fantastic story-teller in Bengali, and T.N. Mukherjee, the Westernized scholar renowned in an area that today would have overlapped with economics, geography and commerce, there was a third dimension to the man that could easily be missed if one did not look for it in his most abiding writing of all, Kankabati. I am talking here of the social aspect of the Kankabati story that comes out clearly, but fortunately falls just short of spoiling the childrens tale aspect of it. Rabindranath Tagore, whose 1892 review of the book has now been republished from Sadhana as a foreword to Kankabati, obviously did not want to emphasize the former aspect.        
	I have to admit here I had remained sold to both Kankabati and her creator from my childhood. I was told stories alongside vivid commentaries on Trailokyanaths habits and character by one who had been his dear little cousin and who always fought for Trailokya-dada in familial confabulations. She was herself brought up in a very orthodox family and in the conservative way that was usual then. Many of the idiosyncrasies of her heavily Westernized but anti-sahib dada she just hated. But I always felt she understood him and his cavalier ways of attacking family customs, purposeless obeisance to a sahib wherever and whenever one was found, and the meaningless village superstitions that abounded rather better than most of his other relatives and friends. She would share all this with her own son who was then growing up and, much later, with me when she was in her eighties. Her son was my maternal grandfather. I must warn you that the rest of my tale is only hearsay. My great grandmother told me all this, always finishing with her beautiful, toothless smile and laughter.        
	First story. Trailokyanath, who was tall, fair and handsome, appears in military khaki and helmet with only a big brown moustache worn as an extra piece of disguise, and an afterthought, at their ancestral house in the village of Rauto, near Kolkata (I think). He shouts in deep-throated English for every male member to come out and answer questions. Quickly a procession of shaken, half-dressed gentlemen trickles out with joined palms. Why have you come out? he shouts to them and then, to add to his authority, pulls at his moustache, which comes off. Before he could reverse the mistake, one of his uncles rushes up to him and starts thrashing the fallen hero mercilessly.              
	Second story. Trailokyonath gathers a dozen sturdy but sheepish young men of the village to drive out ghosts from the trees where they supposedly come to haunt innocent people by night. Taking unfair advantage, thieves also came every night and made off with whatever goodies they could lay their hands on. Three ghosts were spotted on the first night, but on being accosted, they uttered mantras and vanished. The chowkidar assured the young men next morning that this was what all good ghosts would do. There was one consolation though  thieves had also not appeared. On the next night, everything ditto. Three ghosts duly appeared up on a tree and, hell being raised, two held on to the branches, while one jumped down naked and was caught. It was the chowkidar! The other two could not, or would not, shed their dhotis, all three dhotis sticking firmly to a heavy glue that had been thickly spread on the branches under Trailokyonaths able guidance.         
	Trying to look up Mukherjee on the internet, I could locate most of the facts. The fiction part, however, is understandably missing. But to my mind, that fiction is most of the truth about T.N. Mukherjee, the social reformer. I also found somebody on the internet describing Trailokyanath as an important reformer belonging to the Brahmo Samaj  I cannot vouch for the truth of that either.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        FROM TERROR TO TRIUMPH                                  Fifth Column -Abhijit Bhattacharyya                              
	The fresh induction of 33,000 US soldiers and 7,000 Nato troops indicates that the Afghan war is still unwinnable. In order to get out by mid-2011, the US-led allied forces of 42 nations must be prepared to get farther in  that seems to be the new strategy. Nevertheless, as the saying goes, Wars are like household DIY, easy to start but hard to finish. And an unfinished enterprise is a sure recipe for future mess.        
	War also drains out a nations wealth. The present one by Barack Obama is no exception. It transpires that the latest surge would result in an additional expenditure of $1 million per soldier per year, $30 billion annual expenditure as the cost of surge in the first year, 240,900,000 extra gallons of fuel per year at 22 gallons per soldier per day and finally, $614,610,000 in salaries. And yet success cannot be guaranteed. Why? Because Obamas utterances are pregnant with the possibility of an escalation of the present AfPak policy to an all-out Pak-Pak programme.        
	Alongside Afghanistan, the frontiers of Pakistan have also come into focus. The fresh deployment of troops to five eastern and south-eastern Afghan provinces bordering Pakistan is bound to put pressure on the Pakistan army for deeper action on cross-border terrorism. Obamas words constitute an ominous warning to Pakistan  The days of providing a blank check are over. Pakistan being a nuclear power, Obamas avoidance of a clear declaration of war on Islamabads inactivity and recalcitrance is understandable. Yet, it is familiar knowledge that Pakistan will prove to be a far more intractable problem in the long term than Afghanistan.        
	Whereas in Afghanistan there are several thousands of heads to fight on the ground, the more difficult issue of Pakistan is largely outside of General Stanley McChrystals control. It requires no reiteration that thus far no substantive action has been taken against the Taliban leadership in Baluchistan, south of the Pashtun-dominated areas of Afghanistan. Experts are unanimous that this is the same mistake the Soviets made in the Eighties, when they failed to take action against major mujahideen groups based in Pakistan.                
	Tricky situation        
	Pakistan emerges as the control room of the Afghan war. No one understands the situation better than the US. The Taliban in Pakistan has an organizational structure divided into media, military and finance committees. The Talibans inner shura, or government council, exerts authority over its fighters, with Mullah Omar as the supreme leader. Many Taliban leaders have moved their families to Baluchistan and their children attend Pakistani schools.        
	Thus the strategic imbalance is proving too costly for the US-led troops in Afghanistan. Whereas the Pakistani army and frontier corps are on half-baked action in the northern belt of Pakistans tribal areas, a gaping hole exists in the southern sector, around Baluchistan, with regions surrounding Quetta being the hub of al Qaida and Taliban action. Since the US is not in a position yet to make an open entry into Pakistani territory, the obvious choice is drone attack. It is a Catch-22 situation for the Pakistani army. It has to respond to, and match, the US surge in the neighbourhood. Or else....        
	The writing on the wall is too transparent to be ignored. Certain things will have to change in Pakistan to ensure Afghanistans security. If Pakistan cannot deliver the goods, the US may have to use other means to curb insurgency along the AfPak border.        
	The US war efforts are racing against time. The Afghan war, with Pakistan being the epicentre of terrorism, poses a potential threat to the worlds existence. It is time for Islamabad to clean up its act.

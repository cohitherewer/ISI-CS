                                                                                                                 LONG TERM FOCUS                                                    
	It is not surprising that apprehensions about the United States of America continue to inform sections of public opinion in India, even while bilateral relations are getting better in significant ways. The improvement in bilateral relations was clear in the course of the visit of the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton. The apprehensions manifested themselves in the aftermath of the visit. It is essential that the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, does not allow a small but shrill group to adversely affect Indias ties with Washington. The landmark Indo-US agreement on nuclear issues that is on the verge of being sealed will benefit India in a number of ways. It signals recognition of India as a major player in the international system by the worlds only superpower. Yet there are voices, within Parliament and outside it, which are convinced that the agreement is intended to contain and rollback Indias nuclear programme. These concerns have little merit in substance, and must be ignored, but they reflect a larger contradiction.        
	In reality, a section of Indias strategic elite continues to have a paradoxical view of the US. They continue to be suspicious of American policies towards South Asia. These suspicions are kept alive by the USs relationship with Pakistan and  more generally  by Washingtons perceived behaviour in international politics. Resentment at the manner in which Pakistan seems to continue to be rewarded by the US despite its support for terrorism within India is palpable, as is the widespread perception that the US has double standards in dealing with terrorism. Similarly, there is a widespread feeling that Washington is not sufficiently sensitive to Indian security concerns or to its aspirations of being a great power. The Indian elite is clearly uncomfortable with the USs hyper-power, a term popularized by the French that has gained intellectual currency within India. Similarly, the sparring between Indian and American negotiators, in various multilateral trade-related fora, over the pace of liberalization in agriculture and services and over climate change reinforces the scepticism about the US. Ms Clintons brief visit was intended to dispel these suspicions and to build genuine goodwill with India.        
	 There is a long-term strategic convergence between the two countries. Economic and technological ties, educational and societal links, shared concern over Chinas future, and the common battle against jihadi terrorism are key factors that bind the US and India together. Ms Clintons visit is the bridge to a stronger relationship. Mr Singh should also use his visit to the US in November to ensure that the strategic relationship is insulated from routine politics and tactical differences, and is based on the obvious long-term convergences of values and interests.

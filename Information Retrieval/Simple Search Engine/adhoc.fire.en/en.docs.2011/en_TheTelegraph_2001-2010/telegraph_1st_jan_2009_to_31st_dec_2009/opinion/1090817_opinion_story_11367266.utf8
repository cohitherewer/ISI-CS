	Can proverbially absent-minded professors exercise institutional or regulatory authority in matters of education? The Union human resource development minister seems to believe, quite firmly, that they can, and should, be allowed to do so. Kapil Sibal has sent out word that he does not want any officers from the Indian administrative or police services to head any educational authority under his ministry. He is quite right in doing so, provided this decision has a larger vision of how such bodies should be made up at the top in terms of the distribution of responsibilities. There is something radically lopsided about a senior or retired bureaucrat or police officer heading, say, a Central board of education (as has been the case) or university. An experienced academic who can both guide the body and be its interface with the world should be doing this job.        
	Yet, there are several administrative and practical aspects of running such bodies or institutions that need proper training in management, finance, fund-raising and other structural matters, which might not lie within the purview of academic experience, expertise and wisdom. So people who are qualified to take on these specific aspects of administration should also be taken on in important positions (and these positions created when they do not exist) for the efficient running of these bodies. To encumber academic heads with the nitty-gritty of administrative and structural responsibilities is not only to abuse their special kind of leadership, but also to unnecessarily politicize the job of maintaining academic standards of excellence. But these practical aspects of the running of such bodies should also not be neglected, and suitable people should be taken on or trained for these duties, who will work in tandem with the academic heads. If such authorities and institutions are to become independent of centralizing political intervention, then the minister has taken the right step in this matter.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Raving and ranting
                                                                                                                 RAVING AND RANTING                                  Did the police have any legal grounds to raid a private party in Bangalore? Varuna Verma contends that the police case rests on weak foundations                           Wanton act: The Bangalore arrests were made on grounds of obscenity                                   
	Anil Kumar found drug offences easy to handle. But when the Sub-Inspector of the Tavarekere Police Station  on the outskirts of Bangalore  raided a late night farmhouse party and found no suspicious substances, he used obscenity as a reason to put 100 people behind bars.        
	Last Saturday, Kumar was on night duty when a call came at the police station. A neighbour complained that loud music was being played at a farmhouse. We thought a rave party was happening there, he recalls. Kumar and his team barged in, seized liquor bottles, 40 vehicles, musical instruments, cash and cell phones and arrested all the 100 guests at the party.        
	The cops found no drugs. So they arrested everybody under Section 294 of the Indian Penal Code  which lays down the law on obscenity. We saw men and women dancing obscenely, claims Kumar.        
	But Bangalores legal community is crying foul at the wrong use of the law. Section 294 states that an obscene act done in a public place is an offence. It does not apply to a private party, says Arvind Narrain, a human rights lawyer at Bangalores Alternative Law Forum.        
	The IPC law on obscene acts and songs states, Whoever to the annoyance of another does an obscene act in any public place or sings, recites or utters any obscene song or words in or near any public place shall be punished with imprisonment up to three months, or with fine, or both.        
	But as the lawyers point out, the party was at a private place. The police do not have the authority to decide whether people were dancing obscenely. This is arbitrary use of the law, says Narrain.        
	Human rights lawyers across Bangalore are outraged at what they believe to be the polices high-handedness. The right to privacy is guaranteed under the Constitution. Having a private party is a citizens right, says B.T. Venkatesh, a human rights lawyer.        
	Venkatesh agrees that if a private party is causing inconvenience to neighbours, the police can be called in. But the most that the police can do is issue a warning and maybe slap a fine. They cannot arrest people and keep them in a lock-up for three days. This is an unacceptable punishment for a small offence, he says.        
	Sub-Inspector Kumar says the raid was conducted after neighbours said they were getting disturbed by the loud music playing at the party. We raided the party on the complaint of neighbours. But when we saw people drunk and dancing obscenely, we decided to take strict action, says Kumar. Of the 100 people arrested, 57 spent three nights in jail before they could get bail. All are out on bail now.        
	Gauri Lankesh, a Bangalore-based social activist, says the police used the legal framework to push morality. The women at the party were not obscenely dressed. They were wearing what most women across urban India wear. This is moral and cultural policing, she says.        
	Besides the moral issues, lawyers believe last weeks police raid has several legal loopholes. Civil and criminal advocate C.V. Subindra says that the police have not shown any proof of the allegations that theyve levelled at the late night revellers. The police have not shown any photographs to prove that obscene acts were happening at the party. They have no grounds to fight a case in court, he says.        
	Also, the police raided the private party without a search warrant, which lawyers say is illegal. The police cannot barge into a private premise without a search warrant and conduct a raid. This was an unlawful act, says Sheela Ramanathan, a lawyer with the Human Rights Law Network, Bangalore.        
	The police raided the party on the suspicion of drugs. But when the cops did not recover any drugs from the premises, they had no case against the guests, say lawyers. Raiding a party on the suspicion of drugs is justified. But since no drugs were found, the arrests become an arbitrary act, says Narrain.        
	Besides the obscenity act, the police booked the revellers under Section 36 of the Karnataka Excise Act. The Act prohibits any sale of liquor without a valid license. The party organisers did not have a license to sell liquor  but they have claimed that liquor was being served free of cost at the party. Inspector Kumar, however, claims otherwise. A lot of cash was recovered from the premises. This means liquor was being sold at the party, says Kumar.        
	Lawyers find Kumars argument weak. Recovering cash from the party premises is not proof enough that liquor was being sold there. The court needs more concrete evidence, says Venkatesh. And if the police insist that liquor was being sold, only the party organisers can be booked under the Excise Act and not the guests present there, adds Venkatesh.        
	Human rights lawyers in the city feel that the people arrested at the farmhouse can sue the police for harassment. They can file a complaint under Sections 211 and 218 of the IPC  on lodging a false case to harm the reputation of persons, says Subindra.        
	Narrain adds that the arrested guests can demand that the First Information Report (FIR) be squashed and they can lodge a complaint with the Human Rights Commission. Action can be taken against the police officers involved for arbitrary use of the law, he says.

                                                                                                                 FACE-OFF                                                                        
	During my schooldays, not so long ago, the fear of failure in examinations was a very real one. It controlled my life and shaped my nightmares. Fuelled by my pathetic inability to deal with mathematics, it made me go temporarily insane every time annual exams approached, for I was sure that I would not make it to the next class. A few years down the line, things seem to have changed drastically for students. Far from being threatened by failure, students of state government schools are finding it difficult not to pass nowadays. To reduce the number of school dropouts, the government has come up with an array of measures to ensure that no matter how weak a student is, he will be promoted smoothly year after year.   
	The system of unit tests was started some years ago to replace the half-yearly exams of yore. Five unit tests, each with a total of 20 marks, are held in each subject over the year. The split of the 100-marks half-yearly papers into five parts has obviously made it easier for students to secure the pass mark, which is five for each. And in case students fail to pass the first two unit tests, there is the remedial test to come to their rescue. The chances of failing this test are slim, since teachers usually set the easiest questions for it. They do not do this out of generosity but usually because they are under pressure from school authorities to pass the students.   
	The teachers I talked to on this issue revealed the dismal facts behind the increased success rate. School authorities are eager to promote students to the next level because they do not have rooms large enough to accommodate the failed students with the new batch in a particular class. They cannot increase the number of sections because that would require more teachers, who are in perpetual short supply. So school principals insist that teachers pass almost all the students, with little or no thought to their performance in the exams. Given the nature of these two problems, it is not unexpected that they should be felt more insistently in the rural than in the urban schools. One of the teachers I interviewed said that the worst students in her school in the South 24 Parganas are now making it to the merit list, ousting the deserving ones, after the marks they have obtained in the unit and remedial tests are added to the annual tally. It says much about a schools standards when a student who probably cannot even write a complete grammatical sentence ends up being a rank-holder.         
	The rot actually starts at the very base. Most schools have done away with admission tests under the government directive. So there is no longer any screening procedure to select the better candidates. Moreover, admission is open throughout the year. A student can join a particular class in the middle of the session, and regardless of whether he follows the lesson or not, he will surely be promoted to the next class, courtesy the remedial tests. The politicization of education also has a considerable role to play in the lowering of the schools standards. A child need not bother about failure at all if he is a relative of the school secretary. The latter guarantees that not only his son or daughter but also any pupil belonging to his family is promoted every year. The meaning of family here extends to the party brotherhood.         
	Since most rural schools recruit at least some local teachers, it becomes easier for panchayat or party leaders to use their power on them. Sometimes, teachers are threatened with dire consequences if they dare fail the children of influential men. Eager not to displease the people who count, most village schools have become as flexible as possible with the examination procedure. They have lowered the average pass mark stipulated by the government for the benefit of students who cannot secure even that.         
	It is typical of the state government to try to increase the success rate quantitatively while doing nothing to address the real issues which cause students to drop out. Not surprisingly, the simplified examination system has hardly succeeded in retaining students. Most rural students know that education, especially of the kind they receive, would get them nowhere. So they would rather start earning than waste time in schools that have become more playgrounds than centres of learning. But the segment getting the rawest deal is that of the few dedicated teachers who still take their job seriously. Cooped up in tiny, sweltering classrooms with over a hundred students, racing against time to complete the syllabi while the greater part of the academic session is wasted on conducting the unit tests, now the teachers do not even have the satisfaction of seeing the good students succeed. All the teachers I spoke to expressed unanimous disgust with the education system of which they are a part.        
	One of the teachers described how a student of Class IV in her school in Howrah simply refused to be promoted to the next class although he had cleared his exams. His parents pleaded with the teachers to let him stay on in his old class for one more year because, they said, that would strengthen his base (bheet shokto hobe). In the anarchic world of the state education system, failure has acquired a lure it never had before.

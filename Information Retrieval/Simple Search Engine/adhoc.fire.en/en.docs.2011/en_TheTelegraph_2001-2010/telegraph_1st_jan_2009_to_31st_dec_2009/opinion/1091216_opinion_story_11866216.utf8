	Imagine a flood, and a mix of rich and poor people standing neck deep in rising water with their homes gone. As they wait to be rescued, they bicker and squabble over who gets the helicopters and who the boats. The situation in Copenhagen has been teetering on the brink of something as absurd, unpleasant and dangerous as this. None of the bickerers and squabblers seems to get the big picture, and to be able to place themselves in it. To do that, the perfect point of view would be way up in heaven, from where the earth would look like a little ball in peril and the nations, great and small, indistinguishable from one another. From such a height, everybody would look equally in danger and equally foolish in not realizing this to rise above greed and politics. That was the point made by one demonstrator who rode on a horse through Copenhagen dressed as the grim reaper: global warming, like death, is the great leveller. But being apocalyptic is as unlikely to save the day (or the planet) as being political. What is required is nothing more or less than reasonableness.        
	This basic quality seems to be lacking, to an astonishing extent, in Copenhagen. Everybody there, rich or poor, is fighting some sort of a battle. But to a sensible Martian, they would all appear to be the wrong battles. Negotiations are back on some sort of track  or, as it appears, two tracks. But in spite of the various drafts, deadlines, protocols and conventions, commitments demanded or evaded, funds promised or denied, heads of state arriving or departing, deals struck openly or furtively, the essential spirit of the summit seems to have got on to a rather bizarre track. People have come to the summit to save themselves and one another from a future that is no less real for being too far away to imagine concretely. But is it really the future that one is looking at? What about the floods, droughts, food riots, migrations and other human or natural disasters that have already started happening to drive home the actuality of what is at stake here? Bargaining and intrigue  as if preparing for elections and working out seat-sharing deals and coalition strategies  are hardly what should be determining the ethos of such a summit. A spirit of urgent compromise, informed by sensibleness and foresight, must triumph over greed, cunning, victimhood or the will to power for Copenhagen to make any real difference at all for the earth.

	Tricky question                  
	Sir  Aveek Sen has raised certain important questions about the proposal to make the Central Board of Secondary Education examinations at the end of Class X optional (Not for their sakes only, Sept 8). Many of these questions have been troubling me ever since I heard of the proposal. Such an endeavour will very likely prove to be a tricky affair. India has not progressed so much in the educational sphere as to totally do away with the Class X exams, passing which was considered to be an achievement just a few years ago. I fondly remember my grandmother proudly proclaiming to be a matric pass. I too cherish my Class X results not because I had scored high marks but because it was the first big proof of my assiduity.           
	Sen rightly says that there are two kinds of vocabulary in use as far as secondary education is concerned.On the one hand, is the issue of the government lightening the students burden. On the other hand, lies the question of students choice. Unfortunately, the government often ends up doing the very opposite of what it proposes to do. There must surely be ways of disburdening a child of his or her schoolbag and homework other than making the exams optional. In reality, it is the rigorous routine of school that is responsible for this burden, rather than a single set of exams at the end of Class X.           
	Another reason for such a proposal could be the governments wish to imitate the education systems of other countries. But this is not necessary as Indias own system, no matter how much it may be lacking in efficiency, has produced scholars who have made the country proud. What is required is a push to improve the existing system rather than changing it.          
	The problem is that children are like puppets in the hands of adults. Sometimes they are thought to be immature and incapable of taking their own decisions. Then again, at other times, they are chided for not being responsible enough. To make the Class X exams optional would place the adolescents in a situation where they will be confused about their role in making the choice. As Sen suggests, the choice will be made more by the guardian or the school and less by the child. If that is the case, then what is the point of having an option? But it is not a good idea to leave the choice entirely in the hands of adolescents who are likely to experiment with their futures. Also, a student who has decided to take the exams will always have an edge over another who has decided to opt out. In such a situation, an equal assessment of merit will not be possible.           
	Sen has also pointed out the difference between the choice made by boys and girls. There is no doubt that the decision, if implemented, will bring down the female literacy rate, which is already quite low. More and more girls will be kept away from higher studies due to lack of motivation. What would inspire them to work hard if there is no goal to achieve at the end of 10 years of study? The proposal, which has been accepted, is an irresponsible act on the part of the government (CBSE option from 2011). It has no right to place the future of students, and so of the nation, in such uncertainty.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The proposal of the CBSE to make the optional Class X exam format multiple-choice comes as a setback, even as people are debating the decision to make the Class X exams optional (Multiple-choice test plan on CBSE table, Sept 5). In the move that promises to end all subjectivity lies the inevitable danger of making education shallow for students. Sound conceptual training in a student is hard to come by nowadays, what with the custom of ticking the correct answer becoming the order of the day. This can be verified from almost any engineering college (except the Indian Institutes of Technology, perhaps) where most students know the shortest technique to solve a problem, but few can apply first principles to accomplish the same.           
	With an already superficial syllabus, a multiple-choice type test will reduce an examination to choosing one from a set of already given answers to, say, a question on Shakespeares lines. This will simply force ideas upon students, allowing them no room to build their own views, especially in disciplines such as literature, social sciences and the like. Countless new coaching institutes will spring up, full of false promises, and the whole idea of education will be reduced to mere business. This unfortunate move, if implemented, will act contrary to the governments initiatives to attract students to higher studies in the basic sciences since their understanding of the subjects will be weak from the school-level itself.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sudden strike           
	Sir  The attack on the two priests from Karnataka in Nepals Pashupatinath temple by Maoists protesting their appointment at the temple has rightly been condemned by India (Pashupati; priests beaten up, Sept 5). The Maoists contend that Nepal has entered a new era after the abolition of the monarchy. Hence, in keeping with the spirit of nationalism, the priests at Pashupatinath should be Nepalis rather than Indians. In reality, the Maoists, now out of power, are on the lookout for issues to rally public support. The temple issue has come in handy in their effort to bolster Nepali nationalism based on anti-Indian sentiments.           
	Yours faithfully,      
J.S. Acharya, Hyderabad

                
	Sir  Maoist ideology is premised on atheism. It was perhaps in observance of their slogan that political power emerges from the barrel of the gun, that the devoted members of the Maoist organization attacked the Hindu priests in the Pashupatinath temple.                     
	Yours faithfully,

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Traditions revived by individual talent
                                                                                                                 TRADITIONS REVIVED BY INDIVIDUAL TALENT                              MUSIC      Nilaksha Gupta                                                
	The crushing power of an exceptional singer was evident in the day-long music programme entitled Teen Prahar presented on March 22 by Banyan Tree Events. For, the sole vocalist, Kaushiki Desikan, swept all before her with her khayals in Bilaskhani Todi. This is neither an easy raga nor one really suitable for taan-oriented khayal singing. Most khayal singers give the raga a wide berth for this reason.        
	Kaushiki, however, sang it with the ease of one singing Yaman. She sang the classic composition of the vilambit khayal first in the manner she had been taught and then developed it with her own inputs. Her phrase development skilfully used the format worked out by Ustad Bade Ghulam Khan for achieving maximum impact in minimum time. She then went on to what instrumentalists would call the jod ang, but graced it with bahlawa, which is a melodic play-off of note combinations and phrases underlined with heavy taans and meends. This was a prime feature of the vilambit khayals of the ustad. As you can hear on his recordings, bahlawa slowly evolves into taans at a later stage. This is exactly how Kaushiki worked up the finale of the vilambit.         
	Earlier, the antara development was also in the classic mould and worked up enough emotional punch. Towards the end of the vilambit, Kaushiki at times converted the mukhra into a lightning sapaat taan in the manner of Bade Ghulam Ali.         
	The drut khayal was equally spellbinding. For, here, she used all the traditional devices that make the chhota khayal a treat. But the quality of the figures, rhythms and the taans of course is a big factor, and so is the artistry with which these are executed. There was exceptional skill and artistry for all to hear but practically none to appreciate throughout. These included Kaushikis forays into the taar saptak with her long taans. The forays were entirely functional as Bilaskhani is practically pentatonic in ascent and if you want a long ascending taan you either have to start it very low or take it up very high. This, Kaushiki achieved with ease. The success of the exercises was vouchsafed by the fact that there was no public applause that graces the shrill graduated climbs of gallery players like Parveen Sultana. Anything that is really good will not move the majority, thats a rule that applies to all arts.         
	Samar Sahas mercurial tabla playing complemented Kaushikis excellence, and I noted with pleasure that she refused the usual request for the usual thillana saying, Does one like singing the same thing every time?        
	Sarod player Tejendra Narayan Majumdars painstaking alap in a version of Mian ki Sarang that includes small doses of the tivra madhyam seemed pedestrian after Kaushikis brilliance, and the careful gatkari in Gaud Sarang lulled me to sleep. However, the iniquitous mixture of the two constituent ragas in his Basant Bahar woke me up rudely. Ali Akbars taste for the gauche suits only the ustad. No amount of exceptional tabla playing by Subhankar Banerjee could enliven the show.        
	The evening session was devoted more to entertainment than music. The Ganesh-Kumaresh electric violin duo showed skill and professionalism but little else. The drum ensemble titled Taal India saw the professed leader, Anindo Chatterjee, and his son being totally eclipsed by the raw charm of Manjoor Khans dholak, Ghanashyams nagada, Devu Khans kartaal and most of all by the audio-visual pung-cholum and dhaph by N. Maipak Singh, S. Nano Singh and S. Basanti Singh. Only Samta Prasad or Zakir Hussain could fight off such challenge.        
	Finally, Shujaat Khan proved he is no chip of the old block by knocking the soul out of Raga Bageshri with wayward note application, and also by ignoring all proven rules of both alap and gatkari. Funnily enough, sons always seem to pick up the worst things out of their fathers repertoire much to the joy of the gullible. Shujaat finally drew applause by imitating Vilayat Khans sing-and-play antics without the finesse the ustad used to maintain even in this circus act. Anindo Chatterjee is too dry and too uninspired a tabla player to mitigate the ill-effects of such a non-performance.        
	Since 9.30 am on a Sunday is a bit too early for me, I missed too much of the opening recital by flautist Rupak Kulkarni to review him fairly. But I did notice that there was more flute than sitar and sarod in his playing style than evident in that of his teacher, Hariprasad Chaurasia.

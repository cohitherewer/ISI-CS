The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | COLOUR OF MONEY
                                                                                                                 COLOUR OF MONEY                                                    
	Old soldiers fade away. Antiquated ideas seldom do. They resurface sometimes in odd places, sometimes in obvious ones. One of their nurturing grounds is the minds of Indian politicians. L.K. Advani, the leader of the Bharatiya Janata party, has suddenly rediscovered a phrase from the past. That phrase is black money. In the days before the liberalization of the economy, taxation was high and therefore the incidence of evasion of taxes was also high. This undeclared income was called black money. Conventional wisdom then was that a large proportion of this money was deposited in Swiss banks. One of the immediate effects of liberalization and the opening up of the economy was the gradual disappearance of the shadow of black money. Levels of taxation came down and so did evasion; the market offered opportunities of investment in contrast to keeping money idle in a bank in Switzerland. Having done the circuit, the idea of black money, like so many other features of the planned economy, became part of an obsolete vocabulary. It has reappeared, thanks to Mr Advani.        
	Mr Advani has claimed that Indians are holding Rs one lakh crore in various Swiss banks, and he wants steps to be taken to have this money brought back to India. He has demanded that the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, should raise this issue in the forthcoming G-20 summit. He did not forget to add the rider that if the BJP comes to power, this money would be brought back to India. There is thus a clear political angle to the demand. What Mr Advani glossed over is the fact that when the BJP was in power, till 2004, it took no action against the black money in Swiss banks. Was the information then unknown to the BJP? Or is this another political gimmick? At one time, it was the stock-in-trade of leftists to say that the retrieval of black money would serve as the panacea to all ills of the Indian economy and society. It is significant that the BJP is now singing the same tune. Obsolescence has no colour.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | And It Is Not Difficult
                                                                                                                 AND IT IS NOT DIFFICULT                                  Stephen Hugh-Jones      
	Last time round we looked at two tiny words, but and yet. This week its the turn of a single one, their cousin and.        
	Like them, it springs from the Germanic roots of English, not the Latin or French ones: its und in German, en in Dutch. To the Romans, in contrast, it was et; hence todays French et, Italian and Portuguese e, Spanish y. Greek, ancient or modern, uses a quite different sound: kai. By coincidence or not, the Romans, instead of et, could add -que (probably pronounced ke, not kwe) to the end of words. The most famous phrase in Latin literature, the opening of Virgils Aeneid, runs Arma virumque cano  Arms, and the man I sing.        
	In all these languages, the word, unlike our but or yet, has just one meaning: and. Oddly, in English that word once had two meanings. In the second one, now entirely archaic, it meant if; as in And it please Your Highness.... These days, in that usage it is usually spelt an, with no d. But the origin, it seems, is simply and.        
	Hence the saying, which I remember puzzling me as a child, If ifs and ands were pots and pans, thered be no work for tinkers, the usually travelling folk who used to repair those kitchen vessels. The saying means very much the same as another one, If wishes were horses, beggars would ride: its easy to wish for things (if I were a rich man, in Fiddler on the Roof) but they dont often happen. But what ifs and ands were doing as parallels to each other was long a mystery to me.        
	In its usual sense, and could hardly be more simple, though lexicographers can split hairs about it. The usually wise R.W. Burchfield, editor of the latest Fowlers Modern English Usage, in passing implies that and is complicated. It isnt. It has just two odd uses known to me. One is the mainly colloquial phrase ... and all, as in she went to the big city, found herself homeless and hungry, got pregnant and all. The commonest example of this is the entirely colloquial still and all, meaning despite all that. The other oddity, a really odd one this, is the inexplicable try and in place of try to  which, just as inexplicably, cant be transformed into tried and or trying and.        
	The strangest oddity is not one of meaning but the myth that you must not start a sentence with And. This is sheer nonsense. Witness the 1611 version of the Bible, whose opening words are In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form and void. Likewise, in the same version, countless verses of the New Testament begin with And, as the original Greek did. So do two of the best-known lines of English poetry, the start of William Blakes Jerusalem: And did those feet in ancient time/ Walk upon Englands mountains green?        
	The Bible and Blake of course come from centuries past. But there are modern examples aplenty. The And opening can be used simply to break up a long sentence. But often it also marks a change or contrast of ideas or sentiment or in the kind of things being enumerated. Eg: Marry Johnny? He was young, handsome, rich, well-connected, even well-educated. And he was a swine.        
	Thats my concoction, for my next bonkbuster (also sometimes called junk romance). But you can find examples in almost any serious writer. You can start a sentence, indeed a paragraph or an epic poem with And. And if any pedant says you cant, tell him  with Burchfields backing  to get lost.

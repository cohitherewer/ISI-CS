	The debacle suffered by the Left parties in the recent Lok Sabha elections has cast a pall of gloom over some and brought good cheer to others. Beyond that, it should be an occasion for reflection among those who take a long-term interest in the future of democracy in India. It is evident that at least the proximate cause of the debacle lay in the unyielding, obdurate and intransigent behaviour of the general secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist). As the opposition to the nuclear deal failed to have the desired effect, he allowed his ego to get the better of his political judgment and exposed a well-disciplined party to both hostility and ridicule.        
	The expulsion of the Speaker of the Lok Sabha from the party set in motion a long chain of events. It will be a mistake to view the expulsion as the simple outcome of a clash of personalities. Underlying the clash of personalities was the contradiction between two different political principles, and it is that contradiction that interests me here. No doubt the general secretary could have acted a little more gracefully, but it will be a mistake to say that he acted in an unprincipled way in expelling the Speaker from the party.         
	The first principle assigns primacy to the Constitution, and to the legislature and government duly established according to its provisions. The second principle assigns primacy to the party, and the discipline it imposes on it members according to its own rules. These are two different principles, and in a parliamentary democracy such as ours, they make contradictory demands on a legislator who is also a dedicated member of a communist party.               
	Even a casual examination of the Constitution of India will show that it is Parliament and not any party that is pre-eminent in it. The Constitution of India is a voluminous document with detailed provisions on a very wide range of institutions. The composition of Parliament, and its functions and powers are laid down at great length. The same is done for the state legislatures. The political party is scarcely mentioned, except in Schedule X which was introduced into the Constitution by an amendment designed to restrict defections.         
	By contrast, the party occupied a central position in the Constitution of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics which provided the template for communist parties throughout the world, including India. It will be a mistake to try to understand the central place of the party in communist thinking by reference only to the Constitution of India and without any reference to the Soviet constitution. That constitution had described the party as the leading and guiding force of Soviet society of all state organizations and public organizations. It is true that the Soviet Union has ceased to exist, but the Communist Party of the Soviet Union under the leadership of Stalin has left an indelible mark on communist leaders throughout the world. The Stalinist cast of mind of the present general secretary of the CPI (M) did not emerge ex nihilo: it is the product of a long historical development. It is that cast of mind which has been his main source of strength within his party.         
	It is true that Stalins image became tarnished even among communists after the 20th party congress, but his inspiration and legacy did not disappear. Stalin could be replaced without too much difficulty by Lenin whose image remained relatively untarnished, at least in the Left, even after the decay of the Soviet Union. There is a certain logic in going back to Lenin because he was, after all, the creator of the party which acquired only its fully developed form under Stalin.         
	Even if we concede that Lenin was, in contrast with Stalin, a tolerant, reasonable and humane leader, we cannot escape the conclusion that the Leninist party was designed for operation in a one-party and not a multi-party system. It was Lenin who created a new type of party and a new political environment for its operation by the gradual elimination of all other parties.        
	Once the one-party State was brought into being, Stalin carried it to its logical end. He developed the party as a highly efficient instrument of economic and political change, but its efficiency depended on the condition that its operation would be unhindered by any other political party. No matter how effective it may be in its own political environment, a Leninist party in a multi-party system is an anachronism whose implications have been evaded by both Left politicians and Left intellectuals. In India, Left intellectuals have yearned for a party with clear and definite economic and social objectives, but they have also remained attached to the ideals of political pluralism.         
	As he shaped the destiny of his country, Stalin strengthened the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and his own position in it. He held several positions in his long career, but none of these had the power or the symbolic significance of his position as general secretary of the party. He assumed that position in 1922, in Lenins dying months, and it was by occupying it that he secured his legitimacy as Lenins true successor. For a long time, he held no official position of any significance except that of the general secretary of the party. He was known in his own country and in the outside world as the head of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and he remained in that position until his death in 1953. He developed a mechanism, imitated by other communist parties, whereby it became virtually impossible to replace the general secretary without creating a split in the party.               
	Communist parties throughout the world have developed a distinctive structure modelled on the structure of the Bolshevik party created by Lenin. This is evident even in the nomenclature adopted by them: politbureau, central committee and general secretary. The general secretary, following the precedent set by Stalin, has always been the pivot and controlling figure of the party. A liberal democratic party can sometimes have a figurehead at its top, but that cannot easily happen in a communist party. Lenin and Stalin have provided abiding inspiration not only in shaping the structure of the party but also in moulding the personality of its general secretary. The general secretary has to be strong, forceful and unyielding.         
	The challenge that the CPI(M) faces today is not a small one. There are some who would like to see it removed from the Indian political scene. Personally, I do not believe that that will be in the long-term interest of democracy in India. But for it to play a more effective part, its structure and the character of its leadership will have to change so as to accommodate with better grace the demands that pluralist democracy makes on every political party. Its leaders have a fear that if it changes too much or too fast, it may lose its identity and become a very different kind of party. It is a legitimate anxiety because it will bring little benefit to India if it becomes yet another socialist party like the Samajwadi Party whose name, after all, proclaims its socialist inspiration.

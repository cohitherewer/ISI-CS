The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | COME OUT IN THE OPEN
                                                                                                                 COME OUT IN THE OPEN                                  MALA FIDE - MALVIKA SINGH                              
	It is ludicrous and quite bizarre to hear, in 2009, the insane responses of politicians and old men to the Delhi High Courts acceptance of gay rights. If only these same, loud critics would be as vociferous and militant about fighting the glaring realities of rape, dowry deaths, molestation, killing of innocent couples in love with each other but who happen to belong to different castes or faiths, murders in the name of god, brutalization of Dalits, and other inhuman illegalities that have poisoned our public space! A lazy, self-serving, corrupt political class has not delivered the dignity of life and living as per the Constitution. This class has not ensured social equality and the fundamental rights and freedoms that come with it but has the energy to fight the amendment of a wholly imperfect law that needs to be overhauled.        
	In this new millennium, to deal with changing social structures as societies grow out of the conservatism that once ruled them, laws too need to be rewritten. Damning declamations are usually unintelligent and not carefully thought through. They tend to be based on short-term personal whims and equally shortlived political rhetoric. Amendments of such old and redundant laws lie in the reliable hands of those men and women who comprehend and enforce the laws of this land. The executive authority can recommend the change or object to it but the final writ rests with the court. For most thinking people, gay rights is important and far holier than killing another for dowry or raping a woman forcibly merely to satisfy a carnal pleasure that stems from overriding lust that, in turn, stems from restrictive and unnatural diktats. It is time we opened our minds to the needs of others, to changing norms, and demand that these laws be amended so that gay people can live peacefully and honestly within the parameters of Indian law.                
	Narrow vision        
	Then there was the horror of the hooch deaths because of spurious intoxicants being manufactured illegally to address the needs of people who want to have an alcoholic drink. Worldwide experience has shown that whatever you ban creates a space for the immediate defiance of the ban by illegal production of the banned goods or services. Abstinence cannot be forced. Containing simple, human desires, bottling them in an airtight vessel, and then releasing the cork can only compel an uncontrollable outpour that is bound to overwhelm and pollute personal and public spaces. There is only one way to work out a balance and that is by enforcing all personal freedoms and rights and simultaneously using tools such as the media or school curricula to raise awareness about the pitfalls of addiction.        
	Honesty of appeal, integrity of purpose, open mind and access to information are ingredients that mould modern societies, the political and social ethos that empower the people, and make them responsible citizens. Archaic and unchanging positions make place for illegalities and corruption. Those who govern us get swallowed up in that faulty and dishonest parallel system that betrays all laws and norms that protect civil society. India, unfortunately, has been in the throes of multiple horrors that grew like poisonous weeds and strangled ordinary, law-abiding citizens. We have to work to restore the dignity of living that is our fundamental right.        
	Why did our elected leaders and bureaucracy encourage the dilution of liberty, equality and fraternity? Why were they not excited by inclusive growth? Why did they misuse diversity for personal ends? Why did they allow laws to be mutilated with provisions that allow any creative interpretation to bypass the established rule? Why was no one made publicly accountable for their misdemeanours? Have honesty and integrity become outcastes in our modern social structure?

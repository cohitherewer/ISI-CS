	The English Civil wars: 1640-1660 By Blair Worden, Weidenfeld amp; Nicolson, Rs 695        
	The history that was made in England between 1640 and 1660 remains epochal because it was the first time that a monarch was beheaded as an expression of popular will and protest; it was also the first experiment with republican government. Regicide and republicanism made many historians see the events of those 20 years as a revolution. Other historians have seen the events as the expression of a country at war with itself. Hence the term, the English Civil War. Blair Worden, in this delightful little book, introduces the term, Civil Wars. He explains his use of the plural noun thus: The civil war will mean the war fought between king and parliament in 1642-6. The civil wars will mean the range of conflicts, military and political, of the 1640s and 1650s.        
	The book is divided into five short chapters: Origins, War, Regicide, Republic and Restoration. The emphasis is heavily on political history at which Worden excels. But one looks in vain, say in the chapter, Origins, to learn something about the economic conditions (some would say, crisis) prevailing in the 1620s and 1630s. Similarly, while Worden analyses the political positions adopted by the various groups upholding the cause of parliament, there is scarcely a word about their economic ideology. This is one major lacuna of the book. It is political history at its best, but a kind of political history that believes that the subject can be understood without its interactions with the economy.        
	The author is also very good at separating the strands of religious doctrine and debate that excited contemporaries in the middle of the 17th century. The term, Puritan Revolution, since the time it was first used in the 19th century, has tended to act as a kind of holdall. Worden separates the various strands and where they stood against episcopacy. He does this without going into the nitty-gritty of theological doctrines. This is one of the real strengths of the book, and it serves to underscore how strong religious sentiments were in the wars that divided England in the middle of the 17th century.        
	Worden writes with a hint of disapproval about what happened in England in the 17th century. He comes close to upholding the kings cause without quite saying it. He closes the book with the words of a poem written by John Dryden in 1700. Dryden walked with John Milton and Andrew Marvell in Oliver Cromwells funeral procession, but in 1700, looking back, he had written, Thy wars brought nothing about. Worden approves of this assessment.        
	This raises a few questions. Did the Royalists actually regain the throne that Charles needlessly lost? Worden seems to think so. But surely the throne to which Charles II ascended was not the same one from which his father had ruled. The terms of power had been radically altered. The significance of this change was demonstrated in the Settlement of 1688, which Worden seems to think was unconnected with the events that engulfed England between 1640 and 1660.        
	Historians may have overstated their case by calling the events a revolution. It would be a similar kind of exaggeration to conclude on the other side that the events signified nothing. There is meaning in failure. History, as a great historian of the 17th century, for whom Worden has much time, said, is tragedy, although not a meaningless one.

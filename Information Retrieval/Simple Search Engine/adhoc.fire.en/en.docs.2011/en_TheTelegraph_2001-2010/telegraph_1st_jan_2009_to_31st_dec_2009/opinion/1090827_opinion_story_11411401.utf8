The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | a new tune
                                                                                                                 A NEW TUNE                                                    
	One of the signs of insecurity is the inability to say mea culpa. This is as true for governments and political parties as for individuals. The government of India has a pronounced propensity for not admitting errors. Any such admission is seen as more than weakness: it is seen as a betrayal of the nation. Look at the furore that has been created because the prime minister, in the joint statement with Pakistan, allowed the mention of Indias role in Baluchistan. The prime minister may have had any number of reasons for doing this  from using it as a bargaining chip to a sincere gesture of goodwill. But the entire foreign-policy establishment in India  which includes present diplomats, past ones, pundits, Pakistan watchers et al  has said, openly or piano, that Manmohan Singh has let the side down rather badly. It is worth noting that in a country like the United States of America, the errors of the government, be it the bombing in Vietnam or the attack on Iraq, have all originated within the establishment. In India, the critical eye shuts itself on matters of foreign policy and especially so if the country concerned is Pakistan. This is evidence of a mindset that is blinkered and therefore immature.        
	The prime ministers comment must be seen in the context of what he wants to achieve. His aim is to establish peace with Pakistan. He believes that to achieve this if it is necessary to admit some of Indias errors, including covert action in Baluchistan, than that is a very minor price tag. This does not make him a weak prime minister, but a strong one with a vision. Mr Singh is concerned with the welfare of India and of Indians. To this end, he transformed the Indian economy and put it on the fast track of growth; he radically altered the configuration of Indo-US relations and nuclear co-operation; and now he is laying the groundwork for a lasting peace with Pakistan. These aims and achievements can hardly be described as the work of a weak prime minister. The other point that has been made against Mr Singh is that he bypassed the bureaucracy and thereby embarrassed some of its key members. The bureaucrat is a civil servant. He works for the prime minister and his cabinet. The prime minister was indicating a shift in policy and approach. Civil servants will have to march to the new tune, instead of following an antique drum.

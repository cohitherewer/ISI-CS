	Festive season                  
	Sir  The worlds largest functioning democracy, India, is experiencing its greatest political carnival. As the elections continue, various television channels are airing their views on the electoral process. A major force in the country today is the youth, and the young generation is making its presence felt through the visual media. As I was watching the Indian youth in the various chat shows and road shows being conducted on television, I was reminded of the elections during my own youthful days.          
	What did the election mean to me then? As a person who had just achieved the magic age of twenty-one, I looked upon the elections as a festival made all the more attractive by the fact that it came only once in five years. It was also a time when leaders whom we had previously seen only in posters or magazines descended into our small worlds with bouquets of bright smiles and false promises. I recall my parents and the candidates greeting one another courteously at the door and the candidates moving on once they had been assured of the prized vote.          
	For me, the elections meant holidays made doubly alluring by the Hindi films telecast by Doordarshan while the counting took place. Our eyes used to be fixed on the TV screen as Shammi Kapoor rolled down the snow-capped mountainsides of Kashmir yelling yaaahoo in Junglee, Guru Dutt played the disillusioned poet in Pyassa or Dilip Kumar cracked his whip on Pran in Ram aur Shyam. In between the films, there would be the breaks for election analyses. Call it innocence or ignorance, but the election results did not matter to me at all. I never had the enthusiasm of todays youth for the electoral process.           
	But it is good that young people nowadays are so enthusiastic about the elections. Election has its good and bad points, but it must be acknowledged that it is necessary to bring about reforms. India is called a functional democracy because once in five years we are given the power to elect a candidate suitable for the task of governing the nation. By casting our votes, we turn the fortunes of the candidates. The youth and the aged, irrespective of their caste, faith or class, should not waste this unique power vested in them. They should vote to lead the nation to progress and development. As M.K. Gandhi said, A small body of determined spirits fired by an unquenchable faith in their mission can alter the course of history.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  In this years general elections, voter turnout is not exceeding even 50 per cent in most states. The significance of the number, 273, needed to form a government at the Centre, is getting diminished by the dismal percentage of people exercising their franchise. On top of the peoples lack of interest in the elections, as more and more new political groups and parties mushroom at the national and state level, it will be increasingly difficult for a single party to get a majority. The present rule that the number, 273, be reached to form the Central government has resulted in the mayhem of coalition politics. Several small parties are joining hands to add up to 273. Even if a major party misses the mark narrowly, it will have to make way for a coalition of various minor parties.           
	But this goes against the accepted law that the majority is authority. Keeping this rational, logical and universally acceptable law in mind, our constitutional authorities must change the methodology for the formation of governments, both at the Centre and the states. Ideally, we must honour the single largest party as the government. This system alone ensures absolute freedom to political parties to function for five years without fear. The people, on their part, are saved from toppling games, from the hassle of mid-term polls, and from the wastage of time and money that they entail. If the present system is allowed to prevail, coalition politics will become the rule. This, in turn, will result in India remaining a developing country forever since political partnerships would not allow it to join the rank of developed nations.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The Supreme Court has ordered the Election Commission to ensure free access for all, including the disabled, to the polling booths in the 15th Lok Sabha elections. But there has been no advertising in the media or notices by the EC with regard to the same. Most people have been informed of the Supreme Court ruling by NGOs or disability groups. The disabled population of India has hitherto been largely left outside the electoral process on the basis of certain impairments. In spite of being a marginalized group, the disabled have not received the attention of political parties as other marginalized groups have. At the same time, it is encouraging that for the first time in Indian history, this time almost every major political party has mentioned certain measures to be undertaken for the benefit of the disabled in its manifesto. It is indeed a watershed year for campaigners for the rights of the disabled.          
	The disabled have been shunned from the mainstream and have been denied basic human rights for long. It is time we realize the importance of their inclusion in everyday life. We must come forward to allow disabled persons exercise their rights and lead a life of dignity. Democracy will be strengthened and the position of the disabled reinforced within the society if they are brought into the political system as legitimate stakeholders.                    
	Yours faithfully,

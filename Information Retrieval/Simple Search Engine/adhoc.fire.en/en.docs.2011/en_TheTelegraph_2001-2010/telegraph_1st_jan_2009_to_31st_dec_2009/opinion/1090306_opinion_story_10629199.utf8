                                                                                                                 KEEP THE FOCUS                                                    
	Excellence lies in knowing ones limits, and doggedly maintaining the best standards within those limits. Institutions of higher education, like Jawaharlal Nehru University and the University of Hyderabad, were set up as centres of postgraduate learning and research (except for a few undergraduate courses at JNU), and this is how they have made, and kept, their mark. Now the chancellor of JNU is proposing an expansion into full-fledged undergraduate teaching. The universitys reputation, in India and abroad, is established enough for it to think of venturing into this terrain. But academic excellence does not grow as, say, businesses grow. And the makers of decisions and policies in JNU should think very hard about their institutions raison dtre before giving in to the funding-driven allure of expansion. Postgraduate and research institutions exist all over the world as centres of excellence precisely because of the narrowness of their focus. In terms of vision, pedagogy and infrastructure, these institutions are nurtured by a highly specialized ethos  think of All Souls College, Oxford, or Princetons Institute of Advanced Study  the dilution and diversification of which through expansion into other levels of teaching would be no less than disastrous, or even tragic.        
	Conversely, if reputed undergraduate colleges, like Calcuttas Presidency College, had concentrated purely on undergraduate teaching, improving and refining themselves to that end (like St Stephens, Delhi, or the various St Xaviers Colleges in India) without frittering away their resources by offering half-baked and badly organized postgraduate courses, then they would have done Indian higher education a world of good. Expansion tends to level down the idiosyncratic character of special institutions to a sad and uninspiring sort of State-controlled uniformity. If the JNU expansion happens and is then turned into a norm, taken up by the Centre, for all universities, forcing them to conform to extending the levels of teaching offered, then that would be quite the wrong way for educational institutions to change and grow. Universities cannot be forced to alter their character simply because of arbitrary shifts in Central policies, irrespective of the individual vision behind each institution. Sometimes the best sort of progress is to solidly remain the same.

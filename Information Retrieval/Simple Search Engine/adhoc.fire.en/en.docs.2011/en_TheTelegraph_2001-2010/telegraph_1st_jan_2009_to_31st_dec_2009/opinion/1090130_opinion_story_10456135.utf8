	It runs in the family, after all                
	Bindi Babes (Random House, Rs 150) by Narinder Dhami is a tale of three supercool Brit-Punjabi sisters, Geena, Amber and Jazz. The sisters, aged 14, 11 and 10 respectively, are what all schoolgirls envy and all schoolboys desire. They carry the latest gizmos, don the best designer outfits, flaunt the trendiest accessories, look stunning, act like superwomen, and talk smart. They rate boys on a scale of ten and never hesitate to make a pass. But then comes Auntieji from India and, with their widower fathers silent assent, tries to make the girls mature, adult and the worst of all, perfect. Off go the pizzas and takeaway food, and roti-sabzi fills the platter; midnight TV shows are banned because of homework and an early bedtime. Amber cannot buy a new pair of trainers because Auntie wrongly thinks that six pairs are enough. After being stalked by the sari division of the SAS for some time, the sisters make an ingenious plan  to marry off their aunt. But the plan is foiled, and the girls realize their mistakes. Now they embrace Indian values gladly, and, quite predictably, allow their Auntie to stay on with them. This slim volume of crossover-chicklit promises light-hearted delight, but has nothing new to offer.                        
	Family values (Penguin, Rs 325) by Abha Dawesar is about a small-town society as seen by a young boy. The characters, including the boy himself, remain nameless. The people are given only nicknames, as if they do no have distinct identities of their own. Their lives are riddled with diseases and hypocrisies. The characters preoccupation with physical discomfort and uncleanliness are repeatedly mentioned to suggest the meanness and dirtiness of their minds. Amidst another persons piss, another persons shit, another persons dirty green phlegm, another persons red rash the child protagonist observes how his Grandfather insults his sons and daughters, how Uncle tries to swindle money, and how the family disintegrates. Yet, there is an oasis of grace that the boy finds in his parents love and care for each other. The brief interludes of optimism hardly cheer up the readers of this dark and depressing novel.                        
	Beyond the Blues: a Cricket Season like no other (HarperCollins, Rs 295) by Aakash Chopra collates excerpts from the cricketers diary written between September 2007 and May 2008. This has been a phenomenal period for Indian cricket and for this cricketer as well. Not only did Chopras teams, Delhi and the North Zone, win spectacularly in the Ranji Trophy and the Duleep Trophy respectively, but Chopra himself also scored 1139 runs in 15 matches in the season. Next came his selection for the Kolkata Knight Riders team in the Indian Premier League, where the glamour of Bollywood mingled with the brilliance of Indian and international cricket. The first-hand accounts of dressing-room gossip or field tactics are delectable treats for any cricket-lover interested in details beyond scores and statistics.                                  
	Fascinating Hindutva: Saffron politics and Dalit mobilisation (Sage, Rs 295) by Badri Narayan provides a scholarly insight into the difficult relationship between the politics of Hindutva and the Dalit communities of India. The essays look at the history of saffron outfits such as the BJP, the sangh parivar, and the VHP in different states. They also assess the relevance of the Dalit parties and the secular institutions to Indias social and political fabric. There are interesting discussions on the appropriation of national assets such as the Ramayan by the saffron brigade, the role of the media in communal segregation, and the deification of mythical lower-caste figures like Nishadraj Ekalavya in Uttar Pradesh, which is ruled by a Dalit chief minister.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Fertilizer for the soul
                                                                                                                 FERTILIZER FOR THE SOUL                                  This above all - Khushwant Singh                          Left is right                                        
	While reading Rumis Mathnavi, I came across an anecdote that very aptly describes what common people should do to well-to-do misers who refuse to give anything to the needy.         
	A dervish knocked at the door of a house and asked for a piece of bread. This is not a bakery, replied the houseowner. Can you give me a scrap of meat then? asked the dervish. Does this look like a butchers shop? asked the owner. Perhaps a little flour? Do you hear a flour-mill grinding? came the reply. At least some water, I am thirsty, begged the dervish. This is not a well, snapped the owner.        
	In short, no matter what the dervish asked for, the owner of the big house turned him down with a sneer. Ultimately, the dervish ran into the house, lifted his robe and squatted on his haunches to defecate. Hay, hay, shouted the houseowner, what are you doing?        
	Making shit, replied the dervish. Your house is barren, so it is a good place to relieve myself. Your soul needs some fertilizer and I am giving it to you.                
	A great humorist                
	Sagar Khayyami was the best writer of humorous Urdu verse in his day. He died some time back. When the doctors told his wife that his time had come, she was very depressed. In the meantime, their son arrived and asked his mother why she was so sad. Before she could say anything, Sagarsaheb said, Ill tell you. The nurse has said I look very handsome. Father and son smiled. Earlier in the day, when the nurse had come to draw blood for some test, he had said, How much more will you take? I am already on reserve.        
	Such was his compulsive sense of humour that remained intact even at the time of death. It reminds me of Oscar Wilde, who, when given champagne on his death bed, remarked: John, I am dying beyond my means.        
	I give two examples of Khayyamis verse:                
	Jhoot kehne ki to aadat hee nahin, Sagar mujhey/ Baat sach hai, is liye kehta hoon seena taan kay/ Is sey barh kar dostee ki aur kya hogee misaal/ Hai zubaan Hindustan kee, daant Pakistan key.                
	I am not given to telling lies at all, Sagar/ It is true and therefore I say with a bang/ What better example of friendship could you have, come on,/         
	My tongue is Indian, my teeth are from Pakistan.        
	And         
	Sagar, tumhaarey mulk kaa ulta nizaam hai/ Jo hai makaame-subeh, vahaan ho rahee shaam hai.                
	O Sagar, everything in your country is topsy-turvy/ Where it should be morning, it is evening there.                
	Engineer kareyga agar doctor ka kaam/ To samjho mareez ki hai zindagi tamaam/ Roney lagaa mareez faqat itna bol key/ Zaalim kahaan challa gayaa nutbolt khol key.                
	If the engineer acts as a doctor, then surely/ The life of the patient will be in jeopardy;/ The patient said only this and started crying/ Where has the tyrant gone after opening my nut bolts,/ I am dying.

	Point to ponder                
	We are yet to solve the mystery of why nearly 10 per cent of us are left-handed (khabchoos) from birth. Far from being handicapped, as southpaws they are brighter, better in sports than the other 90 per cent of the population. Just watch the Wimbledon and you will see that a high proportion of left-handed tennis players make it to the quarter finals.         
	In Americas White House, Barack Obama, its latest occupier, is left-handed. So are Bush (Senior), Clinton and Reagan. As a matter of fact, for 20 of the past 28 years, America has been ruled mostly by the left-handed. Two of the least respected previous presidents, Jimmy Carter and George Bush, are right-handed. One wonders why left-handers make up such a high percentage of achievers.                
	Flying Sikh                
	A thief broke into the house of the flying Sikh, Milkha Singh, in the early hours of the morning. He hit into something in the dark. The sound woke up Milkha Singh. The thief ran out. Milkha put on his running shoes to chase the thief.         
	A few minutes later, a friend of Milkha Singh on his morning walk found that Milkha was not jogging as usual, but running like mad. He stopped him and asked, Oye Milkhey, kitthey dauri ja rehaan, shudaiyan vakan? (Where are going, running like mad?)         
	Milkha stopped and replied with a smile, O, chor aa gaya see mere ghar (One thief came to my house). Kitthe hai chor? (Where is the thief ?) enquired the friend.         
	Merey samney daur reha see, main onu do meel pichhe chhor aya wan (He was running in front of me but I have left him two miles behind), replied Milkha jubilantly.

	Clean up the mess                  
	Sir  It seems that there is a huge gap between professing good corporate governance and its actual practice (Countering crookedness, Feb 9). The recent fiasco over hiving off corporate funds by one of the leading information-technology companies in India has thrown open the issue of good corporate governance. Is it at all possible to trust the role of the managers in Indian companies, despite the presence of independent directors on the boards of companies in accordance with clause 49 of the listing agreement of stock exchanges with all companies?           
	The problem is no longer confined to Satyam alone. It is about corporate governance standards across India. Forgery could not have been done by one man, without the knowledge of anyone else. There must have been a team working behind the Satyam fraud. The external body of directors, auditors, rating agencies and merchant bankers cannot get away with putting the shareholders and investors at a huge loss. S.L. Rao has rightly demanded speedier and more severe penalties than laws allow to be imposed on those who helped such gross violations to occur. The government should work with the Securities and Exchange Board of India and come up with a plausible solution to this menace without delay.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Pooja Gupta, Howrah

                
	Sir  I think S.L. Rao puts undue stress on corporate governance, which, in any real sense, is difficult to achieve. On one hand, he would like to see independent directors raise their voices against malpractices going on in the company, while on the other, he presses for not-so-lucrative payments to the independent directors. Rao would do well to remember that in this world nobody is a saint, and any governing body has to frame policies with this fact in mind. If independent directors are not handsomely paid, why would they perform? Moreover, the risk of collusion with crooked promoters will remain as long as they are paid by the companies. Instead of putting the emphasis on corporate governance, we should concentrate on regulatory issues, which in due course would help bring more transparency in the corporate sector.           
	For instance, the practice of pledging promoter shares, and getting money in exchange of this, should go immediately. In the Satyam case, it has been found that in order to maintain share prices at a particular rate, Ramalinga Raju resorted to fudging the companys accounts. If this pledging of shares is stopped, then chances of unduly inflated figures in the accounts will be minimized. Rao, however, has made one laudable suggestion, that auditors must be recruited and paid by regulatory bodies like the Sebi. Ultimately, the intervention of the government or other regulatory bodies in corporate affairs, especially where huge amounts of public money is invested, is becoming inevitable. This would bring the end of deregulation not only in India but also the rest of the world. The Centre should consider these measures while amending the Companies Act, 1956.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Minor power          
	Sir  Ashok V. Desai in Energetic flailing (Feb 10) proposes that there should be a second House of Parliament that would be elected by the taxpayers of India. This body, Desai suggests, would have a say in how revenues should be spent. Interestingly, in this scheme, a dishonest tax evader could return a pending sum of income tax and be allowed to have a say on important policies and decisions related to spending the revenue. Money will, yet again, dictate the workings of democracy. Another kind of flailing would then begin. India is an economy overburdened with a growing population. Millions do not earn enough to be taxed on their incomes. Before we go ahead with Desais idea, we should first make sure that all citizens earn enough to be able to pay tax.           
	Yours faithfully,       
R. Subhranshu, Chandernagore 

                
	Sir  Ashok Desai raises interesting questions about the Indian democratic process, about its politicians and government servants, most of whom, as he puts it, come from the bottom of the drain. There is no argument that the quality, character and background of todays bureaucrats are a far cry from the days of the Indian Civil Service. Perhaps democracy has given opportunities today to sections that would never have made it to the ICS in those pre-democratic days. However, there is another reason behind this decline. The better-educated and more competent young people prefer not to join the public sector or the politics not only because of the lower pay and murkiness, but also because of structures and processes that are out of line with the ethos of the 21st century.           
	However, these young men and women are also the new minority in India. This is a class that is successful educationally and professionally, and forms the bedrock of the secular, modern Indian republic, and is leading the countrys growth. But the tastes, preferences and aspirations of these young people are far removed from the sections where democratic representatives  the politicians and bureaucrats  come from. To this new minority the majority of the Indian taxpayers belong as well.           
	Desai has remarked that in modern India, politicians and bureaucrats do not represent the consumers of government services. So we need a new institution to represent them. He has provocatively suggested that this function can be best carried out by representatives of taxpayers, who actually pay for their services. Out of Indias population of 1.1 billion, eligible taxpayers number about 13 million, and less than 3 million pay their taxes. Unlike the developed countries, here it is absurd for taxpayers to expect public services for the taxes they pay. A new institution of taxpayers would only impose a tiny minority over the free ride of the able-majority to whom democracy has given power.          
	Yours faithfully,

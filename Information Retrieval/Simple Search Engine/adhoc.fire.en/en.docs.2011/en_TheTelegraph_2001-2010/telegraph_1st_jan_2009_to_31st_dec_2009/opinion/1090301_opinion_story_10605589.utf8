                              Strict measures      
	 It was wonderful to have Somnath Chatterjee as Speaker, and wonderful not to have him around too. Had a puritan like him been on the Speakers chair in the Rajya Sabha the other day, things would have turned out quite differently for SS Ahluwalia. The Bharatiya Janata Party MP was caught whispering to his party colleagues that they should find something to object to, raise a scene, and walk out. Ahluwalia was perhaps a tad bored with the proceedings and wanted desperately to step out. But in the heat of the moment, Ahluwalia didnt realize that the microphone in front of him was on and his strategy had been transmitted, right across the floor of the House, to the Speaker. An enraged member of the House threw down his headphones and jumped up, alleging that Ahluwalia was murdering democracy. Had Chatterjee been in the chair, one would have feared for Ahluwalias fate.                          
	 A race is on among Congressmen to please 10 Janpath. One way to do this is by initiating or reviving some government project in Amethi or Rae Bareli, currently represented by Sonia and Rahul Gandhi. Those sincerely trying their luck are loyalists like Sushil Kumar Shinde, Murli Deora, Mani Shankar Aiyar and young Jitin Prasada. There is one notable absentee though  the minister of state for IT and communications, Jyotiraditya Scindia. Congress leaders at 24 Akbar Road have not been able to fathom this mystery. But for Scindia, quite clearly, time is running out.                             
	 Politics makes for strange bedfellows. Which is why, despite allying with the Left, J Jayalalithaa finds no problem in sending out feelers to the Congress. The Congress is, however, more keen to have an alliance with the DMDK, but since Vijayakanth is not showing much interest, it is weighing its options whether it should continue its alliance with the DMK or risk another tea party with Jayalalithaa. In the east, Mamata Banerjee, though warming up to Madams overtures for an alliance, has made it clear that she wants no post-poll truck with the Left  which may pose a problem. Pranab Mukherjee, who now strides the political firmament, wants Madam to keep her options open, as a post-poll support from the Left may be crucial for the UPA.                            
	 Mayavati first announced Salim Ahmad as her partys Lok Sabha nominee from Kanpur, and then replaced him with former BJP leader, Sukhda Mishra. A former MP from Etawah and a former MLA, Mishra has been a minister of state. Ahmad is obviously cut up over the choice, but as a loyal and faithful party worker, he has announced that he will abide by behenjis decree. Veterans in the Congress, the BJP and the Samajwadi Party have not stopped talking about it since then. Many were heard wondering about the state of affairs in their own parties and lamenting where such committed members in their rank and file have gone. Someone quipped, BSP.                            
	 Having worked out his own magic formula to keep the Indian Railways on the right track, Lalu Prasad now has one for the Bihar elections as well  22-13-5. He wants his own Rashtriya Janata Dal to contest 22 seats, Ram Vilas Paswan, who has been constantly bothering him for more share of seats, will have 13, and the Congress 5. Lalu has apparently communicated this to Paswan and also told the latter that he is going to use every bit of his influence to get more seats for Paswan outside Bihar. The bait is to pitch him against Mayavati. But the wise men in the Lok Janshakti Party have been asking Paswan to stay away from the formula. To start with, LJPs past record outside Bihar is nothing to write home about. Besides, the fact that Lalu is still hobnobbing with controversial characters like Shahabuddin to fetch him seats shows that he has lost confidence in his own might. Will then Lalu be derailed in Bihar?                             
	 The ongoing UPA media blitz may improve the revenue earnings of media organizations, but it is pinching the players in the civil aviation sector, and not just the public ones. The minister concerned, Praful Patel, has played ball with a number of these private organizations for the past five years, and expects them to pick up the tab for advertising his good work. That explains the full-page ads of his ministry sponsored by as many as 12 different, but major, public and private enterprises. As the old adage goes, friends in deed at times also have to be friends in need.         Footnote              
	 Film-makers are people of many parts. Prakash Jha is planning to contest the Lok Sabha elections from Bettiah in Bihar. Other than the LJP, other UPA parties are yet to give him the green signal. But that hasnt deterred him. Much of his enthusiasm has to do with the fact that he has a formidable campaign team ready. No less than Katrina Kaif and Ajay Devgan have promised to campaign for the director, irrespective of the party he chooses to represent.       
	Kaif and Devgan are part of his Rajneeti, being shot at Bhopal, where, as the films name suggests, a lot of homework is also being done. The actors insist that though they do not endorse any party or have a political stand, they will do their bit for their director, whose social work after the Bihar floods have impressed both the stars. Devgan is believed to have followed Jhas rehabilitation campaign in west Champaran. Social work done, politics has to follow, naturally.

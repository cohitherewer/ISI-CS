	Freedom to choose                  
	Sir  Cambridge Universitys decision to allow women to wear the burqa below their mortar boards came as a pleasant surprise (Safely covered, Nov 2). A burqa may mean different things to different people. For some, it is a sign of respect. As a Muslim woman, I started wearing the burqa four years back, and I am happy with my decision. For some others, like Nicolas Sarkozy, it is a sign of servitude. People may have varying opinions, but it is important that women be given the freedom to decide whether they want to wear the burqa or not.

	Unbalanced views          
	Sir  The media were full of praise for Sachin Tendulkars superb knock in Hyderabad (Sachin keeps raising bar, Nov 6). But there was hardly a word of appreciation for the inexperienced Australian bowling attack, which prevented Indias star batsmen from getting the required runs. Neither was there any praise for the Australian captain, Ricky Ponting, who continued to put up a brave fight and emerged victorious against heavy odds. At Vadodara, the Indian off-spinner, Harbhajan Singh, had said that the home side will win the one-day series 5-2. One wonders what his views are at present, now that the results have swung the other way round.          
	The medias coverage of the matches was highly biased. The Australian batsman, Michael Hussey, had a consistent strike rate of approximately 100 all along the series, but his remarkable achievement was totally ignored. Instead of going overboard with praise, the Indian media should be balanced in their reporting.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Sachin Tendulkars gallant knock of 175 runs in the fifth one-day international against Australia is a testimony to his genius, physical fitness and iron determination. Unfortunately, despite playing a number of such memorable innings, Tendulkar, barring a few occasions, has not managed to win matches for India. The Little Master is a great batsman, so it is natural for Indian fans to have high expectations from him. Scoring 175 out of a teams total of 347 runs is not a matter of joke. However, Tendulkars heroics could not quite help India win the crucial match. All this will perhaps force one to appreciate the wisdom of the proverb, Alls well that ends well, even more.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Tall claims          
	Sir  The day the article, Prod for riverfront project (Nov 6), appeared in The Telegraph, the Hiland group distributed an eight-page, colour brochure in Bengali as well as in English with newspapers in Batas Maheshtala area through local vendors. The brochures reaffirmed the groups commitment to benefit not only the community within but also the neighbouring areas. Unfortunately, despite its assurances, the sad truth is that the group has not undertaken any community development work since the chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, inaugurated the project in February 2006. This gives the impression that unless compelled, the group will not act on its promise.          
	Now it seems that Bengals land and land reforms minister, Abdur Rezzak Mollah, has suddenly woken up from his slumber and enquired about the state of affairs. Mollahs renewed interest perhaps has to do something with his partys poor performance in the recently-held elections. Mollahs name had cropped up in the Vedic Village episode. One wonders whether he will ask for the deal to be scrapped if skeletons come tumbling out this time around as well.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	The government has announced plans to sell shares of 60 public enterprises to the public. It could not do so earlier on account of the support the Congress needed from the communists to rule. The planned disinvestment is the first use of its liberation from the leftist shackles that the Congress has made. It is not a revolutionary measure; the Congress has been disinvesting since 1992, when the present prime minister was finance minister. There is a modest element of radicalism in the first sale of shares to the public in an enterprise fully owned by the government. If it has all the shares, the government can do what it likes with the enterprise. If it sells some to private shareholders, they will expect that the enterprise is well managed, and that some of its profits would be paid to shareholders as dividends. The government does not have to meet those expectations; if it mismanages an enterprise or uses it for its own purposes, all that will happen is that the price of the companys shares will collapse. So the government does not lose any of its freedom just because it sells a minority stake. It may have some pangs of conscience if it treats minority shareholders badly; but the inconvenience is not major.        
	Even that inconvenience does not arise if the government has already sold a minority stake and sells some more shares without letting its own share sink below 51 per cent. Doing so is an extremely convenient operation because the government gets some money out of private shareholders without ceding anything. It cannot, of course, go on doing so, for at some point its share must get so close to 50 per cent that if it sold more, it might run the risk of losing control. The risk is not great, and it can be reduced by placing the shares in such a way that the private shareholders will not unite or will not want to share in control. So the government would be serving its own interests at little cost to itself by selling small stakes. It has decided to do so now because the budget season is on; it is at budget time that finance ministers think of raising money by fair means or foul. The government has also announced that it will spend the proceeds on social services. This is pure eyewash. The government has one big treasury; all the money it receives pours into it, and all the money it spends goes out of it. There are no names written on the money; it is quite impossible to say that money received from disinvestment went to some particular landless worker. This point is so elementary that it cannot be beyond the finance minister, let alone the prime minister. There is no mileage in hoodwinking the public; it is best avoided.

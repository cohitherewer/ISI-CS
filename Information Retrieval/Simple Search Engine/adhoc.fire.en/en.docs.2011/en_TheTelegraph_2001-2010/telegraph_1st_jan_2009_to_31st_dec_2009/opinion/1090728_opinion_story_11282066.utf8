The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Dining with the dragon
                                                                                                                 DINING WITH THE DRAGON                                  Europe has chosen to ignore its commitment to human rights and democracy while preparing to do business with China, writes Ashok Ganguly                          The Chinese president with the Italian premier in Rome, July 2009                                        
	During the course of a visit to Beijing, I was interviewed by the English-language television channel, CCTV (Channel 9). The interview took place a few weeks after the terrorist attack in Mumbai on November 26 last year. The interviewer rsquo;s main focus was on that particular attack, and his questions primarily dealt with whether the Mumbai attack had really originated in Pakistan or it had been plotted and carried out locally. 
    
	Notwithstanding my rebuttal with facts and figures of the events that I had witnessed, the interviewer persisted with his line of questioning. I found his insistence somewhat strange, and asked him whether he had any specific agenda on his mind. The exchanges during the interview were congenial and, at the end, I was pleased to have been able to persist with my views throughout the interview. We also talked about issues such as the Indian economy, the global downturn and a few other current topics. On the whole, I thought that the interview had gone off well.   
	The interviewer told me that the interview would be telecast the next day at a particular time and that I should see it. The next morning, I received a message that the telecast had been postponed because some portions of the interview had been deemed sensitive. I had heard of it, but this was my first experience of Chinese media censorship. Soon after, I left for India with the impression that the interview would never be telecast as it did not fit in with the Chinese perception of the terrorist attack on Mumbai. I was reminded of this episode by the current unrest in Xinjiang and the Chinese media management of the events there.              
	Notwithstanding uprisings in Tibet and Xinjiang and the planned growth of the ethnic Han population in these regions, as well as the sporadic reports of suppression of disturbances triggered by unemployment and economic difficulties in other parts of China, the countrys global image continues to expand. Admiration for China remains unsullied the world over. The growing admiration for China is particularly noteworthy in Europe, which now seriously views the country not only as a competitor of the United States of America but also as a nation that will eventually overtake the US as the global superpower. Frequent articles in the media by well- known China watchers and commentators have the rise of China as the pet theme in their descriptions of each and every event taking place in that country.         
	One can detect a growing unwillingness to address human rights violation in China. There has also been a gradual muting of the criticism directed at the one-party communist rule under the Peoples Liberation Army. The Great Leap Forward, Tiananmen Square, Tibet, Xinjiang and so on are now increasingly being considered as local events that can take place in any country. The silence in the world press on human rights violation and on the absence of democracy in China is indeed stunning. The rapidly growing admiration for the economic rise and resilience of China even at the time of the turbulent global economic downturn is understandable and laudable. Moreover, the gradual tarnishing of Americas image is seen in Europe with a degree of glee, considering the long and strained ties between the continents dating back to the Second World War. The strain has been compounded by the mess in Iraq and by what looks like an unwinnable conflict in Afghanistan. These recent events have revived memories of the Korean and Vietnam wars, and are seen as signs of Americas waning influence as a superpower by many Europeans. Even the sudden departure of President Hu Jintao from LAquila in Italy before the commencement of the G8 summit was seen in a positive light. His departure was interpreted as a sign that only the president had the authority to order the PLA to quell the uprising in Xinjiang. Hu Jintaos decision to return to China was described in the media as the president getting his priorities right. It was agreed that even in his absence, he would cast an overwhelming influence on the deliberations of the G8.        
	Europe is now gearing up to do even more serious business with China where it sees opportunities, which will grow by leaps and bounds in the coming decades. Besides a number of commercial and political initiatives, Europe now wants its younger generation to become familiar and fluent in Mandarin, which is likely to become a key component in school curricula. Already, the leading universities in the United Kingdom have large and well-endowed departments of China Studies. These are likely to spread to other institutions of higher learning. The yuan is gradually being acknowledged as an emerging reality more widely. Some commentators have suggested that the yuan may replace the dollar as the dominant currency some day.        
	In many Chinese media reports, India gets a mention in the sidelines in acknowledgement of its economic performance. But nowhere in the European media is there any hint of China facing a challenge towards becoming a global superpower. The only cloud hovering in the horizon is the use of climate change as a means of checking the unabated economic march of China and India              
	After one has read a number of such articles, it becomes apparent that the European mercantile mindset has chosen a path of pragmatism in which trade and commerce overshadow the lofty commitments to human rights, democracy and the rule of law. There are occasional expressions of concern regarding the one-party rule in China. The media also wonder whether the curbing of individual rights and freedom is sustainable in the long run. This may not necessarily reflect a concern for the Chinese people, the Tibetans or the Uighurs but it is in fact a reflection of the fear that any disturbance in the Chinese political set-up will be bad for business.        
	One could dismiss all this as the realities of realpolitik. Nevertheless, the assumption of the Europeans regarding China needs to be noted by India and other countries, which will face the impact of Europes changing perceptions vis--vis China. Almost, as if in preparation, China itself is rapidly spreading its wings in Sri Lanka, Myanmar and Nepal. In addition to this, there is the special relationship with Pakistan and the spread of its influence in Africa.         
	Thus, even as China marches ahead with its economy growing at a rapid clip and the country casts its strategic shadow across a large part of the world, Europe is getting ready to share the spoils even if it means that it will have to do business in Mandarin.

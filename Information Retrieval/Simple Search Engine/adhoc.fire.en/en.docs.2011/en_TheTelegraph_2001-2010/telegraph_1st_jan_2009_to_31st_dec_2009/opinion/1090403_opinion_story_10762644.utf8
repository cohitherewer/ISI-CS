The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | turning into a monster
                                                                                                                 TURNING INTO A MONSTER                                  BONA FIDE - MALVIKA SINGH                              
	The phased elections that begin on April 15 have managed to create many monstrous political dalals  brokers  who are desperately changing partners and therefore alliances, as they scurry about doing their sums to survive in their shaky seats that make them powerful. Unfortunately, they have not used their power to empower the less privileged constituents in the assemblies of India and Bharat, but instead have indulged in false rhetoric and predictable platitudes, attempting to fool the people. Television is starting to expose their motives, their personalized aspirations, their greed and their intellectual corruption. As a result, with our leaders setting the national standards, dalali has become a lucrative and fast-growing profession with much innovation to adjust to the changing times and unusual demands. The agenda for India has been forgotten in the process. Will the Indian voter save this civilization from further decay?        
	Many refer to the forthcoming tamasha at the hustings as a semi-final because no one has been able to fathom the mind of India. Having sharpened the divisions in society by compelling choices based on caste, creed, faith and economics, the political class has managed well to fragment this nation. This has been the singlemost destructive reality, one that encourages deadly interventions by unsavoury and radical militant forces. An India polarized by the reactionary politics of both the Left as well as the nationalist Right has been forced into a vulnerable space by opportunist leaders trying to jockey for power at all cost without any real and inclusive strategies to alleviate the vast array of horrors that confronts all strata of citizenry, from top to bottom, beset with unholy political beliefs, degenerate values and certainly zero ethics and morality. This truth has made us a weak, faltering nation-state, held to ransom by petty politics, much akin to the exploitative governance of our erstwhile colonial masters.                
	Forward march        
	We now need a change of heart, ideas and action. India deserves better. The abysmal level of debate leaves one ashamed. There is no discourse. There is no radical agenda. There is no issue that seems to ignite passion in our leadership across the board except, of course, slinging vile abuse at each other. Therefore, there is no one in India who respects the majority of our political leaders. Our ruling class has managed to destroy the best of democracy and its traditions. It has, by its negative actions, nurtured and conserved feudalism by operating much like members of an exalted, exclusive durbar. The maharajas of yore commanded far more respect than the political maharajas of today.        
	Our political class needs a ruthless overhaul. The corrupt need to be purged. The baggage needs to be reduced to ashes. We need to rise out of this quagmire of opportunism, corruption, lack of commitment and action, lethargy and selfishness to meet the challenges of a changed environment, a new generation and a shrinking world. Ideas are dead in the political arena of the moment. The same old rubbish is bandied about, the same garbage is flung at our faces, and the same arrogant faces, aging with each passing moment, assault us with their mindlessness. If only we had our own Obamas who could alter the narrative to take our minds, hearts and realities forward!        
	Even our political analysts are caught in the old and redundant rhetoric of assessments based on divisive positions. They ask the same questions to get the same answers. Nobody is willing to deviate from their perches to try and explore the undercurrents. A fresh trajectory is bound to draw India out of this present horror that appears to be unrelenting. How comic the Sharad Pawars and the Karats look. How pathetic their greed and aspiration for power.

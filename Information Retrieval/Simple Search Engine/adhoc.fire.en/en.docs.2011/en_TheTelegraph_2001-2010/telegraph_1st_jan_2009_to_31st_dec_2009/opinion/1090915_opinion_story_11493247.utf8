The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | game sans stars
                                                                                                                 GAME SANS STARS                                                    
	The game is always more important than any individual, no matter how big a star that individual might be. There is the story that in a village cricket match, W.G. Grace, given out first ball, told the umpire that the people had come to see W.G. bat and not see him umpire. The grand old man of cricket, despite all his protestations, had to leave because he was deemed to be out by the laws of cricket. Serena Williams, one of the reigning tsarinas of tennis, was forced out of the US Open on grounds of misbehaviour. Her behaviour was deplorable. She not only challenged an umpires decision but also went on to abuse the umpire and even threatened to shove the ball down the line judges throat. Quite rightly, such behaviour and language were found to be unacceptable and she paid the penalty by losing the match. All that can be said in favour of Ms Williams is that she accepted her punishment with good grace. There are two aspects to this incident that need to be highlighted and commented upon. One is the aggressiveness that produces this kind of behaviour. Modern sport is very competitive, and nobody denies that the faint-hearted and the humble cannot succeed in such an atmosphere. There is, however, a very thick line that demarcates aggression and bad and unsportsmanlike behaviour. Ms Williams overstepped that line. It was much more than a foot fault.        
	The other point is wider and has some relevance to India. The judge at Flushing Meadows had no hesitation in enforcing the rules against one of the greats of tennis who is also the local star. She went by the simple principle that rules apply to everyone without exception. There is an important lesson to learn from this. In India, very often, this principle is not applied when the person in question is a star. Many bowlers have spoken about the difficulties they faced in getting a leg-before-wicket decision against Sunil Gavaskar. Very few umpires in India will have the courage to take disciplinary action against the local hero, Sourav Ganguly, in Eden Gardens. In India, sports stars are treated like prima donnas. Thus, individual stars often become more important than the game. Here examples have been drawn from cricket because cricketers in India have the maximum public following and the more successful among them are made into icons. This does neither the game nor the player any good.

                                                                                                                 JEALOUS GUARD                                                    
	Indira Gandhi, for good reasons, mainly related to political survival, nationalized domestic banks. Although she is long gone, the Reserve Bank of India continues jealously to look after them. Being run by bureaucracies, they are not particularly helpful or enterprising. So it protects them against entrepreneurs who are good at serving the public. Banks charges are high, and their reach limited. In recent years, private entrepreneurs found a better way of meeting peoples banking requirements. People have to pay bills for their cellphone charges every once in a while. Entrepreneurs told them that they could use their cellphones to pay shopkeepers, and then pay their charges as part of the monthly cellphone bills. That made the cellphone a variant of a credit card. Just about a thousand times as many people have cellphones as have credit cards; even penniless rickshaw-pullers have a cellphone these days. So cellphones made it possible to bring banking to the common man.        
	But that did not suit the RBI, which poses as the ultimate guardian of nationalized banks interests. So it took powers to license the new business, and circulated a discussion paper which proposed that the business should be a monopoly of banks. It is under no obligation to tell who and how many protested against its restrictive practices. But there were no doubt some muted protests, for now the RBI has accommodated non-bank issuers to some extent. They have not been banned. But while banks would be allowed to issue mobile-based credit cards, non-banks would be allowed to issue only semi-closed instruments which could be used only in a few designated shops. Non-banks would not be allowed to give any credit, whereas banks would be. The maximum expenditure their clients would be allowed to make without recharging their account will be limited to Rs 10,000 or less. Non-banks would have to put all the money they collect into bank accounts on which they will get no interest; banks can collect all the money they want and lend it out at any interest rate they choose.        
	Thus the RBI has not only discriminated unscrupulously in favour of banks, but it has also placed restrictions on non-banks business that will cripple them. It hesitated before the criticism it faced, and did not remove non-bank institutions out of the new business altogether, but it has built in strong underhand provisions to ensure that they will fail, leaving the business to banks. This is entirely against public interest, for over the 38 years of their nationalized life, banks have conclusively proved that they love easy, safe profits and are entirely against serving the common man. Technology brought new institutions to serve him, but the RBI has crippled them. The ruling alliance swears by the common man. If it comes back to power, it should drum some populist sense into the RBI.

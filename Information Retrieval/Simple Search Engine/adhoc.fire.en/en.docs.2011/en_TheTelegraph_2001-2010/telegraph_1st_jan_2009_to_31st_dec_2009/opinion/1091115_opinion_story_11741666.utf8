	 Old habits die hard. Manu Sharma, out on parole, was once again caught in a brawl. He returned to prison, apparently on his own, after alarm bells went off in the corridors of power. But what about some of the familiar habits of Indian politicians  chicanery, for example? Sharma obtained his parole in record time, thanks to this undying trait among our netas. Apparently, despite the mud that has stuck on him, Vinod Sharma, Congress MLA and father of Manu Sharma, continues to be indispensable to power-play. It is said that without him Bhupinder Singh Hooda would have found it impossible to rope in the seven independent MLAs needed to form his government in the state of Haryana. Hence, Sharma still calls the shots in some quarters, and is capable of tweaking the law so that his son can have some fun. The party high command, reportedly, has taken a strong view on the matter. Hooda has been ticked off for his reliance on Sharma, and the Delhi administration for its indulgence of Manu. But will that be enough for the Congressman to kick his bad habit?                
	 The three most familiar faces from among the commies were absent on the idiot box when the news came in that the Left had been virtually wiped out in the by-elections. Sitaram Yechury, the most visible face of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) on nightly television, was away in Madrid to participate in the 18th congress of the Spanish Communist Party. Brinda Karat was in Brazil, attending another party conference of the communist fraternity. Her husband, Prakash, chose to be in London but the reason for the visit remained unclear. Whatever the cause, the trio was spared the torture of facing the nation.                            
	 A place where personal magic went completely wrong was Assam. The perfume magnate and the AUDF MP from the state, Maulana Badruddin Ajmal, failed to cast his spell on the voters of Salmara South assembly constituency from where his son, Abdul Rahman Ajmal, was contesting. At his electoral campaigns, people are believed to have come with bowls of water, asking him to breathe occult powers into them. Tired of the bowls, Ajmal Senior is said to have asked to be taken to a nearby well. Now that his son has lost the polls, it is quite evident that things have not gone too well for this conjurer.                            
	 In political circles, it is widely known that both the minister for railways, Mamata Banerjee, and the minister for chemicals and fertilizer, MK Alagiri, invariably give the weekly cabinet meetings a slip. Even the minister for petroleum, Murli Deora, seems to have picked up the same habit. Finding the ministers missing yet again, the finance minister, Pranab Mukherjee, recently gave vent to his frustration. He categorically pointed out that all members of the cabinet were expected to attend the meetings, and that a few of them are taking things casually. When Mukherjee cooled down, the prime minister instructed the cabinet secretary to convey the FMs sentiments to the absentee members. But the chances are that the ministers will take the FMs admonitions as a slight.                            
	 For obvious reasons, the Oppositions gains in Bengal have become a matter of intense speculation. Two cabinet ministers from outside Bengal were heard discussing the by-election results. One of them, belonging to the Congress, remarked that the victory was impressive because Pranab Mukherjee and Mamata Banerjee, we are told, had not been speaking to each other since September, when the Trinamul Congress fielded some rebel Congress leaders as its nominees in Arunachal Pradesh. The other minister wondered what the fate of the Left Front would have been had the two been talking!                            
	 The Union minister for information and broadcasting, Ambika Soni, has been busy channel-surfing. There is a reason behind this. Every parliamentary session, the I amp;B minister faces complaints from irate MPs about the content of serials and reality shows.Hence the homework before the next session begins.

	 The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh is hell-bent on imposing a nobody on the Bharatiya Janata Party as its next boss, and it cares two hoots if BJP leaders are unhappy with the decision. The harshest blow, of course, will fall on Sushma Swaraj, who had set her heart on becoming the leader of the Opposition after LK Advani. Curiously, the RSSs choice is Nitin Gadkari, who had failed miserably to carry the Maharashtra unit of the party along with him when he was its president. So long as Pramod Mahajan was around, Gadkari was completely sidelined. After Mahajans death, it was Gopinath Munde who countered Gadkari. Gadkari is aware of the enormous challenge that lies ahead and sees a Barak Obama in himself. In his recently released book, Gadkari, taking cue from Obamas world-view, portrayed himself as a politician with equality. He may have only started to realize how unequal the world of Indian politics is.

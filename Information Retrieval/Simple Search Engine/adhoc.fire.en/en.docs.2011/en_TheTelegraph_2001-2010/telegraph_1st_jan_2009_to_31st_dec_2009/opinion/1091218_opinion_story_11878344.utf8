	It is not the holding of elections but the strength of democratic institutions that ultimately determines the future of democracy. The recent judgment of the Pakistan supreme court, which struck down the controversial 2007 national reconciliation ordinance, proves that the country has passed this crucial test. The supreme court ruling goes against no less than the holder of the highest office in Pakistan, Asif Ali Zardari. Together with him, around 8,000 lesser mortals will no longer have the shield of the amnesty granted by the NRO in graft charges against them. Like the others, many of them members of the government, Mr Zardari has been made vulnerable to the resurrection of corruption cases against him that were being carried out before October 5, 2007, when political expediency had made a military dictator overturn the rule of law. In treading a politically explosive path, the supreme court of Pakistan has shown remarkable restraint. It had wanted the parliament to take a decision on the NRO in July 2009, when it had declared the emergency imposed by Pervez Musharraf in 2007 unconstitutional. But the lack of consensus there left the decision to the supreme court, which has now passed its verdict, taking into cognizance petitions pending before it since 2007.        
	It is ironic that the strengthening of one democratic institution in Pakistan should take place simultaneously with the weakening of another. The president is granted legal immunity in Pakistan. Technically, the judgment does not unseat Mr Zardari. But with the reinstatement of the corruption cases against him, he will lose his moral high ground and find it increasingly difficult to hold on to office, notwithstanding all the compromises he is willing to make. He has already gone a long way in doing so. He has assured his political rival of his intention to give up discretionary powers and has tried to placate the all-powerful army by changing his stance on India and letting go of his control over nuclear weaponry. He has also shown his desperation to retain power by playing the victim of a larger conspiracy against democracy in Pakistan. But the more desperate Mr Zardari appears to be, the further he will undermine his office and create conditions for the army to seize control and moral leadership. The supreme court has followed the due process of law. Pakistans civilian leadership should show some maturity in handling its fallout, no matter how messy.

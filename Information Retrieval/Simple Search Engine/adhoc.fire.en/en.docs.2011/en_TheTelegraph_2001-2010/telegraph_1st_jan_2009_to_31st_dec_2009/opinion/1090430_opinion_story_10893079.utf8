The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Freedom has a price 
                                                                                                                 FREEDOM HAS A PRICE                                   CHINA DIARY - Neha Sahay                              
	You have more than one party, right? And you are now going to vote for one of them? These questions crop up with amazing regularity these days, and are asked by all sorts of persons: executives in private firms, English teachers, secretaries and so on. Suddenly, the Chinese seem very knowledgeable about Indian politics.        
	Very soon into the conversation, you realize why. In the wake of Charter 08, a declaration of human rights issued last December by over 300 Chinese citizens, the ruling Communist Party has tried different counter attacks. One of them is argument  You want democracy? Look at the state of developing countries who are democracies. India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, the Philippines, and now, Thailand... Democracy is a western concept, and works only in developed countries. For Asian countries with developing economies, more control is needed. Therefore China needs a strong party to guide and strengthen the economy. Once it becomes a developed country, democracy can be tried.        
	The argument is convincing  to the Chinese. Terrorist attacks in India, the Tamils in Sri Lanka, the violence in Thailand  compare these with China. Our country is very stable. Our government aims to work for a developed and harmonious society, this diaryist was told at an informal dinner by a logistics manager working in a multinational firm. You have so many bomb attacks, he continued, and even as I tried to work out a response, his colleague intervened: Thats because you have so many parties. That makes your government weak.        
	Economy is the basis of a nation, says the Chinese government. A strong economy needs a tough, stable government. Indias poverty just got global recognition thanks to Slumdog Millionaire (it has been viewed on DVD by everyone here). That too flows from our weak government, I was told.                
	More control        
	Jackie Chan, the Hong Kong-based star, who is, ironically, himself the beneficiary of a system much closer to democracy than Chinas, has obviously been bowled over by the Chinese Communist Partys message. Im not sure if its good to have freedom or not. Im really confused now. If youre too free, youre like the way Hong Kong is now. Its very chaotic. Taiwan is also chaotic, Chan is reported to have said at the prestigious Boao Economic Forum, 10 days ago. He was responding to questions about censorship in China. Amid applause from the audience, which included Chinas top businessmen, Chan added, Im gradually beginning to feel that we Chinese need to be controlled. If were not being controlled, well just do what we want. However, contrary to the way he has been reported, Chan actually spoke in a disjointed way, seemingly out of depth on such a topic.        
	Chans views werent welcomed in his own city; Hong Kong politicians who want more freedom from Beijing termed them racist. Interestingly, here on the mainland, his comments have drawn support (reported in the official media), and opposition (on the internet). A Peoples Daily columnist, comparing the self-discipline evident in Hong Kongs and Englands traffic in contrast to Beijings traffic jams, concluded that the Chinese needed the instructive and even enlightening role of the government in disciplining public conduct.        
	To substantiate, he recalled the chaos of the Cultural Revolution, which wrought untold havoc to the time-honoured Chinese civilizations, suffocating almost all the human ethics and courtesies (sic). He went on to make a strange comparison  even today, he pointed out, people were getting rich, but not in morality.        
	So, is the Chinese government the peoples moral arbiter? Even the most ordinary Chinese citizen will consider that a joke.

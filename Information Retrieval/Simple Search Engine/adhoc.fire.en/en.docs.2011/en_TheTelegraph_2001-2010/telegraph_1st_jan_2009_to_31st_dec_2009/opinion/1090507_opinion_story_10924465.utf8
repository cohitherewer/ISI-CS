	It is amazing how many reasons politicians can think up in the hope of stalling recommendations by courts that might force them to change their ways. In view of the repeated damage inflicted on public property during bandhs and political demonstrations, the Supreme Court has recommended that the Damage to Public Property Act, 1984 be amended so that leaders of political parties which have called for the action are held responsible for property destruction and made to pay. Citizens, caught between burning buses and vandalized offices, could have been reassured by the recommendation. Apart from being valuable in itself, it adds to the rulings of the high courts and the Supreme Court regarding bandhs, the conduct of processions and the protection of the environment during political meetings. But citizens have watched parties evade or flout such rulings, so they would hope not just for an amendment, but for its implementation as well.        
	Political parties have already got into position to wriggle past the courts recommendation in the hope that this too shall pass. In West Bengal, the Trinamul Congress and the Congress have, predictably at this crucial time, been the good boys, expressing eagerness to obey the law and also hoping that the next government makes the amendment. The Socialist Unity Centre of India has a simple defence: suppose rival parties cause the damage and run away? The Communist Party of India (Marxist) has thought of the smartest line. All parties have the right to protest, and they are all responsible enough to safeguard public property. Since such fairy-tales attract little trust, it can only be hoped that the courts suggested amendment does take place and, in this case, the laws regarding the environment, public property and citizens freedom of movement are strictly implemented. But what will happen when irate railway passengers wreck stations or a furious mob burns buses after an accident on the street?

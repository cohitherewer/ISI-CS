                                                                                                                 LIKE NO OTHER LEADER                                  BONA FIDE - Malvika Singh                              
	Twenty-five years ago, on the morning of October 31, 1984, Indira Gandhi was mercilessly gunned down by her personal bodyguards. Nothing merits this kind of mindless violence, and Indians were stunned. It seemed like a repeat of the frightful assassination of Mahatma Gandhi. Both leaders were victims of sectarian madness and, ironically, both were intrinsically secular in the best definition of the word. What followed the two tragedies was the exact opposite of what Gandhiji, Indira as well as her father, Jawaharlal Nehru, would have wanted to witness, let alone condone. The wide scale killings of innocent Sikhs across Delhi were carried out by bands of Congress workers under the direction of scheming and corrupt office-bearers of the party who wanted to win brownie points and to assert their loyalty to the high command by taking revenge. The riots scarred our nation forever.        
	Indira Gandhi was an extraordinary leader. A complex personality with a strong and determined exterior that complemented her vulnerable traits, she cared deeply for her country. Her antecedents had infused her with a passion and a commitment for India. Some opposed her vehemently, others embraced her and forgave her when she went wrong. She left a distinct impression on the political and intellectual landscape, and in this she remains unmatched.         
	There hasnt been an adequate biography that portrays the many nuances of her character, her dreams and aspirations and her failures that stemmed from having to deal with volatile personal contradictions. Diverse traits of her personality  some fine and evolved, some raw with sharp uneven edges  came together and created a very unusual, lonely woman. Reappraisal and assessment of the personal and political life of Indira Gandhi are required. Her home, which is now a museum, attracts approximately 10,000 visitors every day. They come from different parts of India to pay homage to a woman with whom they connected.                
	Standing tall        
	She was a deft politician who meticulously moved to split the Congress party. She stood apart from the then old, archaic leadership. India was electrified with hope  the people were looking at this woman, a young leader, for a better future. In those days, in the late 1960s, Indira Gandhi represented someone who had broken away from the dull and predictable political class that resisted generational changes in values, aspirations and demands. By her sheer proactive presence at the helm of India, she empowered women with a strong sense of belonging, which, in turn, generated much pride in them.         
	Her aura, in those early years, was overwhelming. Indira Gandhi honoured traditional artisans and fiercely protected the natural treasures of India by instituting laws to protect what was left. She was also the architect of a non-government organization to protect the larger culture of India  its inherent skills and its natural environment. She tried hard to ensure that the fundamental strengths of our pluralistic civilization are respected and allowed to blossom.         
	She understood India and Bharat and, unlike other politicians, knew that any alienation from the cultural roots would impoverish India. She intervened forcefully to conserve and rejuvenate everything in Indias cultural ethos that Indians everywhere were familiar with. Her colleagues and the babus who ruled India  every one of them trying to escape their cultural reality for an alien, plastic world in the sterile West  let her down and destroyed the strengths of this subcontinent. Today, the desecration of the countrys forests, natural resources and the skills of this land is all too apparent. The prevailing anarchy and governments in denial of critical issues have diluted our sense of personal and collective pride.

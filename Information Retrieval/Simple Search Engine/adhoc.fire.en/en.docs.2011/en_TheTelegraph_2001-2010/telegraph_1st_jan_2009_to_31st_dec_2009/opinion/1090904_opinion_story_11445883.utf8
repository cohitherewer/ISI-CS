The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | no small fight
                                                                                                                 NO SMALL FIGHT                                                    
	Year-on-year, quarterly gross domestic product growth shows a slight rise to 6.1 per cent from the depressing 5.8 per cent it showed in the previous two quarters. This rise has led to an outburst of optimism. The prime minister told the Planning Commission that the global economic downturn was ending and that normalcy would return. He also told policy-makers not to be too pessimistic. That could be a sign that things are better than how they see them  unless he was merely cheering them up. He could have been referring to the note circulated by the Planning Commission which weighed in the effect of the drought; it said that foodgrains production could drop this year by 29 million tons, and growth could fall to 5.5 per cent.         
	What is known with certainty is the past; and the past is known only up to April-June this year, to which the latest GDP figures pertain. They show an uptick in mining, manufacturing and public utilities  precisely the sectors that had led the slowdown. That suggests its end. The figures also show a fall in the contribution of the government to GDP growth; this suggests that the figures are not being artificially inflated by unproductive government expenditure. So the possibility can no longer be dismissed that there is a genuine upturn.         
	That is how it looks if the focus is on GDP figures ignoring the rest. The trade figures were released at the same time as GDP figures, and they tell a different story. Monthly goods exports were below the previous years figure for the tenth month running; in the past five months, they have been almost a third lower than the year before. If they had not fallen, GDP would have been four per cent higher. That is an exaggeration, since imports too would have been higher. The point is that there is one sector of the economy that has done extremely badly; so have those whose livelihood depends on exports. Almost half the gem-cutters have lost their jobs; so have a third of garment makers. Their woes do not figure high on the radar of the finance ministry or the Planning Commission. For most of the exporters are small; while politicians pay them homage on appropriate occasions, they are simply not present in the corridors of power. Unbeknownst to the men in power, those small enterprises have been doing their best  to save themselves more than the nation; they have fought back. According to the Reserve Bank of Indias figures, merchandise exports have fallen much less than imports. So, the trade deficit halved in January-March 2009 in comparison to the previous quarter. Exports of services, including information technology, have also been sustained well. It is a pity that these small exporters are just the people whom the trade policy, replete with red tape, serves least well.

	When it rains political misfortune, it can really pour. For the British prime minister, Gordon Brown, the past month has been truly horrible. What began as a media revelation of the rampant misuse of monetary perquisites by members of parliament (cutting across party lines) has turned into a political crisis of staggering proportions. The past week has witnessed the resignation of at least six cabinet ministers, including the home secretary and the defence secretary, the decimation of the Labour Party to third position in the local council elections on June 4, a feeble cabinet reshuffle that failed to inspire and the possibility of a backbenchers revolt. Mr Brown put up a brave face and announced that he will not waver or walk away, but it is becoming increasingly clear that the Labour Party is confronted by diminishing options. Its MPs can either stick with Mr Brown in the fond belief that a year (the scheduled time for the next general election) is an excruciatingly long time in politics. Or it can hope to minimize the scale of an impending defeat by replacing the dour incumbent with the affable newly-appointed home secretary, Alan Johnson. The final choice may depend on the results of the elections to the European parliament. If Labour is left in the pathetic situation of having to compete with the United Kingdom Independence Party for third place, Mr Brown may end up joining Tony Blair in the lucrative business of speaking tours.        
	What has made this political crisis a little different from the run-of-the-mill scandals that titillate Westminster periodically is that it has resulted in a wider crisis of legitimacy. After 12 years in power, New Labour was beginning to look jaded in comparison to the new-look Conservative Party that David Cameron has managed to create. But what has hobbled Mr Brown is the perception that he is incapable of ushering in the reform that is warranted by the rot in the political system. Far from being reassuring, Mr Browns feeble show of steadfastness may be seen as an attempt to delay the inevitable. Governments lose popularity habitually, but this is the first time an entire parliament has lost legitimacy, thanks to the dodgy financial practices of MPs. The replacement of Mr Brown with Mr Johnson will not meet the underlying popular demand to make a fresh start after general elections. Labour just does not have room for manoeuvre.

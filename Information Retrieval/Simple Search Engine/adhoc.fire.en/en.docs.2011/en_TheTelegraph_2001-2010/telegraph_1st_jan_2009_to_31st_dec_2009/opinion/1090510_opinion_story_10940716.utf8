	 There is a battle raging at the Congress war room at 15 Rakabgunj Road. All because Anand Sharma is busy settling scores with Jairam Ramesh. Sharma, the minister of state for external affairs, apparently doesnt get along too well with Ramesh, who is in charge of the war room unofficially. Keen to assert his seniority over Ramesh, Anand reportedly routes telephone calls through an operator who is in the habit of keeping poor Ramesh on hold for a precious few minutes. But the cold war between the two leaders is not the only cause of distraction in the AICC war room. The grapevine has it that the pretty faces from airline companies, who are looking after logistics, are causing some disruption to the proceedings as well. But then, party workers might actually welcome such disturbances to take their minds off the squabbling leaders.                
	 It seems quarrelsome leaders are not just the Congresss problem. Samajwadi Partys gen-sec, Amar Singh, is far from his chirpy self. These days, Singh goes about insisting that he is no longer the final word as far as the party chief, Mulayam Singh Yadav, is concerned. Such an admission is uncharacteristic from a man who, till recently, was in the habit of flaunting his weight in the partys affairs. We hear that Singh is unhappy because of netajis support to rival Azam Khan in Rampur. Moreover, Mulayam is fairly certain that the inclusion of Kalyan Singh in the SP, which was Amar Singhs idea, would certainly hurt the partys Muslim vote-bank. But should Singh be wondering about a life after Samajwadi Party so soon? After all, isnt it true that there are no permanent foes (or friends) in politics?                            
	 With the elections drawing to a close, all eyes are now set on the day of the results. But no one is still quite sure about which way the poll wind is blowing, which is why political leaders are now busy working on post-poll alliances. Congressmen have their thinking caps on, debating strategies to win back the hearts of Prakash Karat and Co. Some in the Congress are arguing that internal pressure will prompt Karat to extend his hand of friendship once again. Some others are convinced that all it would take to get the Left back on the Congress bandwagon is the tweaking of the next common minimum programme to make parliamentary approval of all international treaties mandatory. This, the wise men are convinced, will be enough to earn the comrades nod for Manmohan Singhs second stint as the prime minister. Yet others are counting on Sonia Gandhi and Singh to charm the likes of Karat, Sitaram Yechury and Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. But not everyone is convinced that the Congresss bag of tricks will work. Opponents have been heard quipping that given Karats hard stance, all this is just wishful thinking on the part of the Congress.                             
	 Political parties may differ on almost all issues save one: the current elections, they are convinced, will throw up a hung parliament. Who then holds the key to the throne in Delhi? The answer, according to party experts, is not one but three women. There is the president, Pratibha Patil. She will play a critical role in deciding who to invite first to form the next government given her special discretionary powers. Her recent dinner meeting with Somnath Chatterjee has set tongues wagging that the two were possibly discussing what was the best way available to unravel the constitutional knots that are likely to emerge as a result of a badly fractured verdict. Then there is J. Jayalalithaa, who is likely to emerge as a hard bargainer, and possibly dictate the choice of the PM if the third front comes to power. Finally, there is behenji who would undoubtedly pledge her support to those who are willing to offer her party the most number of ministerial berths. Did we hear someone mention that the Dalit queen should now be called as the king-maker?                             
	 Ever wondered why the turn-out in South Mumbai was abysmal, even though the constituency had borne the brunt of 26/11? Well, here are some of the possible reasons, as suggested by an SMS that is doing the rounds  the polls clashed with salsa classes; no valet parking was available at the booths; the driver had not turned up; no party was willing to tackle the real issues, such as the high rates charged by some gymnasiums; no home delivery of ballot papers, and so on.  
	FOOTNOTE      
	 It would be surprising to find if anyone in the Congress still remembers K. Natwar Singh. Natwar has been out in the cold ever since the Volcker report came out. But apparently, the former external affairs minister still hasnt forgotten some people in the party. In fact, he has come up with a word of advice for his beleaguered friend, Arjun Singh  call it a day and spend time in writing an autobiography.      
	Natwar and Arjun had been close friends at the time of P.V. Narasimha Rao. But strangely, when Natwar was shown the door after the oil-for-food fiasco, Arjun did not make an effort to take up his dear friends case with the powers-that-be in 10 Janpath.      
	Things have changed considerably since then, especially at the Union HRD ministers end. Arjun has now entered a lean phase in his own political career and Natwar is trying his best to help him with his advice to pick up the pen. But will Arjun pay heed to his words, or consider this as unfriendly advise?

RAO                                                                  Tenughat Thermal Power Station, Lalpania, Bokaro        
	When Volkswagen decided to set up a car factory in India, it had no certainty of how much it could sell and how much profit it would make. The company had confidence in its products based on successful and profitable performances in many other countries. It could also bank on the goodwill of Indian target consumers for the original Beetle, the iconic Volkswagen of the 1960s. Electricity in India has been different. Investors, especially those from overseas, want guaranteed sales, guaranteed returns and guarantees of payment for sales. This is because of the dominance of state government-owned enterprises whose monopoly in the distribution of electricity has diverted government resources into consumer subsidies and operational inefficiencies instead of into investments in health, education, infrastructure and agriculture. Mumbai has made a break in the natural monopoly conferred by ownership of transmission and distribution wires. Consumers can demand to be supplied by another service provider over wires owned by non-government enterprises.        
	We owe this to the creative imagination in the structure created by the Electricity Act, 2003. It tried to create an environment which could expand capacities despite the constraints imposed by the concurrent nature of electricity in the Constitution (both Centre and states have authority over it); and the near-monopoly over distribution of state electricity boards. Over time, this had led to uneconomic tariffs, as many interest groups were supplied free electricity or power below cost. Because of inefficiency, overstaffing, indiscipline, and collusion in thefts of electricity by the SEB staff, poor maintenance, and delayed replacement of ageing equipment, the SEBs have been losing vast sums of money.        
	The Electricity Act, 2003 redefined captive generation, recognized electricity trading and mandated open access on transmission and distribution wires. Open access enables anybody who wants to send electricity across wires owned by someone else to do so if there is available capacity and payment is made of the tariff determined by the regulator.              
	Captive generation now includes a power plant set by any cooperative society or association of persons for generating electricity primarily for the use of members of such cooperative society or association. Thus any group of persons can set up a captive generation plant and each member must have a shareholding in it. It is no longer incumbent that Tisco, for example, has a power plant for the exclusive use of its steel plant. Such power is outside government control and regulation and can be bought and sold at prices that are market-determined.        
	There is a surcharge for open access to be utilised for the purpose of meeting the requirement of current level of cross-subsidy. It was to be eliminated, though the Left parties managed to make the coalition government change that to progressively reduced and eliminated and made sure that such surcharge may be levied till such time as the cross-subsidies are not eliminated. However no surcharge is to be levied for open access by captive plants. The surcharge for open access using transmission and distribution lines belonging to the state enterprise or any other party will be determined by the State Electricity Regulatory Commission.        
	The electricity regulatory commissions are required to promote the development of a market (including trading). The act now recognizes trading. It is clear to me that it follows that generation plants can now be set up that are wholly or partly dedicated to trading. These are the merchant plants, that is, producing electricity for trading purposes. Thus an investor can promote an electricity generation plant as he can any other product, and depend on the market to buy the electricity at any price acceptable to the consumer and producer. The competitive forces of supply and demand in the market will determine the price, not a regulator. The price level will vary depending on these forces. The regulator will ensure that market forces are enabled to work freely and that there is no anti-competitive practice.        
	If Jindal Power is making huge profits with merchant power, these will drop as more merchant power capacity gets installed, as investors flock to where there is a good profit. This will add to the generation capacity and alleviate shortages. The SEBs will of course have to supply the smaller consumers.        
	There is provision in the act for the ERCs to fix the minimum and maximum ceiling of tariff for sale or purchase of electricity in pursuance of an agreement. In a market, the tariff is normally determined at the equilibrium between demand and supply. The tariffs for traded electricity should therefore be settled between the concerned parties and not be subject to regulation. The Central Electricity Regulatory Commission recently used this provision in the act to place a ceiling on tariffs for traded electricity. It did so because at that time the tariffs were very high owing to the failure of the monsoon. It adversely impacted hydroelectric generation. The buyers were primarily SEBs, which were obligated to supply agriculture and domestic consumers who were paying prices that were mostly below cost. Charging them more would have caused public agitations. If tariffs were not raised for consumers, the SEBs would have lost more money. The CERC must have intervened to prevent such problems.        
	However, as other large users (industries, railways, housing colonies, and so on) become customers for merchant power, the SEBs may depend only on power supplied by government agencies and not have to buy in the market. The markets will then determine prices and the CERCs intervention to hold prices down may become unnecessary.        
	With the establishment of electricity exchanges with excellent linkages between different centres, it should have been possible for electricity to have been traded on firm future supply and demand. Unfortunately, an unresolved dispute between the Forward Markets Commission and the CERC on who will regulate futures trades has delayed futures trading.              
	Thus, an electricity generator can get a tariff in different ways: a long-term tariff on the basis of bidding competitively for a project on the basis of a tariff (as has happened with the ultra-mega power plant  so far about 10,000 megawatts is under construction); have it determined by the ERC on the basis of norms for costs and a predetermined return on equity, proposed capital expenditures, fuel and other costs; or be an electricity merchant depending on the vagaries of the market to get revenues to cover expenditures (as happens with most other products and services).        
	This last option enables the investor in electricity generation to earn depending on the market and not on a fixed return determined by the regulator. Many investors prefer such a risk and produce electricity that they will sell either through the exchange on a spot or future basis or on bilateral contracts. Open access will enable them to transmit the electricity. They can enter into contracts for transmission capacity to assure delivery.        
	Until India moves away from subsidized tariffs, much of the electricity generated will continue to be regulated and sold for use by households, small enterprises, farmers, and so on. The law limits trading to large users (above 1 MW). These could include housing colonies and industries.        
	State governments and colluding SERCs have used a clause in the act that gives state governments the power to issue directions under extraordinary circumstances to deny open access. States would rather keep all electricity generated within their borders for their use. The government is at last changing this clause. After six years since the act was passed, open access should finally enable merchant power and substantial additional generation.        
	Open access is the lynchpin for trading merchant power and massive private investment in generation is essential if our electricity shortages are to be brought under control.

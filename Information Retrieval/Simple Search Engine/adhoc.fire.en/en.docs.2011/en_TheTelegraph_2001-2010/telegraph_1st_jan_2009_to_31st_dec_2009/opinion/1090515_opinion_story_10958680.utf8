	This years troubles                  
	Sir  Some workers of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) had left a voting slip in my house which said that my polling station was at the National High School for Boys on Hazra Road. I was delighted because the place is just a few paces from my home. On my way to the polling station, I met my uncle, who lives at the same address as I do. He informed me that our polling station was at a municipality school further down the road. Yes, my uncle was right.           
	My husband, Raja Menon, also went to the booth with me to cast his vote. His name was not to be found on the rolls. We were advised to check at the booths set up by various political parties on the crossing of Ballygunge Circular Road and Hazra Road. We went, we searched, but Raja Menon was not registered as a voter.           
	Of course, in 21st century India, married women have to have their husbands name on almost all official documents. The Election Commission, in its wisdom, thinks that all married women can only have the same surname as their husbands, and so in the voters list my husband was called Raja Menon Ghatak.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Being a first-time voter, I was really very excited to vote in this election. I reached the polling booth on the dot of seven, but was frustrated to find that we were not allowed to enter the booth before 7.25 am, and the voting started from 7.30 am. The spirits of the voters were dampened further when they discovered that one of the two electronic voting machines was not functioning. The voters of booth 34 of constituency 165 were stranded in the middle of the road for more then an hour. Such negligence is unpardonable. Why do the polling officers fail to do their job and deliver the kind of efficiency that is expected of them? It is ironic that they come into the picture once every few years, yet fail to perform their duties.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Saurik Ginoria, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  I am a citizen of India and have voted in all the elections since 1952. In fact, I was a polling officer during the countrys first-ever general elections held that year. This year, I found that the voters list has been prepared in a manner that is peculiarly different from the earlier style. Previously, the list was made on the basis of localities, according to the serial number of the housing premises and flats. This time, it had been made using the first alphabet of the voters first names. As a result, it took time to find the names, and members of the same family or sharing the same address were on different sheets causing more delays. The EC ought to take remedial measures in this matter next time.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
C.R. Guha, Calcutta

                
	Sir  With the conclusion of the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, all eyes are now focused on the counting of the votes. In an uncanny coincidence, all general elections since 1952 have thrown up interesting facts regarding the predictions of the results  be it the prophecy of the soothsayers, or estimates by political pundits, or the outcome of the exit polls, or, for that matter, the newly-developed science of psephology, most of the guesswork has invariably failed to reach anywhere near the actual tally of seats won by the contesting parties. The ultimate trump card, therefore, lies with the real hand behind the entire exercise  the all-powerful Indian electorate.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Arun Malankar, Mumbai 

                
	Sir  The EC deserves congratulations for conducting the polls to the 15th Lok Sabha in a successful manner. The paramilitary and police forces, too, deserve praise for ensuring peace despite terror threats in different corners of the country. India has once again proved to the world the strength of its democratic credentials. It is an awe-inspiring fact that several million voters have a say in electing just 543 candidates.           
	The media, too, played a decisive role in being the watchdog over the electoral process stretching over several weeks. Booth-capturing and major mishaps were rare this time, barring some sporadic attacks in the early phases. The media also created mass awareness about the need to vote. They made the common man conscious of his power, leading to large turnouts in many areas. However, the total voting percentage was not all that inspiring as sections of the elite and the middle class turned away from discharging their duties. There were many first-time voters who exercised their franchise and felt proud about it, but a few felt dejected as their names went missing from the voters list.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  The alleged case of racial discrimination of Indian passengers at the Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris is not the first of its kind for Indians travelling to France (Indians harrowed in Paris, May 13). A few years ago, a national carrier was denied landing facilities at the newly-commissioned state-of-the-art extension of the same airport. Along with other airlines, the Air India plane was allotted a slot at the secondary airport in Orly. It was only after strong protests at the diplomatic level that Air India was permitted to use the Charles de Gaulle airport.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Jorhat Singh, Mumbai

                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Not in the picture                  
	Sir  By not sending any representative to the meeting of chief ministers on internal security, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has revealed his lack of political will to fight the Maoists (Bengal silence at security table, Aug 18). It is surprising that from his large council of ministers he could not nominate even one worthy of attending the meet. Since protocol prohibits bureaucrats from speaking in such sessions, what was the point of sending such officials just to table the papers? The chief minister might as well have sent the documents by post.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Chameli Pal, Calcutta

      
	Lost time          
	Sir  Abdur Rezzak Mollahs challenge to Mamata Banerjee to provide 60,000 jobs in the railways to Muslim youths smacks of communal overtones (Mollah rail job challenge to Mamata, Aug 14). The Indian Railways has always recruited irrespective of caste, creed or religion. Most of its employment notices clearly state that recruitment will take place in compliance with reservation policies for the scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, minority communities and the other backward classes. Given these existing norms, Mollahs remarks appear discriminatory. The report justly mentions that Muslims disenchantment with the CPM is believed to be one of the reasons for its successive poll debacles. The state government has failed to improve the lives of Muslims in the years it has been in power. Speeches like these are unlikely to woo the Muslims all of a sudden.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Othello Mazoomdaar, Barasat

                
	Sir  Abdur Rezzak Mollah, while daring Mamata Banerjee to create jobs for Muslims, went so far as to claim that he would join the Trinamul Congress if Banerjee meets this challenge. Such openly defiant attitude among politicians fosters difference among the people. Favouring any section of the population is bound to create divisiveness. The Sachar committee report finds Muslims in the state to be disadvantaged  which raises the question as to whether they ever got equal opportunity to improve their lives.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Road blocks          
	Sir  To reduce the number of road accidents, the governments of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh have prescribed fixing speed limiters and reflective tapes on trucks. The owners, however, objected to it and threatened a strike if the order was implemented. However, the state administrations must not yield to such demands. Rather, they must make sure that small vehicles, too, follow these norms. Wearing helmets and seatbelts are already existing rules, and must be implemented thoroughly. Functioning headlights are indispensable for vehicles plying at night. There must be laws to keep a check on that as well.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
M.M. Kale, Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh

                          
	Parting shot          
	Sir  When the chief minister of Gujarat, Narendra Modi, was denied visa to the United States of America, the United Progressive Alliance did not protest. They also remained quiet when former cabinet minister, George Fernandes, had to go through a rigorous body search in 2004. The civil aviation minister, Praful Patel, promised to take up the issue with the airline that frisked A.P.J. Abdul Kalam. Now, the hue and cry from within the UPA at the detention and questioning of Shah Rukh Khan in the US points to the UPAs appeasement of the minority community for electoral gains.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Tusar Kanti Kar, Howrah

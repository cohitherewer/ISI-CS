	It is obscenely evasive or delusional of successive governments in India not to be able to make up their official minds, for more than four decades now, about whether or not the caste system exists in the country. Since 1965, India has maintained wildly contradictory positions and reports on caste at the United Nations committee on the elimination of racial discrimination. It has swung between acknowledging in an international forum that caste exists as a form of discrimination amounting to the violation of human rights, and getting mindlessly defensive by wanting to remove caste from the UN Convention on Elimination of all forms of Racial Discrimination. In the latest UN Human Rights Council  concluded this year on the birthday of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi  Nepal has somewhat spoilt this long Indian habit of equivocation by endorsing the formal inclusion of caste among forms of discrimination based on descent and work. Caste is too unambiguously real and unacceptable for the Indian State to reduce it to a semantic issue or a question of national autonomy or international prestige. India should come absolutely and officially clean, admit to the existence of caste-based discrimination, and cooperate with the international community in tackling it. Treating it duplicitously as a dirty, and an open, secret is a sordid and dishonourable option that the government should avoid being associated with.        
	Almost all governments and political parties, Central and regional, take the existence of caste as a vital element in their electoral strategies and practices, and several generations of Indians have grown up under the shadow of reservationist policies that have remained fundamentally unquestioned by almost every government. So when the Indian State has never thought twice before reaping every kind of political advantage from the persistence of the caste system, in all its subtle as well as cruder forms at every level of society, then pretending to the world that it is a phenomenon of dubious validity or a matter of merely national concern is hypocrisy of a particularly shameful sort. Being in denial, with its psychological overtones, is too kind an interpretation of this bureaucratic doublespeak in a world forum like the UN. Caste violates international human rights law, and there is a long and robust tradition of fighting it within the country. The government cannot wish away either fact.

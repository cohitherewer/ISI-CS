                                                                                                                 DRAMATIC PATTERNS                                  Dance - Sharmila Basu Thakur                                                  
	The department of information and cultural affairs, West Bengal State Music Academy, organized Nrityanatya Utsav at Madhusudan Mancha recently. The four-day festival featured ten dance troupes from the city and the districts. The enthusiastic performance of the young dancers was enjoyable.        
	The festival began with Saat Bhai o Ek Boner Golpo by Nrityam under the guidance of Sujata Mukherjee. It was followed by Krishna Sudama, presented by Deeksha Manjari. This famous choreography of Guru Kelucharan Mahapatra, the doyen of Odissi dance, was recreated by Dona Ganguly. She kept her gurujis composition almost intact, with some minor changes for the little participants. Donas daughter, Sana, as little Krishna was charming. The music accompanying this item was by Balakrishna Das, Ramesh Chandra Das and Raghunath Panigrahi. Dona should be thanked for this vintage piece.        
	Kajalrekha (directed by Subhasish Dutta) and Sunaimadhab (by Krishna Banerjee of Jalpaiguri Kalamandalam) depicted the folk flavour of Maimansingha. Bhaskar Basus script was compact but dramatic. The most striking and colourful presentation was Sabujer Deshe, brilliantly choreographed by Arpita Venkatesh and Sampita Chatterjee. The light was designed by Uttiyo Jana and set by Haradhan Sarkar. Dressed in bright costumes, the participants rejoiced and danced in deep gratitude to Nature for all the treasures it has bestowed on man (picture). Simple patterns evoked a vast landscape.        
	Raas Leela is one of the many song sequences that make up the corpus of Padabali kirtan. Its songs depict the manner in which Krishna and Radha celebrate a festival of dance along with the gopis on a full-moon night. Debamitra Sengupta, an odissi dancer, chose this theme for her Raas Leela. She imaginatively used khol and pakhawaj to narrate a dialogue between man and woman. The production was enriched by the soulful rendition of songs by Seema Acharya Chowdhury, a renowned kirtan exponent. Amrita Das as Radha looked beautiful. The dancers were ably accompanied by Harekrishna Halder on khol and Uttam Mondol on pakhawaj. This was followed by Haradhanu, by Bidhan Roychowdhury, a disciple of Mamata Shankar. Based on the story of Aladin, Chhandam from Burdwan presented Daitya o Jadukar. The organizers should be thanked for promoting groups from the districts. The festival ended with Alibaba by Nritya Upasana. Based on Khirod Prasad Bidya Binods story, Kasmira Samanta composed this piece with much glamour.

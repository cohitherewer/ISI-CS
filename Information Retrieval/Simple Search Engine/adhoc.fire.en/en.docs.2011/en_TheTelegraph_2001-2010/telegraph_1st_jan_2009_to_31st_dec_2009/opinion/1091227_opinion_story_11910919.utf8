	 As if the Telangana imbroglio was not bad enough, the recent allegations of inappropriate conduct against the governor of Andhra Pradesh, ND Tiwari, has queered the pitch further for the Congress. The buzz is that the Congress is keen to replace him with someone who will be able to bail the party out of the mess. Tiwaris loss could possibly be Digvijay Singhs gain if he manages to stave of stiff competition from Keralas Oommen Chandy to fill Tiwaris shoes. As the governor, if Diggy Raja were to succeed in defusing the crisis in Andhra, it could elevate his stature in the party and also catapult him into an illustrious league whose members include the home minister. But then, Hyderabad may remain a distant dream. Singh is currently looking after party affairs in the crucial state of Uttar Pradesh, and the Congress may not be too keen to transfer him down South. Moreover, after his humiliating defeat in the Madhya Pradesh elections in 2003, the thakur had sworn that he would not assume any office of significance for 10 long years. But then,the wily Singh might not have too many problems in breaking his vow. After all, in the murky world of politics, promises are meant to be broken.                
	 Now for some more news on other gubernatorial fronts. Gopal Krishna Gandhi may have set an example by leaving Calcuttas Raj Bhavan immediately after the expiry of his term, but some others are not as keen to follow in his footsteps. In Chandigarh, for instance, SF Rodrigues is continuing with his feud with two Union ministers  Pawan Bansal and Ambika Soni. The duo have even petitioned the prime minister to remove their arch-enemy, but there is no moving Rodrigues just yet. Again, in Bhopal, Rameshwar Thakur ended his term as the governor in mid-November, but he is proving to be equally slow in quitting office. Some of his detractors had thought that the octogenarian would be looking forward to a retired life, but Thakur has proved all of them wrong with a sudden burst of activity. Apparently, these days, the chartered accountant-turned-politician is extremely busy auditing every single official paper that comes to the Raj Bhavan, including the various invitation cards.                            
	 Delhis claim to being a power city cannot be easily dismissed. In the capitals corridors, everyone claims to be someone of importance, and what better way of flaunting ones weighty credentials than flashing free invitation cards to high profile events such as fashion shows, the Republic Day parade, cultural soirees and so on? But these invitations have their own little pecking order, with complimentary tickets to cricket matches perched right at the top. So, every time Delhi hosts a game of cricket, poor Arun Jaitley, who is the president of the Delhi and District Cricket Association, is pestered by VVIPs for their share of free passes. Politicians, businessmen, media personnel, lawyers  everyone queues up at Jaitleys doors without any qualms. On some occasions, it is said that Jaitley has had to pay from his own pocket to satisfy the insatiable hunger of his guests for passes. Mind you, most of these people are in the habit of spending their money freely, and the humble price of a complimentary ticket wouldnt exactly burn a hole in their deep pockets. But then, it has to be remembered that brandishing a free invite is a must to burnish ones Very Very Important status.                            
	 The other day, we noticed an advertisement in an English language daily that listed the names of senior army officers guilty of dumping their luggage at the regimental headquarters, and not retrieving them even after one full year. The ad thundered that severe action would be taken unless the officers acted with haste and removed their baggage. And we thought that only our netas dragged their feet on evacuating their belongings from their official residences after demitting.                            
	 The Chinese surely know how to make a point. The other day, they organized a cultural event at a plush hotel in which Indias foreign minister was the chief guest. The programme featured several Tibetan dances which was the Chinese way of stressing that Tibet is an inalienable part of China. One doesnt quite know whether the chief guest enjoyed the show.

	 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee isnt the only one obsessed with the Maoists. Mamata Banerjee, too, seems to be keen on spotting them in every corner. The other day, a railways spokesperson, while briefing the media on a minor accident, had stated that it had been brought about by a technical snag. Hearing this, Didi saw red. She rebuked the man publicly and told the chairman of the Railway Board that the man should be sacked. More so because she had directed railways officials to blame the Maoists for such mishaps as they were present almost everywhere. But the spectre of Maoism isnt the only one haunting railways officials these days. Apparently, they have been told that the next railway budget should be framed in such a way so that Banerjees home state derives the maximum benefit in the form of new trains. The officials now find themselves between a rock and hard place. They are not quite sure whether it is easier to blame the Maoists or make every new train run through Bengal.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        TIME MATTERS                                                    
	Pakistan has an uncanny sense of timing. Immediately before the Pakistan prime minister met his Indian counterpart at Sharm el-Sheikh in July, the Pakistan government had filed an application before the supreme court against the release of the Jamaat-ud-Dawa chief, Hafeez Saeed. The move protected Yousuf Raza Gilani from having to answer uncomfortable questions about the trial, especially about the federal governments reluctance to share information with the provincial government that had grounded the trial in the Lahore high court. The timing of the conviction of the seven terror suspects of the 26/11 carnage at an anti-terrorism court in Rawalpindi is just as perfect. As it came a day before the anniversary of the tragedy, it circumvented the possibility of fingers being raised at Pakistan for dragging its feet on the judicial proceedings against the Mumbai terror suspects. With seven indicted, including the Lashkar-e-Toiba commander, Zaki-ur Rahman Lakhvi, the trial has finally begun in Pakistan. But the timeliness of the move is unlikely to allow Pakistan to shake off allegations of delay. Despite the meticulous investigation by Pakistans Federal Investigation Agency, proceedings in this case were stonewalled under one pretext or another. Judges were changed, the court was shifted and the case adjourned seven times in the past two months alone. Ajmal Amir Kasabs trial in India, on the contrary, has proceeded with gusto in spite of initial hitches. It is also one that has been held with remarkable transparency, unlike the one in Pakistan from which the media have been barred.        
	All the seven accused in Pakistan have pleaded not guilty, and the defence lawyers are reasonably confident that the lack of sufficient evidence will allow them to walk free. Their hopes may not be misplaced. A similar turn of events has enabled Saeed to continue with his social service and war propaganda despite ten dossiers of information against him sent by India. The accused would hope that apart from political duplicity, legal loopholes too will see them through. Much depends on the eye-witness account of Ajmal Kasab, a proclaimed offender in Pakistan, who, fortunately for the accused, cannot be extradited from India. It seems that without an unprecedented legal initiative between two countries for such an exceptional case, there is every possibility of this trial going the same way as that of the JuD chief.

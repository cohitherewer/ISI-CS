	Waiting for justice                  
	Sir  The outburst of the former Chief Justice of India, J.S. Verma, at the large number pending cases in various courts of the country shows that he is concerned about the snails pace at which the judicial machinery operates ( Ex-CJI blames judge trips at govt expense for pile-up, Aug 26 ). His criticism comes at a time when the prime minister had to urge the judiciary to declare war against the huge pile-ups, pointing out India s dubious distinction of having the largest number of pending cases in the world. Vermas suggestions, if followed, could lead to real improvement in the disposal of cases. If people have to wait endlessly to get justice, the system of dispensing justice begins to lose its relevance in society, and this could end up encouraging lawlessness in the long run.           
	The people have heard all the right political noises about setting up fast-track courts, special courts, lok adalats and so on. However, how many cases have been settled through such courts, and in how much time, have rarely been made public. The entire judicial system should be revamped to make it faster and more transparent, to which end the judiciary and the law ministry should work together. It is important to ensure that the people do not lose their trust in the judicial system.                     
	Yours faithfully,         Srikanta Bhattacharjee,Calcutta                    
	Sir  J.S. Verma has raised a timely question about the accumulation of cases in Indias courts. Verma had been successful in clearing the backlog when he was the CJI, but thereafter the situation has reverted back to the usual slowness at the courts. Besides, there have been reports of irregularities in the system that have forced litigants to take recourse to out-of-court settlements. If the judiciary fails to clear the back-log in time, then the countrys democratic ethos is liable to be damaged.           
	Yours faithfully,Jayanta Datta, Hooghly

                
	Sir  J.S. Verma is right in stating that judges of the apex court should cut down on travel as this hampers the speedy disposal of cases. In order to clear the backlog, apart from drafting in retired judges as suggested by Verma, vacations for judges need to be curtailed as well. The practice of calling frequent adjournments, too, needs to stop as these further increase the backlog.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Till or trade          
	Sir  With reference to the editorial, Words as signs(Aug 24), one must say that Mamata Banerjee has stumped the Left politicians. Although she was instrumental in driving the Tatas away from the state with her disruptive politics, she has later tried to ensure that industrialization is not affected adversely. The issue of land-acquisition for industry is an emotive one. The role of the State is critical here, and it is not a task that can be left to private industrialists alone. The Trinamul Congress leader may feel that the government should not get involved at all in the acquisition of land, but that would be neither possible nor advisable.          
	The land acquisition bill that talks of the government helping an industrialist after he acquires 70 per cent of the land, by taking over the remaining 30 per cent and then selling it to the industrial buyer, is preposterous. Banerjee was quite right in opposing it  although she did so for political convenience. For a businessman to acquire as much as 70 per cent of the land on his own means is a task fraught with the danger of possible conflict between the buyer and the owner. The 70:30 land-share ratio is impracticable as not even a large-scale industrialist, let alone a small-scale one, can be expected, on the one hand, to liaise with various government officials over a piece of land he would like to buy, and on the other hand, to negotiate with the landowners, who may be hostile initially. This is more so because land acquisition is usually looked upon as a threat by the rural populace. The bill only makes the process of starting a business more complicated.           
	Since the land records are with the government, they should be digitized and made available online, with relevant details of the location, transport facilities as well as the legal status of the land, to ease the process of bidding. But acquisition should be undertaken by the government to ensure that the ownership transfer is smooth. To safeguard the interests of the sellers, the payment should be arranged in such a way that the benefit of the increased market value of the land, post industrialization, is distributed between both buyer and seller.           
	Agriculture is as important as industry. To the extent possible, only barren land should be used for industrialization. One hopes that Banerjee would be able to make sure that both industry and agriculture thrive in the state.                     
	Yours faithfully,Raghu Seshadri, Chennai

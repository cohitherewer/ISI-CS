                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Monkey business                  
	Sir  The politicians who agitated at the Alipore zoo over the theft of a pack of Common Marmosets showed their true colours (A zoo called Bengal politics, Aug 11). First, the supporters of Trinamul Congress turned up at the zoo to express their solidarity with the caged creatures who had been forcibly taken away from their family. Then the Congress member of parliament, Deepa Das Munshi, along with her retinue of followers, took over, armed with oversized posters of Manmohan Singh, Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi.  
	This brouhaha on the zoo premises is highly condemnable and deserves legal action for cruelty to animals. So far, the TMC and the Congress have done precious little for wildlife preservation. Endangered species are steadily disappearing as politicians continue to maintain a stoic silence. Is this because animals do not have the right to vote, and so they dont matter?          
	Perhaps the politicians ought to be thanked for not claiming that the lost monkeys were their supporters or that the red brigade has a hand behind this foul play. This unique protest by Bengal politicians has hit a new low: they staged an elaborate drama on the zoo premises blaring loudspeakers, howling slogans and disturbing both the animals and the visitors. Instead of making such a din, a review of the security measures in the zoo would have made far better sense. The theft of the monkeys could have been averted had there been electronic surveillance in the form of CCTV cameras.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  There is no doubt that the Alipore zoo like any other state department in West Bengal is run in a most slipshod manner. The Central Zoo Authority should take over the administration of the zoo, lest the remaining marmosets are also smuggled away. It is preposterous how members of the TMC and the Congress invaded the zoo and disturbed the animals. The government must lodge complaints against the political leaders for causing such disruptions.  
	Yours faithfully,

	Obstacles on the way          
	Sir  The initiation of a process to restore normalcy in the hills by abandoning the idea of a separate Gorkhaland may please the Bengal government only for a short while (Break in mist, Aug 13). The outcome of the August 11 talks did not suggest a permanent solution to a long demand for statehood. There was no indication that the cry for Gorkhaland will simply go away. It seems only the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council Act, 1988, and the Sixth Schedule Bill are supposed to go.  
	The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha seems to be pleased at the way the talks went, and have promised to maintain peace. An alternative framework, which is to be finalized through mutual consultation and agreement, to repeal the DGHC Act could give the agitation a new direction. However, as the editorial mentions, there is really no guarantee that the GJM or some other organization will not revive the demand for a separate state and unleash a fresh bout of anarchy. The next tripartite meeting, to be held in Darjeeling, should aim at forestalling any further movement for the cause of Gorkhaland.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Birkha Khadka Duvarseli, Siliguri 

                
	Sir  Who is responsible for the state that the hills are in today? Years ago, the Bengal government slapped the DGHC on this region, but it neither brought development to the hills nor pleased the people. If the government had assumed that the DGHC would be the answer to the demand for a separate state, then it was totally misguided. The DGHC did nothing for the hills, and the people of this region continue to languish in the same way as before. Only the faces of the leaders and their mode of leadership have changed. Had the council promoted education or development programmes in the villages or taken initiatives for the welfare of the common people, the hills would have been a far better place to live in today. The government would not have faced such a huge crisis as well.  
	The biggest obstacle to development in Darjeeling has been the state government itself. Emotions run high among those who had once braved the bullets of paramilitary forces fighting for the cause of a separate state. These veterans now realize that the lives of the younger generation have not changed all that much. As always, only a handful have tasted success and power. Although the onus of the failure to improve the lives of the people in the hills lies with the government, the role played by some local leaders with vested interest should not be underestimated.          
	To add to these already existing wounds, when a voice was raised demanding an autonomous Gorkhaland, the hill people were labelled foreigners. The Gorkhas of Darjeeling were never outsiders. They are all citizens of India and are proud to be so. These people are only seeking respect for who they are, and asking for resources that could give them a happy and equitable life.          
	Yours faithfully,

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Sharpness with whimsy
                                                                                                                 SHARPNESS WITH WHIMSY                              VISUAL ARTS      Aveek Sen                                                
	Three figurative painters, all in their twenties, showed some of their work in Subliminal Images (Studio21, January 9-20). The title implies a stimulus or mental process perceived by or affecting the human mind without its being aware.         
	All three artists show a high degree of technical deliberation, but situate their work somewhere between fantasy and mythology, with Gauri moving towards a grotesque, yet stylized, vision of the human body. The Surrealists had shown the world how representing the unruliness of the unconscious was a matter of worldliness, precision and wit. Both Satya Dheer Singh and Gourishankar Soni owe their respective idioms to this Surrealist mix of sharpness and whimsy.         
	Singh, trained in Allahabad, uses folk and tribal mythological imagery (birds, chariots, golden umbrellas, hybrid creatures) to create a personal language for a life of desire, conscious as well as subliminal (picture). The confines of a provincial town, where romances are furtively conducted in cycle-rickshaws and open jeeps, become a fantastical ecology peopled by characters who would not have felt out of place in early Jogen Chowdhury or Manjit Bawa. Singhs androgynous men and women have their feet planted on earth, but they look up and aspire to an Elsewhere of the imagination and of feelings that imbue his large canvases with a kind of fairytale sweetness and pathos.         
	Gourishankar Soni, trained in Rajasthan, showed a few smartly done untitled paintings full of erotic mischief. Turning the viewer into some sort of a sophisticated Peeping Tom, Sonis little people live in a polka-dotted world that shares a close kinship with the phantasmagoric universe depicted by Hieronymus Bosch in his Garden of Earthly Delights. There is humour and verve in Sonis world, but it is not difficult to work out the structural principle behind his compositions, and once that is done, he risks pleasuring his viewers a little too effortlessly.         
	Gauris small and medium-sized canvases dwell obsessively on the single motif of a cavernous, open mouth with most of its teeth gone. The body to which this mouth is attached is a complicated contraption of forms and colours. But the net effect of each painting is of a balanced composition that renders the grotesquerie of the body not entirely unpleasant to contemplate. There is even a sort of grim humour about its antics and contortions.         
	Gauris vision of the grotesque body, together with some of the ways in which it prevents its own falling apart, reminded me of the work of Jaya Ganguly, although the look and finish that each painter gives to her figures are distinct.

	English spelling, I wrote two weeks ago, is a quagmire. Why worry, asks a reader, now that we have spell-checkers? Ive never used those aids; I dont need them, I claim, but the real reason, I suspect, is that theyd show up my awful typing. But now Im attending a computer course, where a stern tutor swears by them.        
	So it was that I first met the Owed to a Spelling Checker. Google its opening line and youll find it in many minor variants since its birth in the early 1990s. I too thought I could improve it, and lo, a new ode grew  brand-new, bar the opening four lines and one or two others. Here, purely for your fun, it is:        
	I have a spelling checker,/ It came with my PC./ It plane lee marques fore my revue/ Miss steaks aye wood knot sea.                
	Harder still to learn        
	Too right in stile is know mien feet,/ Its won of witch weir prowed,/ Sew wee mussed Sikh to do hour best,/ And floors just aunt aloud.        
	Butts age gram Aryans lores ah hard/ And hard a still tool urn./ Wee sheikh are heads, are hands wee ring,/ Weave know wear else to tern.        
	Bee four weed herd what chequers whirr/ Are tung was in decline,/ And any won who rote it write/ Mite soon have caws too wine.        
	Wile if a neck spurt showed this kill/ Our heir, feint hopes to raze,/ With on a grate we lorded hymn,/ Week round his browse with baize.         
	These daze inns ted are eer as awl/ Ah court with key nest flare./ Know fall tsar scene awe gray tors maul,/ Of nun am ayah where.        
	A checquer is yaw knee test guyed,/ It freeze yew lodes of thyme./ It helps me rite and ewe two reed,/ And aides me wen aye rime.         
	As on the quays eye wright sum frays,/ To cheque it metes the rule / The Czech a pours oar every stroke  / Aye trussed it, its a joule.                
	This masterpiece         
	If ever ice pell-mell an with/ Knot won ell butter pear/ Its cause align bin ether sine/ Of what cry mitts pots their.         
	Awe riff my sin tacks falter bits / Awe commerce eye miss yews,/ Oar up perk ace for, lo, a take,/ Agree niche markets pews.         
	Now righting know maw phases me,/ Gnaw tiers brings to my ayes,/ Eye awl my wrap to tensions pend/ En-suite words yew will prise.        
	Sew, deer, know tec strong or miss pelt/ Aisle off a too youre gays./ Each sill a bull, each whirred Yule fined,/ Each let us in its plaice.         
	And ewe can I my versus floe,/ Inn meat as wont to pleas  / Mice elf, isle prays with awl dews eel/ This soft wear fore pea seize.        
	Aye ran this mast a peace threw it,/ Yewll shore big lad two no,/ A candy date fore whirled-up laws/ Inn landsve son awe snow  / Im quite up owe it in my weigh,/ My checker tolled me sow.

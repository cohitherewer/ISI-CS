The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Beethoven to Bollywood
                                                                                                                 BEETHOVEN TO BOLLYWOOD                              Fauzia Marikar      MUSIC                                                
	Described as one of the leading Israeli musicians of his generation, Gil Shohat is an acclaimed composer, conductor and virtuoso pianist. He was in Calcutta on March 12 to play the piano to a packed house at the Satyajit Ray Auditorium, presented by the ICCR.        
	The programme, titled Moonlight Recital, featured Beethovens Sonata No. 14 in C sharp minor, Opus 27, No. 2 (Quasi una Fantasia, often referred to as the Moonlight Sonata) and Debussys Claire de Lune, among others. The charismatic Gil Shohat introduced each work with anecdotes and snippets of information. He began the evening a little outside the programme, with Rachmaninovs popular and dramatic Prelude No. 1 in C sharp minor, which was not included in the printed programme. Sadly, the two microphones gracefully bending into the open piano transformed the music into a disturbing jangle of sound that jarred on the ear. Despite this, it was clear that here was a pianist of great power and skill. Beethovens sonata, eagerly awaited by all, was played at an unusually swift tempo in the first movement that belied the promised Allegro sostenuto one is accustomed to. The Allegretto, Trio and Presto agitato were brilliant.        
	The four Impromptus of Schubert that followed, commonly found in the advanced student repertoire and quickly recognized by those present, somehow sounded dismissive in the first two, but were redeemed by the expressive skill of the pianist. The second part of the programme began with an enigmatic improvisation based on an Indian theme, which we were left to guess. Expecting the usual contrived variations on Rabindrasangeet, the audience gasped at the virtuosity of the pianist (and the versatility of the composer) in the hugely ornamental and sweeping introduction, until the theme song was played as an episode in this exuberant sea of notes. To everybodys surprise and delight, it turned out to be Dil to paagal hai  an unusual treatment of a Bollywood tune within the framework of a European harmonic structure. This was decidedly not fusion, but exactly as it was described: an impromptu for piano solo on an Indian melody.        
	Claude Debussys ever-popular Claire de Lune was played with much brilliance too, if not with the accustomed romantic fervour, the mikes detracting from the graceful beauty of the flowing arpeggios in the second part. The final offering of the evening was the last of the Transcendental tudes of Franz Liszt, introduced by the pianist as the most challenging of the evenings works. The 12 tudes are famously regarded to be the most difficult in the solo piano repertoire, attempted only by the most competent performers. Liszt had added programme titles to all but numbers 2 and 10, which he left as Molto vivace and Allegro agitato molto respectively. No. 12 is picturesquely named Chasse-Neige (impetuous winds which raise whirls of snow). It is a title that does justice to the flurry of tremolos that start the music softly, building up gradually through a range of wide leaps and swift chromatic passages to a powerful climax. Shohats consummate technique, dynamic pedalling and sensitive interpretation brought the audience to its feet in a standing ovation. The encore was Chopins Waltz in E minor.        
	It would be a great boon to the city if the ICCR invested in a proper concert grand piano. Also, the acoustics of the beautiful Satyajit Ray Auditorium seem good enough not to require electronic amplification.

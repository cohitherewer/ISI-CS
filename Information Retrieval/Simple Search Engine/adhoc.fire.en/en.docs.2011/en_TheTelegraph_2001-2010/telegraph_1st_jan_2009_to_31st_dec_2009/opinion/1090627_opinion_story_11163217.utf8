The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | moment of change
                                                                                                                 MOMENT OF CHANGE                                                          
	Is something happening after all? This is a question that the weary but stubborn fighters for social change and womens rights may well be asking themselves. Fourteen-year-old Padma Ruidas, from a village in the Bankura district of West Bengal, fought a lone battle when her parents insisted that she get married to a man from Uttar Pradesh whom they had chosen. She quietly asked her neighbours to inform the police. The police arrested the groom and the girls parents, although the ritual vermilion had already been put on Padmas forehead by the time they arrived. But vermilion does not make a marriage, the girl declared, annihilating by this one statement the belief that reason is helpless before superstition among the less educated.         
	Padma is remarkable, and, it can now be hoped, a promise of the future. Her three equally remarkable predecessors, Sunita Mahato, Rekha Kalindi and Afsana Khatun, between 12 and 13 years of age, who had rebelled against their parents decision to get them married off and had succeeded with the help of neighbours, teachers and, in one case, the assistant labour commissioner, were from Purulia district. All three were going to the school run by the national child labour project, having been rehabilitated from beedi-making and paid domestic labour. Padma, on the other hand, had had to drop out of school in Class IV and was helping her parents by doing domestic work in the neighbouring houses. It is not as if she was about to lose something precious by marriage, not even schooling. Her courage and clarity of thought came from her observation of what early marriage had done to her two older sisters. She will think about marriage when she is of age, she said, showing an awareness of which both she and the campaigners against minor marriage can both be proud.        
	While the change that Padma represents is deeply heartening, it also means greater responsibility for the governmental and non-governmental institutions that have been trying to make it happen. Padma needs the assurance that she will not have to fight the same battle again before she is of age; she needs education and the equipment to stand on her own feet. Her neighbours have been helpful, and that too is an indicator of change. This is the same village that has seen many little girls married off, some to men who live in the same part of Uttar Pradesh from which Padmas aspiring groom came. Extreme poverty encourages minor marriage, but Padma has shown that protest is possible even when the poverty cannot be immediately remedied. In one stroke, she has prevented a minor marriage, and has foiled migration by marriage, which, in numerous cases, is turning out to be a disguised form of trafficking. One of Padmas neighbours has admitted that many of the underage brides from the village lose contact with their natal homes. Padmas example could be inspiring, only if she is given the protection and education that are her due.

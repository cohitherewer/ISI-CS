	Q: I had taken a personal loan from a bank about two years ago. Due to financial constraints I was unable to pay four instalments of the loan. I requested the bank to give me more time to make the payment. To my horror the bank sent some goons to my residence and said that we would face dire consequences if we didnt pay up immediately. Since then we have been receiving obscene and intimidating phone calls from the banks agents. We are completely panic-stricken. What should we do?        
	Dwijen Das, Siliguri        
	A: Your bank is using illegal methods to recover the money from you. The Reserve Bank of India has issued certain guidelines to be adopted by banks issuing loans and credit cards and employing recovery agents for the collection of dues. You can lodge a complaint with the police or file a complaint under Section 200 of the Criminal Procedure Code against the bank for harassment and criminal intimidation. But in the meantime you should try to pay the dues to the bank to show your bona fide in a court of law.        
	Q: I am a divorce who has recently remarried. I have a four-year-old son from my previous marriage. My present husband wants to formally adopt him. Is such an adoption possible, given that his natural father is alive?        
	Name Withheld        
	A: Your son can be legally adopted by your present husband either by making a deed of adoption or by making an application for adoption before the district judge within the jurisdiction of your husbands residence. However, in both cases the consent of the childs natural parents is required. So in your sons case your ex-husbands consent will be required.        
	Q: My father, who died recently, was a member in a co-operative housing society. Later, I too became a member of another co-operative housing society. Being the sole heir of my father, I have applied for membership to my fathers co-operative. But now the latter is objecting to it. Is the co-operatives objection valid?         
	Dipak Ghosh, Haltu        
	A: The co-operative is justified in raising its objection. The West Bengal Co-operative Societies Rule, 1987, states that no person shall be entitled to membership of any society if he has become a member of another society in the preceding two years. Also, to be eligible for membership to a co-operative, the person must not own a house or an apartment in his own name or in the name of a family member.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Hot, still and silent moments
                                                                                                                 HOT, STILL AND SILENT MOMENTS                                  This Above all - Khushwant Singh                          Keeping the tryst                                        
	It was one day in Lahore, mid-June, 1947  hot, still and silent. People were rudely shaken out of their siestas by shouts and exploding crackers. Since March, their nights had been disturbed by sporadic gunfire and mobs yelling in the streets, hurling slogans like missiles. From one end, Muslims, armed with knives and lathis, shouted Naara-e-Takbeer followed by full-throated Allah-o-Akbars. From the other end came the reply: Har Har Mahadev and Boley-so-Nihal, Sat Sri Akal. Stones were thrown, abuses exchanged, and unwary pedestrians stabbed to death. The police fired to disperse mobs, a few people were killed before peace was restored. Next morning, the papers reported the casualties like Muslims versus the Rest cricket scores. The score was invariably in favour of the Muslims. The chief reason for Muslims having the upper hand was that the umpires were Muslims. Over 80 per cent of the Punjab Police was Muslim: the state government was Muslim-dominated. It was the same story all over western Punjab. Hindus and Sikhs had begun pulling out of the Muslim-dominated town of Lahore. Finding Lahore unsafe, they trudged on to Amritsar and the towns of eastern Punjab, where Hindus and Sikhs outnumbered Muslims.        
	The June afternoon of 1947 remains etched in my mind. I had returned from the high court when I heard the uproar. I ran up to the roof of my apartment. The sun burnt down fiercely over the city. From the centre billowed a huge cloud of dense, black smoke. I did not have to make guesses: the Hindu-Sikh mohalla of Shahalmi was going up in flames. Muslim goondas had broken the back of non-Muslim resistance. After Shahalmi, the fight went out of the Hindus and Sikhs of Lahore. We remained mute spectators to Muslim League supporters in disciplined phalanxes chanting: Pakistan ka naara kya? La-ilaha-Lilillah.        
	The turmoil had little impact on the well-to-do, who lived around Lawrence Gardens (todays Bagh-e-Jinnah), and on either side of the canal which ran on the eastern end of Lahore. We went about in our cars to our offices, spent evening playing tennis at the Cosmopolitan or the Gymkhana Club, had dinner parties where Scotch, which cost Rs 11 per bottle, flowed like waters of the Ravi. In elite, residential areas, the old bonhomie of Hindu-Muslim bhai bhaism continued. We placed a lot of faith in the Unionist government of Khizr Hayat Tiwana, who had Hindus and Sikhs in his cabinet, and was strongly opposed to a separate Muslim State. League leaders turned their ire on him.        
	Processionists chanted: Taazi khabar, mar gaya Khizr. Then he threw up the sponge. Overnight, he became the hero of Muslim sloganeers: Taazi khabar aayee hai/ Khizr hamara bhai hai.        
	The juggernaut gathered speed. Hindus and Sikhs began to sell properties and slip out towards eastern Punjab. One day I found that my neighbour on one side had painted in large Urdu calligraphy, Parsee ka makaan. One on the other side had a huge cross painted in white. Unmarked Hindu-Sikh houses were thus marked out. We were within walking distance of Mozang, a centre of Muslim goondas.        
	By July 1947, stories of violence against Muslims in east Punjab circulated in Lahore, and a few Muslim refugees flew westwards. This further roused Muslim fury. The last time I went to the high court, I saw a dozen Sikh students of the National College of Arts in handcuffs. They were charged with the murder of two Muslims on the Grand Trunk Road, which passed by the front of their college. One of them was Ganga Singh Dhillon, later the pioneer of the demand for Khalistan. They were produced before Justice Teja Singh, the only Sikh Judge. He freed them on bail. That had become the pattern of justice.        
	A week before Independence, Chris Everett, head of the Criminal Investigations Department in Punjab, who had studied law with me in London, advised me to get out of Lahore. Escorted by six Baluch constables, my wife and I took a train to Kalka to join our two children who had been sent ahead to their grandparents in Kasauli. Then I drove down to Delhi. There wasnt a soul on the 200-mile stretch. I arrived in Delhi on August 13, 1947. The next night, I was among the crowd outside Parliament chanting Bharat mata ki jai. We heard Sucheta Kripalanis voice over loudspeakers singing Vande Mataram. Then came Jawaharlal Nehrus Tryst with destiny speech.        
	What a tryst it was! And what destiny!                
	Symbolic universe                
	India, the second-largest democracy,        
	Also has enormous illiteracy.        
	When the average voter goes to the        
	poll,        
	He presses a EVM-button seeing a        
	symbol.        
	Thus, at times, a stupid candidate is        
	democratically elected to legislate.        
	Next five years for him will be no        
	worry        
	Illicit income, free air-travel, life         
	of luxury.        
	Totally cut off from his grassroots        
	And will not let it grow under his        
	boots.        
	While the aam admi may suffer and        
	yell,        
	The MP relaxes in bedroom and         
	mutters, Go to hell!

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | secrets behind happiness
                                                                                                                 SECRETS BEHIND HAPPINESS                                  CHINA DIARY -Neha Sahay                              
	Surveys are big in China, as are all things American. Theres even a strange survey on happiness. For example, Hangzhou  on the east coast  has been voted the happiest city in the country for the last five years, its famous West Lake probably a major contributing factor.         
	However, a recent well-being inspection in the new satellite town of Nanjing makes one wonder at the implications of such surveys. This town, parts of which are still rural, is being developed as a showpiece high-tech extension of Nanjing. Naturally, things must be perfect there.         
	So, the answers were also distributed along with the questionnaires that were given to the residents for the survey. The village officials each adopted 30 households, starting with their relatives. They had to ensure that these 30 households answered correctly. To ensure the villagers fullest cooperation, the officials also announced a prize of 2,000 yuan to those who got all the answers right.         
	Leaving nothing to chance, students were given the day off to enable their parents to read out the correct answer on the phone when the surveyors called. Officials themselves had to deposit some money with their office; if everyone answered as expected, the deposit would be refunded; if not, the officials would lose the deposit, be fined, and could even lose their job.        
	When the big day dawned, families made sure their phones were close to them. One couple moved the phone to their bedroom, but suddenly found it wasnt working. They hurried to the exchange, only to find others there with the same complaint. The exchange told them the problem could only be solved by the afternoon, by which time the survey would be over. Coincidentally, the families whose phones suddenly went out of order were either poorer than the rest, or known to be troublemakers.                 
	Unnatural disaster        
	The final result: the village showed a satisfaction index of over 96 per cent. As always, this incident made its way to the local newspapers. A reporter who interviewed a senior party official found, to his surprise, the man readily admitting to most of what had appeared in the press, but for three things: the government had not planned for the phones to stop working; it hadnt instructed students to help their parents; neither had it promised any incentive to villagers.         
	This official insisted that the answers were not fudged. For example, he maintained that the correct answer about the villagers annual income was indeed 8,000 yuan, even though many of them earned less than that. Income wasnt measured only in cash, but also in terms of livestock owned by the villagers. But what about the expenses incurred on maintaining the livestock? To that the official had no answer.         
	This incident has been widely covered, with one commentator recalling the bad old days under Mao Zedong when agricultural production was portrayed as rising even though farmers were starving. In fact, a former reporter with Xinhua, himself a communist party member who had lived through those days, has just had his extensively researched book on the great famine of 1959-61 published in Hong Kong. It concludes that the natural disasters that were said to have caused the famine were actually man-made, to be precise, Mao-made. This reporters own father died in the famine, but he thought his village was an aberration.         
	It was only a decade later that he chanced upon the number of persons who had died in his province alone in a Red Guard document: the number of those who perished was 300,000. The reporter then decided he must find out the truth. It took him 10 years to do that, accessing documents and speaking to survivors.Tombstone, the reporters book, is already banned on campus in his own province.

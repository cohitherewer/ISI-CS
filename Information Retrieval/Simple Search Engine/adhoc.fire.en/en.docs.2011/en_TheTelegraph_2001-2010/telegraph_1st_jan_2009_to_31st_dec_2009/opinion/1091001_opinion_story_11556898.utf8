The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Still waiting for the Mahatma
                                                                                                                 STILL WAITING FOR THE MAHATMA                                  Instead of distorting Gandhis legacy for dubious political gain, India needs to see if his beliefs can work today, writes Somak Ghoshal                          Gandhi, Trivandrum, 2000 from Privacy by Dayanita Singh                                  
	Writing in the Partisan Review in 1949, a year after Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi fell to an assassins bullet, George Orwell left behind a fitting epitaph for him: I believe that even Gandhis worst enemies would admit that he was an interesting and unusual man who enriched the world simply by being alive. It is a measured sentiment, treading the middle path between gushing eulogy and blanket denunciation, the two common reactions that have polarized public perceptions of Gandhi as much during his lifetime as in his afterlife, enabling people to make either a mahatma or a monster of him. Orwells assessment of Gandhi, on the contrary, remains uncompromisingly sane, even though his feelings about Gandhi were ambivalent at best. It is precisely this shiftiness, betrayed by Orwells tone, that continues to survive in contemporary Indias attitude to Gandhi.        
	It is ironic that most of the principles Gandhi lived by  satyagraha, non-violence, celibacy, frugality  were, from the time of their inception, difficult, if not impossible, to incorporate in the fabric of modern life. This perhaps explains the greater popularity of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose or Swami Vivekananda as leaders of the struggle for independence. In West Bengal, for instance, you are likely to come across celebrations of Netajis birthday on January 23 on street corners, with the mandatory hoisting of the national flag and patriotic songs on loudspeakers. Nothing comparable is arranged to commemorate Gandhi Jayanti.               
	Apart from the obvious reason of Bengal being Netajis home state, what explains his greater claim to fame over Gandhi in this region is the romance of heroism associated with his character. The same holds true for Swami Vivekananda, who, being a karma yogi, privileged active service over passive contemplation. Vivekanandas injunction to the youth to play football rather than sit poring over the Gita advocated a gregarious and physically robust character in stark opposition to Gandhis emphasis on fasting and passive aggression. People would be naturally less inclined to follow Gandhis example than Netajis or Swamijis  it is always easier, and more attractive, to be a hero than to be a saint.        
	So, in a sense, the best practitioner of the Gandhian philosophy was always Gandhi himself, given the steadfastness and absolutism with which he followed his own ideals. Human nature remains vulnerable to its all-too-human longings. Perhaps the most stinging desecration of Gandhis vision of social cleansing happened in his own hometown, Porbandar, as it turned into a bootleggers paradise over the years. No wonder an increasing number of people continue to die from drinking illicit alcohol in Gujarat, a state that had imposed prohibition in deference to the Mahatma. As for sexual abstinence, had Indians been even remotely moved by Gandhis views on the matter, they would have inherited a less burgeoning nation, faced less of food shortages and made a better deal with life. In spite of the brouhaha over affirmative action, the backward classes continue to suffer miserably. Regarding inter-communal relations, you need not look beyond the track record of Narendra Modi to realize how cruelly Gandhis aspiration for a Hindu-Muslim brotherhood has been mocked.        
	Apart from a generally frazzled India, riddled with sundry demands of statehood, shattered by internal rebellions and threatened by dangerously porous international borders, what poisons the life of the nation are political leaders, donning the khadi that Gandhi had made a cult of, and professing to lead a plain living, high thinking existence. Yet it is this self-fashioning, more than anything else, that has become inseparable from the aura of fraudulence that surrounds them: think of the Bollywood neta, in a Gandhi topi and with folded hands, an icon synonymous with corruption in the popular psyche.        
	Yet Gandhis ideas have also entered the fray of modernity in decisive ways. In his autobiography, Gandhi speaks of his desire to blur every distinction between the private and the public, so that his life embodies the metaphor of the open book. Shorn of all secrets, politicians too are supposed to represent a pristine persona, one who allows his private ethics and public actions to converge and define his social role. The intense scrutiny to which the public and private lives of politicians are relentlessly subjected in the media harks back to the way Gandhi used his own journalism to illustrate his ideal of transparency. From honesty to austerity, Gandhi remains the true begetter of many debates that continue to engage India more than 60 years after his death.              
	But to what extent can Gandhis words be heeded to the letter in the age of market economy and globalization? The quick disintegration of the national agenda for cost-cutting into silly jokes shows, for one, the extent to which Gandhis ideas have been literalized and thus misrepresented. For Gandhi, austerity was a way of life, not a convenient excuse to garner votes. It did not mean standing in the queue with the aam aadmi to buy vegetables or travelling with the so-called cattle class on aeroplanes. Gandhi considered frugal habits and an unblemished soul as keys to a fearless existence. He embraced this belief fervently, doing away with any security around him, even at the risk of inviting a fanatics ire. Although possessed of a sterling sense of humour, Gandhi would probably have been the last person to crack poor jokes at the expense of the middle class. The Indian middle class is intelligent and has developed something of a knack for turning the tables on the leaders in election time. This class also works very hard to be able to afford an economy ticket, and would not like to be ridiculed for it.        
	To retrieve Gandhi from the realm of tokenism (khadi being the most pervasive token), India would have to reinterpret the symbolic potential of Gandhis lifes work. When Gandhi began his experiments with truth, he was venturing into uncharted terrain. He enriched the world, to borrow from Orwell, complicated the established cycles of life, death, justice and injustice. India after Gandhi can be a richer place by reinventing his way of life. The rehabilitation of Gandhi in public life need not be done merely through comedy, as in the film, Lage Raho Munna Bhai, which introduced the notion of Gandhigiri (a user-friendly version of the sterner stuff). Politicians, for one, can stop wearing the khadi like a school uniform and affecting the manners of overzealous schoolboys dying to save the world. The janata would be far better pleased with their elected leaders if the latter started behaving more responsibly and taking a little more interest in the lives of others.

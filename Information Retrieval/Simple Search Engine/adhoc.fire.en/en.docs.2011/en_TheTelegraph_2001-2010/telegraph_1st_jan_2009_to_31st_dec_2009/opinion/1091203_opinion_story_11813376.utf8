                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        NOT QUITE NEW                                                    
	In his first policy address on Afghanistan after assuming office, Barack Obama, the president of the United States of America, had enumerated an exit strategy for the US and North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies. In his latest policy announcement from West Point, Mr Obama sets a clear date  2011  for the exit process to begin despite the absence of any indication that the strategy adopted has got him closer to anything resembling success. Why Mr Obama commits himself to a time frame is obvious. With 55 per cent of the domestic population and a sizeable section within his own party having turned against the Afghanistan war, the initiation of the countdown had become a necessary rider to an announcement of a troop surge, without which Mr Obama runs the chance of losing whatever has been gained in eight years of fighting. The problem with this new policy is that other than its USP of the roll-back time, it is no different from what had existed before. It remains dependent on the same variables  the uncertainty about additional troops being able to provide the breakthrough on the ground, the peculiar situation in Afghanistan, and Pakistans intransigence in clearing its own territory of terror links.         
	Of the three, the last is perhaps the most dispiriting. Mr Obama is acutely aware that the headway achieved in the first few years of the war in Afghanistan was lost when Pakistan emerged as the safe haven for terrorists. Yet, other than continuing the unpopular drone attacks along Pakistans borders or cajoling Pakistan into action by giving it generous military and non-military aid, there is hardly much the US can do. Mr Obama made his frustration known in a letter to his Pakistan counterpart earlier this month. But with the steadily decreasing stature of Asif Ali Zardari in Pakistan, it is unlikely to carry much weight within the establishment that is again completely in the iron grip of the Pakistan army. Despite the internal threat and bloodshed, the army is still unwilling to take on the Afghan Taliban or al Qaida networks, with which it hopes to neutralize Indias strategic gains in Afghanistan.         
	The situation may turn out to be as disappointing for the US within Afghanistan if it fails to coax the Hamid Karzai government to root out corruption and form a more broad-based government. Mr Karzais refusal to remove his brother, charged with corruption, from the government in Kandahar, and his growing obduracy towards the US are not very encouraging signs. There remain Mr Obamas hopes of building up a civilian resistance to the Taliban. But that may not work out within the prescribed time frame. With the pious announcement of withdrawal, without the groundwork complete, Mr Obama may be giving time to his adversaries in Afghanistan to work out their plot. Meanwhile, he may be losing his own.

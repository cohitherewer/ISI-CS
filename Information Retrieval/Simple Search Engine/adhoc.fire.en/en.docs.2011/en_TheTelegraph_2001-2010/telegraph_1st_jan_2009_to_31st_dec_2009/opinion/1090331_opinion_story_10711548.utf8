	Special needs                  
	Sir  The article, A school for everyone (March 17), was greatly reassuring and I must congratulate the author, Reena Sen, for writing it. That we have even begun to think about children with special educational needs is a huge step forward in the herculean task of bringing them into the mainstream. I am a developmental paediatrician specializing in neuro-disability and neurodevelopment, and children with special needs are special to me indeed. Their concerns are very close to my heart.           
	I have been trained in the United Kingdom and have worked there for 13 years in various schools, both mainstream and those for children with disabilities. The experience was an eye-opener for me. It was amazing to see how the life of these children and that of their parents improved radically when they got adequate input and support from schools. The educational ethos across the globe today is inclusion. But such an attitude has been late in the making, even in developed countries like the UK. The need for appropriate training for the teachers and staff in schools for special children cannot be underestimated. In the UK, it helps that most of these schools are state-funded and extremely well resourced.           
	Having come back to Calcutta to work with children having various disorders after 13 years, I now hope to utilize my expertise acquired on field in the UK and contribute to their development. However, the first stumbling block I encountered here was the lack of schools in which these children can be integrated. Parents are in despair that there are no schools that will open the doors to their ward. In many cases it so happens that a child with special requirements faces difficulties in a mainstream school and yet the school has no means to help the child. Unfortunately, in most of these cases, the easiest way out is adopted, and the school expels the child.           
	Parents then get desperate to get their child back to school. They run from pillar and post for this but achieve very little by way of result. While there is no dearth of professionals to deal with children with disabilities, the entire system is not very organized. As a result, there is often inappropriate or late diagnosis of the problems. This, for the child, translates into a dearly missed opportunity of early intervention. This is a pity since there is unquestionable evidence supporting the fact that if corrective measures are implemented in time, the difficulties can be solved early. But the schools do not even know whom to refer these children to.           
	Some of these children are taken to counsellors but then the former cannot spell out the reasons for which they need counsel. Some go to general paediatricians, who cannot diagnose the problems because a majority of these children seems healthy. Some go to special educators, who usually patch up the problems in an imperfect manner. A few very fortunate ones make their way to psychologists perhaps via psychiatrists. Till date, a developmental paediatrician gets to handle only a handful of these cases. The role of a developmental paediatrician is to examine these children, make a holistic assessment of their troubles and formulate an integrated programme for their progress with the active involvement of the school. The really unlucky children are those who have been expelled from school. Even if they undergo appropriate therapy and receive support from peer groups, the need for remedial teaching remains unfulfilled in their lives.           
	My younger patients, who have fortunately been picked up early, are benefiting immensely from diagnosis and intervention. But still they are very few pre-schools that they can get admitted in. This is affecting their training. The parents are prepared to give their child special support. While that will take care of the home front, what about their educational requirements that only a school can provide? These children can be helped only if policymakers, professionals, teachers and parents work together. It is high time they do so in the interests of these exceptional children.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Not a drop          
	Sir  Election time is perhaps not the right hour for talking about tea, especially Darjeeling tea. Yet, since most of the tea gardens in the Terai, Dooars and Darjeeling, as also in Assam and Tripura, are languishing, it is necessary that our elected representatives come forward to save this national asset. Although tea is grown in various other countries all over the world, there can hardly be any alternative to Darjeeling tea. But the Darjeeling tea gardens have been facing serious challenges in the last few years. To add to the problems, now the leaders of the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha are demanding that Darjeeling tea be called Gorkhaland tea henceforth. They have even declared a ban on tea auctions unless the change is made. Such an attitude can only be detrimental to the world market for Darjeeling tea. It will also bring about the ruin of all those connected with the trade.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Jyoti P. Guhaneogi, Pabitrapara, Jalpaiguri

                
	Sir  The report, Water supply hit (March 9), about the disruption of water supply in Gangtok after the six pipes providing water to the city snapped following a landslide reminded me of similar difficulties we face everyday in Darjeeling. The Darjeeling district perpetually suffers from water shortage. Sometimes people have to travel long distances to fetch drinking water. The situation is slightly better down south in the Terai but even there, people have started digging wells beside rivers to get drinking water. It is a shame that our leaders are doing nothing about this grave problem. Their apathy makes me wonder about their role in society. Instead of spending time and money on unnecessary works, they should start thinking about the welfare of the public who elected them to power.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Mandeep Gahatraj, Panighatta, Darjeeling

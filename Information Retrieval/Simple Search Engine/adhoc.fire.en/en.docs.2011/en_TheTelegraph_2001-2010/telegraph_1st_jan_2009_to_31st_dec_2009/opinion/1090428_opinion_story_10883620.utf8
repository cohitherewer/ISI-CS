                                                                                                                 BARGING IN                                                    
	It was shocking enough, for most civilized people, to see the National Library being summarily requisitioned by the Election Commission for polling work. To then refuse to review this decision in the light of the strong and widespread public protest against it is to take such bureaucratic high-handedness to an outrageous extreme. To do so in the name of democracy makes it all the more outrageous. Discretion and civility in the exercise of the legal rights bestowed on a regulatory body remain crucial to the democratic process. In every other civilized democracy, the EC has to ask the permission of those running an institution before taking it over. If the permission is not granted it, then this will have to be honoured by the EC. This is how the EC operates in Britain, for instance, where the authorities at the Bodleian or British Library can only imagine such an invasion  and that too with difficulty  in a scenario as extreme as a nuclear attack on the country. Even with the venues that are normally taken over by the EC in Britain  schools and leisure centres  if the permission initially sought is not granted, then there is little that the EC can, or would wish to, do. In the case of the National Library in Calcutta, the notion of asking for permission seems to have been quite beyond the ECs conception. The library was simply informed by the EC that the premises would be taken over, and there was no question of a choice on the part of the library. This is not democracy, but exactly the opposite of it, and of a particularly insidious kind. Such a modus operandi takes a commonly held civilized position, peremptorily overturns it, and then tries to pass that peremptoriness off as the exercising of a sacred right for the sake of the people.        
	What is most unpleasantly surprising, and bewildering, is the States passiveness in all this. It has occurred to neither the state government nor the Centre to intervene, or even have a position, on the matter. Would the Centre have watched quietly if the EC had decided to take over the Red Fort or the Taj Mahal for the work of democracy? An invaluable national archive and a place of study of the order of the National Library should be left absolutely alone by the electoral machinery, or for that matter, by any process that is extrinsic to its original purpose. To have had to explain this in vain to a body like the EC bodes terribly ill for the Indian polity and society.

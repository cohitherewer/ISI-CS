	In the past two years, various non-African countries  China, India, South Korea, Britain and the Arab Gulf states have been taking over huge tracts of farmland in Africa by lease or purchase, to produce food or bio-fuels for their own use. Critics call them neo-colonialists, but they will not be as successful as the old ones. The scale of the land grab is impressive. In Sudan, South Korea has acquired 69,000 hectares of land to grow wheat. The United Arab Emirates, which already has 30,000 hectares in Sudan, is investing in another 378,000 hectares to grow corn, alfalfa, wheat, potatoes and beans. In Tanzania, Saudi Arabia is seeking 500,000 hectares.        
	Even bigger chunks of land are being leased to produce bio-fuels. China has acquired 2.8 million hectares in the Democratic Republic of Congo to create the worlds largest oil-palm plantation, and is negotiating for two million hectares in Zambia to grow jatropha. British firms have secured big tracts of land in Angola, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Nigeria and Tanzania.Why Africa? Because thats the last place where there are large areas of good agricultural land that arent already completely occupied by local farmers. There are usually some peasants scratching a living from the land, but they are few and poor, and they can easily be bought or driven out. For the foreigners, the lure is profit, or food security, or both. For those who are investing in bio-fuels, there are profits to be made in the short term. But for those seeking food security, the new African food resources will probably become unavailable just when they are needed most.        
	It was the surge in grain prices in 2007-2008 that drove many countries that depend heavily on imported food to start acquiring African farmland. The immediate reason for a doubling or tripling of the price of wheat, rice and corn (maize) was a couple of local crop failures and the diversion of large amounts of American corn into bio-fuel production, but the underlying cause was that the global food supply is falling further and further behind demand.                
	Bad investment        
	Since 1945, the worlds population has tripled, and so has its food production. But for most of the past decade, grain production has essentially flat-lined, while the global population has gone on growing. By 2006, just before the prices soared, the world grain reserve had shrunk from 116 days of food for everybody in the world in 1999 to only 57 days. Last years good harvests brought prices back down, but the outlook for this year is dire, with drought in about half of the worlds main grain-growing areas.        
	So wouldnt it be nice if you didnt have to compete for scarce stocks of grain at inflated prices on the international grain market when prices soar, but could rely on your own food supply instead, even if it isnt located in your own country? Thats why, its mostly countries that depend heavily on food imports that are involved in the current land-rush in Africa  but they are forgetting two things.        
	The first is that sovereignty trumps contractual obligations. If the African countries that are leasing their land fall into difficulties in feeding their own populations, as they are likely to do if world grain prices rise sharply, the first resource they will turn to is the foreign plantations on their territory. The second is that when things get really tough, when climate change starts to bite, grain yields fall and what remains of the international grain market cannot meet demand at any price, Africa is not the place to be sourcing your emergency grain supply. Almost the entire continent lies in the tropics or the sub-tropics, which is where food production will be hit worst.        
	The neo-colonialists will make some money in the short term, but they will not get much for their investment in the long run. Trouble is, Africans will not get much out of it either, although some of their leaders certainly will.

	For millions of Indian consumers, having to put their mouths where their money is could mean having to give up eating a few meals each week. Prices of all kinds of food products  from grain to vegetables to processed foods  have gone through the roof, by nearly 20 per cent in November, for instance, compared to the same month a year earlier. The price increases are not reflected just in the consumer price index; the food component of the wholesale price index  where it has a weight of about 18 per cent  has gone up nearly 137 per cent this year over 2008. A number of causes have contributed: some old familiars, but a few of more recent vintage. The first is the failed monsoon, which means lower estimates of food production; second, poor infrastructure, which results in an estimated annual loss of Rs 52,000 crore without cold storage or quick transportation to markets for perishables; third, restrictions on food imports that could have ameliorated the huge price increases. Fourth, there are hoarders, but dealing with them is not new. Fifth, in recent years, with the huge amounts of global liquidity, hedge funds and other institutional speculators have diversified their portfolios into food commodities as an asset class, driving global prices. Sixth, food cultivation has been diverted to bio-fuels as an alternative to high oil prices.        
	Most people are looking to the Reserve Bank of India, but as Governor Duvvuri Subbarao has said, monetary policy is a blunt instrument for such a complex problem. Raising interest rates could reduce liquidity, but could also adversely impact the nascent recovery in economic growth. Allowing imports is another option; but international macroeconomic factors  exchange rates, volatile oil prices, and continuing very easy liquidity  could play a larger role in exporting nations decisions. The government could release the stocks it holds, both to the open markets and through the public distribution system, but that is likely to have less impact on vegetable prices. Price controls are a possibility, but that would turn off domestic investors and reduce our attraction as an investment destination. Montek Singh Ahluwalia, the deputy chairman of the Planning Commission, said this rapid and sizeable run-up in food prices was a supply side phenomenon, and hes probably right; that implies short-term fixes would not fundamentally address the problems infrastructure, storage and transportation  that have been essentially long-term.

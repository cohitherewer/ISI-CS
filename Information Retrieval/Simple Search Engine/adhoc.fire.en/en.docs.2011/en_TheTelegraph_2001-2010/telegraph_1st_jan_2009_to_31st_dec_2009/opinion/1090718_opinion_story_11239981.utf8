	Pleasantly austere  
	Sir  I read K.P. Nayars Good old filter coffee (July 8) with much delight. In it, Nayar highlights the austerity and waste in South Block very vividly. I am a keen follower of this columnist and his incisive writing. In this context, it may be said that S.M. Krishna, the senior Karnataka politician, would bring great political depth to the ministry of external affairs of India. However, the media-savvy Shashi Tharoor and media-shy A.K. Antony will also set good precedents by practising austerity within the scope of their new offices.  
	Yours faithfully, 
  Amit Sengupta, Bokaro
      
	Striking hot  
	Sir  The trouble in Darjeeling over the demand for a separate Gorkhaland is an unfortunate one (Students advised to leave hills, July 10). The government of West Bengal has been comparatively silent over the issue. Even the elected member of parliament from Darjeeling, Jaswant Singh, had supported the Gorkha agitation because he wanted that seat in Parliament by hook or by crook. Now he is nowhere to be seen.  
	The state government must clarify its stand on the issue and tame the agitation. West Bengal has already suffered Partition, and should not be broken up again. The leaders heading the movement must realize that it will only impoverish their people more. The police are bound to take action during such protests. So demanding the removal of one or the other police officer for that is futile.  
	Yours faithfully, 
  Benu Kumar Bose, Calcutta    
	Sir  Darjeeling has been dubbed the queen of hills because of its dream-like quality and rich heritage. It has contributed to the tourism industry in a significant manner. Tourists refuse to visit Darjeeling now owing to the lack of security.  
	The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha has declared an indefinite strike in the hills and has also demanded the substitution of the present inspector-general of police, Kundan Lal Tamta. Darjeelings importance lies in the fact that it is a reasonably priced destination for any one who wishes to get a glimpse of the Himalayas. Many middle-class families that had planned a vacation to the hills during Durga Puja have had to cancel their trip because of the indefinite strike. This is nothing but an attempt to stop all public activity, and an intentional move to reduce the profit from tourism.  
	The state government has evaded taking any resolute action to bring the situation under control, which shows just how indifferent the chief minister is to his peoples problems and emotions.  
	Yours faithfully, 
  Satyaki Banerjee, Howrah    
	High drama  
	Sir  The Parliament recently witnessed an uproar against a television serial that deals with child marriage, and sought a ban on such stories. One wonders why the members have so far refrained from implementing the ban on the practice of child marriage itself, which is still prevalent among certain communities. It is the seriousness of the issue that should have engaged the attention of the nations law-makers rather than a soap-opera theme.  
	Yours faithfully, 
  Vineet Phadtare, Mumbai    
	Parting shot  
	Sir  The stretch between Dum Dum station and cantonment is a neglected one. Since no transport is available except cycle rickshaws, people have to walk for 20-30 minutes to either of the stations to catch a train. I would like to request the railways minister to try and provide at least a halt station between these two stops.  
	Yours faithfully, 
  Subhash Chandra Das, Bediapara

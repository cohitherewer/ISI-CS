	One of the witticisms about the Left in India is that it exists in three and a half states. The three states are Kerala, Tripura and West Bengal and the half is Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi, communists sprouting from its debating circles. There is a very real possibility now that the Left would wither away in West Bengal  at least, as rulers. Writing political obituaries of leaders and parties can be risky business, but it is safer now than ever before to talk about the decline and fall of the Left in West Bengal. The results of the municipal polls  that came less than two months after the Lefts crushing defeat in the Lok Sabha elections  leave little doubt about its coming collapse in the assembly polls of 2011. It is a process that began with the panchayat elections last year. After every electoral defeat, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) sought to explain it away with wild conspiracy theories. But there were reasons for the successive defeats of the Left Front that the people could easily see but the leftists could not. The strategy of a united fight, once helping the Left come to power, is now working for the Opposition.         
	Yet, this massive popular surge against the Left cannot be explained only by the so-called anti-incumbency factor. After all, the Left Fronts 32-year reign is a record of sorts for an elected government, not just in India, but anywhere in the world. Two things seem to have set the stage for the decline of West Bengals Left. Leftism as a political ideology is increasingly seen as both irrelevant and unworkable, not only by the people but also by its adherents. The political and economic ruin that communism wrought in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe finally exploded the myth of the socialist utopia. In West Bengals case, the people seem to have become utterly frustrated by years of non-performance by the government. True to the communist tradition, the line between the government and the party was blurred at all levels. But the gap between the people and the party cadre kept widening. The peoples deprivations and sense of injustice grew almost in direct proportion to the prosperity and arrogance of the cadre. The Left legacy of an administrative vacuum will continue to hurt West Bengal for a long time. It could be worse if the Lefts opponents, too, put bad politics before the states economic good.

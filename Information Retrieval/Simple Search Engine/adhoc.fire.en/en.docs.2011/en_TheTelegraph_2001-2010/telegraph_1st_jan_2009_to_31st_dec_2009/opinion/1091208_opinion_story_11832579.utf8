	It seems that the only thing that has consistently, and convincingly, changed since the Kyoto Protocol was adopted in 1997 is the temperature of the earth. The principles of the protocol  aimed at arresting the rate of global warming by reducing the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the positions taken by the major and minor players in response to its stipulations, and the prevailing sense of an impasse remain as they used to be 12 years ago. Yet, a grand conference on climate change on the heels of an equally grand economic depression betokens a rare sense of urgency that can only be explained by a subliminal change in attitudes. For the spectacle of 15,000 delegates from 192 nations gathering in Copenhagen for a two-week summit to combat environmental disaster suggests an overwhelming consensus on at least one thing: the imminent dangers facing a steadily polluting world.         
	It has been unanimously agreed on by big and small nations alike that the earth must be saved, and for that to happen GHG emissions have to be cut. But the bone of contention remains over who is to do how much and in return for what. According to the Kyoto Protocol, industrialized or developed nations, being the worst polluters, are expected to take on legally binding emission reduction commitments, an idea that was met with unmitigated scorn in the West (Australia, the biggest polluter per person, refrained from signing the treaty for a long time, while the United States of America, the biggest emitter, is yet to ratify it). It was pointed out that the developing nations, increasingly aspiring to a mechanized, first-world lifestyle, were the chief culprits. Suddenly the tables were being turned on Asia  particularly on the new regional powerhouses, India and China.        
	India has taken a considered stance on the matter. Like most emerging economies, it has pledged to act but not without adequate incentives (economic aid, in this case). India is one of the lowest emitters, both in terms of per hectare and per capita emissions. But the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, has refused to make a virtue out of numbers. It is undeniable that India remains one of the most polluted countries in the world, and it is only going to get worse as it gradually makes the transition from a largely-agrarian to an industrial economy. In India, recycling is a way of life, although that is fading away as per capita income increases  need will slowly be replaced by greed. Above all, the effects of climate change are universal, and the Indian subcontinent has experienced them to its acute detriment. The devastating tsunami a few years back, followed by the cyclones, droughts and floods at regular intervals, should be portents of things to come. Investing in climate control is as essential as buying an insurance policy to safeguard ones own home.

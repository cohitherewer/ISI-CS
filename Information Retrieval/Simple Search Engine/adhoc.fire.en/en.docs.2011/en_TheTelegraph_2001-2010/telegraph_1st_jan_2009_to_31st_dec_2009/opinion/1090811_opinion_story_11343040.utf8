                                                                                                                 ENEMIES WITHIN THE BORDERS                                  Richard Holbrookes demand to open a new front in Baluchistan is unlikely to be met by the Pakistani leaders, writes Abhijit Bhattacharyya                           Difficult terrain                                  
	An unexpected but interesting development seems to have taken place during Richard Holbrookes recent visit to Pakistan. During his meetings with the president, Asif Ali Zardari, the prime minister, Yousaf Raza Gilani, the army chief, General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani and the minister of state for finance, Hina Rabbani, Holbrooke insisted on intensifying operations in Helmand, coupled with enhanced intelligence-sharing and military offensive in Baluchistan. The sudden emphasis on Baluchistan by the US special envoy for Pakistan and Afghanistan, coming in the steps of the joint statement issued by Manmohan Singh and Yousaf Gilani at Sharm el-Sheikh, has created waves across South Asia.         
	Holbrooke reportedly referred to India as a great regional power, to be taken on board on actions against militants that are the common enemy of the US, India and Pakistan. It also appeared that Holbrooke made a subtle distinction in his references to the United States of America, India and Pakistan. He referred to the actions of militants in the US and in India as attacks. But when it came to militant strikes in Pakistan, he stated that the extremists were killing innocent people and had murdered Pakistans great leader, Benazir Bhutto. Holbrooke seemed to have created two distinct categories. The US and India  victims of a common terror  have been bracketed together. As for Pakistan, Holbrooke suggested that it faces a threat from within. Holbrookes concerns for the US and India are easily discernible. He seems to share the belief that the origin of terror lies in Pakistan. Hence his stringent demands on Pakistan and its government. Holbrooke, in keeping with his special status, also declared that tension between Pakistan and India was now over, and both countries needed to move forward and take action against the common enemy.               
	However, it is unlikely that Holbrookes demand of a military offensive in Baluchistan will be met by the Pakistani authorities. Pakistan is unlikely to open a new front in Baluchistan because of a number of factors that might inconvenience its military deployments.        
	To begin with, one must have a clear understanding of Baluchistan, and its geo-strategic importance to Pakistan. Baluchistan is the largest province in Pakistan, and comprises nearly 48 per cent of the total area of the country. Baluchistans one crore population makes up, approximately, six per cent of Pakistans total population. Nevertheless, governing the province has never been easy, ever since it became a part of Pakistan a year after the partition of India.         
	Baluchistan continues to be volatile and violent owing to several mistakes committed by the Pakistani generals. The tribals in Baluchistan, led by the chieftains called sardars, have been sensitive about the non-Baluchi dominance over their tradition, culture and natural resources ever since the province became a part of Pakistan. Things have not changed much ever since, in spite of the advent of Taliban and the presence of Nato forces in the vicinity.        
	In the early days, Baluchistan did not pose a significant threat to the Pakistani state. Consequently, army excesses were also unheard of. All this changed because of the ill-conceived military action on August 26, 2006, when Akbar Khan Bugti, the head of the Bugti tribe, was killed by bombs dropped from army helicopters on his hideout. This single, monumental blunder proved to be disastrous for General Pervez Musharrafs political career as he succeeded in opening multiple war fronts, which, in turn, resulted in the escalation of violence within Pakistan. For the army in Pakistan, Baluchistan is still a small trouble spot. The bigger and graver threat to the nation, from the armys point of view, is the Taliban. The Taliban, according to the Pakistani army, is pro-India, and has been created by India to foment trouble inside Pakistan. This, the army thinks, has been done in response to Pakistans proxy war against India which is being carried out in the form of terror strikes across the border.         
	When the marauding Taliban faced the might of the Pakistani military in Swat valley, Sajjad Ghani, the sector commander, mentioned the alleged Indian role in the violence in that region. The Taliban, explained Ghani, is being directed, commanded and controlled by some of hostile intelligence agencies. He also added that the Taliban was being controlled by our neighbouring country. In his references to hostile intelligence agencies, and neighbouring country, Ghani could have only alluded to the Research and Analysis Wing and to India respectively. The exasperated Ghani also made another fascinating comparison. He went on record stating, Matta, a major Taliban stronghold in Swat, is the Benares of terrorism.        
	In fact, credible reports suggest that virtually everyone in Pakistan  street-side tea vendors, students and senior officials  genuinely believe that the Talibans advance in Pakistan is part of a larger Indian conspiracy to encircle the country by building ties with the US and Afghanistan. Never mind that the Taliban is fighting the White House and Kabul simultaneously. An ordinary Indian will be surprised to learn that some circles in Pakistan sincerely believe that the Indian consulate in Afghanistan, fully supported by the US, is creating mayhem and sabotaging peace in Pakistan. Daily Express, an Urdu newspaper, expressed its opinion in an editorial in June that the Pakistani army should come down hard on any one who is playing into the hands of foreign powers.              
	However, Pakistan blaming India for its problems in Swat and in the other Taliban-infested regions has served a useful purpose. It has led to the broadening of anti-Taliban operations undertaken by the army. The idea that fighting the Taliban amounts to fighting India has created an anti-Taliban and pro-army image among the people. Anti-Taliban sentiments have also played a critical role in rallying the nationalist army to support and execute a wide range of operations to crush the insurgents. Hence, full-scale operations by the Pakistan army against the Taliban implies that the army will not be able to open similar fronts in Baluchistan.         
	But it has to be borne in mind that not all Islamists pose a problem for Pakistan: only those who are being commandeered, funded and guided by hostile neighbours are a threat. Hence, while the Pakistani Taliban and their Indian handlers need to be crushed, the Afghan Taliban deserve to be nurtured. Under the circumstances, how can Holbrooke expect that his demands will be met by the Pakistan establishment?         
	Little wonder then that Afghan Taliban fighters cross the Durand Line with ease and manage to find safe haven deep inside Pakistani territory. Holbrooke is trying to nudge the Pakistani leaders to act against the Afghan Taliban and the Baluchistan-based terrorists by deploying more troops. But most Pakistani leaders believe that the Pakistani Taliban fighters, sponsored by the US and India, are enemies while the Afghan Taliban are their friends. Thus, Holbrookes worries are far from over. Difficult days lie ahead for diplomats dealing with Pakistan.

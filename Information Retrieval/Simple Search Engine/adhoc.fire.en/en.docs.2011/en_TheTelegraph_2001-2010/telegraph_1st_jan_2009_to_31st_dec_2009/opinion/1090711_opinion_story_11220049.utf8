The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A tenuous connection
                                                                                                                 A TENUOUS CONNECTION                                  The world has not seen a single cricketer of international repute emerge from either Oxford or Cambridge in recent times. This signifies the end of a great tradition, writes Raju Mukherji                          Another era                                  
	Why are the British universities not producing top-class cricketers these days? Where are all those cricketing buds that bloomed so often at Fenners and Parks? The Oxbridge connection with cricket has always been as important and as prolific as any county club in England.        
	The cricket traditions of Oxford and Cambridge have been long and distinguished. No other centre of education has come anywhere near these alma maters in its contribution to the world of cricket. Actually, it is highly doubtful if any cricket academy would be able to match the significant contributions that Oxford and Cambridge have made in the course of the last hundred years.        
	But then what are the reasons for the sudden dip in the supply of promising cricketers at Oxbridge? It is generally said that today these universities are no longer keen on the arrival of students who show prowess at sports. If this is indeed true, then it is most unfortunate. These universities have served as platforms from which great cricketers have emerged. These cricketers went on to become extremely famous and attained success in many other arenas of life. Some of the names that readily come to mind are those of Charles Studd, Charles Fry, Ranjitsinhji, Mike Brearley and Imran Khan.        
	Golden past        
	There was a time when the best of English cricketing brains came from the corridors of these hallowed institutions. Charles Fry, Douglas Jardine, Peter May, Colin Cowdrey, Ted Dexter, Mike Smith, Mike Brearley and Tony Lewis were products of Oxford and Cambridge.        
	All of these talented cricketers went on to lead England with varying degrees of success. They had the mien of born leaders, and led their men with panache. During the reign of these leaders, England, at various periods, dominated the course of international cricket.        
	Sadly, today, those classy university cricketers are no longer in existence. The university teams hardly have cricketers who can be considered worthy of playing first-class cricket or Test matches.         
	A few years ago, this writer had the opportunity to survey the cricket scenario at these universities. It was indeed a bewildering experience. None of the students appeared to be enthusiastic enough. There was no commitment, pride or ambition on display on the part of the players. It appeared as if most of them had decided to go through the motions. The general standard of the game was pedestrian in terms of skill and attitude. A sense of apathy seemed to have gripped them. Why it is so is anybodys guess.        
	There was a time when Oxford and Cambridge were the breeding grounds of cricket players for all nations. These players often went on to attain the top-most rung in world cricket. They used the grand opportunities available to reach the pinnacle of their ambition. The Indian tradition began with Ranjitsinhji at Cambridge. He was followed by his nephew Duleepsinhji and by Iftikhar Ali Khan , the senior Nawab of Pataudi. All three of them represented England in Tests, and all three players scored centuries in their first Test match against the Australians.        
	Some of the other university players who came into limelight were Jahangir Khan, Dilawar Hussain, Abbas Ali Baig and Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi. Pakistan had Abdul Hafeez Kardar, Javed Burki, Majid Khan and Imran Khan from Oxbridge. Although Majid Khan was already a Test player by the time he went to Cambridge, his maternal cousins, Burki and Imran, benefited tremendously by their association with Oxford.         
	Great loss        
	New Zealand had the brilliant batsman, Martin Donnelly, Sri Lanka had Gamini Goonesena, who was an all-rounder, while Gerry Alexander, the West Indiess last white Test captain, was a veterinary surgeon at Cambridge. The great contribution of Oxbridge to world cricket would always be written in letters of gold in the annals of cricket.        
	English cricket has suffered in recent times because of the non-availability of players from Oxford and Cambridge. It may be sheer coincidence but whenever England has been on top of world cricket, the captain invariably happened to be a product of Oxbridge. Jardine, May and Brearley are revered all over the world because of their leadership qualities as well as their rare command over cricket strategy. They were at the helm when England dominated the world in cricket.        
	Of late, we have not had a single player of international eminence from either Oxford or Cambridge. A great tradition has probably come to an unfortunate end. The university-bred cricketers gave the noble game a different perspective. They also brought rare values and a distinctive flavour to the game of cricket. Cricket, thus, has lost a very significant heritage. The loss is not only crickets, but Cambridges and Oxfords as well.

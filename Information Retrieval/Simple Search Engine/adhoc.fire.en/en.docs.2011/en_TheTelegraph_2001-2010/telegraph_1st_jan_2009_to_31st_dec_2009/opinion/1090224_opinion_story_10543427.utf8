The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | On a hot and dusty morning
                                                                                                                 ON A HOT AND DUSTY MORNING                                  SCHOOL TIME      An unlikely place for learning the alphabet                                                  
	It is easy to guess that the general elections are round the corner from the zeal with which the roads of Calcutta and its outskirts are being dug up, apparently to repair them. I made my way to an anganwadi school in the southern fringes of Calcutta amidst a swirling storm of dust kicked up by the PWD workers. Thanks to the thick screen of dust, I could barely see where I was going and was almost startled by the school suddenly appearing in front of me. My amazement was also due to the fact that what passed off as the school was actually a single room owned by the local club. Jutting out over a pond, the tiny schoolroom had Nobodoy Sangha written in lurid colours over the entrance.         
	The setting inside hardly suggested a pre-school. The paraphernalia of the club  from a broken television set to a huge carom board  had been pushed to the corners to clear the floor for about 25 children and their two teachers. Everything inside the room was grimy. On the walls hung photographs of garlanded men on their last journey, who were possibly public figures in their lifetime. Only the flow charts hanging askew from the windows gave any inkling of the fact that this was a nursery for toddlers.         
	The teacher-in-charge, Sabita Manna (name changed), informed me that anganwadi schools do not follow a specific curriculum. The teachers just try to acquaint the children with the alphabet, basic mathematics, rules of hygiene and so on through informal methods like rhyming or singing. Children from three to five years of age study in anganwadi centres, from where they graduate to primary school. Each anganwadi school has a teacher and an assistant teacher, and they look after the children, cook the midday meals and feed the wards. They also devote one hour after school every day to the expecting mothers in the locality, giving them counsel regarding pre-natal care or sending them to health centres for regular check-ups.         
	Manna lamented the lack of a proper schoolroom for the children. She said that the local panchayat has been promising one for a long time but it has not materialized as yet. She found it difficult to make the children play within the few feet of space inside the room. It is even harder to make all 25 of them sit in a line and eat, Manna said.        
	In the anganwadi school I visited, there were more girls than boys. All of them recited rhymes at the top of their voices and danced obediently to their teachers tunes while glancing furtively outside the room to ascertain whether their meal was ready. Manna agreed that the meal is one of the main reasons why the children attend school. But, she said, the parents also seriously want their children to study. If a child misses school, it is the teachers duty to visit his family and persuade the student to return to class.        
	Before Manna started laying the plates for the humble meal of khichdi, she finished off the days lessons by telling the children a story. It was about a jackal and a tiger. She wore a hand-painted mask of a tiger while speaking in its voice. But the unadorned face of the teacher had to do for that of the jackal, because, Manna told me apologetically, the jackals mask has not yet arrived. The children did not seem to mind exercising their imagination on this count. They listened with rapt attention and broke out in excited giggles occasionally. Evidently, the dust in their schoolroom and outside has not settled on their minds.

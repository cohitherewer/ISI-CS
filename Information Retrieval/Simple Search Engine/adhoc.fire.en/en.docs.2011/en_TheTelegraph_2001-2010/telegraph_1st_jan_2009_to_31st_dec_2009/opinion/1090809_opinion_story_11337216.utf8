The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | dope for players
                                                                                                                 DOPE FOR PLAYERS                                                          
	Success is the opium of Indian cricketers. Treated as icons by their fans, they begin to perceive themselves as such. This, naturally, changes their view of life and things. There is no other explanation for the Indian cricketers objecting to the proposals of the World Anti-Doping Agency. The proposal is simple enough. The Wada wants all sportspersons to submit a schedule for three months that designates an hour in a day when they can be tested for drugs on a random basis. The objections of the Indian cricketers are at two levels. There is the general objection, which says that cricketers in India are playing for three quarters of the year and they do not want the dope tests to intrude upon their leisure time. The second is more particular since it concerns high profile players like Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Sachin Tendulkar who have security worries. Their contention is that there is always a chance of their security being breached if their schedules are advertised and fixed. This second objection is dealt with very easily. There is no reason to advertise their schedules. The Wada can be asked to keep the schedules under wraps. This would also suit the Wadas interests since it wants to have random checks. It is also difficult to understand the first objection since a quick test can hardly be construed as a major invasion of privacy.        
	There are grounds to suspect that Indian cricketers see themselves as superior to and different from not only other sportspersons but also other cricketers. It is significant that all other cricket teams, whatever may be their reservations, have agreed to abide by the Wada proposals. At the behest of the Indian cricketers, the Board of Control for Cricket in India has asked the International Cricket Council to turn down the Wada regime, and to prepare a schedule that will suit the cricketers. This special treatment is difficult to comprehend. It is worth recalling that cricketers, may be not Indian players, have not been entirely innocent of doping.        
	There could be a case that different conditions of testing are needed for individual athletes and players of team sports. (In this context, it is worth noting that Uefa and Fifa have both turned down the new code of the Wada.) But it should be borne in mind that in team sports, players are individually responsible for their health, fitness and performance. Individual players are also supposed to have their own code of ethics. The Pakistani fast bowler, Shoaib Akhtar, who tested positive, did not take the performance enhancing drug for the sake of his team but to boost his own performance. Cricketers in India, because of their immense popularity, are seen as role models. On a matter as important as doping, they should not stand on ceremony but should, in fact, come forward and be examples to young men and women who want to emulate them.

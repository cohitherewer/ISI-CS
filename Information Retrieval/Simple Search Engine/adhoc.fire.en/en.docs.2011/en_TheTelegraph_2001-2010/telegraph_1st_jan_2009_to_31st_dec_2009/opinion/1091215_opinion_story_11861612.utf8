                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      BY THE THROAT                                                            
	Languages are persons. Or at least, they have personalities, even characters, that may be pleasing, rough, transparent, tricky, furtive, sunny, bleak, manipulative, pliant, bawdy, deep, frivolous  you name it, and there they are, sometimes with these characteristics combined intricately enough to drive the user mad. Which brings us to the most puzzling question of all: do we use language or do languages use us? I may suffer from the delusion that I am using language, but am perpetually haunted by the feeling of being stalked and driven by an infinitely superior entity, unsurpassed in exercising its invisible control over millions of similarly deluded souls throughout history. Surely I am not the same person when I speak or write English as when I do Bengali? Or when I shamelessly use both together? It is necessary to keep a sharp watch on oneself to pounce upon the change, but then, one cannot even yell Got you! without language. Its language that has got us by the throat.        
	In my more optimistic moments I am willing to concede that, at best, it is a ceaseless tussle between speaker and spoken, between the user and the used, with each seizing control at different times. I have come to some understanding of the agonies of the tussle through hard experience. In school and in life, I have always failed in Hindi. This is a shameful lack; everyone knows and speaks it around me; it is, the Constitution says, the official language, and failing in it miserably, year after year, is not something to be bruited abroad.        
	But I did try. I can read it too; Devanagari holds no terrors for me. But except for hai and, perhaps, a few words like ladka or ladki, the language is an insoluble mystery to me. They tell me that watching Hindi films is a great way to pick up the language, everyone knows Hindi because of Bollywood. I have done so, faithfully, and the language has remained as aloof as ever. Hindi songs I love have not helped. I have learnt up the meanings of words, I have tried to read paragraphs of stories  and have ended up by being put in my place, puny and powerless.        
	Perhaps it is genetic. I had one terrifying glimpse of my fathers knowledge of Hindi when he was living in Delhi for a while, and he asked someone who had rung up to hold the line. He said, Dhariye. My mother was less canny about concealing her lack of the language, and would freely rain instructions on her employees in a strangely accented Bengali with a -ko here and there and an invariable hai at the end of every non-sentence.        
	Their legacy has seriously handicapped me in a very different world. Official callers on the phone often insist on talking in Hindi, making my shamefaced English seem disgracefully out of tune with a resurgent India, and giving me no chance to display the frantic goodwill and desperate apology on my face. Worse, I dont get it. I dont follow a word once the conversation crosses the mark of three words. Hindi trounces me every time, apart from the fact that there is a deafening buzz in my ears when I find myself trapped in it. If a language refuses you, there is nothing you can do about it.         
	Pity Ill never know who I would have been in Hindi.       BHASWATI CHAKRAVORTY

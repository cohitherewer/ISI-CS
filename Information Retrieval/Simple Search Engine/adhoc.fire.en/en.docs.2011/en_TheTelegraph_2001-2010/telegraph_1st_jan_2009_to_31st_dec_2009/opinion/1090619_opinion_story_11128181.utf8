	Poets, physicians, fanatics                
	A Life of Change: The Autobiography of a Doctor (Penguin, Rs 299) by Noshir H. Antia is an account of a richly lived life. Born in 1922 in Hubli, Antia spent the first few years of his career working in the Indian army, then went on to serve in a number of British hospitals during the peak of the Second World War. In Britain, he came under the influence of the renowned Harold Gillies, hailed as the father of modern plastic surgery. Guided by his mentor, Antia not only managed to carve a name for himself in this difficult area of specialization, but also set up the Tata Department of Plastic Surgery in Bombay once he returned home. This is a chronicle of the many challenges  from working with leprosy patients to running the burns unit of the J.J. Hospital in Mumbai  Antia faced as a physician. Apart from being a medical adventurer, Antia was also a social visionary, who set up organizations like the Foundation for Research in Community Health and the Foundation for Medical Research.                         
	Faking It (Hachette, Rs 250) by Amrita Chowdhury is a brave attempt at a first novel involving a US returned financial expert bored with her pearls-and-chiffon life in Mumbai, the love of contemporary Indian art, and the devastating consequences of buying an Amrita Sher-Gil. Tara Malhotra, displaced from her plush job as a financial expert in the US, is the whining, embittered wife of Raj, who moves to Mumbai with a new job. Taras tone is confidential, even entertaining, though her prose sounds a bit overwrought sometimes. Expressions like a sigh pirouetted into existence like an applause-hungry diva interrupt the conversational mode. The next time Chowdhury takes up the pen, she ought to get a ruthless editor to harness her talent.        
	Tantra Demystified (Orient, Rs 295) by Vikas Malkani comes with the eye-catching subtitle, Tantric Secrets and Techniques for Sexual and Spiritual Bliss. This book is the ideal balm to the recession-hit soul. The author promises his readers a sex-citing journey, and the book lives up to the corniness of this offer. With Osho as his presiding genius, Malkani holds forth on the spiritual pleasures of lovemaking. There is a Sexual Beliefs Questionnaire at the end, which is not to be recommended to the faint-hearted.                        
	Puntanam and Melpattur: Two measures of Bhakti (Penguin, Rs 150) collects two gems of medieval Indian literature. While Jnana-paana by Puntanam is possibly the first original poem in Malayalam, Melpatturs Narayaniyam is referred to as the last great hurrah of classical Sanskrit in India. The former was composed probably after the death of the poets beloved first son, and resonates with the lyricism of the Bhakti tradition. The latter, based on a vision of the Lord, is rendered in a more majestic style. Vijay Nambisan has done a laudable job not only as a translator but also as an editor. Apart from his detailed introduction, Nambisan includes another short verse by Mahakavi Vallathol, who related the meeting between Melpattur and Puntanam in which the exalted Sanskritist scoffed at the humble vernacular poet.                                  
	Rethinking Hindu Identity (Equinox, 14.99) by D.N. Jha is part of the Religion in Culture series which focuses on Studies in Social Contest and Construction. This is compulsory reading for the right-wing fanatics who make a career out of distorting the premises of Hinduism. Jhas analysis is historically sound and puts the tenets of Hinduism in perspective, though his prose is a trifle heavy-going. Jha challenges the notions of sacredness and stereotypes (the holy cow, for instance) that have become entrenched in the religion.

                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	A pitch too far                  
	Sir  It is surprising that Lalit Modi and the Board of Control for Cricket in India are holding the government responsible for the decision to take the Indian Premier League out of the country. Providing security during the elections is of paramount importance to the government and this is what the board was told. The organizers should have postponed the tournament till the elections were over. Their attitude shows that they are narrow-minded people whose business motives are stronger than their concern for the country. We should not forget that the IPL franchisees are celebrities who are in it to earn money and not to cater to the peoples wishes. Indians should take a firm stand and boycott films and events featuring these celebrities.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Debasish Mukherjee, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Given its name, Indian Premier League matches should be played in India, not elsewhere, as reported in Out (of India) (March 23). Although many foreign players participate in this cricketing extravaganza, regional sentiments attached to the IPL are strong. The people of this country look forward to seeing their heroes play on their homeground. Viewing matches on television is not the same thing. This years IPL is definitely going to lose its glitter.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Subhayu Saha, Khagra, Murshidabad 

                
	Sir  Whoever engineered the brutal attack on the Sri Lankan cricketers must now be full of glee. That action is producing incalculably far-reaching results. Thanks to the inept handling of the situation by all parties responsible for holding the IPL, South Africa will now have the honour of hosting it. One wonders why a programme acceptable to all could not be worked out so that ego clashes could be averted. This last, and not security, is the reason for the IPLs ignominious exit from India. People do not believe that India is as unsafe as the authorities make it out to be, and that, too, before the international community.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Banaded Banerjee, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  From day one of the announcement of the IPL schedule, the Union home minister has played hide-and-seek with the IPL organizers. At his behest, the schedule was changed three times. First, he expressed concern about the security arrangement, and then, when matters heated up, he passed the buck to the state governments.           
	Once shifted out of India, the tournament can hardly be called the Indian Premier League. Can one think of the Wimbledon being shifted out of London to Rio de Janeiro or the US Open from the Flushing Meadows to somewhere in Namibia? The bottomline is that the Indian political league has gained precedence over the Indian Premier League. The Rajasthan chief minister wanted to take revenge on the IPL chairman, Lalit Modi, for his proximity to the earlier Bharatiya Janata Party government in the state. The Congress is out to discredit the BCCI big boss, Sharad Pawar, for his prime ministerial ambitions. The BCCI has accused the Congress state governments of Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh for sabotaging the IPL.           
	While BJP-ruled states are now willing to stage the IPL in India, the Congress-ruled ones are unwilling. The real loser is Indian cricket, its fans, and Indian industry. The hospitality and aviation sectors would have received a much-needed boost had the IPL happened in India. Who would have thought that the blockbuster IPL could end in a flop show?                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Tapan Dasgupta, Dasghara, Burdwan

                
	Sir  The shifting of the IPL venue is a big blow to Indias middle class. The IPL is not a cricket tournament alone, it is also entertainment. For the game and for cricketers, the presence of local supporters was a big boost. Foreigners are unlikely to provide this impetus to players. The experience of having the Indian crowd to cheer a game on Indian soil is something quite different and cannot be replicated abroad.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Ahana Sen Gupta, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  To ensure the smooth and peaceful parliamentary elections, it was necessary to shift the IPL out of India. The police, hopefully, will be able to concentrate better, and in greater numbers, on the maintenance of law and order during the polls. But it should be obvious that hosting the IPL had become a matter of prestige for the Nationalist Congress Party chief, Sharad Pawar, whose political fortunes became linked to the success of the IPL tournament. The Congress, sensing Pawars political ambitions, has punctured his dreams. Even before the elections have begun, Pawar has been caught by P. Chidambaram and bowled by Sonia Gandhi for zero.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Ganesh K. Sovani, Thane 

                
	Sir  The BCCI and the IPL organizers are too arrogant to care about the security threat. By taking the matches abroad they are making a laughing-stock of India and its security. The BCCI and the IPL should be heavily taxed and the money spent on promoting other sports in India.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Radheshyam Sharma, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  The hype over the IPL is unjustified. Had the tournament taken place in India, people would have questioned the wisdom of deploying security forces for players, team personnel or spectators during election time. Given what happened to the Sri Lankan cricket team in Lahore, India could not have taken the risk of holding the matches now. The very media houses which are now going into overdrive in their offensive against the government would have blamed it for the decision. The same is true of opportunists like Narendra Modi and Arun Jaitley.           
	Yours faithfully,       
A.K. Biswas, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Persons who are prepared to sell their country short for an all-expenses-paid foreign junket are worse than the so-called terrorists we deride.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Ashok Mantri, London

	An off-the-record question that is often asked to insiders in the publishing world is whether it is possible for an unknown author to be published purely on grounds of merit and without having to pay for publication  an increasingly common practice these days. To put it another way, is being well-known an essential qualification for publication? From this comes the bigger question of whether books by famous people sell and make money for publishers. Or is it only a passing trend that doesnt do any good to anyone?        
	Face the basic facts. If identity politics plays a big role in politics it does so also in other facets of life. A publisher, or a reader, wants to know who you are and whom you are writing for, if only to assess the market potential of a forthcoming book. It becomes difficult for a publisher to figure out the newcomer who hasnt been seen on TV or read in the print media. Of course, the merit of a work  the language, style and relevance of the book and its timing  does matter, but the public image of the author goes a long way in accepting a work for publication. There have been unknown first-time authors who have made it big. But in the last decade or so, most authors have been big shots who would not have been published otherwise. This is particularly true of ex-politicians and bureaucrats who wrote too much to say too little.        
	Because of the pressure to produce more and more, many books that ought never have been published are accepted. The safest bet for a publisher is to go for big names because they hold out the promise of a minimum off-take that would at least recover costs and hopefully make some profit. But when the final sums have been done at the end of the year, books by the big and famous have bombed despite the splash in the media. There are three reasons for this failure.        
	First, books by famous personalities are extremely difficult to edit because the authors simply dont accept any changes in the text, not just in language and style, but also in simple facts that are wrong. Not being professional writers, they tend to write too much. Good writing does not consist of what you need to put in, but what you can no longer take out. Its an ego problem that sensitive editors wrestle with, but they eventually give in because it takes too much to make authors accept the editorial changes. The result: big books that could have been twice as good at half their size.        
	Second, many big time authors now employ professional writers (mostly former journalists) to write their copy. This is all right, but many books become as-told-to versions where the author tells his story to the scribe who spins it out in his own way. The story lacks authenticity, and any critical reader can recognize it as second-hand stuff.        
	Third, big names dont have as much clout as is often imagined. They hold the stage for only sometime, and then, are heard no more. The Indian reader will put his money on stuff that holds good for sometime, not on something that is only of passing interest.        
	Then why do publishers accept such books? Because they have their production quotas to fulfill, and it is always helpful to have some big shots on your side. But in terms of accounting, many of these books dont make money.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Fraud instead of Freud
                                                                                                                 FRAUD INSTEAD OF FREUD                              THEATRE      Ananda Lal                                                
	To supply the perennial demand for new scripts in Bengali theatre, many playwrights are increasingly turning to fiction for material. Nandipats Apad comes from a well-known short story by Bimal Kar, titled Satyadas, which could feature more prominently in the credits because the dramatist, Rajat Ghosh, has stuck quite scrupulously to his source. It concerns the fortunes (almost literally) of the humble Raghunath, who owns a ramshackle shop on the edge of his village, so he gets few customers. The fact that he gets little business, however, does not make him bitter or resentful. (The only regret he and his wife voice is their childlessness.) On the contrary, he remains cheerful and hospitable to all, including a wandering fakir who shows up on a stormy night and requests for some food and shelter. Raghunath goes out of his way to make him comfortable.        
	The stranger, who introduces himself (significantly) as Satyadas from Dharmapur, of course fits the archetypal Indian icon of the unknown guest as God whom we are duty-bound to care for. When he departs at dawn, Raghunath notices he has left a pouch behind. After much soul-searching, he opens it to find six mohurs and two rings with precious stones. He agonizes over what to do and how to return them, while his wife encourages him to put the wealth to their own good use. Obviously, this is the classic cross-cultural allegory of a divine test of character.        
	I must not proceed further into the tale since its beauty lies in what happens. Suffice it to say that Raghunath does renovate his shop (picture) a year later, but then Satyadas comes back. Ghosh differs from Kar in not making Raghunaths ultimate guilt so crushing. Apad may even have improved on Satyadas by throwing multiple possibilities in Raghunaths path, most of which would have led to extreme moralistic or melodramatic resolutions that we can anticipate, but eventually an inspiring conclusion cleans the murk in our minds.        
	One of our best actors, Bimal Chakraborty, portrays Raghunath with his customary naturalistic perfectionism, to the extent that we cannot recognize him in the role until several minutes into the play. He expresses a full range of emotions in the course of two hours, the only blemish being that unable as director to see himself he overacts the anxieties about how to tackle his dilemma towards the end of the first half. Sarbani Bhattacharya (his wife) and Biplab Naha Biswas (Satyadas) handle their less complex supporting parts ably. Sandip Suman Bhattacharya pays meticulous attention to detail in the sets, especially of the shop.        
	Purba Paschims latest venture is Manik Bandyopadhyays Diba Ratrir Kabya, dramatized and directed by Arun Mukherjee. Here, we have a problem on our hands. This early novel is certainly not in the same league as its immediate successors, Padma Nadir Majhi and Putul Nacher Itikatha, both of which can be viewed in stage versions currently, so it suffers in comparison. This impression is doubled by the fact that Mukherjee himself directed the excellent rendering of Putul Nacher Itikatha; but he cannot repeat that magic in Diba Ratrir Kabya, nor is it suitable for theatre anyway.        
	The antihero, Heramba, must be one of the most spineless male protagonists in Bengali literature, never committing himself to any relationship fully, precipitating the breakdown of each one: a youthful affair, a marriage that ended with his wifes suicide, and love of a young girl who kills herself when she senses that he has fallen out of love with her (his brilliant motto being, love never lasts). Since nothing attracts Heramba to us, I cannot imagine this kind of thing working theatrically, even if we accept him as a symbol of fickle masculinity.        
	The only possible redemption was to give him an intensely psychoanalytical characterization, but that is evidently outside the scope of Pijush Gangopadhyay, who merely drifts in and out of scenes looking perplexed in two-thirds profile, except for a short episode in which he gets violently drunk. Thus, Mukherjee completely deflates Bandyopadhyays reputation as the most unsentimental Bengali novelist; instead of Freud, he gives us a fraud. The actresses fare better  Rwita Dutta Chakraborty as Supriya, who still carries a torch for Heramba (why, we wonder) and, to a lesser degree, Mishka Halim (his present lover, Ananda) and Suranjana Dasgupta (her mother). Is Bengali theatre so strapped for talent that Mukherjee must split Ananda between two performers, an actress and a dancer?

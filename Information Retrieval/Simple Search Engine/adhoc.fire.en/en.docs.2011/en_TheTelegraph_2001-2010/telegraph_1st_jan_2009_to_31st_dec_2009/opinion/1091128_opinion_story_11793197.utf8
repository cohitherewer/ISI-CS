	A very contemporary sensibility permeated Ashavari Majumdar and her troupes Kathak performance, Im_Pulse, at the Rabindranath Tagore Centre on November 19. Even as the todas, parans and chakkardars displayed Majumdars technical competence and comprehensive training under gurus such as Birju Maharaj, one got to experience a delightfully creative exploration of the form. There was freedom from classical strictures in the costume, stage decor and expression. The accompaniment, surfeit with global influences, drew inspiration from the rhythm of heartbeat among other things, and had an edgy randomness about it. For many classical dancers today, experimentation is de rigueur, if only to be fted as innovative. Not all experiments, however, are successful. To Majumdars credit, she was able to include her audience in her quest for rhythm. Her pursuit allowed her to explore facets of pure dance. From delicately executed pirouettes to sharp footwork and elaborate bols, everything was imaginatively woven into the framework of Im_Pulse, making it immensely enjoyable.

	Down memory lane        
	It is impossible to absorb much of Chitpore by casually strolling down what is known as Rabindra Sarani today or even consciously lose ones bearing in its meandering alleys. Apart from closely studying the street, one has to discover for oneself the accretions of time and the coexistence of people of various clans and communities. Recently, some German students had photographed this area, but those large prints turned out to be frigid academic exercises. However, Saibal Dass Tales of Chitpore (Nov 7-24), at Seagull Arts amp; Media Resource Centre, shows intimate knowledge not only of the physical realities of this ancient thoroughfare but also of its elusive spirit. There is no denying that Chitpores shabbiness is highly photogenic, and Das makes good use of it, consciously avoiding clichs. So while the impossibly-ornamented Putul Bari is there, it looks as if rising out of filth. Graffiti enhances the mystery of dark streets. Dass images of religiosity are emotionally charged but he distances himself from the scene. The rows of babies lying in cots on the sprawling verandah of a mansion-turned-hospital is shot from above, giving a dramatic turn to an everyday scene. All his images are not successful and some could have been dropped. Thereby, Dass vision would have been more focused.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Happy Days for Veterans
                                                                                                                 HAPPY DAYS FOR VETERANS                                  Fifth Column -Sumanta Sen                              
	The chief minister of Bihar, Nitish Kumar, was present at the Patna airport to receive George Fernandes. He escorted his onetime guru to the office of the state Election Commission, where Fernandes filed his nomination for the Rajya Sabha election. Reports in the newspapers spoke of the ailing Fernandes thanking the same man against whom he had railed just the other day for having denied him a ticket for the Lok Sabha from Muzaffarpur. Nevertheless, he had contested as an independent only to suffer an ignominious defeat. Now, it is happy days once more for the veteran socialist.        
	Nitish Kumar may have had his own reasons for selecting Fernandes. Some say that he did it to keep at bay other Janata Dal (United) leaders whom he did not quite trust. That is a matter of speculation. What is more pertinent is that when he had refused to allow Fernandes contest the Lok Sabha polls, he had cited health reasons. Now Fernandes will be a member of the Upper House. Is it to be believed that in the short intervening period, Fernandes has recovered his health and is fit to attend to parliamentary duties now? While denying the veteran a ticket, Nitish Kumar had suggested that the former could be sent to the Rajya Sabha at a later date. So what it all boils down to is that in the chief ministers perception, a person may be too ill to be considered for the Lok Sabha, but not so for the Rajya Sabha. Is the Upper House then a dumping ground for the aged and the infirm?         
	That, most certainly, is not what the Constitution makers had in mind. But in the last sixty odd years, the Rajya Sabha has, to a fair measure, been used by political parties to accommodate people who have to be provided, for one reason or the other, with parliamentary refuge. It is not strange therefore that for most, it has ceased to enjoy the importance it should have had. Even though there have been prime ministers, including the present one, and senior ministers from the Rajya Sabha, they have always itched for a Lok Sabha seat. Indira Gandhi got herself directly elected at the first opportunity, and Pranab Mukherjee, a long time Rajya Sabha member, was obviously pleased when he won the Lok Sabha election in 2004.                 
	Under pressure        
	The importance of the Rajya Sabha has been undermined by political parties for logistical reasons too. When parties need members in other states to work at the Central office, they try to get them into the Rajya Sabha so that the problem of housing is taken care of. Whether that person will be able to effectively highlight issues concerning the state is seldom, if ever, of any concern.        
	There are also other ways in which this process of undermining is consciously helped. Take the case of Fernandes, for instance. The people of Muzaffarpur did not want to see him as their representative in Parliament. But now he will be, technically at least, a representative for the whole of Bihar. Certainly not fair, but that is what is happening all over the country. Such re-entries into the Parliament are certainly legal, but are they moral?        
	But why raise issues of legitimacy or morality in a situation where the political parties went into a tizzy over the rule that a Rajya Sabha member must be a resident of the state which he represents. That rule has now been done away with, and so, anybody can get elected from any state where his or her party has the required strength in the assembly to ensure victory. This also had been the system initially and one of the arguments in its favour is that it does away with compartmentalism, which the amendment was thought to have introduced. One, however, suspects that the old system was brought back not in the interests of integration but under pressure. The cause of self-interest was made to triumph.

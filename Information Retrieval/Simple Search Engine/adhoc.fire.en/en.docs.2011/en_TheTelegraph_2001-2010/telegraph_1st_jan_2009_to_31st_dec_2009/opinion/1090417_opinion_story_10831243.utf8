The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | The die is cast
                                                                                                                 THE DIE IS CAST                                  MALVIKA SINGH                              
	This election process is on, and India will put in place a government at the Centre that will have a democratic mandate to rule. Unlike past experience, this time voters seem silent and determined, having witnessed unpleasant verbal assaults that opposing candidates have hurled at one another as well as the blatant opportunism of smaller parties desperate to make a bid for Delhi and the spoils there. Will India reject those who have merely indulged in stale political rhetoric and look towards an experiment that could change the future and open up opportunities? Scanning through the manifesto of the Samajwadi Party one wonders what madness overtook them to spell out an agenda that moves back in time. Is it because real change on the ground that comes with inclusive governance and social action could dramatically dilute their vote share and make them increasingly pass?        
	It is interesting that in this election season, the stock market has been rising steadily, sending out a signal that endorses Manmohan Singh and the economic agenda he stands for. The fear of regressive policies during the downturn is something that people are wary of, disturbed by the possible negative effect it could have on India and on their lives. The popularity of Manmohan Singh for prime minister could stem from this historical truth as well as from the fact that among the rest, he and Sonia Gandhi spell dignity and a firm, resolute will. This seems to be a new ingredient in the complicated khichdi. The topping could well be a surprise. A majority of Indians, regardless of caste, class and community, find the present-day political jargon and antics unsavoury and increasingly unpalatable. Will they dump the khichdi?        
	Writing on the wall        
	High-pitched voices, verging on the hysterical, usually come from a deep-seated insecurity. Confidence is calm, considered and collected. Narendra Modi, accusing Sonia Gandhi of eating the namak of India, goes down as a strong negative, a real time No No. She came as a bahu, stayed in her sasural and never returned to her maica. India respects this because it is intrinsic to Indian culture and tradition. Modi is seen speaking out of turn and against the tradition of this civilization. L.K. Advanis hurt has backfired and clearly put Manmohan Singh ahead as a national leader. Sushma Swaraj seems to have disappeared from her upfront position. Is there some kind of split in the ranks of the Bharatiya Janata Party? These are the kinds of shifts we want to understand through the media but unfortunately, the anchors are as high-pitched and superficial as most of the political personas in the fray.         
	Mayavati has been relentlessly criss-crossing the country, making her national presence felt. She has tried to absorb all the castes into her party, having got the Dalit vote- bank under her belt, and now hopes to build the Bahujan Samaj Party into a strong national party. The premise of the Congress had been the same. It represented India in all its diversity. Internal factionalism, centralization of decision making, with general secretaries calling the shots from the diwan-e-khas rather than from the diwan-e-aam, disconnected from ground realities but believing they know it all, reduced the party to becoming an ally of regional parties hungry for power at the Centre. A generation of party workers fell into this comfortable trap and brought the tally down to figures unimaginable some decades ago. The battle to wrest that plural space in the near future will be a fight between the Congress and the BSP.        
	In the coming years, India will watch the last act of this particular political play that belongs to the theatre of the absurd. Next time, India and Bharat will compel the change, and with deliberation. Times have changed and those in power are stuck in a tangled mess, unwilling to see the writing on the wall. Elections 2009 will foreshadow the future.

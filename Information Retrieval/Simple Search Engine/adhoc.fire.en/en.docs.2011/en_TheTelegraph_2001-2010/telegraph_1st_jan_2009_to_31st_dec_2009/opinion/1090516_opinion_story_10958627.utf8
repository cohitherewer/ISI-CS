	Similar performance                  
	Sir  One had hoped that Ashok Chavan would be different as a chief minister from Vilasrao Deshmukh. Deshmukhs years in office were spent for personal gain. Maharashtra had been pushed out of the race for industrialization, thanks to Deshmukhs incompetence. Hopes were rekindled that things will change when Chavan took over. However, Maharashtra continues to reel under power shortage, farmers there continue to hang themselves, and crime is on the rise. Sonia Gandhi needs to explain why Chavan has been imposed on the people of Maharashtra.          
	Yours faithfully,        Nayan Patel, Mumbai 
                  
	Bold admission          
	Sir  Although it may be known to many, the fact that the Taliban are a creation of the Inter-Services Intelligence and the Central Intelligence Agency, as alleged by the Pakistan president, is still shocking news (CIA monster, May 12). It was earlier alleged that Osama bin Laden is also a creation of the CIA. What is this role that the United States of America is playing on the world stage? If Asif Ali Zardaris allegation is untrue, it should be countered by the US. If not, the CIA should be tried.           
	Zardari has rightly acknowledged that India is not a threat to Pakistan. His boldness must be appreciated by one and all. But reports from Pakistan indicate that the people of the country do not see India as a friendly nation. Thus Zardari has to see that the right atmosphere is created in Pakistan, one that enables a correction of the perception concerning India. After all, people of the two countries share the same roots. It is in Pakistans interest to maintain cordial relations with India.           
	Yours faithfully,       
M. Kumar, New Delhi 

      
	Sir  At the end of Barack Obamas first 100 days as the president of the US, the strategies adopted by him do not seem to be making any difference in Afghanistan, Pakistan and India. If Obama continues to believe that US troops can leave Afghanistan without clearing the dangerous mess left by the Taliban in Pakistan, then he is in for trouble. His administrations Afpak policy has been utterly skewed, since the US has pledged billions of dollars in aid to help Pakistan combat terror.           
	This is nothing but the repetition of the error committed by George W. Bush, who had similarly doled out huge sums to Islamabad in the hope that it would crack down on the insurgents. However, Pakistan has continued to play a tricky game by using the money to arm itself against India. The Obama administration is wrong in believing that Islamabad can meet the challenge from extremists if only India eased pressure on the northern border. Pakistan only wants American money. So it continues with its pretence of fighting terror.           
	Although Obama has realized that the situation in Pakistan is going from bad to worse, he still believes that Afghanistan should underpin his Afpak policy. But, to be realistic, it is Pakistan that should form the basis of the US foreign policy since it has become the epicentre of all the troubles in Kabul and New Delhi.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Party above people          
	Sir  In a democracy, people are supposed to vote for a party and not for the individual nominated by the party. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) chose not to nominate Prakash Karat as a contestant in this election. So the editorial, Face the people, (May 13) rightly asked Karat to face the people to secure their mandate. He has already secured the mandate of his comrades to lead the party. That he wields more power in the party than the elected Lok Sabha candidates is the CPI(M)s problem.                    
	Yours faithfully,

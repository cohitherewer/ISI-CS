The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | The don who loved to talk   For the specialist
                                                                                                               IN BRIEF
                            
	THE DON WHO LOVED TO TALK          
	Isaiah Berlin: Enlightening: Letters 1946-1960 Edited by Henry Hardy and Jennifer Holmes, Chatto amp; Windus, 24.99  
	For some people, a technological innovation can become a curse. When Isaiah Berlin, the legendary Oxford don, was given a dictaphone, he was, in a manner of speaking, doomed. For Berlin loved to talk. He seldom wrote after he had got the machine. He spoke into the machine and his devoted secretaries transcribed what he said. Most of the dictating was done late at night. This explains how he managed to write so many letters. One volume of his letters has already appeared. This is the second volume, and the letters cover some very important aspects of Berlins life: his fellowship in New College, his return to All Souls as professor, his trips to American universities, and his participation in the cause of Zionism and Israel. His correspondents were varied  from Winston Churchill to Chaim Weizman, from socialist ladies to leading intellectuals on both sides of the Atlantic. Berlin seldom left any letter unanswered, no matter how obscure the letter-writer. The sheer quantity of his letters raises one important question. Except for one small book on Karl Marx, written in his youth, Berlin did not write any book. He only wrote essays. If he hadnt devoted so much of his time to dictating letters (some of them unnecessary), would he have written some more books?

	Islam and the army in colonial India: Sepoy religion in the service of empire 
  By Nile Green, Cambridge, Rs 695              
	Studies of the revolt of 1857 have shown beyond any reasonable doubt the important place that religion occupied in the lives of the sepoys. The sepoys of the Bengal Army who mutinied and then fought the British in 1857 were mostly Brahmins from Awadh. Hence the term, Pandies, to describe sepoys; Pandey being a common surname. This book looks at the sepoys in Hyderabad, where most of them were Muslims, and how certain forms of religiosity spread in the sepoy lines. The institutions of the army and the prevailing attitudes permitted the dissemination of certain types of religious feelings while restraining others. This book is the first to offer a detailed reconstruction of the interaction of the sepoys with religious ideas.         
	It does so through the military fellowship of four faqirs. The author calls his project an exercise in micro-history and is, therefore, justifiably hesitant in drawing overarching generalizations. He wants to confine his evidence and the telling of his stories to a particular time and place. The book is, therefore, rich in detail. What needs to be underscored is that most, if not all, of the details are absolutely new. Green has used sources that have never been used before. In the reconstruction of sepoy life and religiosity, the standard sources are those that lie in the military department. Green has fallen back on Urdu sources. These have opened up a new dimension. He has brought to light what he calls barracks Islam: shaped by the daily life of the soldier between the barrack and the battlefied, it was an Islam that at once served and was served by the interests of empire. The books chronological scope is huge. It comes right up to the 1930s. The author thus also traces the changes and reforms that barracks Islam underwent. The writing is lucid despite the complex nature of the subject matter. It is, however, a monograph for the specialist. Its research and its approach are both ground-breaking. Nile Green deserves to be congratulated for his contribution to a neglected field of modern Indian history.

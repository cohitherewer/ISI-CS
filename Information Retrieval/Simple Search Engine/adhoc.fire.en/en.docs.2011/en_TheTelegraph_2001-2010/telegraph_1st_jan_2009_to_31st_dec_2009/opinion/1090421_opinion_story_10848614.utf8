	During his first trial in India, held in Ahmedabad in 1923, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was asked by the judge what his occupation was. Gandhi replied, Farmer and weaver. The answer is significant because this is how he refashioned himself after he came back to India from South Africa and decided to dedicate his life to the service of the Indian people. He thus abandoned his old clothes and wore a loin cloth and another simple cloth around his torso. An equally simple pair of slippers and a wooden stick completed his attire. This has become the enduring image of the Mahatma. He consciously dressed as an Indian peasant would. The cloth that he used was handspun, very often spun by his own hands.        
	Gandhi pruned his lifes needs down to the bare essentials. This helped him to identify with the poor people of India, who, in most parts of the country, unhesitatingly accepted Gandhi as one of their own. Gandhi fashioned himself as a renunciator even though he never wore the ochre robes of a Hindu sanyasi. He was seen in the rural world as a holy man. People kept vrats in his name; carried out acts of worship. In rural Gorakhpur, his name became associated with boons and curses. These associations, embracing Gandhis name and message, were enabled by the way Gandhi decided to dress, by the kind of cloth he decided to use. In India, it would be difficult to imagine a man in Western dress being given a halo of holiness by the people.        
	Gandhis dress helped his politics. But the way he dressed was also a statement of some of his fundamental beliefs. Gandhi believed that the future of civilization lay in the simple life of the Indian peasant, which was governed by a law of reciprocity. This life permitted individuals to be self-sufficient and to regulate their own lives. Gandhi wanted his life to be a symbol of this.        
	Thus the charka and the khadi became the symbols of the Gandhian phase of Indian nationalism. The call of khadi drew even Jawaharlal Nehru, fresh out of Harrow and Trinity College, Cambridge. The young Nehru, following in the footsteps of Bapu, wore a khadi dhoti and kurta. The chost, achkan and the rose came much later.        
	Khadi today is an item of ethnic chic. With Gandhi it was a potent weapon to fight British rule through non-violent means. Khadi stood for swadeshi, the rejection of everything that was British and foreign. By wearing khadi and asking Indians to wear khadi, Gandhi struck at the very root of the British presence in India.        
	Politics and beliefs came together in khadi and the way Gandhi chose to dress. Never before, and never since, has a piece of cloth been such a powerful symbol of mass movement.

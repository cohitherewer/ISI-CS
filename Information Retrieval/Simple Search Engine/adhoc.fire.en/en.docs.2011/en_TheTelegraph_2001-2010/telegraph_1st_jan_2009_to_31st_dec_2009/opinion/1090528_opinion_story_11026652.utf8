The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Struggle without an end in sight
                                                                                                                 STRUGGLE WITHOUT AN END IN SIGHT                                  WISH FOR CHANGE      What ordinary Muslim voters in the city had in mind before the general elections                          Better future                                        
	We are used to struggle, said Mohammad Selim, standing on the narrow, crowded pavement before one of the shops selling flowers for the mazhar at Moulali junction. But if there is no job at the end of the struggle, it is very painful. I had asked the men I met there what they had in mind before the elections. We do want change, they said, while acknowledging that some changes for the better have taken place. Looking around, one of them said that pollution on the streets was a big problem. Something had to be done about the filth and the smoke.        
	For Majid Khan, getting to office on time everyday had got progressively difficult. He never knows where he is going to get held up on the way and why. How many days in the week was he going to say he was late because of a traffic jam or some other form of hold-up? Paribesh (environment), traffic movement, rising prices of everything from food to gold  these were uppermost in their minds  and possibly easiest to speak of when the conversation began.        
	But the conversation actually turned on the need for jobs. Educated young men from middle-class families have no jobs; should they be selling vegetables or imitation stuff, or driving auto-rickshaws? They did not mind the struggle, as Selim said, but there should be some reward at the end. Nishchay raag hoy (they must feel angry)? I asked, without thinking. No, no, not angry, they were anxious to explain, just sad, pained. I was ashamed; how could I have forgotten that this tense tightrope walk is what the majority community in India has forced on everyone else, that even a brief conversation with a stranger can seem risky? But even within that short time just before prayers, space was made for me to sit and I was served tea. I was warmly welcomed simply because I had asked them how they felt.        
	Iqbalbhai said that Urdu should be made one of the main languages in the state. Eighty thousand students had passed from Urdu medium schools; he was doubtful about their future. Young people feel frustrated, yet unable to express their feelings. In the fear that they would be misunderstood? I asked. Yes, there is that. We love all parties, we have enmity with none, I was told. But jobs and status are crucial. This is a point that Selim wanted me to emphasize, to say that it is his request from all his friends and kin to anybody in power. We are ordinary middle-class people, he said, all we want is to go out in the morning to work, and come home in the evening to our families. What more should anyone want than that? Without jobs, young men take to less seemly means of livelihood: that is inevitable. Religions make no difference, living all together as part of a productive society is enough.        
	The Sachar committee report weighed heavily on my mind during this poignant conversation. Yet more people are educated now. Earlier, said Khan, when there was trouble, young men would avoid involving educated families. Now there is less trouble because there is more education. That has made another difference, he added. Earlier, campaigners would tell them whom to vote for. Now everyone quietly thinks it out for himself.         
	Suppose you have a wife, and I have a wife, says Selim, charmingly, your wife would tell you, how is it that her son (referring to my wife) is going to a good school? My son should go there too. So competition is a good thing? I ask him. Very good, he says, laughing.                          BHASWATI CHAKRAVORTY

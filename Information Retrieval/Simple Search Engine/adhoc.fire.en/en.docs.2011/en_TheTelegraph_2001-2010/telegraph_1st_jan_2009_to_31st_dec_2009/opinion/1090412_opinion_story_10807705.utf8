                                                                                                               DIARY
                  
	 In this season of flying footwear, politicians are becoming ever cautious of potential missiles hurled at their faces (though not a single assailant has managed to hit the bulls eye yet). The one good thing about these unsavoury episodes is that ducking a shoe requires agile reflexes  that means having a fit body. Sadly, most Indian leaders leave much to be desired on that account. Perhaps, now that the air is abuzz with shoes, the errant politicians will pull up their socks and work on their sagging fitness quotient. Of course, the flip side of these attacks is to be caught on the camera with the boot in the face  or inching by the face. Think of Naveen Jindal. The first thing the poor man did after a school teacher greeted him with a shoe was to look round for TV cameras. Just as he was feeling a little relieved to note that none was around, and was shrilly condemning the incident as a political conspiracy by his rivals, the hand of fate struck. Once again, on the face. The alleged enemy had also ensured that the saga was recorded, and in minutes Jindals acrobatics were on TV for all to see. The only consolation  Jindal managed to duck!                
	 Staying with shoes: political parties and the police are understandably alarmed by the growing popularity of the shoe trend. Recently, when the AICC gen-sec Digvijay Singh was in his home state, Madhya Pradesh, he asked the assembled scribes to please take off their shoes if they wished to interact with him. Diggy Raja may have been half-joking, but the mood in several states is far from it. It is rumoured that intelligence chiefs are busy compiling dossiers of journalists with a predilection for throwing shoes. Given the fabled efficiency of our intelligence cells, we shudder to think what might have befallen Shivraj Patil had he continued to be the home minister.                             
	 From vengeful shoe soles to a privileged sole. Guess the only Congressman present during the PMs meeting with women journalists? None other than the AICC gen-sec, Janardhan Dwivedi. The sole male politician sat quietly as the ladies posed their questions to Manmohan Singh. Presumably, Dwivedi was present as the head of the AICC media department, though a few sensitive souls did murmur the name of Jayanti Natrajan. But Dwivedi is quite canny himself. After all, he was the first to question Jagdish Tytlers candidature shortly after the home minister had fielded another shoe salvo.                            
	 Some rush in where the judicious fear to tread. Take Arjun Singh for instance. For the best part of his tenure as the human resource development minister, Singh has run things pretty much in his own way. The other day, he pulled a long face on learning that both his daughter and son have been denied nomination to run for the Lok Sabha polls. But nowadays he seems totally unmindful of his diminishing clout in the party, or else why would he press ahead with faculty and non-faculty appointments at Jamia Millia Islamia even after the Election Commissions model code of conduct had come into force? The vice-chancellor of the university is so pleased with Singhs gesture that he has named a road in the campus after the minister. Whats more, Singh has even been asked to unveil the plaque on a corner of the said road to celebrate his glorious feat.                            
	 Rita Bahuguna Joshi is the Congresss answer to Nafisa Ali. Joshi, who heads the partys Uttar Pradesh unit, is taking on Ali from Lucknow. The Congress is smarting from hurt pride. Not only had Ali been given easy access to Madam for years, but great things had been expected of her as well. After Sanjay Dutts exit from the scene, the Congress was planning to field her from Lucknow, before bad luck intervened in the form of Amar Singh. Now that Joshi is being readied for the battle, her instructions are loud and clear: even if the seat goes to the BJP or the BSP, she must get more votes than Ali.                            
	 On screen and off it too, Chiranjeevi is living up to the image of an honest hero. Asked why he was opting for a fourth front, the chief of the newly-formed Praja Rajyam Party quipped, You see, the first front, UPA, has the Congress and the second front has the BJP. In the third front is my rival, TDP, so I have no option but to go for a fourth front.                
	 That there is something cocky about Jairam Ramesh is no secret. His attitude goes on to explain his enduring unpopularity within and without the party. But did you know that the chief media planner of Congress has sent LK Advani a letter to rebut the BJP campaign about black money stashed abroad in tax havens? Apparently, the language in which the letter was worded takes the cake for rudeness. After calling Advanis outcry a total hoax, and rebuking him in the choicest of words, Ramesh ends his missive with these colourful words: Goebbels believed that if you keep repeating a lie several times, people will begin to believe it. Your ideological brotherhood has perfected that dictum. Now what remains to be seen is whether such sound and fury would be suitably rewarded by the party top brass. Or would Ramesh be ticked off for this outburst?

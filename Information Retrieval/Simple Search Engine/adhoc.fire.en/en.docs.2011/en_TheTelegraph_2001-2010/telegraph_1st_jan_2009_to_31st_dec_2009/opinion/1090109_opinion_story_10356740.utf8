                                                                                                                 LESSONS TO LEARN                                  BONA FIDE - Malvika Singh                              
	A peculiar sense of fear has enveloped India. It is unusual, abnormal and palpable wherever one is, whatever one is doing. This is the mood across the country. The many insidious assaults on us by our neighbours over the decades, ranging from their illegal infiltration into the state of Jammu and Kashmir in a determined effort to fuel insurgency and support radical fringe groups to a regular influx into Assam, Bihar, Bengal and other parts of the country, have finally caused Indians to lose their patience. Now they are willing to sacrifice all that it takes to quell this unlawful operation.        
	Nations that are directly involved know that the attacks have been happening for years. They know well the institutions that support the ongoing brutal and mindless militancy. The world knows who are responsible, but because India has always looked towards dialogue and working out peaceful solutions despite knowing how long that humane process might take, the United States of America, Britain and others have been non-committal, disengaged and in denial. They have looked the other way, and silently encouraged the social upheaval by not taking strong positions.        
	India has been an independent nation-state, a critical player in Asia, an intellectual resource bank, a manufacturing base and a huge potential market. Hitherto rich and powerful Western countries have been conscious of the fact that India could become even more powerful than they are, and so have worked deliberately to keep South Asia in turmoil. Indias potential awes them. However, what the rich and the powerful clearly did not envisage is the fact that terror and militancy would not be confined within our economically exploited, and therefore backward, region but would assault their cultures equally, if not far more harshly. It is only when 9/11 hit them on their territory that they recognized the enemy of humanity they had created and sponsored for use against a potentially rich and civilized world, although economically poor at the moment, whose cultures and philosophies are rooted and will withstand the onslaught of time.                
	Joint venture        
	Pakistan was, till yesterday, a spoilt, favoured nation that America propped up and nurtured. Today, it is imploding on our faces, and falling apart with its own terminal, internal illness. The terror camps  which capture and train unemployed, unexposed and inexperienced youth who have been denied even the basic minimum life has to offer, and who are desperate for something to do and earn  are run by unstructured groups led by a breed of indigenous robber barons. They have taken over large tracts of the country, areas that the State has failed to hold and govern. The Inter-Services Intelligence and the army, both institutions with no checks and balances, use these bands to do what commissioned officers are supposed to refrain from doing! The US knows this, and it has never helped to restructure that Islamic state. Pakistan knows this. India knows this. Every country in the world knows this. Clearly, therefore, it is only when the battlefield shifts away from the subcontinent to Europe, Britain and the US will real action take place.         
	Endless false premises, upon which faulty dialogues, based on half-truths, are superimposed, have aggravated the problem. Sadly, as long as the scene of horror is far away from Western shores, there is no international urgency. All of us, irrespective of colour and creed, have to come together. We have to accept that discrimination, exploitation and neglect compelled young men to become terrorists. We have to begin by cleansing ourselves of the hatred towards other faiths, which need to be fully understood first. We need to respect that which is unfamiliar and learn new lessons. This international joint venture will ensure a safe future.

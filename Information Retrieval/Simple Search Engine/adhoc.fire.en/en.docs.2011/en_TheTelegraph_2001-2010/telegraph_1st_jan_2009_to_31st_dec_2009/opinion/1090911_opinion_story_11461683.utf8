	Trees from a window      
	Notes from a Small Room (Penguin, Rs 225) by Ruskin Bond is a vintage collection of his short essays, many of which have appeared over the years in various magazines and newspapers. Bonds favourite themes his love for trees, animals, geraniums and books unite these musings, which are written in his inimitable unpretentious style. From his station at the window of his study overlooking the hills of Landour, Bond observes the days marching away into the sunset or sunrise. He talks of the perfect widow, of the need for solitude, and of the ghosts of a peepul tree. Through all these essays, Bond comes across as the quintessential loner, who at 75 finds contentment personified in the small ginger cat who arrives on the balcony every afternoon, to curl up in the sun and slumber peacefully for a couple of hours. An added reward of this book is the cover photograph by Bond that shows a Siamese cat (probably Suzie, about whom he writes here) sitting beside a typewriter with that look of exquisite boredom and indifference that makes them the kin of certain categories of human beings.                          
	Sri Aurobindo: A Contemporary Reader (Routledge, Rs 325) edited by Sachidananda Mohanty attempts to provide a sketch of Aurobindo as a thinker rather than as a mystic by offering extracts from his writings on politics, international relations and philosophy. Mohanty says in the Introduction that most biographies of Aurobindo end up being hagiographies and prevent one from evaluating him as an intellectual. Aurobindos writings are dense. Their titles, Can Reason be the Governor of Life?, True and False Subjectivism or Growth of Continental Agglomerates, give an inkling of their seriousness. One has to be thankful for the editors prologues to the essays without which they would have been difficult to understand.                        
	50 Simple Steps to Save the Earth from Global Warming (Jaico, Rs 250) by the Green Patriot Working Group is a book by Americans that would have maximum relevance for Americans only. It refers to American consumer labels, American websites, American public utilities. Hence, however well-meaning the advice it renders, it can have only limited application for Indian readers. Nevertheless, some of the counsels, such as those of unplugging your chargers when not in use, or of drinking organic (red) wine to the lees, can be embraced heartily by all.

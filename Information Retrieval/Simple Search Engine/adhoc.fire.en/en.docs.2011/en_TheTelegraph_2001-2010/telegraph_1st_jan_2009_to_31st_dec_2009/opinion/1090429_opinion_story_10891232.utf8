	Delay justified        
	 In a case involving murder, the accused persons who were convicted and sentenced to imprisonment made two appeals before the High Court of Karnataka. Although the high court honoured one of them by partially altering an order, the other appeal was dismissed. The accused person then appealed to the Supreme Court. One of the points raised was that there was an inordinate delay in lodging the FIR. Rejecting the plea, the Supreme Court held that since the incident took place at 6.30 pm and the injured person reached the hospital at 8 pm, the eight-hour delay in lodging the FIR was not abnormal. Given that a person even died during this period, the court held, the delay could not be dubbed as indordinate. (Shankaraya Naik vs State of Karnataka)                           
	Dumb witness        
	 A dumb woman who had been set on fire made a dying declaration to the executive magistrate before her death. The communication between the two had been carried out in sign language. The accused pleaded that since the deceased woman was deaf and dumb, her dying declaration was of no value. The trial court accepted this argument. However, the Punjab and Haryana High Court set aside the trial courts order of framing charges against the accused on the basis that the victim was deaf and dumb. Going by the evidence, the Supreme Court held that the victim was merely dumb and paralytic and not deaf and therefore the high court ought not to have entertained the petition of the accused.

	Still secure        
	 Section 60 of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC) exempts certain categories of property (such as pension and gratuity) from attachment. The Rajasthan High Court ordered the attachment of a persons fixed deposits, which had been converted from pension and gratuity funds, when he failed to repay certain bank loans. When the borrower appealed to the Supreme Court, it held that the fixed deposits could not be attached as they had been converted from gratuity funds. It added that the deposits did not lose their character even after conversion and continued to be covered by Section 60 of the CPC. (Radhey Shyam vs Punjab National Bank)

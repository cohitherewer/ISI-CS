	On April 17 this year, 11-year-old Shanno Khan died in Delhi after she was punished by her teacher in a primary school of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi. Shanno was made to crouch on the ground with bricks on her shoulders because she failed to recite her alphabets properly.        
	In November last year, eight-year-old Iftesham Chowdhury, a student of Bidya Bharati School in Calcutta, went into a coma and later died at the Calcutta Medical Research Institute after her yoga teacher, Anita Das, allegedly slapped her so hard that she lost her balance and rammed her head against a wall.        
	A year later, Ifteshams parents are still trying to bring Anita Das to justice.        
	Brutal corporal punishment  at home or at school  is one of the commonest forms of child abuse. But while India celebrates 20 years of the ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, this form of abuse continues unabated in our country.        
	Last week the governments apathy on the issue became clear once again when it came to light that a Calcutta High Court order banning corporal punishment in schools in 2004 had not even been communicated to all the primary and secondary schools in West Bengal. The order had stated that if corporal punishment led to a students death, the guilty person would be tried under Section 304 of the Indian Penal Code (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) instead of Section 304A (death due to negligence). An offence under Section 304 is punishable with life imprisonment, while Section 304A carries the lighter sentence of up to two years in jail.        
	An affidavit submitted by the West Bengal director of school education, Debyen Mukherjee, to the Calcutta High Court last week stated that secondary and higher secondary schools in only eight of the 19 districts of West Bengal have received the notification so far. As for primary schools, the school inspectors of as many as nine districts in the state have failed to issue the notification.        
	But it is not just West Bengal that turns a lackadaisical eye on corporal punishment. Experts say that all over the country there is a lack of seriousness when it comes to dealing with crimes relating to harsh punishment of children. This despite the fact that the Supreme Court banned corporal punishment of children in 2000.        
	Existing provisions covering different types of violence against children are rarely used to prosecute acts of corporal punishment. Also, corporal punishment is not specifically defined and/or criminalised under the Indian Penal Code (IPC), says Deepa Dixit, member of the National Commission for the Protection of Child Rights, explaining why teachers are rarely punished for causing serious injury to their students.        
	Offenders often get away with no punishment or light sentences because usually, the appropriate laws are not invoked. In Shannos case, for instance, the Delhi police filed the case under Section 304A of the IPC which includes causing death by negligence. Says Amod Kanth, chairperson of the Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights, Punishment meted out to a student is a deliberate act. It cant be deemed negligent. The case ought to have been filed under Section 304 of the IPC, which includes punishment for culpable homicide not amounting to murder. The case is now pending in the Delhi High Court.        
	Or take the case of Iftesham. Tapas Kumar Bhanja, Ifteshams lawyer, points out that when Iftesham was still fighting for her life, the police lodged the case under Section 338 of the IPC, which includes causing grievous hurt by an act endangering life or personal safety of others. The penalty for this offence includes imprisonmentfor a term which may extend to two years, or with a fine which may extend to one thousand rupees, or with both. But after the child died the police brought the case under the less severe Section 304A of the IPC, which includes punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both.        
	Bhanja, who had filed the public interest litigation against corporal punishment of children that eventually led to the Calcutta High Court order banning it, is now trying to get schools to implement the order.              
	Indeed, there is no dearth of judicial orders banning corporal punishment. Experts say that the problem lies in effective implementation of these orders. Says Kamini Jaiswal, senior advocate, Supreme Court, The apex court ordered a ban on corporal punishment in 2000. But the enforcement is weak and the order has been implemented in only 17 out of 28 states.        
	Jaiswal reveals that a study on child abuse conducted by the ministry of women and child development in 2007 shows that in all age groups an overwhelming majority of children (65.01 per cent) reported being beaten at school. This means that two out of three children are victims of corporal punishment. There are various laws on issues related to child protection, but the lack of implementation and an efficient implementation mechanism makes protection a myth, she says.        
	Again, though corporal punishment is banned by judicial orders  the Right to Education Act also bans it  till date there is no comprehensive law that deals with this crime. Says Ashok Agarwal, a Supreme Court advocate, We need strong penal provisions in the law where the accused can be tried summarily by the court within a period of six months with a provision of only one appeal to the Supreme Court.        
	Of course, corporal punishment of children ties in with many other forms of child abuse that are rampant in our country. The Child Rights Charter 2003 of India states: All children have a right to be protected against neglect, maltreatment, injury, trafficking, sexual and physical abuse of all kinds, corporal punishment, torture, exploitation, violence and degrading treatment. And if legal protection against corporal punishment appears to be insufficient, this could be said about other forms of child abuse as well.        
	In October this year Childline India Foundation, a tele-helpline organisation, rescued a five-year-old boy in Chennai who was underfed, kept confined in a kitchen and regularly beaten by his father  allegedly because the man could not stand his sons resemblance to his estranged wife. The case is now pending, but Sridevi, a coordinator with Childline, who was part of the rescue operation, has expressed concern for the childs safety should his father get bail.        
	The state often fails to protect children who are victims of abuse, she says. This despite the fact that these children would, in theory, be protected by the provisions of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act.        
	But at least the Chennai boy had the good fortune to be rescued from his abusive environment. Shanno, Iftesham and hundreds of others have not been so lucky. Clearly, the government needs to bring in an effective law against harsh physical punishment in order to make sure that no child falls prey to the sadistic impulses of grown ups.

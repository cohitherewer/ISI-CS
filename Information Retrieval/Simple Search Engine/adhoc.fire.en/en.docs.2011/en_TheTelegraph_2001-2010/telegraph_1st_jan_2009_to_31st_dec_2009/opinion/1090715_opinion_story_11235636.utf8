                                                                                                                 DANGER DRIFT                                                    
	Governments everywhere find it hard to deal with separatist politics. But the West Bengal government has long lost the will or ability to even try to tackle it in the Darjeeling hills. The result is a dangerous drift that is allowed to continue in a sensitive border region. The latest call for another indefinite bandh in Darjeeling shows once again the total collapse of the administration in the area. The people there are left at the mercy of the agitators, and normal life is completely disrupted. The government has abdicated all its responsibilities to enforce the rule of law. The only concern of the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government seems to be to avoid the use of force and bloodshed at all costs. This can hardly be the mandate for governance anywhere. But then, both New Delhi and Calcutta have long sought to buy peace in Darjeeling by surrendering to the violent tactics of Gorkhaland movements. The withdrawal of the State from Darjeeling today is actually an old story that began with the violent stir by Subash Ghisinghs Gorkha National Liberation Front in the mid-1980s. The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha, which leads the agitation for a separate Gorkhaland state now, moved into the vacuum created as much by the fall of Mr Ghisingh as by the collapse of the State.         
	True, it would be politically and administratively wrong to treat the agitation in Darjeeling as only a law and order problem. The demand for a separate administrative arrangement for Darjeeling predates Indias independence. Ironically, it was the communists who first voiced the demand for self-determination for the people of Darjeeling in 1946. No matter which party led such an agitation in different times, the demand had always had the support of an overwhelming majority of the people in Darjeeling. The issue, therefore, needs a political solution that would respect the popular sentiment. The problem is that almost all major political parties used it over the past 20 years only to further their narrow partisan interests. It is time leaders of these parties, both in West Bengal and at the national level, realized the importance of a durable solution to the problem. After all, the way the Centre and a state government deal with a statehood demand will have its impact in other parts of the country where such demands exist. But letting Darjeeling drift is a sure recipe for worse problems.

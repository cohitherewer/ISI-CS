                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        HUMAN KINDNESS                                                          
	How much suffering must a woman endure before the courts can even think of allowing her to pass away in peace? In India, it seems, it needs 61-year-old Aruna Shanbaug to provide the answer. Ever since she was subjected to a ferocious rape 36 years ago, Ms Shanbaug has remained blind, speechless and paralysed, her brain cells severely damaged by the dog chain her rapist used to strangle her. She has been lying in the King Edward Memorial Hospital ever since, force-fed and looked after by the hospital staff and abandoned by her family. Her tragedy is agonizing enough for the Supreme Court to have admitted the plea made on her behalf; recently, it had refused to admit a plea for abortion from a mentally challenged girl who had been raped. There is undoubtedly a strong case for the freedom to die with dignity, equal to the right to search for a life of dignity. But the imperfections of the world impose upon the freedom to die the constraints of religion, of law, of medical ethics, perhaps because human beings know how easy it is to kill.        
	But the right to die with dignity when one is afflicted with an incurable disease, or is undergoing irredeemable suffering, is not an easy principle. Doctors take the oath to heal, and never cause harm. Yet each word in this most general statement can offer various interpretations. The different Dr Deaths could argue that by administering a fatal injection, or withdrawing extraordinary life support, the doctor is acting against harm by ridding the patient of an unbearable life. On the other hand, who is to decide that a patients suffering is irredeemable? Advancements in medicine would prevent a doctor from making such a categorical statement; doctors would rather continue with treatment that aspires to be palliative even when experience tells them that a case is hopeless.        
	But in Ms Shanbaugs case, the doctors have been brave enough to say that recovery is impossible. She represents a test case on many levels. Is it right to let a woman continue with her life when she cannot move, see, speak or think, is without hope of recovery and is totally dependent on the kindness of others? At the same time, is it possible for other human beings, caring for one so helpless, to stop force-feeding her, which is what the plea asks for? The woman lying unmoving for 36 years is really asking the world the most difficult question: to seek and find what it means to be human. Reportedly, the man whose truly inhuman act destroyed so much of her humanness got away after seven years in prison, because he had been charged with robbery and attempted murder, and not with rape. Surely there is something inhuman also in a justice process that allows this to happen. Does Ms Shanbaug also not represent, unforgettably, what it means to be a woman in India?

                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Tall talk                  
	Sir  While the editorial, Talks sans terror (July 18), concludes that hawkish cynicism can often harm self-interest, the truth remains that Indias cynical stand on Pakistan has been precipitated by continuing terrorist attacks from Pakistan, as also by Pakistans longstanding denial of responsibility for the same. Given this state of affairs, the recent talks between India and Pakistan in Sharm-al-Sheikh have ultimately led to a climbdown for India and to a triumph of sorts for Pakistan. Since Pakistan-based terrorism has become a fact of life for India, the so-called delinking of terror from the composite dialogue makes no sense. Focusing on economic issues without addressing the core problem of terror suggests a blinkered approach. How can India see any sense in taking a step that gives Pakistan indefinite breathing space? New Delhi seems to be giving more importance to cross-border bus services than to cross-border terrorism. In just about eight months since the 26/11 attacks, Indian policy on Pakistan has regressed a long way.          
	For its part, Pakistan has gained a victory because the joint statement specifically mentions that all outstanding issues, apart from terrorism, will be discussed (Terror delinked from Pak dialogue but split on spin, July 17). This gives Pakistan a free rein to engage with the Kashmir issue at will. The lopsided attitude of Pakistan has been increasingly prominent ever since it lost East Pakistan in 1971. Instead of recognizing, directly or indirectly, that Kashmir is an outstanding issue that needs to be resolved with Pakistan (and American pressure is also playing a role here), India has to be bold enough to state, once and for all, that Kashmir is an integral part of India and not an issue that needs to be resolved with any other country.          
	In spite of all the talk from Pakistan about it too being affected by terrorism, every Pakistani government has steadfastly raked up the Kashmir issue. For them, the only solution is an azad Kashmir, and to this end, cross-border terrorism will continue. It would be nave to assume that terrorism originating on Pakistani soil is going to stop because India has delinked terror from the composite dialogue. On the contrary, terrorism may just increase because India is choosing to look the other way.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Of late, Pakistan, whenever cornered on the issue of exporting Islamic terrorism to India, has advanced a conveniently confusing reply, saying that it too is a victim of such terrorism. If so, Pakistan is merely reaping the harvest that it has sowed.           
	India has borne the brunt of many diabolical attacks originating in Pakistan over the years. In 2008 alone, India lost hundreds of lives in separate incidents, ending with the gruesome 26/11 mayhem. On the eve of the proposed bipartite talks in Sharm-al-Sheikh, the Jamaat-ud-Dawa chief, Hafeez Saeed, a terror mastermind, was released from custody in Pakistan: this is how Pakistan expressed its sincerity. Yet India did not defer the dialogue for fear of being accused of derailing the talks by the international community, particularly by the United States of America. It is high time India realized that the US is merely interested in curbing the entry of terrorists into Afghanistan from Pakistan. Not much else matters to the US beyond this.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Pick up the bill          
	Sir  The state government has taken the right step by introducing a bill to make vandals pay up for damaging properties on hospital premises (Hospital vandals face bill, July 16). It is true that attacks on state hospitals have risen and cannot be justified on any count. At the same time, it is strange that the government has not emphasized the need to govern hospitals better and reduce their overcrowding.          
	Due to bad management, untoward incidents take place that lead to huge loss of the taxpayers money. The district and the sub-divisional hospitals are keen to transfer patients due to lack of state-of-the-art facilities. The opinion of the state health minister that patients and their families follow several avenues to get justice is ludicrous. Health-related cases lie unresolved in consumer courts for years. The authorities need to imbibe a holistic and a better-coordinated approach towards healthcare. Otherwise, common people will continue to suffer.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Jayanta Datta,

	Sir  The bill to extract damages from offenders who destroy hospital property is, as yet, another instance of old wine in a new bottle. Incidents of violence following the death of patients due to negligence on the part of hospital and nursing homes are a common feature in West Bengal. The new bill aims at pacifying the medical fraternity, which is often accused of indifference and dragged to courts.          
	The issue of violence leading to the destruction of public and private property also plagues the nation in one form or the other in a more general sense. These acts are conspicuous during bandhs and riots. The Indian Penal Code has adequate legal provisions to deal with such misdemeanours. However, the biggest hurdle on the way to justice is the lack of proper enforcement. Till date, compensations have been seldom extracted from the offenders because most of them belong to political outfits. Ironically, the laws meant to punish the miscreants are framed by political leaders who end up protecting the guilty. A state that repeatedly makes a mockery of high court orders imposing bans on polluting vehicles can hardly be serious about enacting laws which it would not be able to enforce across the political divide.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Prabhakar Bhattacharya,

      
	Ichapore, North 24 Parganas

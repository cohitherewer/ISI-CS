The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A different closeness
                                                                                                                 A DIFFERENT CLOSENESS                              Visual Arts      Somak Ghoshal                                                            
	When James Abbot McNeill Whistler had his dream of a pure visual music while looking at the old Battersea Bridge, he chose to call it Nocturne in blue and silver; but when Sarbari Roy Choudhury had his own vision of the musical sublime, he created those unforgettable heads of Siddheswari Devi (top, right), Bade Ghulam Ali Khan and Ali Akbar Khan, and simply called them by the rightful names of his original models. Although shorn of fanciful titles, these faces cast in bronze  Roy Choudhurys most favoured medium of expression  turned out to be the ideal meeting ground of intense materiality and resonant mysticism. Deeply lined, riddled with crevices, often resembling noble ruins, Roy Choudhurys musicians are caught mid-song, absorbed in the making of some exquisite phrase, as the human imperfections of their faces stand out in contrast to the flawless grandeur of their art.         
	The exhibition of sculptures by Sarbari Roy Choudhury at Akar Prakar (Sensibility Objectified, April 29 to May 22) was captivating precisely for this emphasis on dissonance, in the way that it evoked the sensuous in relation to the ineffable, the shapeliness in shapeless forms in Roy Choudhurys art. Bringing together a range of work, from the early 1950s to 2001 and beyond, this exhibition revisited the manifold aspects of Roy Choudhurys aesthetics as it imbibed cubist, realist and abstract elements, over the decades, to emerge as a unique amalgam of all three styles. Initially trained by Pradosh Dasgupta under a strictly colonial curriculum of art education that focused on realism, Sarbari Roy Choudhury also came under the influence of Sankha Chaudhuri, and was to meet Giacometti and Henry Moore in person later. The best of the East and the West thus came together in Roy Choudhurys work, resulting in a shifting, protean and unique idiom that defies all classification.        
	While the tender warmth of Mother amp; Child (1952) and the graceful curves of Kiss (1957) recall the marmoreal perfection of Rodin, Giacometti (1989; below), very much after the manner of the Italian master, or Seated Woman (1951), alluding to Henry Moores Recumbent figure (1938), hark back to another kind of high modernist ethos. Surreally smooth textures and the earthiness of wrinkled skin come together like twinned halves of a schizophrenic sensibility. The usually modest scale of these figures lends an aura of intimacy to them: it is as if they had been rolled out of clay, not cast in bronze. The playful mother with her child, the pensive figure crouched all alone, and the grotesquely misshapen female bodies all carry the imprint of the living hands that have fashioned them; the technical exigencies of the lost-wax process and bronze-casting are dissipated in their vibrant humanity. Even the miniature nudes and dancing figures do not look remotely impersonal. In spite of their slender elegance and perfect contours, they are not doll-like in any way.        
	Another kind of closeness comes through in the larger figures: a glint of sharpness about Ramkinkar Baijs eyes (top, left), a hint of melancholy in the furrowed face of Kesarbai Kerkar, or the ghost of a smile hovering around Bade Ghulam Ali Khans full mouth as it spins out a taan. With unfailing sensitivity, Roy Choudhury touches the essence of his subjects personalities  a shyness in the pubescent girls, the austere grimness of Ramkinkar, the convivial charm of Bade Ghulam Ali or the brooding inwardness of Kesarbai. It is because of this affective kinship with his subjects that Roy Choudhury is able to glimpse unfamiliar edges on ever-familiar faces. His portrait of Rabindranath Tagore, Gurudev (1951), is far removed from the hackneyed image of the sage-like bard with flowing beard supposed to conjure up Tagore. It is almost a caricature. If the angular lines and the Chaplinesque moustache give a pleasant jolt, what is totally unanticipated is the lightness of being emanating from the upturned lips and the beaky nose.

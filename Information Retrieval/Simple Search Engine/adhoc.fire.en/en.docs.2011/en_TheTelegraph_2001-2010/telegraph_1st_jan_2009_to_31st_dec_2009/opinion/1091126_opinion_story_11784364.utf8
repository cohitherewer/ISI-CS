	When it comes to sugar, prices are not set by supply-demand equations, but by regulation, making it inefficient and possibly wasteful. Both houses of Parliament adjourned on the first day of the winter session after Opposition parties protested against the governments attempt to impose fair and remunerative pricing on the sugar industry through an ordinance which sought to amend the Essential Commodities Act of 1955. The protests reflect the differences of opinion between two sets of people, both on the supply side: farmers who want better prices for their cane, and the millers and refiners who take issue with having to supply 20 per cent of their output to the public distribution system at a subsidized price of Rs 13.50 a kilogram. Basically, it is about which one of the two parties carries more of the risk relative to the other. The dispute stems from the multi-layered patchwork of regulation that rules the industry. It also has to do with the way different states not only price sugarcane  and subsidize its production  but how payment is settled between refiner and farmer, all of which come with a legacy. In all states except Maharashtra, farmers deposit their harvested sugarcane with refiners, who use them as and when needed. Terms of settlement are negotiated about six months after refiners receive the cane, and at a price that is mutually agreeable.        
	Refiners provide 20 per cent of their production to the PDS, for which the government pays them late. Refiners say they are unable to pay farmers on time as a result, and in Uttar Pradesh, the Allahabad High Court has had to step in to clear dues to the farmers each year. Dues have been cleared for 2007-08 thus far. The story in Tamil Nadu is similar; only in Maharashtra have all dues to farmers been settled, largely because the co-operatives ensure payment on delivery. Farmers are affected by delayed payments because they carry interest and other costs, and the global shortage in sugar production has given them additional leverage to demand Rs 2,500 per tonne for their cane. Refiners do not want to pay this price because that would set the base price for the following years, and if there is a glut, the refiners will have to carry losses if open market prices for sugar fall from their current very high levels of Rs 44 per kg. It is time to open up sugar pricing to market forces, rather than have it imposed on both the input (cane) and output (sugar) sides.

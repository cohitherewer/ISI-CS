The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | on economy avenue
                                                                                                                 ON ECONOMY AVENUE                                                          
	There is a societal cost for keeping a leader poor, as Sarojini Naidu once jokingly reminded Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. The finance ministers austerity measures, welcome though they are, might have hidden costs. This might lead to the bizarre situation of losing in the swings what has been won in the roundabout. Ministers have been asked to travel by economy class. The point has been raised by Sharad Pawar that it might be difficult, if not an ordeal, for an obese minister to fit himself into an economy class seat. It might even be impossible to squeeze such a person into a seat in the unlikely event of a minister being assigned a middle seat. It could be argued that an over-large minister would have to go through a programme of weight and diet reduction before he is able to fly economy class. Rapid weight reduction in a gym or in special clinics is an expensive proposition. What the government would save by making ministers fly economy could be offset by bills coming in from gyms and spas. The issue posed by Farooq Abdullah before the cabinet is insoluble. He asked what would happen if the minister was tall and needed extra leg space? Frequent fliers should begin to get used to the idea of the first row of the economy class on aircraft being reserved for ministers and other VIPs. These problems raised by ministers may appear risible but they actually point to other areas where austerity could be more easily enforceable.        
	In Indian political circles, the line between party and government has become blurred; in many cases, it has been erased. Why should a minister, when he is going on party work or to the party office, use his ministerial car? He should use the party car or his personal car. It is a common sight to see ministers and important bureaucrats using their official cars for private purposes. This kind of misuse increases official expenditure. Unless there are serious security considerations  such considerations should be restricted to the prime minister and a handful of others  private use of official vehicles and drivers should be stopped. It is worth recalling that when Manmohan Singh had to renew his driving license he drove his own Maruti 800 to the licensing office. Mr Singh was then the prime minister of the country. Ministers in the United Kingdom are regularly seen driving their own cars while doing their own private work or attending private functions. The number of pilot cars that lead and follow a ministers white Ambassador has become the new status symbol. This can easily be curtailed and some money saved.        
	The finance minister should ask his office to look into these costs. There must be other similar items as well. These, he will find, are more easy to implement than asking a fat colleague to squeeze into an economy class seat in an aircraft. Austerity, like charity, must begin at home. The car at home might be a better place to start than the plane in the hangar.

                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	A new star                  
	Sir  Saina Nehwal deserves heartiest congratulations for winning the Indonesian Open Super Series tournament at Jakarta (Saina makes history, June 22). Her success will inspire other Indian girls to perform well. After the triumphs of Prakash Padukone and Pullela Gopichand at the All England Open Badminton Championship in 1980 and 2001 respectively, this is a major international title won by an Indian badminton player. The girl from Hyderabad defeated world numbers five and three, a commendable achievement for one ranked number eight in world badminton. Gopichand, Nehwals coach, has said that winning a Super Series is no less than winning a Grand Slam title in tennis. If Nehwal maintains this form, she will do well in the forthcoming World Cup on Indian turf. The Badminton Association of India has announced a prize of Rs 2 lakh to inspire her.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Indranil Sanyal, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Two of the shining stars in the firmament of Indian sports are Saina Nehwal and Sania Mirza. By a coincidence, their first names contain the same five letters of the alphabet. However, going by their performances, they seem poles apart. While the former has a number of feathers in her cap, the latter is yet to grab a singles crown  the Hyderabad championship victory four years ago being her only major achievement till date.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Vineet Phadtare, Mumbai 

                
	Sir  The Indian cricket team failed to defend the T20 title that they had won in 2007. However, the glorious victory of the badminton player, Saina Nehwal, has restored Indias lost prestige.           
	Exactly five decades ago, our cricket team lost all five tests in a series against England. That ignominy was obliterated by Arati Sahas feat of swimming across the English Channel. This was in 1959. The two achievements are separated by half a century.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Arun Malankar, Mumbai

                
	Sir  Badminton is a fast game that has all the makings of top-TRP spectator sports, and Saina Nehwals win against the best players at Jakarta has proven that the sport has become telegenic enough for us to cheer aloud and bite our nails while watching.           
	So hats off to Nehwal for a historic win in an edge-of-the-seat thriller, in which she defeated the higher-ranked Lin Wang, and became the first Indian to win a Super Series tournament. Nehwal came from behind to outsmart Wang, the world number three, and thus avenged her Singapore Open loss. Her triumph can be ranked as the best ever performance in badminton by an Indian woman, at par with the all England championship titles won by Padukone and Gopichand. Her victory is a milestone in Indian badminton. Nehwal has what it takes  physical fitness, sound technique and mental toughness  to become the world number one, although she still has a long way to go.           
	Yours faithfully.

	Reform not reserve          
	Sir  It is heartening that Kapil Sibal, the Union human resource development minister, is striving to stop dilution of standards in educational institutions that seems to have occurred by the introduction of quotas (Sibal salvo on faculty quota June 23). Reservation based on caste is not in the best interest of the backward classes.           
	There was resentment against the previous incumbent, Arjun Singh, who was in favour of reservations in elite academic institutions. He was ready to compromise the quality of education to keep himself afloat in the cabinet. Knowing well that only students above the average can clear the entrance examinations to the Indian institutes of technology and the Indian institutes of management, Singh was determined to open the door to quota-based selection of students and faculty.           
	Rather than doling out reservations, the government should create employment. Reservations do not help the really underprivileged backward classes because they lose out to the creamy layer. Our leaders have failed to provide quality education in government-run schools and colleges because of political intervention in educational matters. This has led to the mushrooming of private institutions.           
	B.R. Ambedkar had provided for reservations for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes in the Constitution. Now, after 60 years of independence, greedy politicians are expanding these quotas to create vote-bank politics that exploits casteism. Ambedkars mission to uplift the backward classes has failed, and only the creamy layers are deriving the benefits of reservations.           
	Sibal has rightly observed that primary and secondary education would be his priorities. He should prevent politicians from crippling institutions of higher education.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Subhankar Mukherjee, Borehat, Burdwan

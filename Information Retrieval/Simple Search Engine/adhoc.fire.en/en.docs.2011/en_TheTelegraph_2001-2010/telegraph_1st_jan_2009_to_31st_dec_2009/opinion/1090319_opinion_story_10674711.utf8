                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Wrong move                  
	Sir  The Congress has made a great mistake by entering into an electoral alliance with the Trinamul Congress (Deal with surrender tag, March 13). The TMC leader, Mamata Banerjee, has shown time and again that she is against development. Her party has been the main instrument in driving out the Nano project. Many other development projects have been hindered because of agitations by the TMC. The party has made people suffer with its road and rail blockades without any apparent need for such lawlessness.           
	I feel that Sonia Gandhi was so eager to teach the Left a lesson for its mindless withdrawal of support during the nuclear debate that the Congress agreed to a humiliating deal. I am not sure whether this agreement will succeed in ending Left rule in West Bengal. The Left has a very organized cadre base. A deal with a whimsical leader is not a sign of mature statesmanship, and this may cost the Congress dear in the future.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Mamata Banerjee has announced the list of TMC nominees contesting 27 Lok Sabha seats in West Bengal. She has allowed the Congress 14 seats, and given one to the Socialist Unity Centre of India.When Banerjee read out the names of the contesting candidates, she played the prelude to her electoral campaign. From that, it would seem that the themes of Nandigram, Singur and Tapasi Malik will drown the issue of agriculture versus industry. The partys aim would be to appeal to the sentiments of the people.           
	But one important aspect of the TMCs list is that it has fielded five women which is 18.5 per cent of the partys total seats. This exposes the Communist Party of India (Marxist)s discriminatory attitude towards gender, since it has nominated only three women at the national level. Of them, Rajjo Devi, is a contestant outside West Bengal, a CPI(M) candidate in Uttar Pradesh.           
	The TMC has eight scheduled caste and scheduled tribe candidates (31 per cent) to represent the underprivileged of Bengal. The CPI(M), however, just about matches the TMCs percentage of SC/ST candidates within the state in spite of its larger number of seats, and has a lower percentage of SC/ST candidates at the national level. So the CPI(M), a party that advertises the fact that it is fighting for the downtrodden, has failed to accommodate the poor proportionately among its candidates. Besides, in the representation of the minority community, the TMC seems to have done a better job than the Left parties. Even at the national level, it does not look as if the CPI(M) means to promote secularism. That has certainly not been reflected in the making of the nomination list. Gujarat, the field of past communal carnage, could have been an instrument in the hands of the Left to campaign against Hindutva and against the Bharatiya Janata Party. Yet, the nomination list suggests that the Left has lost its way here. If it fails to put up a fight in a symbolic contest, its promise to defeat communal forces is scarcely credible. The publication of the nomination list of the anti-Left squad in West Bengal shows that the TMC has defeated the CPI(M) in at least one battle already by trying to give substantial representation to different segments of society.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  To take revenge for the withdrawal of Left support, the Congress has made an alliance with Mamata Banerjee by surrendering to her. But, for that, it is actually she who should be grateful to the Congress. I hope Banerjee makes mature, not whimsical, decisions to pay off this debt should a Congress government come into being.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Sudarsan Nandi, Midnapore 

                
	Sir  The news that the TMC and the Congress are coming together to fight the red brigade in Bengal is welcome. The CPI(M) cadre have been attacking members of Opposition parties, whether the Congress, or the TMC, or the BJP, for the last 30 years. If the outcome of this new alliance is positive, then Bengal may see better days.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  The governor of West Bengal initiated the singing of the national anthem when the sound system failed in the assembly (Governor turns lead singer in Assembly, March 10). Is the government at all serious about efficiency? No one is penalized for such failures; government employees have their unions to protect them, while political alignment protects others. The culture of non-accountability has permeated all fields of work in West Bengal.          
	Yours faithfully,      
S.K. Roy, Calcutta

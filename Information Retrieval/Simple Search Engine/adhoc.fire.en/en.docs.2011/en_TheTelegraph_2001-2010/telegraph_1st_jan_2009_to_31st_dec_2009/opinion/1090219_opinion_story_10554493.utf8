The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Never again
                                                                                                                 NEVER AGAIN                                                    
	Hugo Chvez has done it again  the 15th time in 10 years  and done it better than all previous times when the nation was called to vote by him. The referendum on February 15 asked Venezuelans to judge, on the basis of what Mr Chvez has done for them in the past decade, whether they would require him for the rest of their lives. They were being asked to reconsider their judgment of 2007, when they had rejected, in a similar referendum, the move to amend the constitution so that the term limit on Mr Chvezs presidency could be removed for ever. This time, they changed their minds. It could be because of the persuasiveness of the massive, State-organized Vote Si campaign, or the failure of the opposition to put up anyone to match Mr Chvezs larger-than-life image or the saleability of Mr Chvezs Bolivarian dream. But by saying yes to him, Venezuelans have ensured that their president got his chance to achieve a personal coup while keeping the faade of a participatory democracy intact.         
	The people, of course, still continue to hold the right to boot out Mr Chvez at any point between 2012 and 2049, the year he has reportedly hinted he would step down. But given the monopolistic hold of the Chavistas on power, it is unlikely to happen any time soon. The referendum over, Venezuelans may, in fact, find a sharp drop in Mr Chvezs enthusiasm for elections. With the diminishing weight of petro-dollars in these times of recession, increasing inflation and spiralling crime rate, free healthcare and education may not be enough to hold back the frustrations of a restive population. The Chavistas have already lost control of the prosperous, resource-rich provinces and major metropolitan areas because of the presidents lack of interest in urban reform and his unwillingness to look at the long-term consequences of measures like price control. More social reform, termed misiones, may not be able to reverse this trend if complacence, now inevitable, takes over the regime.

                                                                                                                 NO MIDDLE WAY                                                    
	Not just socialism, but all things in China are supposed to have Chinese characteristics. What happened in Tibet on March 28 could thus be described as an anniversary celebration with Chinese characteristics. The local government in Lhasa decided, for the first time, to celebrate the day as Serf Liberation Day. It was a rare kind of celebration which saw security tightened in different parts of Tibet, dissidents put behind bars and foreigners barred from visiting the area. But the ultimate irony was the Chinese claim that the cause of human rights has made remarkable progress. It is easy to understand why the Chinese are taking great pains this year to create their own myth about present-day Tibet. Last month marked the 50th anniversary of the Tibetan uprising against communist rule. Also, the riots and the brutal crackdown on dissidents in March last year proved that the communist rule in Tibet remains as unpopular as ever. These also exposed the Chinese governments sense of insecurity over the issue of Tibet.         
	However, even the Chinese government knows there is no Tibetan story without the Dalai Lama. Incidentally, the 50th anniversary of his escape from Tibet fell three days after the Chinese celebration of Serf Liberation Day. And the real story of these 50 years is that they saw no changes in Chinas policy in Tibet. None of the issues the Dalai Lama has raised over the years  real autonomy for the region, human rights and religious or other freedoms for Tibetans  has been seriously addressed by the Chinese. All the seemingly interminable rounds of talks between Beijing and the Dalai Lamas representatives have been part of the formers strategy of reacting to international pressure. If anything, these talks have made it clear that China has no intention of accepting any of the Dalai Lamas ideas. On his part, the Dalai Lama has once again shown his commitment to peace and non-violence by sticking to his Middle Way. What he said at a meeting in New Delhi should nail the Chinese lie that he was fomenting violence in Tibet or planning a militant solution to the Tibetan problem. His commitment to peace should help prepare the stage for the next round of talks between his envoys and Beijing. But then, the Chinese set no great value on ideals like non-violence. No wonder that violence by the State continues to be the basis of Chinese rule in Tibet.

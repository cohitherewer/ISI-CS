	Some of the countrys most intelligent young men and women have gone beyond the limits of educated restraint to protest against the conditions in which they have been living and, in this case, dying. It would be foolish and sinister to deal with this protest as a law-and-order problem. This is how both the Indian Institute of Technology in Kharagpur and the Central ministry for human resource development have chosen to address publicly the death of the third-year engineering student, Rohit Kumar. The institute has now officially denied responsibility for Kumars death, declaring that he died of delayed treatment rather than negligence  a distinction that would leave most thinking people unpleasantly baffled. The ministry is concerned about law and order on campus, finding itself with nothing to say, or feel, about the reasons behind the disruption of law and order in IIT, Kharagpur. Yet even the dubious legalism of the delay but not neglect point made by the authorities does not absolve them from responsibility for the accident. So, making defensive and placatory promises to the students without making corresponding changes in attitude and administration would be the least humane way of dealing with the situation.        
	The pride that the nation takes in the excellence maintained in such institutions seems to rest on a bizarre privileging of mind over body. The students are provided with the best pedagogy and related infrastructure, while their basic, bodily health, comfort and nutrition are unthinkingly neglected. The rooms are small and under-furnished, the hostel food is appalling and, as Kumars death proves, emergency healthcare (anything that requires more than first-aid by way of investigation and treatment) is dangerously inadequate. This combination of mismanagement and irresponsibility is covered up with a philosophy of plain living and high thinking that knowingly deprives students of the entitlements and amenities that they are paying for through their noses. As one student puts it, it is the norm to be unhappy about the system, yet somehow have great faith in the institution: Kumars friends never heard him cribbing about the system. This suits the authorities as well as the State. The pressure should be kept on both, without disrupting law and order, so that the system does not become the norm.

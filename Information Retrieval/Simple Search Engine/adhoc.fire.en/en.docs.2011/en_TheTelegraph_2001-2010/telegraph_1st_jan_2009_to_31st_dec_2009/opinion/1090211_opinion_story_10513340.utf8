                                                                                                                 ODD BALANCE                                                    
	The attempt to correct a historical imbalance always sounds noble, especially when it is a matter of higher pay. A central technical education pay review panel has recommended to the government that teachers in the Indian institutes of technology and Indian institutes of management should get a raise in salary  generous by any standard  as well as perquisites, so as to match the salaries offered by the private sector. This is intended to stop the best teachers from becoming corporate bosses. But it is the other part of the historical imbalance being righted that is more significant. Teachers in IITs and IIMs already get higher scales than those set by the University Grants Commission. But teachers in university engineering colleges and national institutes of technology had been tied down to UGC scales. Now, they too will be given higher pay, although not quite as high as teachers in IITs and IIMs. This is excellent news; teachers getting better pay always is.        
	But whenever historic imbalances are addressed  as in the case of underprivileged castes  the driving principle is discrimination. The Indian establishment has gradually privileged teachers and students of technology and management over those of the pure sciences and humanities. Without in any way taking away from the value of technology and the applied sciences and of research in them, it has to be asked whether true advance and understanding are possible without an equally rich base of pure science and humanities. The prime minister recently promised a scholarship of Rs 80,000 a year for students selected from the pure science streams in colleges and universities. This could wean brilliant brains away from the technological or applied streams. Yet, the new recommendations contradict the principle behind the prime ministers promise. And that promise, too, did not suggest that college and university teachers of pure science would be paid better. Common sense says that the best young brains would be lured into pure science not just by money, but also by the best teachers. Somehow, universities no longer figure in new Indias horizons of learning. They have slowly been reduced to degree-giving outlets by being deprived of the resources to conduct research while support is directed towards specialist institutes. It seems that Indian policymakers will be truly satisfied only when India becomes a nation of techno-coolies.

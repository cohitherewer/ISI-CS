The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | a hard knock
                                                                                                                 A HARD KNOCK                                                    
	An alarming number of schools in West Bengal seems to be unaware of the judicial ban on corporal punishment. This is what outraged Tapas Bhanja into filing a public interest litigation alleging the governments failure to enforce the ban. His PIL also follows the death of 11-year-old Babli Ghosh in the Burdwan district allegedly after being hit by her teacher with a duster. The child was being punished for having failed to memorize a poem; she had been unable to buy the book from which the poem had been set by the teacher. This teacher seems to have disappeared from the scene, and neither the police nor the school authorities have been able to find her. Like every other instance of a child being punished fatally, this incident too is on its way to dying a natural death after a brief ripple in the media and in the courts. It is as if a modern legal system, articulated in terms of an equally modern language of childrens rights, is struggling in vain against a tradition that is still taken as natural not only by society but also, for all practical purposes, by the State.        
	In a society where inequality, and therefore the abuse of power, remain unquestioned norms, children, especially poor children, are doubly the victims. Their powerlessness and their silence make them the perfect objects of adult pathologies of power, their physical vulnerability placing them outside the realm of the political and hence, in the realm of the natural. So their relationships with their teachers in school, as at home, must remain outside the purview of the State and of the law, immutably decided by their nurturers and well-wishers through the age-old dictates of common sense. And common sense does have something ancient and wise to say about children and the rod. A societys cherished notions of childhood always provide a revealing point of entry into its most adult attitudes and fantasies. Sex, work and violence are the three inevitabilities of the adult world from which children have to be protected for them to be perceived as children. Yet, it is precisely these three aspects of adult life that find their most brutal, but most invisible, forms in the lives of children in the adult world. The stakes are high though  the sanctity of the family, and an economy founded on cheap labour that absolves both society and State of hard responsibilities.

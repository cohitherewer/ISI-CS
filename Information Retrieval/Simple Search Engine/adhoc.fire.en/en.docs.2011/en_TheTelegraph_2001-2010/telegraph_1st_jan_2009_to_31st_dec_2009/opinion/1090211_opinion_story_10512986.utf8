	Not quite slumming it                  
	Sir  Amidst all the warped criticism of Slumdog Millionaire, what provides some relief is Danny Boyles promise that he would donate a significant portion of the box-office profits to the Mumbai slums that were part of the films setting (Slumdog millions for little stars, Jan 31). Boyle even added that the investors would meet in London to discuss how best to distribute the funds. The money would be paid to the children in the Mumbai slums to help them complete their studies.          
	This should also silence the critics who have been complaining that a Western director and his crew have exploited the child actors from the slums as well as the other Indian actors. The film may be full of stereotypes, but even then, the fact that it has won four Golden Globes tells its own tale of success. Boyles resolute decision to ignore the demand of some people to send the underprivileged children back to their villages, thereby depriving them of the opportunities for future development, deserves applause. Tateshwar Vishwakarmas call for burning Boyles effigies in protest is in poor taste. Why is it hurting people that Boyle has shown the miseries of Indian society? Are slums not a reality in Indian metros? Dominique Lapierres City of Joy, made into a film by Roland Joff, infuriated Calcuttans because the film allegedly tried to demean the great city of charmingly confused contradictions. But Boyle uses the Mumbai slums as a backdrop partly to draw the worlds attention to them, and thus contributes to their improvement. This is the difference between Lapierre and Boyle, and it is unfair to misinterpret this difference in perspective.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Mumbai is always in the news for right or wrong reasons. This mayanagari is an integral part of the urban Indian lifestyle; in it, millions live out their dreams or doom by the shores of the Arabian Sea. After 26/11, the city came into the limelight again through Danny Boyles Slumdog Millionaire. The film has already won the Golden Globe and Bafta awards, along with bagging 10 Oscar nominations. It is faring well at box offices worldwide. However, critics in India have taken the film as just a mediocre work exploiting the Indian unprivileged and unduly celebrated by Western audiences. It is not necessary to sell only the success stories of the Indian IT firms, shopping malls, and Bollywood song and dance to the West. A majority of Indians lives below the poverty line. Asias biggest slum, Dharavi, is in Mumbai. To ignore or hide this face of India will mean ignoring reality. The projection of the emerging Indian economy to global audiences through its slums is painful, but not acknowledging its darker aspects is also a weakness. This film should be an impetus for administrative bodies and NGOs to make constructive efforts to bring about changes for ensuring a dignified life for the poor.

	Sir  Amitabh Bachchan is being criticized in the media for the negative entry on Slumdog Millionaire in his blog. But it is a fact that the film is now being lauded by the media and the common people because it has won international awards and nominations. Had it been otherwise, I wonder if the film would have been liked so much. Most regional productions or low-budget films lie ignored and forgotten because they do not make it to the international competitions. Why are we still dependent on the West to decide whether we are going to like an Indian film?                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Many Indian citizens, as well as the millionaires among them, have lots to say about Slumdog Millionaire. But have they ever wondered why slums are still a reality for many in the country? It is not only the unequal distribution of wealth but also the conspicuous consumption of the affluent classes that make the disparities between the rich and the poor starker. Cant film stars like Amitabh Bachchan and cricketers like Sachin Tendulkar, who can splurge millions on homes and cars and have spent their best years in Mumbai, help the slum-dwellers of the city? I found it vulgar that Shilpa Shetty and her boyfriend spent about 15 million dollars on a cricket franchise, and that millions of dollars were spent at the recent IPL auction in Goa for selecting the teams.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The Indian media have showered praise on Slumdog Millionaire. Danny Boyle only mocks India for the pleasure of first world audiences. The British director misrepresents India, like his colonial predecessors in the country. Since the director is from the West, were all cheering the emperors new clothes. The noted Bollywood filmmaker, Sanjay Gupta, could not get the adaptation rights for Vikas Swarups Q amp;A because it was snatched away by Boyle who paid a heftier sum to the novelist. True, Boyles film has given Swarup an international recognition, but at the cost of Indias prestige. Western authors and directors forget that even the most developed nations have poverty and corruption. Even the title of the film proves Boyles mindset. He has shown Indias ugly aspects based on distorted facts so that they sell well in the West and win its awards. The Indian film, Lagaan, stood nowhere at the Oscars. Taare Zameen Par couldnt even make it to the final round of the Oscars.

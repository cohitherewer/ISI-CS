	In Jammu and Kashmir, it is the tail that seems to be wagging the dog. There is little doubt that the agitations in Baramulla have forced the chief minister, Omar Abdullah, to order the Central Reserve Police Force back to the barracks. This is the second such order after 30 companies of the force were moved out of Srinagar in February. Both orders may be construed as part of Mr Abdullahs larger plan to demilitarize the state and leave controls in the hands of the state police, who are to induct more locals and get more sensitized. Given that the massive deployment of the paramilitary forces had taken place in an emergency (the Amarnath crisis), their withdrawal after the return of normalcy is only expected. However, the spectre of the popular agitation driving the policy suggests a picture, not of a responsive government that Mr Abdullah has been trying to project, but of a weak government wilting under pressure. The Abdullah administrations bad reflexes ever since the Shopian tragedy created such an impression. It was only when public anger had spilled into the streets that the police registered a case for the death of the two women in Shopian, and even before the forensic reports had been submitted, the chief minister concluded that it was a case of drowning. A judicial commission to inquire into the incident was ordered after widespread violence forced the hand of the government. This was also how the government was forced into its decision to withdraw the CRPF.        
	The problem with such on-the-edge politics is that it forces a change to happen earlier than expected or advised. If the withdrawal of the CRPF takes place too fast (and Mr Abdullah seems to have committed himself to that), it will leave a massive hole in the states security apparatus. The state police still do not have the manpower to handle the situation and will continue to depend on the paramilitary for a while. There is another sting in the tail. The people, whose anger Mr Abdullah is so desperate to quell, are unlikely to be pacified by cosmetic changes, for they believe that the police are as bad as the armed forces. They need to be assured of justice, peace in the long run and, of course, freedom from the military boot. But none of this can be guaranteed if the government loses sight of its larger goals in order to tackle an exigency.

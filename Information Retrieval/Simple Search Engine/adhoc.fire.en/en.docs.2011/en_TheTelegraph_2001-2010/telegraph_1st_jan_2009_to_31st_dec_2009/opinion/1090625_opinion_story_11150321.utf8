The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Realitys house of mirrors
                                                                                                                 REALITYS HOUSE OF MIRRORS                                  Victories and defeats in reality shows are sometimes real and sometimes manipulated. Is that what is truly lifelike about reality television?                                             
	All the worlds a stage  Shakespeare once wrote. Today, he may have wanted to change the word stage to reality show, had he watched Prashant Tamang win in the music reality show, Indian Idol 3, two years back. Tamang, an unknown police constable, became quite a known face overnight after he won the show through an enormous number of audience votes in his favour. But his victory had other, more far-reaching, consequences. A campaign launched to help him win the competition later became the cradle for the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha. Not a play, not a film, but a television reality show, gave birth to a socio-political movement.         
	Was the victory a result of a strong provincial sentiment? Tamang, who is originally from Darjeeling, had been publicly backed by the GJM president, Bimal Gurung, along with a large part of the Gorkha community. Kapil Thapa from Dehradun, a contestant of the same show a year later, was also backed by the GJM. So, was that show being manipulated by a political sentiment? Perhaps not, as Indian Idol 4 was won, not by Thapa, but by Sourabhee Debbarma. This time, it seems, support for womens liberation won over provinciality as Debbarma became the first woman Indian Idol. Again, Shilpa Shetty won Big Brother as an Asian being victimized by racism. Then Poonam Jadav, the Sa Re Ga Ma Pa contestant, who came with a below the poverty line tag, seemed to earn the sympathy of the audience with her social status.         
	Reality shows very frequently have contestants who embody a popular social sentiment. It may not be entirely wrong to suggest that these contestants are chosen very consciously by the television channels. At least, Rupankar Sarkar, a retired bank officer who takes a keen interest in reality shows, thinks so. My gut feeling is that the curricula vitae of the contestants are closely scanned to elicit some positive or negative aspects which are likely to prompt a huge number of SMS votes, he said. If this ploy fails, plan B is generally a mild or severe rebuke by a judge after a seemingly good performance that helps evoke a huge wave of sympathy  and votes  in favour of the contestant, according to Sarkar. Each three-rupee SMS would contribute to a turnover in millions  a fact that the sponsors of these shows keep in mind.        
	How real are these reality shows, then? Adris Biswas, a professor and a researcher in popular literature, said that reality shows portray the ideal, rather than the real. According to him, what the audience wants to see is a dream-come-true situation, in which it can identify itself with the winner of the show. A marginal identity is mostly necessary, Biswas said, to make a contestant popular, as the audience sees in his victory a remedy of its own deprivations.         
	But the well-known musician and actor, Silajit, who has also judged quite a few reality shows, puts forth a different angle. According to him, within the boundaries of a reality show exists a capsular form of society. Victories and defeats in these shows are sometimes manipulated and sometimes real  which is also the case in society, where a performer, in order to gain a platform, may explore both his talent and his connections. But victory in these cases may be momentary, and keeping the audience interested afterwards is a different ball game altogether, Silajit said. The real question is, where is the reality show going? What other realities are going to be shown on television? he wondered.        
	Following the logic of his remarks, one may ponder whether news itself may be packaged into a reality show one day, in which wars and riots will become sponsored events. The reality of the television screen is limited to the frame of the camera. But what the frame shows us often becomes our social, political and even personal reality, such is our unquestioning submission.                    ADHEESHA SARKAR

	Queen of epic and romance      
	In search of Sita: Revisiting mythology (Penguin, Rs 399) edited by Malashri Lal and Namita Gokhale is a stimulating collection of critical, creative and conversational pieces that review and reframe one of the enduring archetypes of Indian womanhood. From the Ramayana, in its many versions, to television soaps, Sita, as the heroine at once of the epical and the kitsch, revisits us oftener than we do her. And she is paradox personified, symbolizing strength as much as vulnerability. The contributions fall under four heads: Commentary, In Dialogue, Versions and Creative Interpretations. All in all, the book goads the reader on to make sense of the scene.                  
	Dialogues to remember: Subhoranjan Dasgupta speaks with four Nobel laureates (Dasgupta and Co, Rs 55) brings conveniently together the interviews Dasgupta took of Amartya Sen, Willy Brandt, Gunter Grass and William Golding. Asked how far he has been able to impress upon governments his insights about fighting famine and starvation, Sen replies, I dont think I can claim much success. Sen favours technology when used in a sensible way. Willy Brandt feels some developing countries have mistakenly devoted more energy to technology to the neglect of agriculture. Grass tells how a Gautam Ghosh film made him realize the loss of reality in our contemporary creativity. Disturbed by its sea of raging poverty, Calcutta, he says, has changed him radically. He, too, is sceptical of technological advance per se. Golding, who was writing at the time of the ultimate evilof the Holocaust yet sees room for hope and refuses to be shocked by the human condition. The thread that connects the observations of two novelists, an economist and a statesman is the common question of human suffering.                        
	Does God have favourites? And other heart-to-heart talks (Sterling, Rs 125) by J.P. Vaswani claims to have captured in print the amrit dhara of salvation for the benefit of readers who are unable to attend satsang owing to lack of time. Do not go away thirsty and parched from the ocean of bliss!, Sadhu Vaswanis immortal words exhort the reader. If youre a modern man, or woman, in search of a soul, then this could just be your salvific syrop.                                
	Exploration in Tagore Translation (K.P. Bagchi and Co, Rs 450) by Swati Datta undertakes to study the various translations of Tagores short stories from Bengali to English, and the many questions they raise about translation as a cultural project. Promising to provide a holistic view of the subject, the book confines its scope to the translations of the stories from Galpaguchchha and Tin Sangi. Brought up outside Bengal, Datta read Tagores stories in English translation before going on to read them in the original Bengali. This, the author believes, far from being a disadvantage actually facilitated her appreciation of the value of translation as a medium of cultural exchange. It is interesting to know that the first translator of Tagores stories into English was Sister Nivedita, and it was a translation of The Postmaster that attracted William Rothenstein to Tagore. One of Rothensteins acquaintances was W.B. Yeats. But before the Gitanjali attracted Yeatss attention, which resulted in the Nobel prize, it was The Modern Review that made the Anglophone world take notice of Tagore. It is difficult to say that Datta breaks much new critical ground, but her comparative survey of the literature makes the book useful as a reference for the scholar. A list of Tagore stories published in English translation between 1901-2001 adds to the books utility.

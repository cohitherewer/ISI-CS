	Morally sound        
	 An employee working in a company oversaw the maintenance of records relating to cylinders. He was dismissed from service when discrepancies were detected in the records. But the order of dismissal was challenged and it was finally upheld by the Supreme Court. As a result of the dismissal, his gratuity had also been forfeited on the grounds that his offence had involved moral turpitude. The employee challenged the order contending that neither was he guilty of moral turpitude as the act had not caused any loss to the company, nor had a criminal case been registered against him. The Madras High Court held that though he had been found guilty of manipulating records, the act could not be said to involve moral turpitude. It directed the employer to disburse his gratuity. (A.

	Strike unjust        
	 Seven workmen in a hospital were dismissed from service on charges of going on an illegal strike and preventing patients and employees from entering the hospital. The labour court held that the strike was unjustified, but added that since there had been no untoward incident, the punishment of dismissal was disproportionate. The Karnataka High Court held that a strike in a hospital could not be treated on a par with one in a factory. Since the seven workmen not only went on a strike but also coerced other employees to participate in it, the labour courts directive to modify the order of dismissal was unjustified, the court ruled.

	More than cosmetic        
	 The central excise authorities imposed a high rate of duty on products such as bio-aloe vera and bio-cucumber as it treated them as cosmetics and not as Ayurvedic products. But the Central Excise Tribunal ruled that many of these products were medicines and not cosmetics. The central excise authorities appealed, stating that the products were, in fact, cosmetic rather than medicinal. Dismissing the appeal, the Supreme Court held that the use of a product as a cosmetic did not mean that it was one. If a product contained medicinal properties, it had to be treated as such.

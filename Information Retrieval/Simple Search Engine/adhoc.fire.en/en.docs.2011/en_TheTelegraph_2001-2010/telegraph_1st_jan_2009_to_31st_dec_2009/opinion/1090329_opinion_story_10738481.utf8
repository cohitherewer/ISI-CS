The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | futility of violence
                                                                                                                 FUTILITY OF VIOLENCE                                                          
	A terrorist by any other name will be as violent. Indeed, violence is the birthmark of a terrorist whose chosen task is to kill as many people as he can to get as much publicity as possible for his cause. There is a kind of blindness in the way a terrorist acts. This blindness is manifest in his faith and in his certainty. The presumed nobility of the cause cannot take away from the violence and blindness a terrorist embodies and exemplifies. This is where a religious fanatic and a terrorist come together and the Gujarat high court has made a valid point by pointing out that religious fanatics are no better than terrorists. A religious fanatic sees no virtue in any religion save his own. He is thus blind. He also believes that religious differences can be eradicated by obliterating other religions and their believers. Violence is the religious fanatics handmaiden. It surprises nobody that most terrorists in todays world are also religious fanatics.        
	Terrorism and violence can also be born of secular causes. Take the example of men and women who take to arms to draw attention to their struggle for freedom: liberation from oppression or independence from foreign rule. The Irish Republican Army, various extremists like the Decembrists in Tsarist Russia, and the young men and women in India who took up the bomb and the pistol for the sake of Indias freedom. The intention of all these people and groups was to strike terror and grab attention for their chosen cause. A bomb planted in a departmental store in London would not directly free Northern Ireland, but it would, by claiming innocent lives, make the British government take note and also make the common people think about the Irish problem. Similarly, the liquidation of a Tsarist minister or even the Tsar himself or of a British police commissioner was not intended to shake the foundations of either the Russian or the British empire. But it could strike terror among the officials. It has become the conventional wisdom in India and elsewhere to praise such acts for their bravery and to hail the perpetrators as martyrs. The matter may not be so simple. Violent acts are inherently vacuous. They never achieve anything. Moreover, there is the danger of adopting double standards of condemning one type of violence and praising another. It cannot be denied that todays terrorists also believe that they are fighting and dying for a cause.        
	Any act that takes the lives of innocent people for whatever cause, secular or religious, noble or ignoble, demands a certain ruthlessness. It requires turning a blind eye to the loss of lives and the consequences that ensue. This is equally true of States that use terror to gain political ends. There is good reason to ponder the consequences of using violence to solve problems. Blindness cannot lead to insight.

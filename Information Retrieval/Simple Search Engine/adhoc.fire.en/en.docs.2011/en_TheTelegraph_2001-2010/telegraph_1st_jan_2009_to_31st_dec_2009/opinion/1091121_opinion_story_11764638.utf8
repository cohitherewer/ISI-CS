The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Never on a Sunday
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        NEVER ON A SUNDAY                                  VISUAL ARTS - Aveek Sen                          Nilanjan Ray, Tragedy of the Statues, 2008                                        
	Photography is difficult, precisely because it is easy. With a mobile phone and something to focus on, photographs can be made instantly by anybody. Our everyday lives are flooded with them  from the moment we look at the papers in the morning until that late hour when we are ushered out of a multiplex after the night show by beautiful people in their backlit boxes, miraculously untouched by human fatigue. The gadgetry takes little time to master and there is always something arresting to look at. So, one may ask, Whats the big deal?        
	Its no big deal, except that there is that peculiar thing called Art, which photography is increasingly expected to be. Naturally adapted to the worlds of commerce, information, leisure and domesticity, none of which need have anything to do with Art, photography could have merrily remained mindless, sexy or sensational if gallerists, collectors, curators, publishers, artlovers and critics had not started demanding something more from it, and if photography itself had not started acquiring a mind of its own, getting listless and jaded with the seductive surface of things.        
	Faced with this demand, the easiest thing to do is to make large and expensive prints on archival paper, limit the editions, use classy frames, hang them in a gallery, print a catalogue and price list  and lo, it is Art!        
	But is it? Looking at the work of the five photographers brought together by Christopher Taylor in Home and the Street (Studio 21, until today), I was struck by how innocent all the photographers seemed to be of the contemporary anxiety regarding the status of photography as Art  an anxiety that has pushed photography into richly diverse creative and discursive fields, taking it well beyond journalism, family photography and advertising with varying degrees of success. I was also struck by how similar the pictures by the five photographers  Sumit Basu, Jayanta Saha, Kushal Ray, Nilanjan Ray and Saibal Das  looked to one another. If they had not been captioned, I would have taken them all to be the work of a single photographer, made in the Forties and Fifties (stretching sometimes into the early Sixties). All of them seem to have been made under the influence of Henri Cartier-Bresson (and, to a lesser extent, of Walker Evans and Diane Arbus), of Raghubir Singh and Raghu Rai, and of the Family of Man show of the mid-Fifties, curated by Edward Steichen, that had travelled all over the world and come to India too.        
	It is not just the Fifties black-and-white look that unifies these five photographers. But their subject matter, angles, perspectives, visual effects and other tricks of sight, together with their feeling-world and cultural references, are all part of one happy family of charming and well-intentioned Sunday photography practised, like philately or gardening, in the interstices of another profession. So it comes as a bit of a shock to discover that these are five different pairs of eyes, and five different minds, all showing work made in the last few years. When the internet and freer global commerce, if not actual travel, make it perfectly possible to be aware of the directions in which serious work in ones chosen medium is going, and what kinds of thinking, discussion and debate are animating it currently, such naivet and lack of exposure are truly remarkable. It is like a 21st-century painter being so stuck in his veneration of Nandalal, Abanindranath and Ramkinkar that he continues to depict Santhal women, blind bauls, Rabindranath, goats and the khoai all his life without being aware of Ganesh Pyne and Bhupen Khakhar, let alone Jackson Pollock and Louise Bourgeois. There is a way of avoiding both provincialism and trendiness in creative practice, which is the rigorous, intellectually engaged, endlessly evolving inner life of Art, and there is no reason why photography, amateur or professional, should be let off from being subjected to these aesthetic and intellectual standards if it wants to be taken seriously.         
	For this to happen, the photographer must, as it were, leave home and venture out beyond the street, not just in the direction of North Calcutta or Varanasi, but into the world. More crucially, he must journey into his own mind, and into the work of others who set out on similar journeys with literature, cinema, music and the other visual arts. Revolutions in art come from concerns that are outside and beyond art, John Szarkowski, director of photography at New Yorks Museum of Modern Art from 1962 to 1991, said to teachers of photography in 1962, New art comes from the fact of tradition meeting and mingling with the fact of a new life experience, not merely the re-shuffling of achieved solutions.

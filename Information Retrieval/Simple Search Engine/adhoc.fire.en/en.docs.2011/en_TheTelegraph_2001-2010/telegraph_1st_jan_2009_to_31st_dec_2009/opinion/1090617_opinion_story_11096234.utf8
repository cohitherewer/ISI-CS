	Bill at ransom                  
	Sir  The only method of ensuring 33 per cent seats in the parliament for women is to reserve as many constituencies all over the country. This will, however, not ensure the election of the right candidate to represent those constituencies. Every political party will be constrained to put up a female candidate in spite of having an abler male candidate. Perhaps, this will not do justice to the electorate. I agree with a section of the members of parliament that a party-level ticket reservation for women should be evolved, to start with, from civic bodies and panchayats to the state legislature. This will ensure the empowerment of women at the grassroot level and thereafter they will be expected to reach the parliament on their own standing. I am firmly of the opinion that a day will not be far when there will be a sizeable number of female MPs exceeding the 33 per cent limit. The nation will see more Sonia Gandhis, Mamata Banerjees, Sushma Swarajs, Jayalalithaas and Mayavatis, and not face the ugly drama enacted in the parliament by some vehement opposers every time the bill is tabled.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Prabhakar Bhattacharya, Ichapore, North 24 Parganas              
	Sir  Sharad Yadav wants the womens reservation bill to be amended to provide for a quota for women belonging to the SCs, STs, OBCs and minorities (JD-U asks Sharad Yadav to loosen up, June 9). His further demand to the Centre is to adopt the Bihar model, which has successfully implemented 50 per cent reservation for women in local bodies by making provisions for these categories. If the bill should really mirror Indian society then the SCs and OBCs should be further classified into A, B, C and D, as it is in the Andhra Pradesh model. This will ensure equality to, and adequate representation of, all the downtrodden sub-classes.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Padmini Raghavendra, Secunderabad              
	Sir  Mulayam Singh Yadavs demand for a male-dominated political system was highly unreasonable, as if it is a male monopoly to rule. If the womens reservation bill could bring an end to regional parties, as is feared by Lalu Prasad, then it would be in favour of a healthy democracy where the politics would revolve ideally around two or three big parties. Personality-based regional parties are run like family businesses by their bosses. Moreover, increasing the strength of the Lok Sabha by about one-third in order to accommodate women is senseless. How far is it justified to burden the public exchequer just to retain the employment of the male politicians, who fear they would be out of jobs because of the women replacing them in the parliament? Legislatures should not be made employment opportunities for politicians. The apex court should intervene if the parliament, by adding more MPs, misuses the tax-payers hard-earned money for the interest of the politicians. The Election Commissions suggestion of a party-level ticket-quota should be accepted, to end all controversies.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  All sorts of weak-minded people have become politicians, and hold the highest and most important posts of public interest. Many have succeeded in their lives without reservations, so do Indian citizens really need reservations? The word, reservation, must be deleted with an appropriate amendment in the Constitution itself. But these politicians have no common sense, and they have a narrow vision of Indias future.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Mahesh Kumar, New Delhi

                
	Sir  The presidents comments on the womens bill in her address to the Lok Sabha were resented by some of the political parties. They voiced their fear, anticipating their doomed careers if the legislation came into force. Lalu Prasad seems to have forgotten that he had once made his wife a chief minister and now comes closer to Mulayam Singh Yadavs policy of pandering to the minority community. A leader like Sharad Yadav, in vowing to take poison if the bill is passed, is talking in a spirit of vengeance. This anti-women lobby ends up endorsing a society where forms of gender abuse like female foeticide and dowry deaths continue to disempower women.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Soma Biswas, Durgapur

                
	Sir  Mulayam Singh Yadavs opposition to the womens bill hides his true intention. It is not going to help increase the representation of women of minority communities and backward castes as opposed to that of the baal-kati auratein (women with bobbed hair). He is afraid that with the passage of this bill some of the seats will be reserved for women rotationally, as it is in the case of the SCs and STs. Those like him have a support-base in only a few constituencies. Each of these leaders has developed one or two of the constituencies (according to their caste or religion) from where they have been elected repeatedly. It may so happen that these constituencies may be reserved for women forcing them to shift elsewhere, where there may be no guarantee of success.          
	Yours faithfully,

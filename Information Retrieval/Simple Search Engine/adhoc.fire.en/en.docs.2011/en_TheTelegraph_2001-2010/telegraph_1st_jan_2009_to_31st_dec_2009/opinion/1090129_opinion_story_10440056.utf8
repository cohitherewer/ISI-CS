	Common ground                  
	Sir  After reading Githa Hariharans article, In the name of patriotism (Jan 25), I am tempted to ponder the difference between a terrorist and a patriot. Under what category, for instance, would we place historical figures like Bhagat Singh or Kshudiram Bose, or closer time, Vellupillai Prabhakaran, Abdullah calan, Shamil Basayev, and Hashim Thai? To some they are terrorists, while others consider them to be great patriots. An interesting parallel, in this regard, is Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose. Successive governments in New Delhi, since Independence, have tried to play down his patriotism and highlight that of Jawaharlal Nehru, M.K. Gandhi and others. This is a clear case of politics overriding fair play that Hariharan talks about towards the end of her piece.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Jayanta Kumar Dutt, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Githa Hariharans article on patriotism reminded me of George Bernard Shaws famous words: Patriotism is your conviction that this country is superior to all other countries because you were born in it. Patriotism has no substance, everyone mistakenly believes that his country is the best.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  An entire generation can be inspired to patriotism by the powerful words of a poet. A poet can move his nation to become part of a revolution and bring about social good. At the same time, he can also point out the horrors of war. The role of a scientist, on the other hand, is different. He is committed to invent something that enhances public good and broadens the field of knowledge. So, a scientist has a greater responsibility than a poet. Whatever he achieves is meant for the benefit of all nations, not just of his own country, because scientific progress cannot be limited to people of any one nationality. A scientist should not tolerate or support any move by his countrys leaders to stir patriotic sentiments in the people. He must not be reckless like Fritz Haber, who transferred dangerous knowhow on to the hands of irresponsible politicians in order to be the good patriot. Scientists must be pacifist, committed internationalists and revolutionaries resolved only to usher in positive change.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Pranab Hazra, Asansol

                
	As real as it gets          
	Sir  The Delhi High Court has stood up for artistic freedom by quashing the ban on showing smoking in films. The courts decision reflects the position of many Bollywood stars like Shah Rukh Khan who are against a total ban on smoking on screen. It is true that people do sometimes take up smoking by imitating actors, thereby inviting health hazards. But, like smoking, many other social evils are on the rise as well. Given the daily trials of Indian women on the streets, the Centre should then also put a blanket ban on the depiction of rape on cinema. By the same logic, the dangers of alcoholism calls for the censoring of scenes showing drinking in films.          
	Ultimately, if the government is so concerned about the health of its citizens, it should ban the manufacture of cigarettes and alcohol. But that would mean a huge compromise on its commercial interests. Perhaps guidelines could be issued to small- and big-screen productions suggesting ways to minimize the use of smoking scenes. This could be the basis of self-regulatory measures that producers and directors can then follow on their own discretion.          
	Yours faithfully,      
M. Kumar, New Delhi

                
	Sir  The report, Court licence to smoke on screen (Jan 24), heralds a victory for creativity. The governments October 2006 ban on smoking in films was illogical since it smacked of hypocrisy. If the Centre is so worried about the health of the people, then the entire tobacco industry should be done away with. If depictions of vices in films influence a nations character, then the entire film industry should also be banned.          
	The Delhi High Court has rightly observed that a film must reflect the realities of life. Smoking is a reality of life. It may be undesirable but it exists. It is not banned by any law.. Prostitution is also prohibited by law, but it is still appears on films since it is part of the fabric of the society. However, no film upholds the dark side of life as an example for the viewers to emulate. To depict the truth, actors have to enact the same in a realistic manner. Those who are immature take up smoking, prostitution or criminal acts after viewing their favourite actors doing so on screen, hence the argument put forward by the health minister, Ambumani Ramadoss, does hold good for the majority. Only education is the antidote. The government should create greater public awareness through campaigns to check these harmful habits.          
	Yours faithfully,        Prabhakar Bhattacharya, Ichapore, 24 Parganas (N)          
	Sir  Is it a good idea to lift the ban on smoking in films simply because it is a part of social reality? The high courts latest decision in favour of smoking on screen is confusing because smoking in public places has already been banned. But people will continue watching their favourite actors smoking on screen, and many are bound to imitate them in real lives. This dichotomy may also provoke them to flout the ban on public smoking.                    
	Yours faithfully,

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Opening a new window 
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        OPENING A NEW WINDOW                                   Bikash Sinha reflects on the significance of the Large Hadron Collider for India and the world                          Wonder machine                                  
	On November 11 this year, I rang my friend, Lyndon Evans, the chief architect and builder of the Large Hadron Collider at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (Cern), to enquire about a good time to go for a dinner organized in his honour. Lyn had come from Geneva to deliver a lecture and address the convocation of the Durgapur National Institute of Technology. By the time I called, there had already been another call from a well-known newspaper asking about yet another disaster at the collider.         
	A little bird was pecking at a French loaf about that time outside Cern, and the loaf fell, causing a short circuit in the grid power supply at Cern. The LHC plunged into darkness for a couple of hours. The memory of the last major hiccup, precipitating a grand scale burst of about 60 tons of liquid helium, came alive once again. Is the LHC then permanently jinxed? Is god protecting the darkest secrets of nature?        
	By dinner time, Lyn was drowned in calls. Immediately after the convocation, he dashed back to Geneva. On November 21, at 2.30 am IST, protons started circulating in the tunnel, and as I write this, they are still circulating in one direction in one of the beam lines, and in the opposite direction in the second beam line. The LHC is being tested as rigorously as possible before going on to the full power mode. I now feel sorry for the bird that missed its French treat. At the same time, one feels elated to note that perhaps the LHC is not jinxed, after all.        
	Clearly, a mystique has evolved around the LHC. For some, it has a mythical capacity to create black holes, which can devour the entire planet. More interestingly, thanks to the LHC, there now exist real possibilities of discovering things unexpected and wonderful, opening out new windows of perception to the universe. At last, Big Science has gatecrashed into the centre of the world, bringing about a refreshing change from the ephemeral high drama of politicians, sportsmen and filmstars. Big Science is almost glamourous now!        
	But, what is the LHC? And more important, why? These two questions have plagued the author whenever or wherever one has talked about Indias involvement with the LHC.        
	Every single feature of engineering necessary to build the LHC is the first of its kind in the world. The LHC houses 27 kilometres of beam tube (through which very high-energy beams of protons and/or nuclei speed through) in an underground tunnel 50 to 100 metres below the surface of the earth, going round from Geneva to France and back. There are two beam lines, each 27 kms long. The collider in the name signifies the fact that protons and/or nuclei circulating in one beam line are expected to collide with protons and/or nuclei going in the opposite direction in the second beam line.        
	The elementary species that build up the nucleus consists of neutrons, protons, and the meson, which binds them together. The incredible temperature attained after the collision of the two nuclei simply melt the neutrons, protons and mesons, dissolving them into a fluid of their interior inhabitants  the quarks, glued together by gluons to a plasma of quarks and gluons. However incredible it may second, a millionth of a second after the Big Bang, the universe also consisted of the same quarks and gluons. Thus, the mini bang of the two nuclei mimics the Big Bang.        
	You can feel the excitement, capturing the primordial moments of the creation of the universe in the laboratory. The protons travel at 99.999991 per cent of the speed of light, and go around the ring (27 kms long) 11,245 times per second. Once again, Albert Einsteins special theory of relativity is applied in full measure  nothing can move beyond the speed of light, and those with increasing velocity mass of the particles dilate to a larger value. The design of the machine has to take care of the dilation of mass. About 600 collisions take place every second.        
	The LHC has cost the European Union and other countries, including India, a little more than $8 billion, and it took nearly 15 years to build. The temperature inside the LHC is around -271C, and the absolute zero temperature is -273C  a feat that can be achieved with the most developed form of liquid helium technology, usually referred to as cryogenic technology. To reach the high magnetic field required, high currents are needed. To avoid excessive resistive losses, the magnets are made superconducting. A huge cryogenic system is required to produce the liquid helium needed to keep the magnets cold. Twelve million litres of liquid nitrogen will be vapourized during the initial cooldown of 31,000 tons of material and the total inventory of liquid helium will be 700,000 litres. The superconducting magnet systems at that temperature suffer virtually no resistance to electric current  that is precisely why it has been possible to attain such incredible energy. Otherwise, the machine would have been the most power-hungry machine in this planet. The temperature is even lower than that in the coldest part of our universe.        
	Why has man built such an expensive, complex and technologically demanding machine? The LHC is driven by science, and the unquenchable desire of man to explore the unknown, the interiors of the building blocks of nature. The missing link of contemporary wisdom, the standard model sometimes referred to as Gods particle  the Higgs boson  is expected to be discovered finally. Higgs boson has this strange habit of increasing its mass in its familiar habitat filled with quarks and gluons. It will be most unusual if Higgs boson is not discovered.        
	The LHC is also supposed to prove or disprove the existence of yet another exotic particle called the super symmetric particle; all elementary particles, protons, neutrons even photons (light particle) are supposed to have their super symmetric partners. Super symmetry, incidentally, is an intrinsic component of the most advanced theory physicists have so far propounded  the theory of everything  the String Theory.         
	Our very own detectors, the Photon Multiplicity Detector at the Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre in Calcutta, and the Saha Institutes muon, armed with the Manas chip as the central building block, are put on line at a large ion collider experiment (ALICE) as detectors. Photons and electrons, as signals of the debris of the collision of two nuclei, are expected to be observed by these detectors.         
	The biggest puzzle of all times is dark matter, and even more mysterious is dark energy. As per contemporary wisdom, 75 per cent of the energy is dark energy. We do not know its source but we know that it is dark energy which has been responsible for accelerating the expansion rate of the universe  this has been experimentally observed. Experiments conducted at the LHC will throw light on the dark side of energy.        
	With the LHC, a whole new world of science will open up. To explore the universe and its infinite wonders, man has created the most advanced technology as well computational expertise. Science is the main driver of the technological wonder called the LHC. The LHC has proved that the spirit of discovery can help man attain an extraordinary height of technology.

                                                                                                                 COURTING ANGER                                                    
	The Indian practice of killing wives or daughters-in-law or driving them to suicide is flourishing. The count is going up, not down: from 2005 to 2007, deaths for dowry have gone up from over 6,000 to over 8,000. Every right-thinking citizen would be horrified by not just the statistics but by the increase in violence as well, and wonder how this rising tide of domestic murder can be stemmed. Exactly this horror and concern seems to lie behind the remarks emanating from the Supreme Court bench that refused the bail plea of an accused in a bride-burning case. The judges made clear that pouring kerosene over a woman to burn her is a barbaric act, unfit for civilized people. The courts sharp remarks implied that it was death, not a life sentence, that such offenders deserved. Given the increase in the crime, the remarks seem to suggest, capital punishment alone would be a possible deterrent.        
	Without questioning for a moment the rightness of sentiment behind the courts remarks, it is possible to feel deeply uncomfortable about them. A courts pronouncement represents the balance imaged in the concept of justice; it cannot afford to be touched by anger. In times such as the present, when most institutions are blamed for acts of excess or impropriety, the court is especially important as a symbol of balance. The legal process, which culminates, ideally, in a punishment befitting the crime, is a fundamental requirement of civilized life. Since everyone has a right to be legally tried, it is the only bulwark against a violent ethos of public revenge and oppression. The court represents societys agreements about the punishments regarding each category of crime. It is an impersonal institution that channels societys constructive sentiments into law and procedure. Even its rhetoric is impersonal, neutral, it cannot afford to seem intemperate. Even a touch of personal ire in a judicial pronouncement can cause alarm, for the balance between sentiment and legality is strenuously achieved. While India does have capital punishment, it is used with great restraint. To mention it with reference to an offender already sentenced to life imprisonment in order to emphasize the brutal nature of his crime seems unnecessary. The man is already paying for his crime according to the law. The denial of bail should be enough to drive home the gravity of his deed.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Between the devil and the deep sea
                                                                                                                 BETWEEN THE DEVIL AND THE DEEP SEA                                  Abhijit Bhattacharyya                              
	The image of Pakistan on the global canvas is by now familiar and needs no elaboration. The country is known the world over as a nation in turmoil, which has been its own making. Its army has a single-point agenda: to avenge its defeat in Indias hands in 1971. To do so, the army devised the concept of proxy war, which was carried out by non-military men with a penchant for suicide attacks and guerrilla tactic. Pakistan, thus, emerged as the epicentre of global terror.        
	A month ago, Richard Holbrooke, the American presidents special envoy to Pakistan and Afghanistan, declared triumphantly that Pakistan has moved a significant number of its troops from the Indian border in order to tackle local militants. Now compare what Holbrooke said with General Ashfaq Parvez Kayanis briefing to members of parliament on May 15, 2009: The army cannot be withdrawn from its location of covering the expected attack routes on the border with India.        
	Clearly, Kayani and Holbrooke have aired diametrically opposite views. Who, then, is speaking the truth? Kayani spoke in the middle of May. Holbrookes comments came in early June. Obviously, some things must have changed in between. Kayani cannot afford to be perceived as a weak general in front of a civilian ruling class. Hence, Kayanis tough posturing should be seen as an attempt to put up a brave stand in the face of intense, and successful, American pressure on the civilian bosses of Pakistan. Nevertheless, it would be inconceivable to infer that a large-scale reduction of troops would be acceptable to the army, which is still licking the wounds of the 1971 debacle.                 
	Balancing act        
	By declaring a status quo on the Indian border, Kayani defied the Obama-Zardari agreement to withdraw Pakistani troops from the relatively peaceful border with India and re-deploy them to fight the Taliban. He thereby managed to send across the message that the army chief is still the real boss when it comes to national security.        
	After Kayani, it was Holbrookes turn to make a point, but the point he made appears to be a half-truth. According to credible Indian sources, a few brigades have been relocated from the eastern border (with India) to Pakistans northwest (where the military is engaged in counter-insurgency operations) after the Obama-Zardari meet. There just could not have been any major movement from the holding corps based in Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Lahore, Bahawalpur and Karachi.        
	It thus boils down to Americas strategic interests to make space for itself in the region. The United States of Americas design is explicit: Pakistan has to act on ground. On the other hand, Pakistans strategy is to remain ambiguous in its commitment. Fighting terrorism has never been high on its agenda. Why? Because, the army wants to thwart India at all costs.         
	That things are unlikely to go in the right direction was conveyed by Indias external affairs minister, S.M. Krishna, who said that, The...release of a known terrorist who master-minded the terrorist attack on India on 26/11 has certainly created doubts in us about the sincerity of Pakistan... It is our experience that Pakistan says something for outward consumption but it does not really mean what it conveys to the rest of the world.         
	Nothing more needs to be said after this. Despite Asif Ali Zardaris assurances, Pakistan does not seem to be under a unified command. Islamabad is being ruled by power brokers who are regional satraps. An unstable Pakistan would be detrimental to Indias interests. Terror and talk are incompatible propositions.

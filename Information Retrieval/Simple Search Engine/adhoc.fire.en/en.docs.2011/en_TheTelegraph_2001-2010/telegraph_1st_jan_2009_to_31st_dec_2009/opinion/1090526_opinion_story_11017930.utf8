The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Delusion after defeat
                                                                                                                 DELUSION AFTER DEFEAT                          - West Bengals CPI(M) leaders continue to deceive themselves         Ashis Chakrabarti                                              
	Faced with a humbling defeat, a political party can do one of two things. It can either opt for a sincere admission of mistakes and guilt or deceive itself by weaving a cloak of specious arguments. An honest search for reasons can take a long time during which opinions may need to be revised several times. After all, it is never easy to pinpoint the exact reasons for an electoral victory or defeat for any party or alliance in India. Almost every argument can be challenged by a counter-argument. But the voices that have so far emanated from Alimuddin Street, the headquarters of the West Bengal unit of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), suggest that the party is either unable or unwilling to even undertake an honest appraisal of what went wrong. The reasons aired by the partys leaders so far would tempt one to conclude that they are too dazed by the results and can do no better than indulge in bouts of shadow-boxing.        
	One reason for the debacle, we are told, is the peoples unequivocal rejection of the idea of the third front as a viable alternative to the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance and the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance. The partys central leadership or, more specifically, its general secretary, Prakash Karat, was responsible for this flawed line. In other words, it isnt their fault, the Bengal comrades would have us believe.        
	The second argument that is offered follows from the first. The defeat is all about the partys decision to withdraw its support to the Manmohan Singh government on the issue of the civilian nuclear deal with the United States of America. This too is Karats doing, and the party in Bengal shouldnt really be blamed for the mess. If the withdrawal had not happened, the Bengal leaders lament, the Congress would not have gone with the Trinamul Congress. In that event, Mamata Banerjee would have continued with her alliance with the BJP, thereby forcing Muslim voters to stay with the Left.              
	The third argument talks about the strong wind across the country in favour of a stable government at the Centre. Even the huge swing of the Muslim vote away from the Left in Bengal is partly attributed to this new-found desire for stability. With the third front a non-starter and the opinion polls predicting a neck-and-neck race between the UPA and the NDA, the Muslims panicked at the possibility of Lal Krishna Advani becoming prime minister and voted en bloc for the Congress. Once again, no fault of either the party or its government in Bengal.        
	The point is not that these arguments are all without a basis. That the third front was an unrealistic idea had been suspected even as it was being born. But communist parties all over the world have always worked on the theory of the United Front, tactically agreeing to sleep with strange bedfellows in order to defeat the main enemy or enemies.         
	But the way Karat went about gathering forces for the third front made for a rather comical spectacle. Anyone and everyone was welcome to the party, no questions asked. He had no problem if his recruits had been with the BJP only a summer ago. His last  and most prized  trophy, Naveen Patnaik, captured the ultimate irony. Karat and his comrades had absolutely no problems with embracing the Orissa chief minister who had not only supped with the devil for five years but also had found nothing wrong with the BJP even when Kandhamal burnt in communal fire. It was thus not the workability of the third front but its immorality and opportunism that showed the Marxists in a poor light.        
	The second argument is just as steeped in political immorality. If the CPI(M) thought that the nuclear deal posed a threat to Indias sovereignty and independent foreign policy, it was entirely justified to oppose the deal and withdraw its support to a government that, in its judgment, had sacrificed national interest. That would have been a principled position for any party. Whether it posed a risk of electoral losses would have been irrelevant to the commitment to a cause.        
	The other half of this argument that one now hears from the losers in Bengal sounds even more self-deceiving. Where was the guarantee that the continuation of the Lefts support to the UPA government would have tied Mamata Banerjee to the BJP? The Congress had its own interest in trying to wean her away from the BJP. Also, it was difficult for her to stay on with the saffron brigade not just because it had proved so costly for her in the 2004 elections but also because her Singur-Nandigram agitation had made the Muslims an integral part of her strategy this time as never before.         
	Take the third argument about the strong pro-stability wave. Even if one ignores past records of such waves missing many shores, a look at the results in states like Assam, Bihar, Orissa, Tripura, Jharkhand and Karnataka suggests that this does not wholly explain the Lefts humiliating defeat in Bengal. Politicians, analysts and the people will be divided as to what the real explanation is. But there is no escaping the conclusion that the mandate in Bengal is primarily an expression of anger against the CPI(M). And this anger was both deepening and widening among different sections of the people.         
	Different things kept this angry flame burning and even helped it spread to more sections of society. The acquisition of agricultural land for setting up industries may well have been the spark that lit the prairie fire in many areas, especially in south Bengal, and helped the Lefts opponents to use the issue in order to brew a fatal cocktail of fear and rage, particularly among the Muslim peasants and other sections of the rural poor. But another way of looking at this anger is to see the Singur-Nandigram eruption as an effect, and not a cause, of mounting dissatisfaction with the ways of the party and its government. In villages and suburban towns, the most common complaint against the Marxists  even before land acquisition became an explosive political issue  was about the arrogance of the leaders, big and small.               
	Leftists tend to project arrogance as a capitalist attribute. The assumption is that if the capitalist elite is arrogant and insensitive to the problems of lesser mortals, the Leftists must be humble and compassionate. But more and more people in Bengal came to realize in recent years that arrogance is not necessarily a class attribute and can afflict all those in authority. Usually, the longer a party is in authority, the worse the affliction.         
	The CPI(M) leaders arrogance prompted them to see all criticism as partisan and, more woefully for them, blinded them to the problems it caused for its government. Whether it was a small rural development project or a major industrial venture, an arrogant leadership tended to take things  and the people  for granted. The result was an accumulation of anger that burst out in varied degrees and forms over different issues.         
	The fact that, despite all these, the Left had more than 43.3 per cent of the votes in Bengal  against 44.63 per cent of the Congress-Trinamul Congress combine  is proof that its support base is still formidable. It also suggests that the party still has reasons to hope for a recovery of some of the lost ground.         
	What the party leaders in Bengal are saying in order to deflect blame to Karat and the central leadership suggests that even this huge defeat has not taught them to be honest or humble enough to admit their own guilt. Karats political line may have failed, but the Bengal leaders faults created the right and necessary conditions for that failure.

                                                                                                                 JUST OFFSHORE                                                    
	A social visit, ordinarily, does not come at the end of a night-long swim in a lake with flippers on. There is no doubt that the circumstances of John William Yeattaws visit to the lakeside residence of Aung San Suu Kyi, the pro-democracy leader of Myanmar, are rather extraordinary. There are, as yet, no clear motives behind the excursion of the middle-aged American from Missouri. But his foolhardy exercise, and the two-day stay at Ms Suu Kyis bungalow, have ensured that the release of the leader from her 13-year-long house arrest is jeopardized only days before it was to end on May 27. The junta in Myanmar has seized the opportunity to pack off Ms Suu Kyi to the infamous Insein prison for violating the conditions of her detention. Her lawyers are about to argue that Ms Suu Kyi was forbidden to invite people to her home, not to play unwilling host to determined gatecrashers. That argument, however, is unlikely to wash with the establishment. By an unbelievable coincidence, it now has the chance of not only shutting out its chief dissident before the crucial elections next year but also getting back at the United States of America, which has imposed sanctions on the country and has been persistently critical of the regime. The US will now have to negotiate, and from a different position altogether, the safety of an American citizen and that of Ms Suu Kyi. It must also give a rare pleasure to the junta to have the world see an American as a spoiler of the pro-democracy movement, which would perhaps have taken a new direction with the release of Ms Suu Kyi.         
	It is anybodys guess how the trial will unfold. What should be the cause for immediate international concern is the failing health of the leader. The doctor, her only officially allowed visitor, was arrested days before Mr Yeattaw swam ashore. The wellbeing of Ms Suu Kyi and her release, together with that of countless other political prisoners, should be insisted upon. Myanmars military regime is hard-pressed to gain international recognition, which it seeks to earn through the State-controlled elections next year. The peoples referendum on the holding of the elections may have been stage-managed, and the constitution doctored, to ensure the victory of the rulers by denying political legitimacy to the democrats. Right now, however, the junta may be more amenable to certain demands than before.

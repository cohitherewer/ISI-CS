	Proper learning and vigorous practice are the two pillars of a successful classical dance performance. But the zeal and passion that keep the audience craving for more set Ramli Ibrahims creations apart. A dynamic force to reckon with in Malaysian culture, Ibrahim has been described as original, radical and non-conformist. His Odissi choreography transcends national, religious and ethnic boundaries.         
	In Vision of Forever, choreographed by Ibrahim and his Sutra Dance Company at the G.D. Birla Sabhagar on January 25, he combined different styles of renowned Odissi gurus, and rearranged them in a compelling composition, surpassing all stereotypes. The programme began with an invocation, followed by sthayi and pallavi, where the dancers painted a colourful canvas with strong lines, rhythmic patterns and graceful postures. Ibrahims inimitable style, the accompanying music, and the modern costumes set an example in classical dance presentation.         
	Ibrahim is not only a fine dancer, but also a talented teacher, which was evident from his groups performance. Guna, the only male artist in the group, is a dancer par excellence. His precision, presence, poise and perfection were extraordinary. Dashamahavidya, the final item, narrating the ten revelations of the Goddess Absolute, was novel.

                                                                                                                 A STEP BACK IN TIME                                  FIFTH COLUMN - GWYNNE DYER                              
	On March 29, the 180,000 people of the island of Mayotte voted to decide whether they would like to become the 101st department of France. They live on a tropical island in the Indian Ocean, they are almost all Sunni Muslims, and their cultural heritage is overwhelmingly African and Arab. They could become independent just by ticking the right box  but they voted instead to become fully, irrevocably, French. Why?        
	Sure, its the money. Per capita income on Mayotte is $2,600, compared to $1,142 in the other Comoro islands (the other three islands of the group declared independence from France in 1975), and even less in Madagascar, Mayottes giant neighbour on the other side. But why does being ruled by France make Mayotte richer? There hasnt been much by the way of subsidies from France over the years, and even after Mayotte becomes a full-fledged department the money is not going to flood in. The population will have to give up local customs like Islamic courts, polygamy and child marriages right away to conform to the French legal code, but it will gradually gain access to French social benefits over the next 25 years.        
	This is not about how wonderful France is. Its about how awful Africa is for most of the people who live there. So awful that most other people in the continent would, like the citizens of Mayotte, vote to be French if they were given the choice. Or Hungarian or South Korean, for that matter.        
	Youre not supposed to say this, but its the most obvious thing about Africa. There are oases of hope here and there  most other Africans would also vote to join South Africa, for example  but most countries in the continent are broken. Consider what the people of Mayotte see when they look at their neighbours.        
	South of them is Madagascar, where the latest coup took place just last week. It has been lucky as African countries go: no civil wars, and none of its dictators was a monster. But are its people any better off economically than they were when Madagascar got its independence from France 49 years ago? Not much.                
	Bitter truth        
	Madagascars economy has grown since independence, but average income barely kept up with population growth for the first 40 years. There was then a 20 per cent rise in average income over the past decade, but the present and prospective political upheavals will probably cancel that out. As for democracy, it comes and it goes, but mostly its gone.        
	Mayottes other neighbour, the Union of the Comoros, has had 20 military coups in its 34 years of independence, some of them carried out by foreign mercenaries (mostly French) who were hired by the various local rivals for power. Two of the three islands even seceded in 1997 in an attempt to put themselves back under French rule, but France refused to take them on and the revolts were bloodily suppressed. Population growth is high, and per capita income has been falling for decades. You would not wish to be born in the Union of the Comoros. Indeed, one-third of Mayottes population is made up of people from the other islands who have moved there to place themselves back under colonial oppression.        
	There will be a great outburst of indignation and much anti-imperialist bluster by the representatives of Africas ruling elites after Mayottes voters make their choice. But not one of those privileged people would be willing to live as an ordinary citizen of the Union of the Comoros, and most of their own fellow-citizens at home would make the same choice as the voters of Mayotte if it were offered to them.        
	You can analyse it as much as you like. You can hypothesize causes or postulate solutions. But half-a-century after the first wave of decolonization gave most Africans their independence, this is the bitter truth about the continent.

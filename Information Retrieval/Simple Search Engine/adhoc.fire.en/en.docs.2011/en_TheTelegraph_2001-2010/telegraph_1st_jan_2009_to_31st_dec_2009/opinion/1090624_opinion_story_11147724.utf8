	There is something distinctly odd about citizens of a modern democracy being taught manners by the State. But mobile phones have caused a global revolution not only in communications but also in public (and private) behaviour. And there are elements in this new behaviour that should be deemed obnoxious anywhere in the world. So, the department of telecom seems to have struck the right balance between intervention and discretion by providing handset manufacturers and service providers with guidelines on etiquette to be passed on to their customers. First, some aspects of mobile-phone use directly concern public safety. In these matters, the laws and their implementation have to be rigorous. Drivers or riders speaking into their phones should have to face dire punishment. Indias enforcement record, when it comes to such matters, is poor; think of seat belts, helmets or fire regulations in public or private buildings. This is because of a strange lack of the fear of death or bodily harm among Indians on the road. (Selfish lack of consideration for others is perhaps less baffling.)         
	It is this tendency to be dangerously callous and uncivil that often forces the State to interfere in these matters, making laws that then need to be enforced, for simply trying to raise awareness is usually not enough. But the question of manners is a grey area in this respect. Different institutions and spaces of civil society have their own ways of regulating human behaviour: schools, universities, families, workplaces, restaurants, hospitals, cinema halls. But a lot depends on unspoken conventions, on a tacit understanding among civilized human beings as to what constitutes acceptable behaviour. In a populous, diverse and radically unequal society like Indias, and given the mobile phones ubiquity across the entire social spectrum (415 million users), such a consensus is difficult to take for granted. India is not Luxembourg. It is, therefore, up to individuals and specific institutions to frame their own personal and professional guidelines regarding mobile-phone use. It is a device for better communication and access to information, and should not be used for getting on peoples nerves or for controlling their lives.

	Chatter all the time                  
	Sir  Sunanda K. Datta-Ray forcefully drives home the point that no amount of hot talk and rhetoric can deter Pakistan from continuing with its avowed policy of direct and covert terrorist activities against India (Less talk, more action, Dec 27). It is really the time for action, and India must use every means at its disposal to put pressure on Pakistan, since, under no circumstances, should another war break out. Few people would disagree with Datta-Ray that a full-scale combat with a Pakistan armed to the teeth with American weapons and dollars would not only harm India economically and physically, but also please a belligerent China. The reason is obvious. An India busy at war would provide China the golden opportunity of grabbing more Indian territories in the Northeast and Kashmir in its bid to establish itself as the undisputed Asian superpower.           
	It is imperative for India to use its economic clout and democratic credentials to browbeat any country condoning or ignoring Pakistans state policy of harbouring and sponsoring Islamic terrorism. In this process, India should also befriend every country that is weary of the dangers of a Pak-China nexus. Moreover, as Datta-Ray asserts, this nation needs to impress upon its huge Muslim population that their culture, needs and aspirations are totally different from those of the Islamic fundamentalists spearheading jihad on Pakistani soil and across the world.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Shivaji K. Moitra, Kharagpur

                
	Sir  With just reasons, Sunanda K. Datta-Ray has declared that the television, these days, has become the national adda. It is true that what goes on on TV shapes the thinking of millions of viewers. In a mad race to increase their TRP, news channels often telecast breaking news based on events already known or plainly obvious. The topics of talk shows or the headlines accompanying footages are often confusing and misleading. Datta-Ray rightly points out that abroad, the media are accepted as Indias disguised official voice and that is the point everybody, and especially the media, should be concerned about. Hasty comments from our ministers or journalists or from guests featured on talk shows may produce adverse international opinion about India, particularly in countries that are wary of our growing economy and flourishing democracy.          
	Yours faithfully,       
T. Biswas, Barrackpore

                
	Sir  While watching television or reading the newspapers, it often seems as if the media wish to be the mouthpiece for the entire country. Indias security concerns are sometimes exaggerated to such an extent that debate and discussions start sounding like exercises in jingoism. We tend to waste crucial time by endlessly analysing a crisis with panels of eminent speakers, and all that is said matters very little in real life.           
	The possibility of an all-out war with Pakistan is the result of such idle chit-chat on television channels and sensational reports in the print media. As Sunanda K. Datta-Ray shows, India has to come out with a clear policy towards Pakistan that is not dictated by divisive politics. Limited ties with Pakistan in all the spheres of national activity is the right step to take. Israel has shown the world that there can be no half measures when it comes to national security and survival. India has to be ruthless to those abetting terror and strive to make itself impregnable to fundamentalist forces.          
	Yours faithfully,        Prabhakar Bhattacharya,Ichapore, 24 Parganas            
	War not whine          
	Sir  The military attacks started by Israeli forces on Gaza last December are reprehensible (Rules of revenge, Dec 31). These have destroyed the security of Gaza and killed hundreds of Palestinians. The high mortality indicates a wilful targeting of civilians and the police forces in a clear violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention, under Article 147, making Israel culpable of a war crime. Both the time and location of these attacks indicate a malicious intent to inflict as many casualties as possible. The latest shelling on UN schools killed a number of children. What on earth did Ehud Olmert, the interim prime minister of Israel, mean when he said that the people of Gaza were not the enemy, but it was Hamas and Islamic jihad that were being targeted? Was he trying to mock the residents of Gaza?           
	Israels war crimes as well as other violations of international law in Gaza and in the rest of the occupied Palestinian territory could not have been perpetrated without the direct or indirect complicity of world governments, particularly of the United States of America and the European Union. The United Nations Security Council must call an emergency session and consider concrete measures, including the imposition of sanctions, to ensure Israel fulfils its obligations under international humanitarian law. The High Contracting Parties to the Geneva Conventions must meet their obligation under Article 1 to ensure respect for the provisions of the Conventions by compelling Israel to abide by international law. Those responsible for the breaches must also be prosecuted.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Rudra Sen, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Israel does not whine, nor does it beg from door to door for relief against Islamic terrorism. It avenges ferociously and often disproportionately. The civilian casualties in Gaza by Israeli air strikes were not intended but were inevitable since the Hamas bases were in the midst of civilian habitats in Gaza Strip. After all, Hamas members do not stay in well-segregated barracks. In contrast, the inmates of the Nariman House in Mumbai were neither Israeli soldiers nor spies of Mosad. Yet, they were deliberately targeted and slain last November. The repeated Hamas rocket strikes on Jewish settlements did not cause comparable damage. But that is due to the poor quality of their weaponry and expertise, and not because Hamas is less ferocious. Jews have every right to exist in their own land that they had to leave years ago due to historic injustices.           
	Yours faithfully,

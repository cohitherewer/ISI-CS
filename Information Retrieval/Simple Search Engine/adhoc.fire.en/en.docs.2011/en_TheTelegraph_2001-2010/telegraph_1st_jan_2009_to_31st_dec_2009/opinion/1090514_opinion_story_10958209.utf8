	The March index of industrial production shows a fall of 2.3 per cent from previous March. This is the largest proportional decline in recent times. Although industrial growth ceased in December, there was still room for doubt, for it showed a small rise in the next month. Output declined again in February, but the fall was only 0.7 per cent, and could have been a statistical accident. March shows the third and largest fall in four months. The trend must raise a query about whether the massive boosts to the economy the Central government claims to have given through its politically useful spending programmes have worked.        
	A closer look at the figures suggests that they have worked. One of the industries towards which the government was especially generous is the car industry. The output of transport equipment in March was seven per cent above last Marchs level. Apparently, the money given to government departments to renew their vehicles was spent with some effect. But the government did not release money only for cars. It also wrote off loans for farmers, and in general spent quite indiscriminately. Such expenditure should have strewn more income across all the people, and perked up demand for all consumer goods. Despite this generosity, production of food products fell by a massive 35.8 per cent. The government would be inclined to pass this off as a supply-side effect  it could say that sugarcane available for milling was less this year. But it could not say that of garment production, which fell 1.7 per cent, textile production, which shrank 10.6 per cent, or output of leather goods, which fell 18.1 per cent.         
	The lesson the government draws from this experience may well be that it was not enough to give its employees money to buy new cars  that it should have given them money to buy new clothes and shoes. It may be a bit difficult to police expenditure on them; but that would not stop the government. It would ask for invoices for the purchases. They can be forged; to get around that, the government would insist that the shirts and shoes should be bought from its own shops. And if they are too few or do not stock essential goods, the government would open new shops for mass consumer goods. The global crisis shows that capitalism has failed; the government can now go back to the Nehruvian socialism it abandoned under the pressure of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. But it is also possible to conclude from the governments experience hitherto that indiscriminate spending does not cure a downturn. In bad times, people tend to save and to hoard money, so giving them more money does not necessarily increase demand. And even if demand is increased by government expenditure for a time, it will slump again once the government ceases to spend.

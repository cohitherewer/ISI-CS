	The Idol Lover and Other Stories of Pakistan By Moazzam Sheikh, Ithuriels Spear, $16        
	Pakistani writers are in fashion. They are writing in all genres of fiction  the serious novel, rambunctious social novels, epic sagas, and of course, the simplest and yet the most complex form of all  the short story. Daniyal Mueenuddins In Other Rooms, Other Wonders is a wonderfully written book of interlinked stories set in the feudal world of rural Punjab. And there is also Moazzam Sheikh, who in his stories straddles several different worlds stretching across continents.        
	I had read Sheikhs first edited collection, A Letter from India (2004), where he introduced many Pakistani writers to the readers of South Asia. In his very insistent, angry introduction, Sheikh talked of the new, post-Independence Pakistani writing that was different, defiant and also fully expressive of the various identities that make up the country.        
	Sheikh is now based in San Francisco and he continues to write and translate fiction across English, Urdu and Punjabi. In The Idol Lover, his first collection of short stories, he travels, as do his stories, from Pakistan to varied worlds that include the dry, desert-ridden, intensely patrolled, and terribly divided areas which obviously signify West Asia, and the more disembodied, disenchanted, coffee-scented worlds of New York and San Francisco. The settings of the latter group of stories are the common fixtures of our globalized world  the airport and the caf.         
	Monsoon Rains begins with the rains lashing Lahore, and Masud Sheikh waiting for Nasima, his Christian sweeper-woman, with whom he is having an affair. The rain becomes a motif to describe his emotions, which torment and taunt him as he goes out in the citys flooded streets in search of Nasima. When Masud finds out about her husband, he is startled, but only momentarily. This is a story of how our own emotions play deceitful games on us.        
	The title story of his collection, The Idol Lover, has a long, engrossing description of the turmoil inside a mans head as he takes aim at an enemy soldier. Prem Singhs humaneness is evident, not just in how history shaped him, but also in his loves and in his passion for music. There is a teacher  a widow  whom he thinks he still loves the most, but strangely it is a Christian woman whose image his mind conjures up at the oddest moments, even at the critical juncture when he is taking the fatal shot at the enemy. It is the tricks the mind and heart play on him that leave him agonized.        
	Similar descriptive soliloquy, this time playful, is also seen in the airport story simply called Kiss of the Holy Land, which happens to be the most hilarious piece. To the recently arrived stranger from Pakistan, all the American faces he encounters at the airport look familiar for they resemble past and present American presidents. People seem to bump into him all the time and it takes all his mental acuteness to sidestep them. And then he succumbs to temptation, ignores the images of forewarning that appear in his mind, and has a beer. A sensation akin to bliss overpowers him. People who bumped into him now step past him with care. His discomfited state, which sees him pass out in the airport restroom and lose his wallet, makes for tragi-comic reading.        
	It is his ability to describe conflicting emotions, whether a raw emotional dilemma or even a contradiction-filled soliloquy, that marks out Sheikh. The monologues convey a lot as they swing from one emotion, one contradictory thought to another, juxtaposing the sacred with the profane. Sometimes however, and this is especially true of the later stories, this very strength can become a weakness. This happens, for instance, in the last story, set in the ubiquitous San Francisco caf. The introspection of the narrator is in keeping with the mood. The disembodiment the narrator experiences reflects perhaps the solitariness and anomie that characterize life in America.        
	The two stories that stand out in this collection have to do with children. The Cow is the story of the strange friendship that develops between Vidia, the son of a household help, and William, the son of a collector. The friendship begins stutteringly from a game of cricket and soon develops into a strangely equal relationship between two unequals.         
	The child appears less prominently in the other story, The Barbarians and the Mule, set in what is evidently the Israel-Palestine border. This story is narrated from the standpoint of an Israeli-American soldier, who has to prove himself to his fellow soldiers, who mock his accent and fancy ways. And so he picks on a father-son duo for bullying. The son springs an unexpected surprise, and for a moment everyone is stunned, in a strange and momentous reversal of emotions.         
	These stories run across a range of worlds and emotions. You can read them in many different ways. The stories traverse different worlds; these are also stories that travel across time. And then these stories move from one brutal mental plane to another where there is a deliberate distancing from things emotional.        
	Mohsin Hamid, in The Reluctant Fundamentalist, wrote of the troubled experience one goes through when someone  the narrator of his novel  begins to see himself as the other. The seed of anger and dangerous fanaticism grows in him, and soon he is no longer the suave financial expert that he was, but is radicalized into a person who hates America and everything Western. Moazzam Sheikhs characters experience a more graduated change in their emotions and perspectives. Read these stories as commentaries on the storytellers own way of seeing the world and how in the very manner of writing the stories, the storytellers way of seeing changes too.                          ANURADHA KUMAR

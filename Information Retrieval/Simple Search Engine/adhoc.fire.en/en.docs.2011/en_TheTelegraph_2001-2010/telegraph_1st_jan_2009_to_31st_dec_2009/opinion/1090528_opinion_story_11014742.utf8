	Lost cause                  
	Sir  Political pundits like Ashok Mitra are still steeped in the cloistered understanding of the indispensability of leftist ideology, only because India has a vast majority of people living below the poverty line (Why fool yourselves?, May 22) . As if the poor could improve their lot only under the umbrella of leftist governance. History states otherwise. In the last two decades, India has learnt about opening up to the rest of the world. All over the world, the basic philosophy of development pivots around human development, the value of education, individual enterprise in newly-explored niche areas and trade across borders at competitive and efficient terms. Rigid leftist policies are no longer acceptable in our country, and equally unacceptable are the Lefts confused deeds and mixed-up idealism.           
	Poor people in other states, where the Left does not rule, are not necessarily poorer than their counterparts in West Bengal. It is a myth that keeps the poor in our state happy through clichs such as anti-Americanism and anti-imperialism. In the 2009 elections, the Left Front could win a nominal percentage of votes across India, apart from Tripura, West Bengal and Kerala where they had made inroads because of the lack of any alternatives.           
	Therefore, it is nave to claim that the debacle suffered by the Left in West Bengal in the recent Lok Sabha polls is owing to external factors like an overzealous industrial policy or a wave of support in favour of the Congress. The Left is actually clueless as to how it should initiate socio-economic policies in the context of a fast-changing world where expectations change rapidly and entrepreneur-employee relationships or productivity-acceleration processes in agro-based endeavours move in a non-linear way. The Left needs nimble-footed politicians who would not remain tied down to economic theories of the previous century.          
	The year, 2009, will hopefully see younger leaders emerging with new visions who will not be afraid to make mistakes, admit that they have done so and then move ahead. The verdict of the electorate is clearly in that direction.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Ashok Mitras article reminds one of Albert Einsteins sarcastic observation, Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. Mitra suggests that the Left is confused, but it seems that Mitra is more confused than the Left.           
	Mitra recommends that the Left should remit office immediately and seek forgiveness from the people. He also observes that the people should be provided with an opportunity to assess persons, parties and programmes objectively. This statement may be seen as a rather clever ploy of asking the people to assess a set of highly subjective issues, and not the concrete results of the badly implemented programmes. In a country where, according to Mitra, three quarters of the population are poor, he wants the partys slogan of development to be substituted by ideology. Mitra thinks capitalist growth coupled with the slogan of development will breed a self-seeking, apolitical generation that does not care to vote for the Left, if they vote at all. He suggests that the new generation is a lost cause for the party, as the former is unwilling to buy into the scheme of reaching the promised land.           
	Mitra also suggests that the Left should lobby earnestly in the national capital for adequate resources from centrally controlled public financial institutions to ensure industrial expansion in the public domain. Presumably, according to Mitra, the Central government can collect their revenues from capitalist growth, but the Left should, in no way, directly soil its hands with such ideologically blasphemous activities. Mitra has perhaps forgotten that this particular economic model has been tried in India, where it has failed. It is obsolete and has been abandoned by most nations, either partially or fully, in favour of what he dismisses as capitalist growth.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Ashok Mitra has analysed the election results very well from the Left Fronts perspective. The issues and circumstances in West Bengal are unique compared to the other states in India. There were a number of events that occurred during a short span of time, such as Jyoti Basus absence from active politics, the events in Nandigram and Singur and, finally, the Lefts withdrawal of support to the Central government, thereby allowing the Congress to form a coalition with Mamata Banerjee.           
	The policy of industrialization adopted by the Left was welcomed by most in the state, but it could not be implemented properly. Many people, including hard-core supporters of the communist ideology, were shocked by the forced implementation of the policy. The formidable lady utilized this situation to her advantage by populist slogans. The administration was indecisive and inactive, which also added to the dissatisfaction of the common people. They held the state administration responsible for its inefficiency. People have actually voted against the confused administration, and not necessarily for the so-called popular lady.           
	The election results in West Bengal need not be taken as the rejection of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and his policy of industrialization, but as a general consensus in favour of logical planning and implementation of the policy. The Left Front, especially the Communist Party of India (Marxist), may learn a lesson from this if it has the will. The CPI(M) should go back to the dissatisfied people, correct its mistakes, welcome external suggestions, bring back the dedicated workers who are unhappy with the leaders for their nepotism and restructure the party as far as possible within this period of two years.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Even after agreeing in general with Ashok Mitras article, one is tempted to differ on some counts. Mitra says, The CPI (M) still has, in the state, within its fold, thousands of sincere, selfless and dedicated workers and followers. But those workers have either left the party or the party has severed ties with them for their obsession with leftist ideals. Had they really been in the party, they would have raised their voices against the partys and the governments inept handling of critical issues like Singur and Nandigram. But they had not raised their voices because it suited them to survive on morsels of power and on shady deals.           
	It is exactly for this reason that the CPI (M) cannot afford to remit office, which Mitra suggests. Then, what will its vast army of sycophants, touts, charlatans and demagogues do for a living?                     
	Yours faithfully,

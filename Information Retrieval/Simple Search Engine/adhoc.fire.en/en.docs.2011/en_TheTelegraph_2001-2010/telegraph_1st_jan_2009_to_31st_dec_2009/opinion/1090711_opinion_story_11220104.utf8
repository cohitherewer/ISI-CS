                                                                                                                 SPELLBOUND                                                          
	From Chaucer to Shakespeare to Whitman to Seth, the English language has survived many kinds of catastrophic change. It had figured out quite early in life that the best way to carry on robustly through the ups and downs of history is to be open and absorbent. This flexibility has helped English as a language of both the conquerors and the conquered. From 1066 to tikka masala, it has eluded purists and put up with tectonic shifts in spelling, pronunciation, meaning and vocabulary. Even dictionaries have been forced to shed their original conservatism, choosing instead to record and incorporate, rather than forestall, linguistic change. So, it simply does not make sense to begin losing sleep over young people now writing color instead of colour or saying zee instead of zed. Schools in Indian cities  starting with Mumbai and now Calcutta too  are beginning to accept their students making a natural transition from British to American English, in keeping with what is happening in other parts of the Anglophone world.         
	The character of English has always been tied up with changes in the wealth and power of nations. And the contemporary world puts the United States of America in a very different place in relation to Britain from where it was when Queens English held imperial sway. This should certainly interest historians and linguists, but should not bother educators too much. Holding forth against it as a decline in standards and values is a kind of knee-jerk conservatism that is not much different from growling against public displays of affection or live-in relationships. Languages not only reflect social change, but they also act as the agents of such change.         
	But even after they have dismissed misgivings about spelling, English teachers in India would still have to think through certain distinctions and priorities. For instance, there is an important difference between using abbreviated forms of words as part of formal English (like ur and thru) and using correct American spellings instead of British ones. The former is an ugly habit, whereas the latter is perfectly acceptable, if done consistently. Why should OED be inherently superior to Webster? The point of English, or of any other language for that matter, is that it be used as a vehicle of thought, communication and creativity. It does not matter at all whether the spellings are British or American if students learn to think precisely and to express themselves in lucid and readable prose. To get mired in the nitty-gritty of spelling is to dodge the real challenges of teaching English in India.        
	The real threat to English is not the shift from British to American spelling, but the numbing of the capacity for linguistic effort through habits of instant communication, together with the sloppiness and eventual degeneration of grey matter that come with such inaction.

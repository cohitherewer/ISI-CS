	 After the jubilant return to power, comes the confusion over the change of guards. Ever since he was allocated the commerce and industry portfolio, the ever-fixed smile on Anand Sharmas face seemed to have widened considerably. The same cannot be said of Kamal Nath, Sharmas predecessor, though Nath, as the newly-crowned road transport and highways minister, is not exactly a disgruntled man. Hes just a little baffled (least of all by the decision to hive off shipping from the road transport and highways portfolio). In his earlier avatar, Nath had done a tolerably well, if not a commendable, job. He made a mark for being a tough negotiator at the Doha round of the World Trade Organization forum last year. However, Naths confrontational stand on behalf of India and other developing countries had displeased the WTO chief, Pascal Lamy. Now, it seems as though Naths belligerence was also disapproved by some at Raisina Hills. Perhaps this explains the changeover, and even a curtailment, of Naths portfolio?                
	 Mulayam Singh Yadav is in a fix, and not least because of the dismal performance of the Samajwadi Party in the general elections. Of course, he is yet to get over the shock of the Muslim vote gravitating towards the Congress, but then should he be all that surprised? Political pundits and partymen have, for long, been making dire predictions about the consequences of tying up with Kalyan Singh, formerly with the Bharatiya Janata Party. Azam Khan, the so-called Muslim face of the SP was perhaps the most vocal. He strongly opposed the inclusion of Singh, who had been the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh when Babri Masjid was demolished in 1992. Although Mulayam had not paid heed to Khans open rebellion, he is now facing a tough challenge: having to keep a promise he had made to Singh earlier. Apparently, Mulayam had offered that in the event of his son, Akhilesh, winning both the seats he was contesting (Ferozabad and Kannauj), he would field Rajveer Singh (Kalyans son) from the seat that Akhilesh would vacate. The idea was to accommodate Rajveer through a parliamentary by-election. But now that Akhilesh has won both seats and Kalyan staked claim on Ferozabad for his son, Mulayam is reluctant to honour his pledge. But then, honour isnt exactly an important word in the political lexicon, is it?                            
	 Words can cost dearly, and it is not Mulayam Singh alone who is learning this the hard way. Take Hansraj Bhardwaj, for instance. Even a few months back, the Union law minister could sit back and relax; the possibility of being left out of the cabinet seemed nowhere in sight. Now that the tables have turned, and Bhardwaj has been shown the door, tongues are wagging wildly about why such a fate has befallen panditji. Apparently, it was his weakness for tall words that cost him his job. Bhardwaj was never tired of telling his devoted followers how he had helped Indira Gandhi tide over various crises. He even went to the extent of claiming that he had been instrumental in getting P. Chidambaram into politics. Another time, he had allegedly boasted of knowing all the important details about everybody who was somebody in the extended Congress parivar. Last heard, Bhardwaj was trying, without much success, to clarify his position to whoever would care to listen.                            
	 Frequent-fliers from Delhi airport are learning the pains of privatization in an odd way. Air travellers are crestfallen that the closure of the government-owned duty-free outlet has lead to a hike in the price of their favourite scotch. Till recently, the duty-free shop had offered the most competitive prices for all popular brands of blended and single-malt whiskies; but not any longer. Whats more, following the closure of the outlet run by the Indian Tourism Development Corporation, the lone franchisee has not only increased the prices but also stores just a few high-value brands. Instead of a 12-year-old single malt, you have to now settle for a older, and far costlier, variety as the former is perennially out of stock.                            
	 Shashi Tharoors brush with realpolitik came when members of the diplomatic corp started flocking to the Delhi hotel where he had put up. As this was before Tharoor got his junior ministership, a well-wisher had to ask him to avoid such meetings till he was formally sworn in.

	 As most Congressmen vied with each other for ministerial berths, three senior party leaders stood distinctly aloof and refused to join the beeline for power. Instead, they decided to play mentor to anxious members of parliament from the Congress. Those MPs who could not lobby directly with Manmohan Singh, Sonia Gandhi or Rahulbaba sought the help of the formidable trio of Digvijay Singh, Janardhan Dwivedi and Ahmad Patel. Diggy Raja is known to be Rahul Gandhis right-hand man. And if JDs clout as Madams speech-writer is well-established, Patel, of course, happens to be her chief strategist. Those who could not make it to Team Manmohan could only silently marvel at the way this trinity wielded power over them in spite of their decision to have nothing to do with ministerships. It seems as though some people do not need any fancy designations to exercise authority. Real power, no doubt, resides in distant hands.

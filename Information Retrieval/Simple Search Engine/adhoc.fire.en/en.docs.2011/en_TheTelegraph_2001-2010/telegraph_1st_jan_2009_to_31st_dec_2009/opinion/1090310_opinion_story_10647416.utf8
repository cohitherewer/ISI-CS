	Whose fault is it? This question has been at the basis of divorce laws in India, requiring one or the other partner to cite grounds of cruelty, adultery, desertion, incorrigible criminality and so on in order to get a divorce. The grounds for divorce are an indicator of Indian societys deep-rooted, if covert, resistance to the idea of a marriage breaking up, because it is so much easier for old, exploitative social arrangements to endure if it could be believed that marriages are made in heaven. Even divorces by mutual consent were introduced years after the Hindu Marriage Act and the Special Marriage Act had been put in place. Now that the Supreme Court has refused to grant divorce on the basis of irretrievable breakdown of the marriage, since this is not a ground mentioned in the Hindu Marriage Act, the whole question of divorce and its attendant issues, such as maintenance, custody and so on, have to be placed in the perspective of changing social needs and unchanging social attitudes.        
	Irretrievable breakdown of marriage is a much-debated issue, with many activists protesting that it can be misused by husbands tired of their wives. But all laws can be so misused. The courts themselves have earlier granted divorce on this ground, although the Supreme Court has reportedly said that such cases are useless as precedent. Only the legislature can change the law by adding the provision of irretrievable breakdown as a ground for divorce. Yet, a slow accumulation of case-by-case decisions could bring available provisions closer to social realities and needs. Such convergence need not await the promulgation of new laws. The court has often been forward-thinking in its interpretations of issues such as womens right to property or maintenance after divorce. And in matters such as pollution or equity in food distribution, the courts have been far from conservative. In its wisdom, the court could, perhaps, interpret laws relating to social institutions and practices in the same forward-looking way. Society needs to keep reinterpreting the significance of its institutions, such as marriage, and the causes of their dissolution. The court clarifies and articulates the reasoning behind the reinterpretation. It will always be there to ensure the rights of the partners who are divorced and for the maintenance of their children.

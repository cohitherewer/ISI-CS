	Fugitive Histories By Githa Hariharan, Viking, Rs 450        
	Does art have a social purpose? What can an artist do when everything around him is falling apart? Can he, by expressing the horror or outrage he feels, enable us to see differently too, and so transform the way we perceive the world? Or should an artist be dismissed as useless because art by definition is re-presentation, and so can never portray the thing-in-itself? Being at best an imitation, can art stave off horrors or prevent tragedies from recurring?        
	The man at the centre of Githa Hariharans latest novel, Fugitive Histories, is an artist, Asad. He is dead when the novel begins but his beliefs and values inform the book, providing the touchstone against which the characters and events can be judged. As a Muslim who married a Hindu, read Marx, painted for a living, and taught his children to call him by his name, Asad is the vital argumentative idealist who had questioned everything that society took for granted. He left the stage when he saw the values he lived by being battered in the Godhra riots. The imaginative sympathy of the artist made Asad one with the victims. Other peoples story became his, and changed him irreversibly.        
	Asads wife, Mala, is left after his death with the legacy of his paintings, and the beliefs encoded in them. She sorts his sketchbooks in an effort to rediscover the man with whom she has spent all her adult life. The first sketch she chances upon  a darkly pencilled drawing of a man and woman is about something as simple and indescribable as that secret that can sometimes reveal itself, become an open secret for a brief and piercing moment: I am alive! We are alive! There is a chasm separating this sketch, celebrating life and its possibilities, from the the final unfinished painting Mala finds in Asads studio a few days before his death. In the latter, five men, armed with weapons ranging from a butchers knife to a screwdriver, close in upon a sixth man, who crouches on the ground. There is also another figure in the frame who stands to one side. Mala ponders over the identity of this man. Whos he... a sadistic devil... [or] an impotent god? Or perhaps he is a helpless artist [who] knows how to use his hands and eyes only when hes safe on the sidewalk, where he has a good view of the blood and gore on the street. The powerless artist, enraged by his inability to change the world, becomes one with both god and the devil.        
	As Mala tries to find some meaning in Asads death, their daughter, Sara, travels to Ahmedabad with the intention of making a documentary film on the riot-victims. She is overwhelmed by their narratives, as her father had been, but unlike Asad, she finds a way to intervene in the devastated life of at least one family. Her plan for the documentary falls through when Sara finds that she cannot simply be an observer while the people grieve. As a woman who has known how it feels to be treated like a helping of creamy butter chicken, a titbit of female flesh by groping men in city streets, she can sense a bond with the women who gather around her with their stories of mutilation and rape. Like Yasmin, who lives with her parents in one of the Muslim ghettos, Sara, with her Muslim surname, has also known the awfulness of name-calling. While refusing to be a screaming professional crusader, Sara decides to help Yasmin continue with her studies by sponsoring her education.        
	Yet Sara is no hero, as her father obviously is. The romantic charm of an artist betrayed by the inherent limitations of his calling surrounds him like a halo. Each of the words he utters acquires a prophetic ring, each of his gestures seems to have a significance beyond itself. As Mala looks back on her life, she might find her late husband worthy of veneration, but the reader only feels irritated by the tone of unflinching adoration that the novel slips into each time it describes Asad. He might have rejected his familys conservative ideology, played with a statue of Ganesh, joined protest marches and agonized over Godhra. But can these be reasons enough for summoning up a warm glow on the face each time his name is mentioned? The novel would have spoken for itself even without the author shaping the readers sympathies through the figure of Asad.         
	There are other touches in the novel that are undeniably trite. Mala attends a traditional Muslim wedding with her mother-in-law, who always reads the Quran for guidance (and is duly denounced by Asad), and finds  what else?  but a sobbing child bride. Saras boyfriend, who practises the art of stress-free living, listens to John Lennon singing of an imaginary peaceful world. Mala has a hysteric grandmother, Bala, who is Asads prototype in being a holy fool. She is branded crazy by her despotic husband, finds an object of love in Mala, and hints naughtily that Asad is her long-lost brother when the two decide to get married. Predictably, Asad connects with Bala easily, and shows that he recognizes her goodness by gifting her a fragrant champak (which makes her hide her face coyly and peep flirtatiously through the gaps between gnarled fingers) on her deathbed.         
	Such expressions of sweetness and light reach a climax where Sara visits the Sabarmati ashram. She finds Gandhis ghost there singing Ishwar Allah tere naam in his Mickey Mouse voice. He weeps when a mob baying for Muslim blood confronts him, jumps into the river, and resurfaces on the other side. Later Sara has a dream featuring, among others, Asad, Grandfather Marx, and Gandhi  not yet a ghost, but still wet from the river he recently swam across.        
	The purple patches notwithstanding, Fugitive Histories has some fine moments, especially in the section where Yasmins story is told. Here reality is reproduced as it is, with minimal intervention by the author. It is almost a relief to hear the angry clamour of the women in the dingy flats drowning the officious voice in which the rest of the novel is narrated. Fugitive Histories would have come off better had the author spent a little less time dwelling on Asads messianic qualities and more on the here-and-now of Gujarat after 2002. Ever-defeated by the reality he tries to capture, the artist is undoubtedly a tragic figure. But in the context of the Godhra carnage, to make his predicament seem more serious than that of the sufferers is to give attention where it is not due.                          ANUSUA MUKHERJEE

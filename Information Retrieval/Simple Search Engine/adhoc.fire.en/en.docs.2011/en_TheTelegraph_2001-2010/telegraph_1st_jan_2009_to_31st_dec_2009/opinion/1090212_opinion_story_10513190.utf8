	Rafael Nadal had beaten Roger Federer in Grand Slam finals on clay and grass. On February 1, in the most compelling Australian Open final in recent history, Nadal beat Federer on hardcourt over five sets to script another gripping instalment of the greatest individual rivalry in world sport. Tennis has thrived on great rivalries over the years, but it is hard to imagine any other players producing better tennis than Sundays gut-wrenching showdown.        
	This was Nadals sixth Grand Slam title, his fifth victory over Federer in the finals. Boasting a 13-6 record over his Swiss rival and possessing six Grand Slam trophies, the 22-year-old has outgrown his reputation as a clay court bully-boy to reach the realms of the games all-time greats. When Federer lost at the French Open and Wimbledon last year, he was still working his way into top form after mononucleosis. There was no reassuring back story to this loss. Among the usual barrage of statistics generally produced on such occasions, the most striking is that the Spaniard has accumulated major titles at a rate bettered in the open era only by Bjrn Borg, six titles in his first 20 majors, compared to Borgs six in 18 and Federers six in 26. For Nadal, the only one missing is the US Open, where Federer has won five in a row and where he has continually faltered by running out of steam late in the season, failing to get past the semi-finals.         
	Questioned at a press conference after the Australian Open final, Nadal sounded upbeat. I will try to win the US Open to win the four, he said, I know its going to be difficult.... The conditions are a little bit worse for my game than here in Australia. The difference is now smaller, as the Australian Open switched last year from a rubberized Rebound Ace hardcourt surface to an acrylic-coated hardcourt made by the same manufacturer that supplies the US Open. The Australian courts are, by design, appreciably slower and higher-bouncing than those in New York, thus suiting Nadal better.                 
	Challenge ahead        
	How many slams can Nadal hope to win in his career? Nadal admitted that being a left-hander makes him better suited to force Federer play more on his weaker side, the back hand, just as Federer is so effective against right-handers. At the same time, Nadal himself is susceptible to top-class left-handers, a case in point being his narrow, and somewhat fortunate, semi-final victory over his countryman, Fernando Verdasco, earlier in the tournament. But the biggest challenge Nadal faces is his intense physical style, and any drop in his fitness level will hamper his game significantly. Can he keep pace with all the effort he puts behind every shot? He already has injury issues and his coach and uncle, Toni, has rightly scripted a less demanding schedule this year.         
	Meanwhile, Federer can wait for his 14th title. With his style of play, and supreme fitness, he should be in contention for at least three years if not more. Incidentally, Sampras won his 14th slam more than two years after his previous one when he was contemplating retirement. While the guessing game, whether Nadal can better Samprass 14, will have to wait to be resolved, another intriguing one can be resolved over the next eight months. Can Nadal win all four majors in the same calendar year, last achieved by Laver in 1968?         
	The next stop is Paris and the red clay. It is hard to see anyone winning three sets off him at the French Open  he did not drop any in last years fourth consecutive victory. Then comes the Wimbledon. Will anyone bet serious money against Nadal after last years epic final? If he does win, will Federer be able to do a Rosewall? In 1956, Lew Hoad had come into the last major with three titles and two victories over Ken Rosewall in finals. At Forest Hills, however, Rosewall turned the table in the finals! Tennis, now, is in for a bonanza.

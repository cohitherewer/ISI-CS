	Given the human resource development ministrys history of being meddlesome in matters concerning higher education, it is difficult not to clutch at straws in the hope of seeing the ministry showing signs of change. The Centre has asked various state governments to form partnerships with private societies in running new colleges in the districts identified as having inadequate access to higher education. Arjun Singhs ministry has also suggested that state governments might even hand over some of these colleges to creditable private societies. What is rather unusual is that in sending out these instructions, the ministry has gone against the recommendations of the experts appointed by the ministry itself to draw up a blueprint for such colleges that wanted them to be managed entirely by the government. It is hoped that going against the grain of such advice is a considered decision on the part of the ministry and not just a stray instance of unthinking inconsistency.        
	State intervention is no guarantee at all for the excellence of newly founded institutions of higher education. But a non-interventionist State does not guarantee the solution of all problems either. It has to be kept in mind that these colleges are supposed to be centres of excellence while being the only such places in districts that could well be economically backward. This means that the private bodies running them have to be especially responsible and skilled in striking a balance between market considerations and commitment to merit. Questions of how they are going to be monitored and whom they will be accountable to have to be thought through carefully. In this, the ministry itself will have to strike a balance between not entirely washing its hands of its duties and discharging them wisely, without regressing to its old and meddlesome ways. There is surely a way of facilitating and supporting the running of institutions without stifling them or levelling them down with bureaucratic and paternalistic restrictions. State governments will also have to be responsible and balanced in discharging their brief from the Centre. Bringing backward districts into the map of quality higher education is a task that will require both sensitivity and restraint from the state and the Central governments.

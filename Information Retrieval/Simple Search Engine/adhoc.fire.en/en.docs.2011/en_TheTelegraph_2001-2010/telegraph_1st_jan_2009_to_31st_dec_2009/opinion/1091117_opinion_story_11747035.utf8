	Living in the times of Indira Gandhi was never boring; she had a penchant for making news. She passed from one dramatic event to another; in each she had a stellar role. She changed over seamlessly from being a heroine to a villain and back. She excited strong passions; in the end, she left an aftertaste which was sweet to her admirers, bitter to her haters, and spicy for all. Of the four significant prime ministers India has had since Independence, she is certainly the most memorable.        
	She stepped into her first crisis the day she became prime minister. India had just fought a war with Pakistan over incursions in Kutch. Lal Bahadur Shastri would have tackled it in his own sage, unsensational manner, but he inconveniently breathed his last while talking to General Ayub Khan about winding up the 1965 war. He left that business unfinished, and the need to finish it must have lurked in Indiras mind. But she had more urgent business to look after as she took over: namely, the looming famine of 1966.        
	She had no options in dealing with it. India had run foodgrain deficits since the late 1950s which the United States of America had filled with its own wheat surplus. Both the Americans and the Indians could see that India would have to import even more wheat during the famine than it normally did. India should have been happy to import more, for the wheat came free: most of the proceeds of selling it in the domestic market went to finance the Plan (the third five-year plan was just ending then, and deliberations were on for a fourth one).              
	There was a hitch, however. The American wheat surplus was declining, and the American cotton surplus was rising. The Americans told India that it should grow more food for itself, grow less cotton and import it from them. At an elementary level this sounded reasonable. The only problem was that the land that grows cotton cannot grow wheat. Wheat is a winter crop in the Gangetic plain (at least it was; it has been creeping southwards since then with the development of more heat-tolerant strains). Cotton is basically a crop of the black volcanic soils of the Deccan plateau. It can be replaced by bajra, jowar and ragi, but not wheat. It is far more paying than coarse grains; farmers would not have been willing to replace it with grains.        
	So there was a difference of perceptions. It could have been bridged; the two countries should have appointed a joint committee to examine the issue and find an agreed solution. But the US Congress got involved, strong words were uttered, and they hit fertile ground in Indiras paranoid mind. The conflict could have had dire consequences for India. But Indira was lucky. The Green Revolution started delivering more and more million tons of wheat from 1967 onwards, and by 1970 India no longer needed American wheat.        
	The 1971 revolt in East Pakistan was an equally fortuitous event. If it had not been for Z.A. Bhuttos vaulting ambition, Mujibur Rehman would have become Pakistans prime minister. But the West Pakistanis had an extremely parochial concept of an Urdu-speaking, beard-sporting Pakistan; they continue to have it. Mohammed Ali Jinnah, who hardly knew any language other than English, had gone to Dacca and lectured East Pakistanis that they must learn Urdu. In the end, East Pakistanis started to rebel in defence of their language. But the Pakistanis were lost in Jinnahist schizophrenia. They made up their minds that the revolt in East Pakistan was the handiwork of those Indian agents, the Hindus. They decided to complete the work begun with the Partition, and to drive the Hindus out of East Pakistan.        
	The Bangladesh war was Indiras finest achievement, not because she fought a successful war, but because, for a change, she listened. She called General Sam Manekshaw and asked him what he needed if he had to win against Pakistan. She took the shopping list he gave her, went to Moscow, and bought the materiel with a friendship treaty. Manekshaw wanted six months to prepare. She gave him the time and used it to go all round the world, telling everyone that the influx of refugees from East Pakistan was intolerable and that if Pakistan did not take them back, she would have to force it to do so. When everything was ready, she let the Indian army organize a perfect military campaign. She ended it just short of destabilizing Pakistan. And she signed a pretty generous Simla pact with Bhutto.        
	If her handling of East Pakistan was a model of sagacity, her handling of the oil crisis was a model of stupidity. The crisis began when the Arab oil producers quadrupled the price of their crude overnight in 1973. It was an international crisis; the price rise affected industrial nations at least as much as India. If Manmohan Singh had been prime minister then, he would have sought out the US president, the British prime minister and the German chancellor, and looked for some joint strategy to bring the Arabs to their senses. It was available. It was not easy, but it was costless. It would have involved making the Israelis see sense and treat Palestinians less harshly. But the Western powers were indecisive; and having called Americas bluff over East Pakistan, Indira Gandhi could hardly go West and organize joint action. She had no international options other than taking what oil the Soviet Union and Iraq would spare. So she had to absorb the impact of higher oil prices domestically. She told the Oil and Natural Gas Commission to find oil at home, and the Indian Oil Corporation to build more refineries. They both did, but it took time, and it was too late; Indira Gandhi lost power long before they could do much.              
	Indira Gandhi is best remembered for the Emergency. But the Emergency was only the last act of a play which started much earlier  with Indiras expulsion of the old Congress leaders. One can no longer recapture the drama; nor can one know what happened in the Congress meetings after Indira took over. What struck me about the split was, how poor Indira was at making friends. Not a single serious leader of the Congress accompanied her; all of them left her. Politics is the art of the possible. In a democracy, one cannot get rid of the Opposition, even in ones own party; to win, one has to make friends and split the enemies. Nehru had trouble enough with dissentients; he kicked some upstairs, tolerated some, and sidelined some. Indira was under his tutelage for five years; the art of politics is just what he was supposed to teach her. If we look at how she practised it, he was a lousy teacher  or she was a lousy student. She failed in politics.        
	The Congress had no opposition till she came; she created it single-handed  out of the Congress. She established a pattern of divisive leadership that nearly destroyed the Congress  until Narasimha Rao rescued it. It is ironic that the party ignores its saviour and worships its destroyer.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Shadow of the freebooter
                                                                                                                 SHADOW OF THE FREEBOOTER                          - A cottage industry of nuclear arms        Ashok Mitra                                    
	Nuclear proliferation is no light-hearted matter. Nonetheless, the righteous indignation the Western powers break into every time Iran or North Korea experiments with a new nuclear device cannot but invite derision. What the heck, are not Iran and North Korea following, with diligence, the precept of the free market, the first tenet of which is the right of free entry? For a liberal, neo or non-neo, the determining principle of life is acceptance of untrammelled competition in all forms of human activity. Tolerating the existence of a nuclear oligopoly cuts across that principle. Those enjoying the advantage of an early start had gone on to accumulate a frightening stockpile of nuclear weaponry. They have, at the same time, busied themselves in framing all kinds of rigid rules to protect their closed shop. On the ground of pure logic, countries outside the charmed circle have every right to resent such an inequitable arrangement and to proceed to acquire their own nuclear capability. Some of them have already succeeded in this endeavour, others like Iran and North Korea are on the threshold of success. They are a determined lot, and have not flinched from begging, borrowing and even stealing in their effort to go nuclear; an unabashed liberal should have the decency to applaud such perseverance.         
	There is bound to be shock and fury at the remark just made. The doctrine of laissez faire is alright, it will be said, in its proper place, but not where its application endangers the entire human species  in fact, all living organisms. In this particular context, free entry needs to be ruled out and the acquisition of nuclear capability must come under strict regulation. Initiatives in the genre of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty have been undertaken with this end in view. It is the moral obligation of all conscientious citizens in all climes, it will be argued, to appreciate the imperative necessity of resisting nuclear proliferation and come down heavily on misbehaving regimes such as those in Iran and North Korea.               
	Dyed-in-the-wool believers in the free market thus turn non-liberal and insist on a regulatory system in the case of weapons of mass destruction. But be reasonable, is it not absurd for the earlier entrants into the nuclear parlour to frame rules of conduct for later entrants or aspirants wanting to join the arena? Members of the nuclear oligopoly in any event are no longer in a position to issue a diktat that from now on none else is to amass nuclear weaponry. Such a fiat is unenforceable, as the United States of America has already discovered: despite its fulminations, both North Korea and Iran have continued with their nuclear programmes. The only way to prevent these countries from going ahead with their mischief is invasion. The risk involved is however much too much. Besides, countries keen to cross the nuclear barrier may well maintain that before lecturing others on the necessity of restraint, the veteran members of the club should first set an example by getting rid of their nuclear stockpile.         
	Far worse news awaits the nuclear hegemony. Technology abhors national frontiers. Fission technology, some say, has now arrived at a stage where, give or take a couple of decades, manufacture of nuclear weapons could almost be akin to cottage craft. The destructive power of the missiles produced by this cottage technology may be a shade less horrifying, but that would hardly be a comfort, especially in a situation where both nuclear technology and nuclear fuel are easily procurable in the international black market. Picture the possibility. Not necessarily a country government, but a freebooter operating from a desert outpost or an expensive cave in some rocky mountains cocks a snook at the nuclear powers and flaunts his private stock of small-scale nuclear arms. Speculation on whether the Taliban are able to enter the citadel of the Pakistani administration and gain access to its nuclear arsenal would then be quite beside the point.         
	While the awesome historical process really began with Hiroshima, the two Bushes, father and son, have in no small measure contributed to its unfolding. Their outstanding achievement is to alienate the entire Arab world. The animosity nurtured towards the US will not now easily wither away in West Asia. Generations of Arabs will be taught from the cradle to hate the Americans and those who keep their company. Even if it is not the Taliban, the threat of a footloose brigand armed with nuclear warheads itching to target the Western hemisphere will hang heavily in the air. It will usher in an uncertain phase of human existence: with the NPT, the nuclear suppliers group, the International Atomic Energy Agency and the rest of the claptrap reduced to irrelevance.        
	Admittedly, much of this is still a hypothesis. Awkward developments can, however, germinate even from a hypothesis. West Asia promises to be the locale of chaos and mayhem for the next few decades. Suicide bombers will every day constitute the lead item in the media, hundreds will die, schools and hospitals will be blasted away. Israel will be an integral part of this landscape, the quintessential enemy within. It will have enough resources and military capability to overpower the Arabs, the sniper attacks will still not abate. American presidents will be at their wits end, but will have no solution to offer.         
	The major victim of this uncertain state of affairs will be the ordinary Israeli householder. Arabs will keep getting killed; they have embarked on a permanent war against the infidels who have occupied their land. Daily mournings in Arab homes will be accepted as a way of life. The Arabs will remain by and large poor. That will not stop them from weaving, non-stop, dreams of taking revenge upon the Americans and the Israelis; they will act according to the script the dreams nudge them to write. The script may even include the sub-dream of nuking Israel off the face of earth.               
	The Israelis, six million of them, will feel suffocated in this environment. Culturally their affinity is with the Americans and the Europeans. Economically, they again have their peers in the US and West Europe. They nonetheless have to live in a perilous war zone, constantly subject to sniper attacks, hemmed in from all sides by hostile Arab territory. There is an affliction human beings suffer from known as weariness. At a certain stage, the six million Israelis might begin to experience a kind of exhaustion, enough was enough, why could not they migrate to the US or, alternatively, return to Europe from where their parents and grandparents had once arrived in the wake of the Balfour Declaration? The US can easily absorb a few extra millions; the strong Jewish lobby will see to that. Anyway, some half-a-million Israelis already hold American passports. No doubt a transfer cost is involved, but once back in Europe or settled in America, they will have peace of mind and escape from the insecurity of a besieged existence surrounded, practically on all sides, by the Arab enemy. Should this mindset spread its empire, it could be euthanasia time; the history of the past six decades would be a futile chapter, Israelis would walk away from Israel.         
	A confidential study sponsored by the Central Intelligence Agency has apparently gone along with this prognosis. It is an unusual role the CIA has been called upon to play, that of Cassandra. But there is that other emerging phenomenon too, the so-called reality byte.

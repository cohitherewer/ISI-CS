                                                                            Thursday , November 12 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                              THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK                          - Dalal Street should not hope for too much in the short run					 					      BHASKAR DUTTA                                                      
	Stock markets all over the world have been fluctuating a great deal during the course of the last month or so. There was much recent euphoria that the global economy was slowly but surely climbing out of the worldwide recession. But this optimism seems to have been replaced by a significantly more cautious assessment about the future. Many analysts feel that the process of recovery in the major economies will be much slower than was anticipated a month ago. Perhaps, this pessimism has been at least partly fuelled by American unemployment figures, which continue to remain very high, despite the massive stimulus packages provided by the American government.        
	However, the economic outlook is brighter on the other side of the Atlantic. The euro zone region certainly seems to have emerged from the downturn. There are reports that output in October rose at its fastest in two years. Perhaps a more authentic estimate comes from the European Commission, which now expects aggregate GDP in the euro zones to rise by 0.20 per cent next year. This negligible rate of growth needs to be viewed from the proper perspective  the earlier estimate was that there would be an absolute drop in output in 2010. However, even the commission sounds a note of warning, pointing out that several national economies in the region may slow down once the effects of the stimulus packages taper off. So, we are not out of the woods as yet.              
	The movements in the Sensex have been quite similar to the trends witnessed in the major stock exchanges around the world. The Sensex plummeted during the first few days in November, reaching 15,000. The steep fall in the Sensex reflected investors fears that the Indian economy would fail to grow at a fast rate if the world economy continued to slump. That these apprehensions were not unreasonable were confirmed by the recently released trade figures for the Indian economy. The woes of the export industries continue unabated. Indian exports declined by 30 per cent in dollar terms during the period, April-September, this year. The only silver lining is that the rate of decline has been gradually slowing down, and there are hopes that exports will revive during the course of the next few months. Nevertheless, there is little doubt that those Indian companies, which depend heavily on export markets, will not declare high dividends next year.        
	As I write this, the Sensex has resumed its upwards march, and has climbed back to just over 16,000. While this is quite a distance from where it was not so long ago, the reversal of the downward trend is certainly welcome. The immediate cause of the improvement in the Indian stock market was the announcement by the government that it would resume the disinvestment exercise in a limited manner. In particular, the first stage will involve the disinvestment of those public-sector enterprises which have been earning profits for the last three years. The government wants to list them on the stock exchange. According to Sebi norms, at least 10 per cent of their shares must then be publicly owned.        
	The government has also announced that the proceeds from the sale of shares in these public-sector enterprises will be earmarked for social-sector spending and investment in infrastructure. This announcement is, at least, partly for political reasons. Opponents of disinvestment  and there are many of them  will find it more difficult to resist this step if the ostensible purpose of the disinvestment exercise is to increase expenditure in sectors that are uncontroversial.        
	But, of course, this is at least partly disingenuous. The government has been silent on whether the increase in, say, social-sector spending will be beyond the level that was planned before the current round of disinvestment. If there is no net increase in spending in these priority sectors, then it is deceitful to state that the proceeds from the disinvestment exercise will be earmarked for expenditure in specific sectors.        
	Having said that, there is little reason to oppose the latest attempt at disinvestment. The sale of just 10 per cent of the shares ensures that (for better or for worse) effective operational control of these enterprises remains in the hands of the government. The positive aspect is that the proceeds will swell the coffers of the cash-starved government, which has had to spend heavily in financing the stimulus package. It will also ensure that the government has no need to increase taxes in the near future. Indeed, the finance minister has already hinted that tax rates may be slightly lower once the new tax codes are introduced.              
	Of course, these positive effects of the disinvestment exercise will not be felt for some time to come. Moreover, the effects will be too small to have any significant impact either on the growth rate of the overall economy or on the profits of individual companies. So, why was there such a dramatic improvement in the health of the Indian stock market?        
	Perhaps, Dalal Street brokers hope that the disinvestment exercise will be the precursor of a new round of economic reforms. During the last year or so, even the die-hard proponent of the market mechanism shied away from promoting market-friendly reforms  the global recession gave capitalism a bad name. However, the relative prosperity and stability of the Indian economy may have revived hopes that the government will introduce some reforms.        
	Coincidentally, the prime minister has, during the course of a recent speech at the India Economic Summit, also announced that the government will pursue economic reforms in order to promote a higher growth rate. Manmohan Singh mentioned that reforms, particularly in the financial sector, were a necessary step in order to increase the growth rate. He also stated that the government would soon take steps to attract larger inflows of foreign direct investment since the domestic savings rate is not high enough to finance the required volume of investment in infrastructure.        
	These words must be music to the ears of Dalal Street brokers. But, they are well-advised not to hope for too much in the short run. At least some of the reforms  for instance, in insurance  will require new legislation. It is doubtful whether the prime minister will be able to muster enough support for the more radical reforms  even the Congress is quite divided on this issue. Perhaps, the best that the pro-reformers can hope for are small or ad hoc reforms. Even this looked so unlikely not so long ago.

                                                                                                                 TWO WOMEN                                                    
	India now has a woman as its president and a woman as the Speaker of the Lok Sabha. These should not be scoffed at since they reveal that there are women in India competent enough to occupy offices that till very recently were male preserves. This is a major transformation in the history of the Indian republic. The struggle for the empowerment of women and to end gender discrimination has never been a strident one in India. Feminists in India have never taken to the streets to burn their underwear. But this has not stalled change. The change is visible in many arenas of public life: in academics, in the media, in the corporate world and in administration. The sphere of politics bears the stamp of very powerful and articulate women. It is therefore in the fitness of things that women should occupy two of the most important offices in Indian democracy.        
	It is important, however, to see the elevation of Meira Kumar and Pratibha Patil in a wider context and not only as evidence of the empowerment of women in India. They are steps in the right direction, yet they may signify nothing. In the heart of Indias darkness live women who are treated no better than chattel by their menfolk. Women are still discriminated against and are more often than not the victims of the worst forms of abuse. They are often burnt for their failure to bring dowry, or as satis on their dead husbands pyres. These are features of Indias social life that cannot be denied despite the progress on many fronts and despite  and this needs to be added with some emphasis  the presence of Ms Patil and Ms Kumar in the Rashtrapati Bhavan and the Lok Sabha respectively. This is not to cast aspersions on the abilities of these two women but to underline that their achievements cannot lead to indifference towards the general darkness and gloom that engulf most women in India. One president and one Speaker do not make for empowerment. The point must be made that both Ms Kumar and Ms Patil have received their offices as gifts from the party which they had served in the past. Political calculations worked in the endowment of these gifts. There may even have been an effort to create the impression that the problems of women are being addressed in positive terms in Indian society. Such an impression does not tell the entire story, just as tokenism does not solve any problems.

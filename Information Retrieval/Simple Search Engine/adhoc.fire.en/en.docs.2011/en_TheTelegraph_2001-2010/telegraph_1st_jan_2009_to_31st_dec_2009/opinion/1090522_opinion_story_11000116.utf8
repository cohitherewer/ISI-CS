	Good governance may not always lead to an election victory, but bad arithmetic is a sure recipe for a defeat. Nitish Kumar may have made Bihar a little less lawless than it had been for many years before him. He has had some success in giving the state back a semblance of administration. It is possible that a relatively more secure life in Patna and fewer kidnappings for ransom gave Mr Kumar an edge in these polls. But the vote shares of different parties suggest that the success of the Bharatiya Janata Party-Janata Dal (United) alliance has less to do with Mr Kumars administrative abilities than with his adversaries faults. It is not uncommon for Indian politicians to be deluded by mistaken notions of self-importance. Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan were guilty of a much worse mistake they got the poll arithmetic completely wrong. They not only overestimated their own strength but also grossly underestimated that of the Congress. The shifting of a large section of Mr Prasads Muslim support base to the Congress helped neither; it only split the votes of Mr Kumars opponents. With the United Progressive Alliance in tatters, the chief ministers task was made much easier.         
	As in Uttar Pradesh, the Congress took a calculated risk in going it alone in Bihar. But the partys moral and political gains seem to be much higher than what its tally of two seats would immediately suggest. Its decision to cut to size such unreliable allies as Mr Prasads Rashtriya Janata Dal and Mr Paswans Lok Janshakti Party is a measure of the old partys renewed faith in itself. That the results have proved the decision correct is only incidental. Bihar, like UP, is expected to be a laboratory for the Congresss latest strategy to rebuild itself. A resurgent Congress can do away with some negative compulsions of coalition politics. Given the complexity of caste and other factors, it may still need allies. But the focus will shift from riding on the back of allies to standing on its feet. The process may take time and involve some electoral setbacks. Yet this is the approach that best suits a national party, and the Congresss success in these polls has created the right conditions for pursuing it. Electoral arithmetic apart, it is time the Congress sincerely worked towards an alternative to the politics of caste and religion.

	Poetry on the perilous seas                
	FOR PEPPER AND CHRIST (Penguin, Rs 399) by Keki N. Daruwalla is an accomplished first novel by the renowned poet and short-story writer. From the first sentence, the cadence of a distinct voice lingers with the readers  Those were the good old days  time itself took ages to move its ass. It is this deadpan tone, tinged with mild drollery, that frames the story, and gives it a delightfully ambivalent flavour. The narrators voice is richly layered: sporadically bursting forth with historical information, tying up the loose ends of the human web spun all over the high seas, and even striking out with an acerbic wit. Set in the age of the spice trade, this is as much a political tale, laced with intrigue, power and ambition, as a deeply romantic saga about eternally insatiable wanderlust, its delights and sorrows. In envisioning the destinies of the missionary, Brother Figuero, the wanderer, Taufiq, or of the artist, Etesham, Daruwalla leaves his mark as a poet. In the same way, his vast learning is astutely captured in the account of the deepening tussle between Islam and Christianity. But history, in this tale, is not shorn of a human face; in fact, it becomes all the more vivid because of the pulsating force of emotions that run through the plot.                                    STARTING AND RUNNING A CATERING BUSINESS Macmillan, Rs 385) by Carol Godsmark promises to give out the recipe for a successful venture into the food and hospitality industry. Beginning with the logistics of the business (capital, partnership, renting a premise, kitchen equipment and transportation) to the fine art of satisfying clients, this book is a perfect DIY handbook for starters. However, the model of hygiene and entrepreneurship followed is exclusively Western, and therefore might not work all that conveniently for indigenous clientele and caterers.                           WHITE MAN FALLING (HarperCollins, Rs 250) by Mike Stocks is a hilarious first novel set in an obscure town called Mullaipuram in Tamil Nadu. The plot revolves around one R.M. Swaminathan, a typical Indian patriarch, burdened with half-a-dozen daughters. But Swami, as his folks call him, is hardly a benignly cynical figure like the bemused Mr Bennet. A police officer, he has a flaring temper to boot. While beating up a suspect in the lock-up, he suffers a heart attack, which leaves his speech indistinct, and deprives him of the neighbours respect. Things start looking up only when a white man suddenly falls out of the clear blue sky before his feet. Swami is immediately perceived to be a man of god and his life changes forever.

	Sex workers are not criminals. At least, not by virtue of sex work alone. The suggestion of the Supreme Court that prostitution be legalized may not have focused particularly on this truth, but legalization would make it official. The court has, in effect, suggested what sex workers groups in various parts of the country have been demanding for years now. In principle, sex work can be regarded as any other kind of work; it is upto the individual whether he or she wishes to sell their body or their musical talent in order to make a living. The question becomes complicated, at least partly, because intimate sexual contact with the body is loaded with cultural and social significance, and is posited, ideologically, as shameful trade pitted against the sacred institution of marriage.        
	Any approach to the legalization of sex work has to be freed of this baggage. But around the core issue of legalization, the questions are various and nuanced. One is the issue of decriminalization. Soliciting and procuring are both criminal activities in India at present, and the Prevention of Immoral Traffic Act is supposed to be implemented against these as well as against child prostitution and forced prostitution. In practice, however, PITA becomes an instrument of blackmail against the sex worker; it is she who pays, in cash and kind, not only the police and local musclemen, but also procurers and brothel-owners and a whole network of underworld figures who appear on her limited horizon. This is apart from the violence and insecurity to which she is routinely subject. Her client is never penalized. In some countries in which prostitution is legal, paying for sex is punishable. The details of the way legalization of sex work are worked out, therefore, reflect that particular societys moral thinking in interesting ways. But legalizing the profession may at least free sex workers from ceaseless harassment.        
	There is another argument for legalization. Bringing hidden activity out into the light is the surest way of ridding it of the aura of crime and illegality. It would close down routes of illegal income from sex workers, and grant them the freedom to be the determining agents of their own lives. Besides, it would have a hugely positive impact on the identification and treatment of AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. At the same time, legalizing sex work  should India decide to do so  would need careful study of the systems and experiences of countries in which sex work is legal. Because of the unique status of the body in human culture and the burdensome associations of the sex act  from love, procreation, delight and worship to exploitation, coercion, violence, transgression and betrayal  there is no one perfect route that legalization can follow. India would need to evolve laws in such a way as to protect the newly lawful sex worker from the grasp of big criminal organizations, and to ensure that it does not become a favoured destination of human traffickers and sex tourists.

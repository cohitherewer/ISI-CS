                                                                                                                 OUT OF TUNE                                                    
	Politics is known to make strange bedfellows. But even by the dubious standards of politics, the coming together of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and Chandra-babu Naidu of the Telegu Desam Party, and the formers wooing of Naveen Patnaik to form a third front are events that stretch the imagination. The CPI(M)s election manifesto as well as its general secretarys many statements make it abundantly clear that the party has not moved beyond the hidebound positions it upheld in the high noon of socialism. The CPI(M) does not believe in economic reforms and liberalization. These are its ideological colours. But these colours do not match what Messrs Naidu and Patnaik wear on their sleeves. Both are known for their advocacy of liberalization and capitalism; moreover, Mr Naidu is an eager supporter of policies put forward by the World Bank. What is anathema to the comrades is welcome to some of its new-found allies. Herein lies the principal contradiction of what is being projected as the third front.        
	There is no denying that there is space in Indian politics for a non-Bharatiya Janata Party-non-Congress formation. Indeed, there is space enough for many such formations  and there could be theoretically a third or a fourth or a fifth front. The erosion of the Congress and the BJP  and this is what makes the conception of a third front possible  is rooted in a profound change in the Indian polity. Political analysts have noted that over the last two decades and more, Indian democracy has experienced a deepening. People and groups who previously had no access to decision-making have become empowered and assertive enough to have their voices heard and their interests reflected in politics. Such people and groups want their own independent platforms since they feel that the two major national parties do not adequately represent their concerns. These groups articulate their politics through a variety of overlapping identities  from caste to region to community. Whatever the articulation, the politics is one of defiance against a national label that seeks to speak for all identities. Unfortunately, for Prakash Karat, the general secretary of the CPI(M), his party has national aspirations. Tactically and ideologically, the CPI(M) cannot remain for too long within the third front. Even opportunism cannot be stretched too far.

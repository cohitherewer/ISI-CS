                                                                                                                 Between dream and reality                                  This above All: Khushwant Singh                          More than a housewife                                        
	Seeing the state of turmoil Pakistan is in today, I wonder what its chief architect and founding-father, Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, would have made of it. Neither he nor any Indian leader of the time, with the sole exception of M.K. Gandhi, visualized that the creation of Pakistan would take a toll of a million lives and uproot 10 million people from their homes. Did Jinnah realize that the halving of the country in two regions (West and East Pakistan) separated by thousands of miles of a resentful India could not last very long? Only C. Rajagopalachari, with an uncanny insight, predicted its breaking up in 1971. Did Jinnah realize that what was left of the Pakistan he created would be ruled by a succession of dictators and venal politicians for most of the 61 years of its existence? Could he have foreseen that instead of modernizing themselves, Pakistanis would succumb to the influence of medieval-minded mullahs who would put women in burqas, close down girls schools, cinemas and music shops? If he could have foreseen these developments, he might have changed his mind. He wanted to continue living in his mansion in Bombay and perhaps to be even buried there. He must be turning in his grave in Karachi.        
	Unfortunately, he was obsessed with the fear of Indian Muslims being persecuted by Hindus in a free India and could think of no other solution than to demand a separate Muslim state. This comes out clearly in an interview he gave in June 1944 to Teja Singh, a retired IAS officer, who was then a cub reporter for Mainsteam and an active member of the Kashmir Youth Congress in Srinagar. When Teja Singh asked him, Do you think it possible in any majority government, particularly in the modern conditions, to persecute a nation of crores inhabiting large tracts of land? I ask this question because the fear of persecution is at the root of the demand for Pakistan, at first Jinnah denied he had used the word, persecution. When shown the text of his speech in which he had used it, he brushed it aside and said, Muslims demand Pakistan for their having a fundamentally different ideology and culture, and persecute is not the right word. He further went on to assert, Religion must be the basis of all politics. It was a strange thing coming from the lips of one who enjoyed a glass of sherry and ham sandwiches at lunch. He was born a Shia Muslim. Today it is the Shias who are being targeted by Sunni fanatics. Jinnah also believed that rulers of Indian states were sovereigns, entitled to shape the future of the states they ruled.        
	The interview makes strange reading as it shows how far the great Qaid was from the ground realities.                
	The lady in white                
	A charming story doing the rounds in the capitals elite society is about Gursharan Kaurs efforts to keep a low profile. Soon after her husband became the prime minister, she found herself in a large reception given in honour of a visiting dignitary: as is her habit, she took a seat in the outer periphery and sat enjoying her tea and cakes all by herself. A lady, the wife of a minister who herself presided over a few societies, saw this plainly dressed woman in white salwar-kameez and introduced herself with all the honorifics of her husband and herself, and asked Gursharan what she did. I am a housewife, replied Gursharan.        
	And what does your husband do? asked the lady.        
	He is in the Prime Ministers Office, she replied.        
	Is he in government service?        
	Yes.        
	In the Indian foreign service?        
	No.        
	In the Indian administrative service?        
	No.        
	Is he a secretary, joint secretary, or a deputy secretary?        
	Neither.        
	At her wits ends, the lady finally asked Gursharan, So what exactly does your husband do in the PMO?        
	He is the prime minister.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | From the crossroads to a new destiny
                                                                                                                 FROM THE CROSSROADS TO A NEW DESTINY                              Commentarao - S.L. Rao                        Spread over too many departments				                                             
	It is a relief. We no longer have the nightmare of a United Progressive Alliance government with communist support, with the latter hostile to reforms in the public sector, to the delivery of subsidies to reduce poor targeting and waste, tax reforms that reduce the burden on the present higher slabs, and to incentives for private and foreign investment. The nuclear agreement can now move forward to take the Obama administration on board. Foreign policy can objectively consider how to help the American intervention in Afghanistan. A new coalition dominated by the Congress can have more coherent policies.         
	Every new government faces major new challenges, this one perhaps more than most. These include the global economic crisis, a domestic economy that requires drastic belt-tightening, an extremely unstable neighbourhood, especially in Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Afghanistan, with the rising power of China and its belligerence at our borders. Our intelligence-gathering and coordination remain pathetic.         
	We have to correct huge deficiencies in physical infrastructure, agriculture investments, social infrastructure of health, education and other human development indicators, as also reduce the colossal wastes on targeting and delivery of all subsidies. Unfortunately, the coalition will still have venal politicians like those from the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, holding back proper implementation of sensible polices. (DMK ministers hijacked telecommunications reforms and held up the national roads construction programmes. In health, the DMK-allied minister focused on peripheral issues versus the basic health issues demanding attention.) But the Congress numbers will give it more freedom to resist such politicians.        
	Indian governance has too many weaknesses. Policy is hardly debated in the parliament and the legislatures. There are too many ministries and no coordination between them. Thus state governments have ministries for primary, secondary, higher, technical and professional education. The Central government has ministries for power, atomic energy, renewable energy, coal and petroleum. Health is distributed among ministries: pharmaceuticals is with chemicals, health and family welfare looks after medical education, hospitals, family planning, and so on; water is separated from sanitation; women and child welfare is a separate ministry. Between these ministries that are all dealing with the issues of health, including public health, there is little coordination. Regulatory agencies are structured in the same way.              
	The administrative system is in poor shape, being unable to handle the challenges of large development expenditures and the devolution of authority to local bodies. The police forces are demoralized, inefficient, corrupt and heavily politicized. No political party is willing to give them more autonomy in intelligence gathering, investigation and prosecution. No party wants to improve actual policing and restore peoples confidence in the ability of the State to safeguard citizens lives and property. The judiciary is also overburdened and does not attract the best talent.        
	Legitimate aspirations for development among our minorities, tribal populations and lower castes, poorly addressed for decades, must be met if the spreading Naxalite- and SIMI-type movements are to be curbed. We must meet the demographic challenges and opportunities posed by urbanization and the growing young population.         
	We have to reorient policies to take advantage of the new American resolve to make Pakistan focus on destroying al Qaida and the Taliban. These are in our national interest, and we must consider how much we should be involved in Afghanistan. Nepal is yet to find its democratic feet without a larger space for China in its policies. We have to accept that in Nepal kingship is dead and live with a Nepal that is democratic. Sri Lanka, after allegedly defeating V. Prabhakaran, must be encouraged to recognize the legitimate aspirations of its Tamil population. We cannot have the Americans walking away from Afghanistan without destroying the Taliban and al Qaida and making Pakistan a better governed nation, and not a fount of terrorism. There are other major issues to resolve: Myanmar, the Middle East, and strategic economic and resource interests in Africa. China is a looming threat and an increasingly important economic power.        
	There are many other challenges. In the economy, the fiscal deficit is a huge worry; a new wave of tax reforms is overdue to take account of the changing price levels and the structure of the economy. Privatization of state-owned enterprises will add to revenues and improve the performance of these enterprises. Measures to curb the volatility of foreign exchange inflows and hence of reserves and the rupee value are necessary. We must create policies to stimulate investment  private and foreign  and savings. The declining state of agriculture requires investment and land reforms. The real economy of agriculture and industry that has been overtaken by services, despite our large number of the very poor, must be restored to health. The quality of our education and training in all respects is poor. Few bright people want to be in teaching at any level. The demographic dividend is in danger of becoming a demographic liability.               
	These are only a few of the pressing challenges. A Congress government under Manmohan Singh will work on these lines. Without the communists, it can move fast on these issues.        
	In foreign policy, we need to support the Obama administration on Afghanistan, help evolve a new approach to Palestine and the Arab world. An honest review of the pros and cons of military involvement in Afghanistan is required. We must support Indian companies, including private ones, to compete effectively with China in our quest for energy and mineral resources in other countries, financially and through our foreign policies. We must accept the reality of the change in Nepal and not be stuck on old friendships with the former king and his people. We must work with the Sri Lankan government, offering arms and financial support, but give the Lankan Tamils greater autonomy than they have today.        
	We must move quickly on the privatization of state-owned enterprises, to give autonomy to managements, raise resources and enable the enterprises to stimulate the economy and not to hold it back as have the Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited, the Food Corporation of India, ONGC, and so on. Subsidies must be reformed, perhaps by using smart cards and without procurement and physical handling of goods. These two measures can help control the deficit. We must curb the inflows of volatile foreign funds by removing the exemption from short-term capital gains tax to funds from Mauritius, Cyprus, and others, and make the regime of participatory notes more transparent. By rethinking policies on foreign direct investment to make it easier while safeguarding security, we can make our currency and reserves more stable. We must be cautious about allowing foreign private banks free play in India and the Reserve Bank of India must keep a hawk eye on new financial products of the kind that have devastated the American economy. Savings and domestic investment must be stimulated. On social infrastructure of health and education, there is a lot to be done both on quantity and quality. We have sufficient literature on what needs to be done. Better regulation, more private investment, and more autonomy need to be introduced in all sectors.         
	The parliament and legislatures must enforce attendance on members. The Speakers must be more vigorous in enforcing discipline. Non-performing ministers must be disciplined. Perhaps we should have three deputy prime ministers, for energy, health and education. All the related and separate present ministries must come under one of these so that coordination is ensured.              
	Administrative, legal, judicial and police reforms are urgently required. The Veerappa Moily administrative reforms commission, law commission, judicial reforms commission and the numerous reports on police reforms have made excellent recommendations which must be implemented.         
	India is at the crossroads of becoming a great power by the turn of the half-century. This new government can make it get there.

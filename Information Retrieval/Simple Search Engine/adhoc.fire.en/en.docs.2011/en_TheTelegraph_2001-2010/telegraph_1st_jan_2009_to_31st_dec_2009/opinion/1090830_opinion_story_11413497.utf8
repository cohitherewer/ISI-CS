	 The usual excuses                  
	 Sir  The private bus owners demand for financial relief from the state government to help them phase out old buses is unjustified. They are like all other businessmen and do not deserve special privileges. They are not only making profits on operating the bus services, but are also avoiding extra expenses by not replacing the old buses. They also get incentives by way of bank loans and subsidies. So, their claim of incurring losses on their businesses is untrue. In fact, the increase in the number of buses points to the contrary.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Captive voice          
	Sir  The editorial, Fake mercy (Aug 13), rightly says that dictators have their own ideas of law and justice. The military junta in Myanmar is throttling democracy with its tyranny. It seems to be hardly bothered by the growing international protest against the prolonged house arrest of Aung San Suu Kyi. The junta ignored the request of the secretary-general of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, to release Suu Kyi. It did not even allow him to visit Suu Kyi during her detention. This reveals the juntas utter disregard for the UN. Although the Security Council has expressed serious concern at the conviction and sentencing of Suu Kyi, the UN has not got any opportunity to compel the junta to release her. The UN cannot take any drastic step against Myanmar as long as China continues to strongly oppose any such move.          
	India had awarded Suu Kyi the Jawaharlal Nehru Award for International Understanding in 1993. Instead of being a silent spectator, India should join the world in reproaching the juntas stance. Otherwise, despite being the worlds largest democracy, it may be seen as a nation that remains unmoved by such a disgraceful threat to democracy.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
R. Choudhuri, Calcutta

      
	Sir  The chief of Myanmars ruling junta, General Than Shwe, has indeed shown fake mercy by first sentencing Aung San Suu Kyi to three years of hard labour, and then reducing the term by half. The junta will now use the verdict to prevent Suu Kyi from contesting the elections next year, thereby denying the people of Myanmar democracy and the rule of law. The editorial, Fake mercy, is right in concluding that it is not enough to treat Myanmar as a pariah state. The UN should do everything it can to ensure that Myanmars people are freed from oppression and misrule.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Second sex          
	Sir  According to a recent survey, Delhi had a positive sex ratio (1,004 girls born for every 1,000 boys) in 2008 for the first time ever. This is a welcome change from the usual reports of female foeticide in India. However, gender-biased abortion is still a big problem in this country. Social evils such as the dowry system have led to the popular perception of a girl child being a burden. Despite sex-determination tests being banned in India, corrupt doctors and clinics allowing such tests under cover have made the situation worse.          
	To rid society of such awful practices, peoples awareness should be raised, especially among the underdeveloped sections. In this context, the Kerala governments intention to reserve 50 per cent seats in the local administration sets a good precedent for fighting prejudice towards women. Now that India has several women in key administrative positions, including the president and the Lok Sabha Speaker, perhaps public attitude towards girl children will change in the coming years.          
	Yours faithfully,

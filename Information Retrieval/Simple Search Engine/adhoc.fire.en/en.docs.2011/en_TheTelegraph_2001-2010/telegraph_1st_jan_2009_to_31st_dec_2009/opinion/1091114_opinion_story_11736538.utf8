The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A foreign country
                                                                            Saturday , November 14 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                              A FOREIGN COUNTRY                          - What did Britain remember on Remembrance Sunday?					 					      Sunanda K. Datta-Ray                        Roll-call of battles				                                             
	Watching last Sundays solemn ritual at the Cenotaph in London, I wondered how many in the dense crowd noticed the prominent role accorded to Commonwealth high commissioners (including Indias Nalin Surie) while the ambassadors even of the United States of America or France were as conspicuously absent as the European Union flag. Its a moot point, too, if the Remembrance Sunday (Poppy Day we used to call it in Calcutta) roll-call of battles far away and long ago  Cyprus, Malta, Malaya  to whose dead the Queen also paid tribute, held any meaning for Britains young.        
	The past is a foreign country, as the novelist, L.P. Hartley, wrote, probably even more so for modern Indians. I once heard a non-resident Indian academic dismiss the Greater India Society (Ramesh Chandra Majumdar, Suniti Kumar Chatterji and Kalidas Nag), which extolled the glories of Suvarnabhumi, as an attempt by Britains slaves to show their rulers that they, too, had their own slaves in South-east Asia! Bombast is contemptible, but no nation can come to grips with the challenge of the future except with the confidence of past achievement. That NRI professor hoped to escape his past by running away to the West. But flight is not an option for the bulk of Indians  or, for that matter, Britons facing economic crisis, political marginalization and the pain without reward of Tony Blairs international commitments.        
	Though Blair spoke of Britain emerging from its post-empire malaise, the empire was relegated to the oblivion of Ozymandiass works long before his Cool Britannia. Those locals who can afford the Victoria and Albert Museums steep admission fee gawp at the opulence of the current Maharaja exhibition with no sense of connection. Only two days before Remembrance Sunday, a military buff lamented at a reception in the panelled parlour of Peterhouse, reputedly Cambridges smallest, oldest and snootiest college, that no one had heard of the Viceroys Commission. Another man interjected, No one has heard of the viceroy!              
	The spread of ignorance is truly awesome, and not confined only to the past. A young Oxford graduate who sought a briefing on the eve of flying to India for some highly intellectual project stared blankly when I said that not all Indian politicians were Vicars of Bray. The cleric in the anonymous 18th-century poem who turned his coat to suit every regime from Charles II to George I (And this is law, I will maintain/ Until my dying day, sir/ That whatsoever king may reign/ Ill be the Vicar of Bray, sir) has always been a popular byword for opportunism. An educated young Englishmans ignorance of the analogy might suggest that opportunism is no longer worth comment.        
	Meanwhile, not far from Peterhouses cobbled precincts, the lists were about to be opened to sell Cambridge University Library. Since it will be named after the biggest donor, future generations of Cantabrigians might be surprised to be told it was ever anything other than the Mittal or Hinduja (or Bill and Melissa Gates) Library. Tesco, the supermarket, is also in the running to bestow its name on that abode of seven million books and other items. From the profound to the profane, and I am reminded of the crass, but mercifully abortive, attempt to name a room at the Bengal Club after a generous finance company. Vulgarity always betokens the flight of values.        
	Nothing could be more vulgar  and cruel  than the mass-circulation Sun newspapers suspected manipulation of a mothers grief to attack Gordon Brown. When Jacqui Janess 20-year-old son, Jamie, a Grenadier Guardsman, was killed in Afghanistan, Brown wrote to her by hand, an unthinkable courtesy for most prime ministers. But instead of responding graciously or making allowance for Browns near-blindness and scrawling handwriting, she complained that the letters 25 alleged spelling mistakes insulted her sons memory and her bereavement. Browns placatory telephone call made matters worse, provoking her to blame her sons death on the absence of helicopters and equipment, and demand shrilly how he would like it if his son bled to death. The worst part is that her moves appear to be monitored, if not dictated, by the Sun whose owner, Rupert Murdoch, has now nailed his colours to the Tory mast.        
	If Afghanistans Helmand battlefield, from where the bodies are being flown back, seems less remote than Cyprus, Malta and Malaya where Britain once defended a direct interest, its for a bizarre local reason. Beards and burqas, headscarves and ankle-length robes in streets, shops, restaurants and offices, and the ownership of institutions like Harrods and the Cromwell Hospital, make Britain appear almost like a part of the Islamic ummah. Cynics will argue that Prince Charless wish to exchange the monarchs Defender of the Faith title for Defender of Faiths is unnecessary because with floods of immigrants from Somalia, Iraq and Afghanistan adding to those from Bangladesh and Bosnia, the faith defended will no longer be Christianity.        
	Whoever succeeds Brown (with the Murdoch empires help) will have to decide whether the people of these offshore islands must continue to suffer death because Blair thought he could restore Britains greatness by making George W. Bushs wars and vendettas his own. Conquest demands sacrifice, and we are familiar in India with neglected acres of crumbling British graves. Iraqs toll of 179 British lives and Afghanistans 231 up to the time of writing may even seem small. But mothers like Jacqui Janes cannot reflect that their loss is the price of national glory, as in the 18th and 19th centuries. Constant media depictions of flag-draped coffins, booming salutes, Last Post and widows in black sporting a new medal that has been struck make their loss seem more poignant.              
	Worse, no one knows why Britain is at war. First, it was to avert a nuclear holocaust because Saddam Hussein was wickedly manufacturing weapons of mass destruction. Then to punish the perpetrators of 9/11. The third aim was to transform Iraq and Afghanistan into Westminster-style democracies. The objective was then changed to making Britains streets safer by destroying Taliban (and, by extension, al Qaida) terrorists in their own stomping ground. Finally, nuclear-armed Pakistan had to be protected.        
	Lately, one hears it whispered that a military solution isnt feasible. Brown talks of Afghanistanization of Afghanistan, of handing back Helmand province and an exit strategy. There are hints of negotiations sooner or later with moderate elements in the Taliban. Some 64 per cent of Britons consider the war unwinnable and 63 per cent want the 9,500 British troops withdrawn as swiftly as possible. As Brown gropes from one justification to another for a war that is not of his making, his bumbling ineffectiveness is a symbol of the country he leads.              
	In Marlborough House, not far from his residence, George V and Queen Mary stare severely out of gilded frames, their imperial crowns sitting beside them, as bags are packed for the Commonwealth summit in Trinidad and Tobago. It will mark the 60th anniversary of what the formidably articulate secretary-general, Kamlesh Sharma, a spinner of words if ever there was one, calls a great global group. Whether or not the deliberations in Port of Spain will encourage the globalization of wisdom as Sharma predicts, the Commonwealth is still a worthy organization that its 32 small and vulnerable members probably still need. The Queen is said to be an ardent votary. But when her grandmother bequeathed Marlborough House to the Commonwealth, she probably saw it as a modernism for Empire (like studio for bedsitter) and would have been aghast to hear Zambias Kenneth Kaunda threatening to expel Britain during the Rhodesian crisis. Not many Britons would notice if that happened today. Few would be seriously concerned. The past is, indeed, a foreign country.

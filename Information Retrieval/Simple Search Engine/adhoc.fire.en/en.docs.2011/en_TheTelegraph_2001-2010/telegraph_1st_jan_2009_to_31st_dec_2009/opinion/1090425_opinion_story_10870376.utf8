	Of the three artists who recently showed their work at Studio 21 (Intersection, April 3-18), Sougata Das seemed to be the most promising. Beginning with pen-and-ink drawings in the classic tradition of Bengal School grotesquerie (the satirical portraits of Gaganendranath or the illustrations for Shey by Rabindranath), Das moved on to a few impressive paintings in acrylic. Although technically accomplished, the drawings ran the risk of appearing slightly derivative (picture). The same is true for the acrylics. No doubt, the startling crimson, blue and green highlight the powerful drama, substantiated by the story-telling mode of these images. But the pervasive presence of Picasso and Paritosh Sen leaves one with a feeling of dj vu. Das makes a sincere effort to engage with art history, but a close fidelity to familiar icons limits his individual style.        
	Satyajit Roy, like Das, goes back to the Old Masters for inspiration. His appropriation of Abanindranath Tagores The passing of Shah Jahan is an interesting thought exercise, though the same cannot be said of his more realistic images. The experiment with popular figures like Amitabh Bachchan masquerading as Sai Baba, flanked by Gablu and Bantul the Great (the cartoon characters), fails to take off convincingly.        
	Anand Prakash is from Bhopal, and departs sharply from the figurative mode of the other two artists. A feeling of placidity emanates from his abstract canvases in which blocks of dull red and smoky grey float about. Indeed, what one misses most while looking at his expertly executed work is a touch of dissonance, that flicker of unrest which excites the eye.

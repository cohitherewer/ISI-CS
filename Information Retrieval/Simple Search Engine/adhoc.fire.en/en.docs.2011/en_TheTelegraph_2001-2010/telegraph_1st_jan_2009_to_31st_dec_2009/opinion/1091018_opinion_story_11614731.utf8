	A different twist in the tale                  
	Sir  Indian Muslims are relieved that Maoists have replaced them as the countrys enemy No.1 (Muslim relief at rebel thrust, Oct 14). Now innocent Muslims would at least be able to live without the fear of being picked out as terrorists. The State has been too late in realizing the Maoist threat because it had focused all its attention on the so-called Islamic terrorists. Although the violence unleashed by either Maoists or Islamic extremists is not justified, it is equally wrong for the State to reciprocate with aggression.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Look strong          
	Sir  Chinas reaction to the Indian prime ministers recent visit to Arunachal Pradesh has only vindicated the stand of the media, which a section of the ministry of external affairs saw as hype (Arunachal vote high, China salvo at PM, Oct 14). There is something seriously wrong with the governments perception of Chinese designs and their future effects on Indo-Chinese relationship. Indias liaison with China has always been characterized by insincerity and deception on the part of Beijing. China is yet to accept India as a major regional power. Its strategy has been to destabilize India in order to thwart the latters economic growth. Beijing has always seized upon Indias weak points, and has tried to use them to its own advantage. India will not only have to be strong but also look strong in order to deal with China firmly. It needs to compel Beijing to change its perception of India as a soft and porous nation.          
	Earlier, the ministry of external affairs had desperately tried to play down the increasing number of incursions by Chinese forces along the line of control. Also, according to the Research and Analysis Wing, Beijing has had long-term plans of isolating India by making heavy investments in other neighbouring countries. The government should not ignore this. India needs to make it clear to China that if the latter tries to force India to solve the border dispute, it should not forget that such actions may result in drastic consequences. Unfortunately, Indian leaders are yet to appreciate the fact that Indias military and economic powers have grown, and that it is strong enough to take up Chinas challenge.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Chinmoy Mukherjee, Howrah

      
	Sir  The statement in which China expressed its strong dissatisfaction over Manmohan Singhs visit to Arunachal Pradesh deserves utmost denunciation. In fact, China has had evil plans against India ever since the Sino-Indian war of 1962. On the other hand, Indias attitude towards China has been cordial. Indias hasty decision to recognize Tibet as a part of China is a proof of this. But China never reciprocated this attitude by recognizing Sikkim as a part of India, and thereafter, its tirade against India over Arunachal Pradesh has continued unabated.          
	India should counter the threat posed by China by condemning the human-rights violation in Tibet and, more recently, the communal frenzy in parts of China. Indias decision to open the Nathu-la pass to facilitate border trade with China should also be re-examined. In this context, it would be interesting to know whether the Left parties consider the Chinas statement as a sign of its interference in Indias internal affairs.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Arunachal Pradesh may be disputed territory, but as long as it is dependent on the Union government for finances, border security and elections, it is under the Centres control. The Indian prime minister, or any other Indian, should be able to visit the state freely.                    
	Yours faithfully,

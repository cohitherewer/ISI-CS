The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | The party lives
                                                                                                                 THE PARTY LIVES                                                    
	The death of a charismatic leader has often acted like a tonic for a political party. But when the same phenomenon occurs after the death of a minor political figure, it is something that demands analysis. Despite all the encomiums that were heaped upon Subhas Chakraborty following his demise, no one will argue that he was a front-ranking leader in his own party, the Communist Party of India (Marxist). He was an able organizer of rallies and demonstrations that brought Calcutta or even West Bengal to a standstill; he was often controversial. But charisma is not a word that would be associated with him, and he was not even a member of the CPI(M)s central committee. Thus, the huge turn-out at his funeral cannot be explained by his importance within the party or by charismatic popularity. The disproportionate turnout of mourners has to be explained by other factors. Chakraborty made himself invaluable to his party in West Bengal by his ability to mobilize people whenever the CPI(M) wanted to show its mass following. He brought to meetings busloads of loyal supporters. The party did the same after Chakrabortys death. It organized his funeral, which turned out to be a show of the CPI(M)s cadre strength.        
	The CPI(M) did not put up this display to bestow some kind of posthumous importance on Chakraborty. The death of a comrade provided a pretext to galvanize the dormant party organization. The context of this occurrence is significant. The defeat in the Lok Sabha polls had devastated the CPI(M)s morale, and had put the party in the doldrums in West Bengal. The organization of the party worked on inertia. It had to be set in motion again so that it can still gear itself to meet the challenge looming in 2011. Tuesday saw what can be called the initial dummy run. The red flags were out; comrades and supporters were in their designated posts and places; leaders gave their red salutes and the International was sung. A drifting and aimless party organization suddenly found its familiar moorings again. A funeral called the comrades and sorrow united the party. Even in his death, Chakraborty was of service to the party. Old comrades, like old soldiers, never die: they fade into the party. Calcutta was made aware that there is life in the old party yet. When the party called, the cadre came  if only to carry the corpse of a comrade.

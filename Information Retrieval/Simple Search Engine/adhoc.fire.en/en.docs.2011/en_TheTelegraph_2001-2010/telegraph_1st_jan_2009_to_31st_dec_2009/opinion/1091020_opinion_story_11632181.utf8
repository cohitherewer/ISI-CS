The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A warmth that brings cold fear
                                                                                                                 A WARMTH THAT BRINGS COLD FEAR                                  Policies to arrest global warming will remain unjust till industrialized countries agree to do their best, writes Jayanta Bandyopadhyay                                            
	During the last century, the average temperature of the atmosphere at the earths surface has gone up by about 0.7 degrees Celsius. This global warming has now become a source of great risk for life in general and economic activity in particular. The future course of human advancement, the technological options that would ensure sustainability, depend very crucially on how we address the challenge of global warming and its diverse impacts.         
	Since the middle of the last century, many initiatives have been taken by scientists to identify the reasons behind the warming. To arrive at an understanding of this process, a conference was held in Austria in 1985. Two years later, a resolution by the 10th World Meteorological Congress and subsequently by the United Nations environment programme led to the establishment of the inter-governmental panel on climate change in Geneva.         
	The IPCC has been examining the causes behind global warming and its different impact over various parts of the world. The panel has produced four assessment reports which relate this warming to the large increases in the concentration of greenhouse gases from anthropogenic emissions. Among the various GHGs, carbon di-oxide emitted by the burning of fossil fuels is the most significant. The concentration has been the cumulative result of fossil-fuel use by the industrializing societies, initially of Europe, and later of other parts of the world. The CO2 concentration in the atmosphere has gone up from 280 parts per million (by volume) in pre-industrial times to about 360 ppm by the end of the 20th century. Changes in the level of GHGs altered the atmospheric radiation balance and caused warming.               
	This amount of warming would have been less worrying had it not been accompanied by the thermal expansion of the ocean waters that makes the sea-level rise, inundating large areas along the coasts and threatening small islands with submersion. Higher temperature of the atmosphere would also lead to the melting of polar ice-caps and mountain glaciers that raise sea-level further. Melting of glaciers would change the flow of many rivers, reducing the lean-period water-availability downstream. The flows in Himalayan river systems like those of the Ganga, Brahmaputra and Indus are expected to undergo crucial changes, causing major social and economic disruptions in the densely populated Indo-Gangetic plains.        
	The less direct, but probably more serious impact of global warming comes in the form of climate change. Warming would change the pattern of global circulation, affecting temperature, rainfall pattern and timing, frequency of cyclones and so on. Prediction of new climatic conditions is urgently needed. The global circulation models are not very accurate for application on smaller but more necessary spatial scales, like river basins. Such models need to be refined.         
	If atmospheric warming is not arrested and reversed, the possibility of the atmosphere getting heated catastrophically remains, posing a direct threat to life. Human economic activities in the past centuries in parts of the world have exposed all humans to grave risks, the nature of which is not clearly known. This is climate injustice, for which the non-industrialized world is seeking redress.         
	To face the challenges, a framework convention on climate change was adopted in the Rio Earth Summit held in 1992. It recognized the urgent need for an early reduction in the emission of GHGs and put the responsibility directly on the industrialized countries, whose emissions in the past are at the root of global warming. Thus came the idea of historical responsibility of the industrialized countries towards the global commons. In 1997, an attempt was made to tighten the FCCC into the form of the Kyoto Protocol that allocated GHG emission quotas for all countries.         
	The position of the United States of America regarding the Kyoto Protocol has been disappointing. The greatest emitter of GHGs today was unwilling to ratify the protocol. The US distanced itself from it mainly over the issue of commitment to emission-capping by rapidly growing economies like China and India. There is now the talk of a post-Kyoto global climate policy that could be the outcome of the December conference of the parties to the FCCC in Copenhagen. Barack Obamas speech at the UN climate conference in September indicates a greener position of the US in terms of meeting its own reduction commitments. But Obama was equally clear about the US demand for a broader commitment from the growing economies. This is the core of the challenge that environmental diplomats of the world will have to address in Copenhagen.        
	The large populations of China and India suggest low per-capita GHG emissions. Statements from the Indian prime minister have always reiterated Indias commitment to limit its per capita GHG emission to below that of the industrialized countries. Although about half of the Indian population has historically not emitted any significant amount of GHGs, it will face the greatest impacts of global warming and related climate change. The question of delivering climate justice at the intra-national level is equally significant.               
	The rich in India should not seek protection behind the vast numbers of the poor to present a low per-capita emission figure. Indias demand for climate justice at the international level can be more authentic if steps are taken within the country to advance climate justice and equity.        
	There is another important dimension to the politics of climate change. While the progress in mitigation of GHG emissions has been alarmingly slow, many international donors and NGOs have been promoting adaptation to climate change in poorer countries. Adaptation needs to be seen as a liability pushed on the poorer countries through climate injustice, it cannot be a panacea. If serious commitments to mitigate GHG emissions are not made by the industrialized countries, adaptation measures in the poorer countries will at best remain marginal. Whether in the Himalaya with melting glaciers or in the Sunderbans facing rising sea-levels or in the plains subject to increasingly uncertain climates, the solution to the problem lies in mitigation. The primacy of mitigation needs to be repeatedly asserted as the central element of global climate justice. Conferences on adaptation that do not demand early mitigation are part of the problem, not the solution. They divert global attention from the urgent need for mitigation. Since the Rio Earth Summit, humanity has lost a lot of time by continued GHG emission. There is no more room for developing cold feet over mitigation in addressing global warming.

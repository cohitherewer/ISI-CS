                                                                                                                 TRUE LIES                                  The Law Commission may soon recommend that narco analysis of criminals be banned as they are unreliable tools of investigation. V. Kumara Swamy on why these tests have become so controversial                          Dubious proof: Padamsinh Patil, charged for the murder of Pawanraje Nimbalkar, may soon have to undergo narco analysis                                  
	Last year a court in Pune convicted Aditi Sharma and Pravin Khandelwal for poisoning Sharmas former boyfriend. Along with other evidence, the court also considered lie detection and brain finger printing tests (a method wherein the brain is mapped for specific activity in response to details regarding the crime) conducted on Sharma. It was the first time ever that a court in India had given credence to such tests. Sessions Judge S.S. Phansal-kar-Joshi noted that Sharmas responses to the questions put to her during the tests were found to be deceptive and proving her experiential knowledge (of the crime).         
	A few months back, the Bombay High Court too took cognisance of the importance of narco analysis tests (where an accused is administered a drug that supposedly leads him to divulge information) when it transferred the 2006 murder case of Maharashtra Congress leader Pawanraje Nimbalkar from the Maharashtra Police to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). The court took the step after taking note of the confession made by one of the accused during his narco analysis test that National Congress Party leader and Member of Parliament Padamsinh Patil was the mastermind in the murder of Nimbalkar. The CBI arrested Patil recently, and he himself may soon be subjected to a series of scientific tests, including narco analysis.         
	Subjecting alleged criminals to tests such as narco analysis or brain finger printing is now very common among the countrys law enforcement agencies. And even though the judiciary is beginning to give credence to the findings of these tests, there is now an equally strong lobby that is opposed to such tests. In fact, the Law Commission of India will soon be submitting its recommendations in this regard, asking the government to ban narco analysis, brain finger printing and polygraph (lie detector) tests as it deems them unreliable and a violation of human rights.         
	Narco analysis and brain finger printing are nothing but primitive psychological third degree methods promoted as modern and scientific by a few pseudo scientists. No civilised country in the world conducts narco and brain finger printing tests, says P. Chandra Sekharan, former president of Forensic Sciences Society of India and one of the crusaders against such tests.         
	The Supreme Court is also looking into the constitutionality of narco analysis tests as a tool of investigation in criminal cases (Selvi and others vs. State of Karnataka). The apex court has completed hearings in this case and may soon give a decision.         
	How can these tests be conducted when they find no mention in the Criminal Procedure Code, says Rajesh Mahale, a Supreme Court advocate who is the counsel for appellant Selvi Murugeshan in the case. Mahale also points out that since narco analysis involves an invasive procedure in the form of injections, before extracting information from the accused, it amounts to torture, which is against the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.         
	But others, especially members of law enforcement agencies, say that these are useful tools that help them to crack difficult cases. When the police conducts a test on an alleged criminal, it has a psychological effect, and this can be used effectively as a form of cross examination, says M. Sivananda Reddy, former superintendent, Andhra Pradesh Police. Reddy has written extensively on the subject.         
	But there are naysayers even among the police. It is a case of the police being taken for a ride by the so-called scientists and experts, says S.T. Ramesh, additional director general of Karnataka Police. In his previous stint as the head of crime and technical services, Ramesh supervised the functions of the forensic labs in the state. The police are under pressure to solve cases and they think that by resorting to these scientific tests they can crack the cases, he says.         
	According to Ramesh, these tests have blunted the skills of investigation officers. Ironically, in the case of narco analysis tests it is the laboratory analysts and not the investigation officers who do the interrogation.         
	Section 45 of the Indian Evidence Act recognises the opinion of persons specially skilled when it comes to science, or art, or as to the identity of handwriting or finger impression. And this forms the basis for conducting scientific tests on alleged criminals.         
	But legal experts point out that these tests actually violate Article 20 (3), of the Constitution, which states that, No person accused of any offence shall be compelled to be a witness against himself and hence is inadmissible in court.         
	Nilima Vartak, the prosecuting lawyer in the Aditi Sharma case, begs to differ. There is no question of the violation of Article 20(3) if the accused is not presented in the court to give witness against himself. These tests sometimes merely help the police in gathering new information, she says.         
	Forensic experts too attest to the scientific basis of these tests. M.V. Garad, regional director of Central Forensic Science Laboratory, Mumbai, says that tests like brain finger printing have a strong scientific basis and these should continue. It was our laboratory that conducted brain finger printing on Aditi Sharma and the court praised us for our analysis, he says.         
	Brain finger printing is basically an application of the electro encephalogram (EEG). Under this technique, the accused persons brain is wired and he is asked to listen to a description of the scene of crime to see if certain sections of the brain register any activity. The electrical activation in various points of the brain during the session with the analyst is studied and a conclusion drawn as to whether or not the accused has experiential knowledge of the events described during the procedure.         
	The most damning report against brain finger printing was delivered by a Union home ministry-appointed committee headed by Dr D. Nagaraja, vice-chancellor, National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS), Bangalore, late last year. The committee said, Experimental works need to be subjected to transparent review by an expert committee to evaluate the validity and reliability of the findings. Only after this, this technique might have the potential to be used as one of the investigative tools. The committee also came down heavily on narco analysis tests.         
	Some say that the government needs to strike a balance before it puts a blanket ban on these tests. These tests have their relevance. Rather than putting a blanket ban, the government should fine tune the laws and bring in safeguards, says Reddy.         
	It took a long time for DNA testing to find acceptance all over the world. Similarly, scientific tests on criminals should be given some more time. They cannot be rejected outright, says G.M. Ranjith Cecil, assistant director, Forensic Sciences Department, Tamil Nadu government, Chennai.         
	But Sekharan and others are holding out for more tangible proof that these tests are actually as reliable as they claim to be. Until irrefutable scientific evidence is provided, the alleged criminals shouldnt be treated like guinea pigs, says Sekharan.

                                                                                                                 THINK CENTRAL                                                    
	The prime ministers idea of being hyperactive for 100 days has much to say for it if they are not followed by 1,000 days of inaction. But it also encouraged other things besides action. The minister of education, for instance, has been unusually active in making proposals. If an idea is the first step to action, he cannot be faulted for being so full of ideas. But when ideas fly in different directions, they can also be useful aids to inaction. His ideas on examinations are a good illustration. Kapil Sibal was keen on making the examination following Class X optional. But he also seemed intent on universalizing the examination that follows Class XII. If one examination gives students sleepless nights, so does the other. So if, as a good populist, the education minister is against one examination, he should start a campaign against examinations per se. But then, as he himself pointed out, some selection mechanism is needed for admission to universities. Examinations will no doubt be as much of a headache under any other name. And as many Indians abroad will testify, the facility they acquired at an early age for swallowing large doses of knowledge, useful or otherwise, gave them a headstart over children of more advanced countries that could afford less advanced systems of selection.        
	However, since education in this country is a state subject, so are school-leaving examinations; their standards vary across the country, and that works against mobility of students across the country. In technical and management education, where the Central government has set up or sanctioned national teaching institutions going under the name of Indian Institutes, they in turn have set up common entrance examinations. These examinations are taken by many more students than the institutes admit, and have in effect become countrywide examinations. The interesting question is, why a similar national university entrance examination did not emerge. The answer must lie in the fact that there are no similar national universities to which admission is prized. The Centre has set up national universities to give currency to such central leaders as Jawaharlal Nehru. But sold as it is on educating children from vote-bank castes without qualifications, it has avoided creating a common entrance examination for national universities.        
	If Mr Sibal is serious, however, a solution is staring in his face. The Centre runs schools for its own employees across the country so that their children can get standardized education wherever the employees are posted. These Central schools run Central examinations. All Mr Sibal has to do is to throw these examinations to all institutions of tertiary education, and indeed to propagate them as a universal solution. And if states do not see the merits of these Central examinations, he should export them to other countries. As Morarji Desai once said, all good things of this country are for export.

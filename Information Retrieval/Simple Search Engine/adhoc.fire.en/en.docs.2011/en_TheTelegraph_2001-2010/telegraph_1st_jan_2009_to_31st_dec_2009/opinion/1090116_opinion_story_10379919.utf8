	Music to the ears                  
	Sir  Hollywood seems to have taken notice of Bollywood at last, with Slumdog Millionaire, an Indo-British film directed by Danny Boyle, winning four Golden Globe awards (Global ride on 4-Globe Slumdog, Jan 13). A.R. Rahman, who won his first Golden Globe for scoring the films music, thanked a billion people of India while accepting the award with great humility. It is interesting to see how Rahman has honed his skills over the years. With every film, be it Jodhaa Akbar or Jaane Tu Ya Jaane Na, he introduced the audience to hitherto unknown talents  singers and musicians with unique skills. What sets Rahman apart from other Indian composers is his versatility as a singer and an instrumentalist. He is choosy about his projects and knows where he stands, having won the prize after being adjudged by renowned composers like Howard Shore and Danny Elfman. Thanks to his musical talent, Indian music can now reach a wider audience.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
J. Akshay, Secunderabad

                
	Sir  A.R. Rahman has won glory for himself and the country by winning the Golden Globe award. Indians are aware how gifted he is, but this award will help win him global recognition. Now that Rahmans hard work has been rewarded with a Golden Globe award, one hopes that he will be able to bring home the Oscars one day. That will certainly be the icing on the cake.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Ambar Mallick, Calcutta

                
	Sir  A.R. Rahman must be congratulated for winning the prestigious Golden Globe for composing the music of Slumdog Millionaire. Rahman has enthralled us with his tuneful compositions over the years, from Roja to Slumdog Millionaire. Music lovers are assured of a new experience in each of Rahmans scores, which are refreshingly different from the typical Bollywood music Indians are familiar with. By winning the Golden Globe, Rahman has put India on the global map of music.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Barun Kumar Mahapatro, Berhampur, Orissa

                
	Sir  A.R. Rahman is being held by a section of the foreign press as the Mozart of Madras. If we were to look back at Rahmans musical career, we would see that Rahman first tasted success after he composed the music for the film, Roja. Since then, Rahman has grown into one of the brightest stars in the Indian music industry. In recent years, Rahman has lent his music to unforgettable melodies for films such as Bombay, Dil Se, Zubeidaa, Guru and Jodhaa Akbar. One of Lagaans popular tracks, Chale chalo, by Rahman went on to acquire a cult status in the whole nation. He is also credited with giving the national anthem a contemporary sound. Now, after his success with Slumdog Millionaire, Rahman has become a name to reckon with on the international music scene as well.          
	Yours faithfully,         Subhayu Saha, 
Khagra, Murshidabad            
	New resolutions          
	Sir  The year past was truly horrible as India faced one disaster after another. First, the floods in Bihar killed hundreds of people and rendered many people homeless. Then came the terror strikes in various parts of India, forcing people to live in perpetual fear.           
	We want this year to be different. The people want tougher laws to be implemented to counter terrorism. Citizens organizations should also be formed to battle terror in every district of the country. People themselves should work together to ensure their own safety as the government or the police cannot do this alone. We can avert these mishaps by remaining more vigilant.           
	Another change that we want is in the field of education. Many people in the city are now literate, but things have not improved much in the villages. Poverty is the main reason behind this disparity. The state governments should provide free education to children, whose parents cannot afford to send them to school. The NGOs need to change as well. There are thousands of NGOs in India, but only few are working towards real development. The rest are only interested in making profit. Government departments too should alter the manner in which they function. Details related to public issues such as taxation should be made transparent to tackle corruption.           
	Finally, there should be changes in the political system so that the number of parties can be restricted. Strict norms should also be adhered to while floating a political party to help cleanse the system. Young people interested in developing the nation should be encouraged to join politics.          
	Last, but not the least, the forms of entertainment need to be transformed. Cinema and theatre should unite the people and instil moral values in them. Only then can this new year be one of peace and happiness.           
	Yours faithfully,

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | testing for consent
                                                                                                                 TESTING FOR CONSENT                                  Anchita Ghatak                              
	Marriage is seen as essential for women in India. The law says that the minimum age of marriage for women is 18 years. But when talking to parents of girls in slums and villages, I am often left with the feeling that people think 18 years is the maximum age of marriage. Come what may, girls have to be married as soon as they turn 18.         
	Malati, a woman domestic worker from a village in South 24 Parganas, was pleased because she was receiving offers of marriage for her schoolgoing 15-year-old daughter. Since the parents of boys were approaching her, she felt the demand for dowry might be manageable and her daughter would be respectably disposed of.         
	Parents of daughters are tense about the loss of face an unmarried daughter causes. Studies and experiences from the field show that one major reason girls drop out of middle school is sexual harassment. They contend with lewd comments and physical assault, both on their way to school and in it. In an attempt to protect them, their parents take them out of school. This is then followed by a frantic search for a groom.         
	Let us not for a moment think that marriage for girls is inevitable only among the poor and semi-literate. A businesswoman proudly told me that her daughter had qualified as a dentist and won a gold medal. Although the girl was keen on post-graduate studies, it was likely that she would be married off while studying for her Masters, which was a five-year course. It was not going to be easy to marry off a woman approaching 30.         
	In such a social milieu, it is not surprising that the Madhya Pradesh government has come up with the Deendayal Antyodaya Mission. This scheme, aimed at conducting marriages of disabled, poor and destitute women, was launched in 2006 with the marriages of 251 couples. The scheme is repeatedly described to suggest that its only beneficiaries are women. As a veteran womens rights activist has often said, in India, men get married but women are married off. The husband, protector and provider, is doing the woman a favour by conferring respectability on her.                 
	Virgin scheme        
	The Indian State subscribes to this view but is committed to womens welfare. So there are schemes like the DAM (an unintended pun) to promote State-sponsored mass marriages that make a statement for simple weddings and against dowry. I could not find out if steps are taken to ensure that the couples married under DAM really have a dowry-free marriage, or if harassment for dowry begins after marriage.         
	Now we are told that the Madhya Pradesh government is conducting virginity and pregnancy tests on the women to ensure that the scheme is not misused by couples already married. The State is expected to act according to the law. There is no law in Indias statute books that prohibits sex for unmarried women, or bars pregnant women from getting married. This is assuming that the women married under DAM have all attained majority, that is, they are at least 18 years old.         
	We know that the Indian State sees itself as a promoter and upholder of Indian cultural values, and a dearly held Indian value, cutting across caste, class and religion, is that good Indian women do not have sex for pleasure. Bowing to the laws of biology, they submit to the sexual demands of their husbands so that they may attain the exalted state of motherhood. Sex is not about pleasure, it is about duty.         
	So, in its zeal for womens welfare and desire to prevent the misuse of a noble scheme, the Madhya Pradesh government has not thought twice about assaulting womens bodies, their rights and dignity. Are there laws that allow the State to conduct such tests on women or even to come up with such measures? It is likely that the women themselves, or one of their family, are even signing consent forms. In such a situation, isnt it coercion presented as consent?

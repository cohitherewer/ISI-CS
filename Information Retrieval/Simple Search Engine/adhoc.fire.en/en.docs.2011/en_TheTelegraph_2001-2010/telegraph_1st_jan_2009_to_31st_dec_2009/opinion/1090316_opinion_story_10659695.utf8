	The real wonder of our age is this: you can go on the internet, type in PlanetQuest New Worlds Atlas, or Extrasolar Planets Encyclopedia, or NASA Star and Exoplanet Database and directly access the data on 340 new planets that have been discovered in the past five years.        
	That number is set to grow very fast now, for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration successfully launched the Kepler telescope that will find many more planets, including potentially Earth-like ones. It will stare unblinkingly at an area of space containing about 100,000 relatively near stars, watching for the tiny dimming of a star that happens when one of its planets passes between the star and us.        
	I enjoyed writing that last sentence. I couldnt have written it 10 years ago, because we still didnt know then whether it was normal for a star to have planets. Maybe planets were very rare, and life a thousand times rarer, and we were the only intelligent life in the galaxy. That always seemed pretty unlikely, but you couldnt prove otherwise.Well, now we know that planets are as common as dirt. New techniques that can see past the blinding glare of the parent star to pick out only the faint light reflected from a planets surface have found them around more than a hundred nearby stars. The Kepler telescope mechanizes the process. If any of those 100,000 stars have planets that orbit in a plane that causes them to pass between the star and us, Kepler will spot them by the dimming they cause as they pass in front of the star. Probably thousands of the stars have planets orbiting in that plane, so now the tally of exoplanets  planets orbiting other suns  is going to go up very fast.        
	Even in that tiny section of sky, Kepler will probably miss tens of thousands of other planets whose orbits dont bring them between their star and us. Moreover, the great majority of the planets it does find will be gas giants like our own Jupiter and Saturn, just because gas giants orbiting close to their stars are the easiest planets to spot. But those are planets that cannot support our kind of life; the real triumph is finding planets like Earth.                
	Price of intelligence        
	The closest astronomers have come so far is a planet called Gliese 581 c. Its the middle planet of three orbiting Gliese 581, a star about twenty light-years from here, and its only one-and-a-half times the diameter of Earth. It is a rocky planet like our own, not a gas giant, and it is in the Goldilocks Zone around its star where the temperature is neither too hot nor too cold to permit liquid water on the surface.        
	We still cannot see if it has an atmosphere, and if so whether it contains the telltale gases that indicate the presence of life, but a new generation of orbiting observatories that are planned for the next decade could give us the answers.Two big consequences are going to come out of this. One is a long and tempting list of Earth-like planets in our own stellar neighbourhood. Its quite likely that there will be evidence of life on many of them.        
	The other consequence is a huge question about intelligent life in the universe. If planets capable of supporting life are so commonplace  Alan Boss of the Carnegie Institution of Science told the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Chicago last month that there could be a 100 billion of them in this galaxy alone  then where is everybody?        
	Is intelligence a rare accident in the evolutionary process, or such a self-destructive attribute that intelligent species dont usually survive more than a couple of centuries after they industrialize? Are they all observing radio silence because there is something dreadful out there? Or have we just not figured out yet how mature galactic civilizations communicate?        
	I enjoyed writing that paragraph, too.

	In all unfairness                  
	Sir  Political parties are just like beauty products. Both claim that they have the best effect on individuals. The opposite is true, however. Political parties are gearing up for the general elections with catchy slogans and a mix of other ploys. A huge amount of money, which could have been used for social welfare, is being spent. If politicians are working for the peoples sake, their actions must speak for them instead of their campaigns. They should realize that people know these advertisements amount to nothing.          
	Yours faithfully,        Amrita Mallik, Calcutta 
                  
	Freedom under fire          
	Sir  I am a 22-year-old girl. I dont take alcohol and I dont wear revealing clothes. But I cannot support what was done to the women in a Mangalore pub (Pub brawl, Jan 28). I am also shocked by what members of our modern, democratic society had to say in this regard. Many of them scoffed at Renuka Chowdhury for supporting the basic rights of an individual. Is it wrong for women in a democracy to live their lives according to their own wishes? Isnt that a fundamental right all Indians possess? Or does the law change when it comes to women? There are many women politicians in this country. Yet, most did not raise their voices against the Sri Ram Sena. Moreover, we should not expect only women to protest against such atrocities. What were the men doing? Are the majority of them so cowardly that they will not admit that women too have some basic rights, and that they need to be treated equally?           
	So far as drinking is concerned, it ought to be as condemnable for men as for women. And yet, only the women were singled out and beaten up. The Ram Sena and its supporters have no inkling of the Indian tradition they wish to protect. One only has to turn to history to know how common smoking and alcohol consumption have been for women down the ages. For that matter, how much of Indian culture do the members of Ram Sena represent in their shirts and trousers? Pink chaddis or not, women are not going to give in to the Talibanization of India.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Worthy cause          
	Sir  The Maharashtra government is reported to have set up a high-powered committee to speed up various SEZ projects in the state. It claims that the projects will generate 66 lakh jobs and attract an investment of Rs 180,000 crore.           
	If this is to be believed, then the chief minister, Ashok Chavan, should really get cracking. The State has to provide help in this time of recession. If Chavan does manage to achieve the target, it will not only better Maharashtras prospects, but also enhance his image. The last will be crucial for both Chavan and his party before the state goes to the hustings.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Palani Thevar, Mumbai 

                
	Sir  Who will bat for the nearly one crore unemployed people of Maharashtra ? No leader or political party feels this is a critical issue. Opponents of development are having a field day, taking law into their hands, while the state government remains a mute spectator. How will investment come to Maharashtra under these circumstances? Are the leaders only good at performing inauguration ceremonies and attending film mahurats?           
	The former chief minister, Vilasrao Deshmukh, is entirely responsible for this culture. He pushed the state back by years. It is unlikely that Ashok Chavan will be able to clean up this mess. Meanwhile, the youth will be left high and dry.           
	Yours faithfully,

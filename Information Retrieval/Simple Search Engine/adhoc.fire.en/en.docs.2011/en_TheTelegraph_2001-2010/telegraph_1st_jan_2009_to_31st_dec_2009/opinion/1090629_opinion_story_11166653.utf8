	The Dalai Lama equals non-violence, and without him there would be violence, said Lhadon Tethong, executive director of Students for a Free Tibet, a couple of months ago. In Beijing, the Chinese writer, Wang Lixiong, agreed: If...the Dalai Lama does not return to Tibet before he dies, the moment that he dies will see general riots across the Tibetan areas of China. And he is going to die, probably fairly soon.        
	The Dalai Lama will be 74 next month, and he has been in hospital three times in the past year. He presumably believes that he will immediately be reborn as soon as he dies, but the traditional search for the child who is his next incarnation could take years. Waiting for that child to grow up and become the Tibetans next leader will take several decades. That is a big political problem.        
	The core of the problem is that his role, as defined by tradition, embodies both political and religious authority. Religious questions rarely require instant answers. Political decisions, on the other hand, need to be made promptly. So, maybe, the solution is to separate those two roles.        
	The Dalai Lama has been raising this possibility for years, only to have it repeatedly rejected by his adoring followers. He brought it up again at a congress of the Tibetan exile community not long after last years bloody anti-Chinese riots in Tibet, saying that his moderate, middle-way approach to the Chinese authorities in Beijing  seeking only autonomy and not independence for Tibet  was having no success. Maybe it was time for him to take a back seat and let the younger generation of leaders in the community deal with that thorny problem as they saw fit, he suggested. The congress rejected the suggestion, reaffirming him as their political leader. They simply could not imagine a future without him.                
	Friend or foe?        
	The Dalai Lama himself knows that such a future will arrive. So he has now released a video in which he urges the Tibetan exile community to embrace democracy and stop depending on a political leader who is essentially (at the risk of sounding disrespectful) picked at random. The Dalai Lama held temporal and spiritual leadership over the last 400 or 500 years. It may have been quite useful, but that period is over, he says in the video. Today it is clear to the whole world that democracy is the best system despite its minor negativities. That is why it is important that Tibetans also move with the larger world community.        
	Its a nicely crafted statement that does not trample on anybodys religious sensitivities, but what it means is that political leadership of the Tibetan exile community must move from the Dalai Lama to an elected prime minister. Such an office has existed since 2001, but, until now, its holder has deferred to the Dalai Lama in all import ant decisions. That is a neat solution to the succession problem, but it has implications that should concern the Chinese government. A Tibetan prime minister elected solely by the exile community cannot hope to have the political authority of a living Buddha within Tibet.        
	For almost half a century, the Dalai Lama has used that authority to restrain Tibetans from open revolt against China. A prime minister elected only by the diaspora could not do that even if he wanted to. China has never appreciated the Dalai Lamas services. In classic imperial style, it assumes that material improvements in the living standards of its subjects will make them forget their nationalist aspirations. When it turns out that Tibetans have not forgotten them, as was brutally demonstrated in last years anti-Chinese riots in Lhasa, Beijing blames outside agitators and plotters like the Dalai Lama.        
	In fact, he has been feeding tranquillizers to the Tibetan population for decades in the belief that Tibet cannot win independence by violence. But a lot of Tibetans would like to try, and Beijing will miss the Dalai Lama when hes gone.

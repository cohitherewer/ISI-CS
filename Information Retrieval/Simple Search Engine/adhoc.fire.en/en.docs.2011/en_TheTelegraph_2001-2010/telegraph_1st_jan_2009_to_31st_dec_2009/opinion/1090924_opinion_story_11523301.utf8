	Strong measures                   
	Sir  In Freshening up (Sept 15), Bhaskar Dutta has rightly stated that the global financial system needs carefully made regulations. The Lehman episode has provided an opportunity to reflect upon the global financial crisis, which shook the foundations of the Western banking system and plunged much of the world into a deep recession. A transparent financial system is the only answer if the world is to avoid such shocks in the future. A system that becomes less transparent is increasingly vulnerable to wicked manipulations. Since the worldwide meltdown was caused by the collapse of the global financial system, it was appropriate on the part of G20 leaders to spend their time in discussions about measures to strengthen the financial system. Dutta is correct in surmising that the focus on the prevention of another crisis is a hopeful sign, and that the global economy is coming out of the severe downturn. Given the stakes involved, it must be a challenge to improve the capacity of dealing with such crises by first identifying and then plugging the deficiencies through various means, including regulatory amendments.           
	Few may dispute the fact that success in this endeavour requires nothing less than a new approach, new thinking and a greater urgency to study tomorrows problems today. The absence of all downside risk, according to Dutta, must surely encourage unduly large risk-taking behaviour. The authors conclusion that the absence of controls is a sure prescription for disaster is apt, considering the present circumstances. It is necessary to have in place stringent rules governing the international financial system. The goal must be to find better ways to insulate the world from extreme financial fluctuations, while not unduly depriving the economies of the benefits that globalization and financial innovation bring. Steps must be taken to ensure that businesses and societies not only cope with the uncertain times, but also flourish in them.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Bhaskar Duttas comment that the absence of controls is a sure prescription for disaster makes one doubt his understanding of a liberalized market. Control is imperative in every system to make the latter efficient, but in the long run, all systems have their specific limitations.          
	Investment bankers like Lehman Brothers took uncontrolled risks that benefited a few. But they also resulted in the firm incurring huge losses. The real tragedy is that tax-paying citizens have to compensate for the losses in the name of stimulus packages. Such a remedy is totally unacceptable. But economists like Dutta have chosen to remain silent on the needs to curb this as well as imperfect competition. The global financial system is also aware of the risks of such a solution, but it has opted to bail out State capitalism.          
	The Indian banking system remains insulated from speculative and fraudulent investments, and is, therefore, safe. However, the global financial system might compel Indian banks to undertake risky investments. Since there is a radical difference in the natures of Indian and global banking systems, Indian banks should view principles that guided global institutions such as the Lehman Brothers with caution. There is also an urgent need for economists to come up with fresh ideas, which can boost the countrys economy during these testing times.          
	Yours faithfully,         R. Subhranshu, Chandernagore, Hooghly            
	Unjust hike    
	Sir  The way bureaucrats are taking pay hikes in these difficult times is really shameful and immoral (In cost-cut times, babus hike pay, Sept 19). But the bureaucrats are not alone in this. The members of parliament are also known to do the same.           
	The government should try to stop this shocking practice. It should consider making a law whereby public servants will not be allowed to decide there own salaries. But whether there is at all a chance of such a legislation being passed is a different story altogether.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Hrituparna Dhar, Calcutta

                
	Sir  At a time when the finance minister has requested his colleagues to cut costs, the babus in the civil service are getting their pay raised without any equivalent improvement in their efficiency. The Lok Sabha must arrange for pay revisions according to the wage boards recommendations, and put an immediate embargo on pay hikes that are proving to be unnecessary and a drain on the exchequer.           
	 Yours faithfully,
  A.S. Mehta, Calcutta             
	Risky humour          
	Sir  It appears that the most serious issue before the United Progressive Alliance government at the moment is to find out who was being alluded to by Shashi Tharoor when he used phrases such as cattle class and holy cows (PM sees joke, but party warms grill, Sept 19). The phrases were used in a social networking site by Tharoor, who happens to be a junior minister. The young Tharoor was also a responsible official at the United Nations and an aspirant for the post of secretary-general. Although he is young, Tharoor is wise enough to realize that respected leaders cannot be the target of such jokes.           
	The episode reminds me of Rabindranath Tagores Tasher Desh and also of Sukumar Rays Ramgorurer Chhana. In Tasher Desh,Tagore wrote about a land guided by strict rules while Rays witty poem was about a species that abhored laughter. The moral, to my mind, is the same in both the play and the poem: the absence of light-hearted moments in life can turn men and women into humourless, inefficient creatures.           
	Solemn minds are often incapable of giving their best to the country. Moreover, one should be careful of those who misinterpret the meaning of jokes. Otherwise, the harmless offenders will always find themselves in the eye of the storm.           
	Yours faithfully,

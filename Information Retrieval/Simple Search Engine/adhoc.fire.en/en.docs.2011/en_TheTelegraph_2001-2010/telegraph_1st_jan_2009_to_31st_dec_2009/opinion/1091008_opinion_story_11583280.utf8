                                                                                                                 SHAVE BEFORE YOU SHOOT                                  Children who enact adult violence and evil challenge the civilized worlds comfortable notions of childhood                                            
	The boys came out of the surrounding forest and headed straight for the paan shop in the village. While some of them watched from a distance, three boys went up to the owner; one of them took out a revolver from under his shirt and shot him. Then, as the boys standing in the distance pulled out their weapons and gave them cover, the three boys disappeared into the forest. Their comrades commanded the villagers to go home, and vanished in the direction of the other three. This happened last month in the Midnapore district of West Bengal. The boys were part of the local Maoist action squad, and had come to kill the CPI(M) branch committee secretary in Burisole village. What the villagers kept saying afterwards was that they could never have imagined that boys so young could be killers: They barely had any facial hair. When they first came out of the forest, the villagers thought that they had come to play football.        
	Between 14 and 17 years of age, these boys are all children  children trained to kill, children who kill. There are supposed to be as many as 200 of them in the Lalgarh area, but child soldiers exist in many other places of the world. In the lingo of humanitarian work, they are objects of concern, welfare and study as child labourers, child prostitutes and street children are. All these phrases are shocking oxymorons, for they link childhood with some of the worst aspects of adult reality. Each refers to children who are deemed to have been deprived of a safe, happy and protected childhood. Their welfare is premised on a universally applicable set of rights and principles, best encoded in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. It does not matter if the child is Swiss, Rwandan, Bangladeshi or Palestinian, for the quality of its life should be measured according to the standards laid down by the UNCRC. So, everywhere in the world, it is equally bad for a child to have to work, fight or have sex. Adult lives vary and are judged in context, but children are children everywhere. And a great deal of our sense of security in what we call the civilized world depends on this absolute and universal separation of childhood from adulthood.        
	Hence, the problem with killers without facial hair. Childhood, especially as the law defines it, is a long affair. According to the Indian Juvenile Justice Act, a strapping 17-year-old is as much a child as an undernourished three-year-old; and it doesnt take much strength, in any case, to handle revolvers and other modern weapons. What the adult world, together with its legal, medical, moral and pedagogic systems, likes to imagine as childhood is fundamentally premised on the idea of innocence. This idea, in turn, is built around the selective, suppressed or lost memories of our own childhood. There is much that we cannot remember, and a great deal that we do not want to remember, about what we were like as children, or what other children were like.         
	So, childhood has to be imagined, projected, formalized and legislated through some of the key institutions of civil society and of the State. And the idea of innocence is as biological as it is moral. It cannot deal with facial hair, breasts and sexual organs (in middle Bengal, a boys first shave still has a rite of passage quality in the eyes of his adult family), just as the innocent cannot go to work and to war. Labour, sexuality and violence become the great taboos, and it is difficult for us to imagine children as political subjects. They can be granted their rights only after they allow us to regard them as victims, incapable of agency and choice, and deprived of a secure, healthy and happy childhood.        
	In the literature on child soldiers, mostly in the media and in pop-anthropology, there is a story that is usually told about them. It is essentially a sentimental story of victimhood  Innocents Lost: When Child Soldiers Go to War is a typical title  in which children are forced into armed conflict by their circumstances, and there is no room at all for volition and choice. Pop-psychology usually treats their use of weapons as the inability to distinguish between play and reality: the AK-47s might as well be toy guns. The story of violent children is sometimes complicated by race and gender. For instance, studies have shown that in America, social class remaining constant, violent white children are more likely to be sent to hospital, and violent black children to prison; aggressive boys are likely to end up in prison, and girls who have performed the same aggressive acts in hospital.        
	For the people of Burisole, would the sight of those boys with their revolvers have been less horrifying if the boys had facial hair? For the gun-wielding 17-year-olds, something will happen at the stroke of midnight on their next birthday that would make the world look at them differently, and the law will treat them with more sternness but less horror.                    AVEEK SEN

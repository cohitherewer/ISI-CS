	Terror talk                  
	Sir  The Union home ministry has banned the Maoist organization as an extremist outfit. A section of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) has rejected the ban and wants to fight the Maoists politically in West Bengal (West Bengal mulls ban on Maoists, June 21). Moving along that logic, do states have the right to ignore the Centres decisions on such matters? If a state refuses to accept the Centres ban what would be the constitutional status of that directive? And if states are soft on extremists would it not disturb the federal structure of the country?                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Kaberi Arjun, Calcutta

                
	Sir  It is unfortunate that a section of the CPI(M) is objecting to the ban on the Maoists by the Centre. The Maoists have held the political and economic systems of the occupied areas in West Bengal, Chhattisgarh and Bihar to ransom, besides using the villagers as human shields. The CPI(M) seems not to understand the seriousness of the issue and also seems to have an ego problem with the Centre. The party had objected to the nuclear treaty while other parties welcomed it. It is time the CPI(M) started giving constructive support to the Centre in the implementation of common welfare programmes and decisions concerning national security.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The joint action by the state police and the Central forces against the Maoists to retrieve Lalgarh has unwittingly offered an opportunity to some regional cinema, theatre and literary personalities to bask in media limelight, a chance they do not often get. These artists, who are usually detached from ground realities, have suddenly developed a sense of belonging with the affected villagers and felt concerned about their safety in the face of police action. So they took out a caravan of big cars and went for a long drive to Lalgarh, defying the governments request not to venture there for security reasons. There they had a first-hand experience of the villagers condition. They then got hold of Chhatradhar Mahato, a proclaimed offender and secretary of the Peoples Committee against Police Atrocities, sat with him in discussion, and extracted a formula for restoring peace, before returning to Calcutta. Calcuttans are now awaiting a series of films and plays depicting their adventure Lalgarh.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  While criticizing intellectuals for not condemning Maoist violence, the editorial, Intellect and prejudice(June 21), fails to clarify why such violence has gathered momentum in India.           
	There is only so much deprivation of basic rights, and disregard by the authorities, that the people can take before resorting to violence. India  particularly those states that have become Maoist targets  continues to lie at the bottom of the human development index and at the top of the world corruption index. The ultimate consequence of the authorities brazen looting of funds meant for development is obviously violence. The attitude of our leaders is, The people ask for rice? Let them eat biriyani. Intellectuals should condemn the colonial stance of those elected to govern us and who are yet doing their people a great disservice.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Many intellectuals in our state could not rise above petty party politics. Media reports have highlighted their intimacy with several ministers. Many of them enjoy considerable perks for their unstinted support to the government.           
	Communists brook no criticism, not even constructive ones. The observation in Intellect and prejudice that Maoist violence does not deserve any support from the intelligentsia, as opposed to the spontaneous demonstrations against the governments repression in Nandigram, is true and timely. Violence as an expression of frustration with a failed State deserves only condemnation. Most local people may be unhappy with the administration but not all of them support the Maoists. Most of them are victims of fear, but the government has been unable to protect those who dared to oppose the Maoists.           
	In its 32 years rule, the Left Front government has not implemented any comprehensive development programme to end the misery of the people in the area. While the tribes have been denied their livelihood in the name of forest protection, the timber and land mafia have been allowed to run free by conniving local administrators. Even now the governments efforts in Lalgarh do not seem wholehearted.There is disagreement in the CPI(M) politburo over the ban on Maoists. It looks as if the partymen are only trying to salvage something from their inglorious defeat at the hands of the Trinamul Congress in the recent polls by blaming it for supping with the Maoists           
	To end the Maoist problem for good, the government should arrange for adequate relief to the inhabitants of the disturbed area, restore law and order and start long-term development programmes with special emphasis on the needs of the tribal section. The intelligentsia, too, have a responsibility to condemn Maoist activities in no uncertain terms and to ask the outfit to lay down arms.           
	Yours faithfully,

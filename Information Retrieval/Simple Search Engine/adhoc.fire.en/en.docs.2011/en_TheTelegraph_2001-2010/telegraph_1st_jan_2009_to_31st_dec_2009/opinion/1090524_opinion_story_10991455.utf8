The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Delhi to the grass roots
                                                                                                                 DELHI TO THE GRASS ROOTS                          - What the new MPs can do for Bengal					 					      Sukanta Chaudhuri                              Early learning				                                             
	I know a young woman who works in an anganwadi in a Birbhum village. By an unblushing official fiction, Indias bedrock childcare personnel are categorized as volunteers. Her honorarium is paid after months, as is the grant to feed the children: meanwhile, she must advance the money from her own pocket. When her pay was raised to the princely sum of Rs 1500, the arrears she received went to pay the local grocer.        
	Anganwadis operate under the integrated child development scheme of the ministry of women and child development. In effect, the children (largely tribal) in this rural pocket are fed and nursed privately by a few underpaid workers.         
	There is a womens rehabilitation home in Burdwan district, funded by the Union government. When I visited it in November 2008, they were yet to receive their full dues for 2007-8, let alone 2008-9. They were surviving on donations and meagre earnings from handicrafts.        
	The Centre has a travel scheme for scheduled caste and scheduled tribe students going to study abroad. Last year, a boy from a Murshidabad village nearly missed his chance because the district magistrate hesitated to approve the disbursement: the rules required him to stand personal guarantor for the students return. This unworkable provision ensures that the government snatches with the left hand what it dispenses with the right: the circle of state beneficiaries continues to exclude the dispossessed.              
	In my university, University Grants Commission project staff work for months without receiving their salary. Grants do not arrive; or, preposterously, lie with the university but cannot be disbursed because, despite letters, calls and even visits to Delhi, the UGC delays in sanctioning the appointments. So bad is the UGCs recent record of disbursement that academics hesitate to avail of attractive research schemes: the money does not materialize.        
	Of the Rs 100 crore each promised to the Universities of Calcutta, Madras and Bombay in the 2006 budget, only 15 crore had materialized two years later. Yet more egregious are the lavish promises of showpiece institutes for which the funds, it seems, simply do not exist. The new Indian institutes of technology are ghost presences on shared campuses, and 15 new Central universities were launched three weeks ago with seed grants of just Rs 2 crore each.         
	In none of these cases is the stoppage of funds owing to any lapse on the recipients part. These anecdotal instances point to an endemic situation. There is no lack of Union government schemes, often with lavish allocations, in crucial social sectors. Many of them address the weakest sections of society, and could transform the nation if properly implemented. Crores of citizens are deprived of their benefits through non-disbursement, clerical muddle and corruption.         
	Experience discounts the touted wisdom that the Union is an enlightened, energetic Santa Claus whose bounty is spurned by the states. This is not to exonerate state governments. Where Union funds are routed through the states, it is impossible to assess how much blame accrues to each, especially if Union and state are under different political regimes. If the state cannot hijack the Centres political capital, it would rather forgo the interests of its own poor. West Bengal has famously dispensed only 18 out of 100 days work under the national rural employment guarantee scheme. Earlier, it had not spent the first tranche of funds under Operation Blackboard when many states had utilized the second. Reports on the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan are so confusing as to suggest deliberate obfuscation.        
	These specific issues seem inappropriate when the nation is cheering in a new government. But it is precisely the time to raise such matters.        
	An election is held to form a government. Yet government, in the bedrock sense, is usually its last concern. Broad issues of policy provide the icing on the campaign cake. Members of parliament trumpet their success in cornering new projects, or extracting some sectarian concession at whatever fiscal or social cost. Nobody, but nobody, checks when and how the goodies arrive; still less the niceties of administration and disbursement, through which any government delivers 90 per cent of its benefits.         
	The figure 90 is inversely relevant. Rajiv Gandhi remarked that of every rupee spent on welfare, only 10 paise reached the people. In a government where Rajivs wife and offspring loom so large, one hopes they will act on the late leaders wisdom. By 2014, will the citizens share reach 20 paise in the rupee? Or even 15?         
	A further question. Of this 20, 15, or 10 paise, how much will sink without trace? It need not even be embezzled, merely undelivered or lost. Some months ago, the papers carried an amazing story: the impoverished tiger widows of the Sundarbans were not collecting their compensation cheques as they had no bank accounts, and it was nobodys business to help them open one. (For once, the district magistrate intervened.) This in a state that prides itself on its people-friendly panchayats, dominated in that district by the party that swept last weeks polls.        
	The best benefit that people-friendly parties  as which party is not?  could render their deprived electorate is to keep a close tab on allocations and disbursements of Central funds to the state, especially for key programmes of mass uplift. It is a painstaking, unglamorous task; but pursued over months and years, it will help our poor towards a decent life, creating an immense bank of welfare and goodwill. It will bring directly, to those who most need it, the disproportionate bounty at Delhis disposal.         
	The Left Front government established its hold over Bengal not only by historic land reforms but by winning the government workforce to its side. Thenceforth, especially for the underprivileged, all state-disbursed benefits and services had to be brokered through the party. This strategic master-stroke ensured mass allegiance more securely than mere good governance, even militating against the latter. The Left grasped deep down what its external utterances often seem to deny: political power is validated through administrative power. That, besides sheer love of loot, is why parties seek to be in government.               
	During the last UPA rule, West Bengal used its political standing with the Centre  till the inconsequential yet all-powerful Left leadership in Delhi decided otherwise  to obtain some long-pending benefits for the state at macro-developmental level. It was a fraction of what political hucksters from other states brazenly extract for their support. But little or nothing was done to exploit ground-level, direct-delivery Central programmes for the poor. The best service our new MPs could render Bengal would be to pursue the latter as well as the former channel of development: in particular, to maximize the operation of schemes like the NREGS, the Indira Abas Yojana, Antyodaya Anna Yojana and the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan.         
	This cannot be done by blocking roads, holding rallies or wrecking offices. It involves patient, sustained bonding with communities and even individuals on the one hand, and ceaseless pressure on the bureaucracy on the other. It involves monitoring the outflow from Delhi, as well as expenditure within the state. But the biggest challenge may be to ensure that ones own party-workers keep their hands out of the till; and, despite their mediating role, do not set up as new brokers in place of the old.               
	No party, alas, can beat the bureaucracy: it can at best join it on honourable terms. Every party in power learns this truth, and strikes a cosy deal with the babus that harms no one except the common citizen. Our new MPs are in a happy position: in, and yet not in, power on their home turf. We can only pray that with the new turn in their fortunes, they will develop the maturity to put this double advantage to best use.

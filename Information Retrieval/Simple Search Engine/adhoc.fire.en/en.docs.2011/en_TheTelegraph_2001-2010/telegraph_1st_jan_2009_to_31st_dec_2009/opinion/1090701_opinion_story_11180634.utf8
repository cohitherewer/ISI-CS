Devlina Ganguly finds out                                                
	The Supreme Court recently awarded Rs 1 crore as compensation to a software engineer who had become permanently disabled, thanks to medical negligence at a private nursing home in Hyderabad. The judgement has been hailed as a victory of the common man over the often-unethical medical fraternity.        
	Earlier this year a Mangalore-based nursing home was asked to pay Rs 15 lakh as compensation for negligence in treating a patient seven years ago.        
	These judgements have kindled the hope that doctors or medical institutions will take care not to be negligent as, if proved guilty, they may have to pay huge damages to the victims.        
	These judgements are significant because the compensation amounts, which have so far been on the lower side, are getting bigger. In order to understand the reasons for the low compensation amounts, one would do well to take a look at how the law deals with the issue of compensation. In Indian law, punishment for crimes is more important than compensation for wrongs done. Unlike in the West, we have different systems for civil remedies, criminal law remedies and disciplinary alternatives when an offence has been proved, explains Calcutta High Court advocate Protik Prokash Banerji.        
	Civil remedies for medical negligence are awarded at the appropriate consumer protection fora under the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, or in any civil court in the country. Only civil remedies provide for the payment of compensation to a claimant. Criminal remedy falls under the Indian Penal Code, carrying punitive measures such as imprisonment and fines. As of now, there is no provision for monetary compensation to the victim under this.        
	Someone seeking a disciplinary alternative would have to complain to the Indian Medical Council, which, theoretically, has the right to disbar or cancel the registration of the medical practitioner in question.        
	There is a three-tier system for consumer protection  the district consumer forum, the state commission and the national commission. Depending on the value of the compensation claimed, the case is filed before the appropriate forum. Unlimited pecuniary jurisdiction is only available if a case is filed with the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Delhi. The cost of litigation being higher in the capital, many claim lower amounts so that they can stay in their own city or state, explains Banerji.        
	Victims of medical malpractice may approach the district consumer disputes redressal forum when the damages claimed is less than Rs 5 lakh. Claims that range between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 20 lakh may be filed at the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission. Claims above Rs 20 lakh are addressed by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission.        
	Earlier this year the Supreme Court made it mandatory for cases of medical negligence to be scrutinised and approved as genuine by doctors before they could be allowed to proceed. In fact, all complaints must be endorsed in writing by two medical specialists.        
	This is a big blow to consumer protection. It is almost as though the judiciary is not keen to take the medical fraternity to court. Doctors will rarely testify against a fellow practitioner, says M. S. Kamath, general secretary of the Mumbai-based Consumer Guidance Society of India.        
	Dr Kunal Saha, who has been fighting a long-drawn legal battle since the death of his wife Anuradha, which occurred because of alleged medical negligence, compares the system in India with that in the UK or the US. Indian doctors are reluctant to come forward and testify against their professional colleagues. The picture is very different in the West where medical experts routinely testify against reckless treatment by other doctors. This makes conviction of errant medicos common in countries like the UK and US, says Dr Saha who lives in the US. The final hearing in the case, to be held in the Supreme Court on July 14, may draw the curtain on a case involving the highest compensation demanded in Indian legal history  Rs 77 crore, plus interest for the past 11 years.        
	Though Saha has battled on for a decade, the average litigant is often daunted by the impediments in the system. For instance, the claimant has to first pay a court fee proportionate to the amount of the compensation sought. In other words, a claimant who has already suffered from medical negligence has to pay to get his claim adjudicated. Since he is not sure of winning, he is usually wary of making a huge claim for, if he loses the case, he also loses the money he paid as court fees.        
	Saha feels that because of the small amounts involved, the relatively rare awards of compensation by consumer courts against medical negligence have failed to satisfy the primary purpose of punishment. The recent judgement by the apex court should pave the way for the lower courts to award adequate compensation when they find a doctor guilty of medical negligence. It is only then that compensation can act as a deterrent to reckless medical practices.        
	Compensation is not any easier to get in cases where a person is killed or suffers injuries in a road accident. The Motor Vehicles Act (MVA), 1988, instructs the tribunals to grant just and fair compensation to victims. However, arriving at a fair and reasonable figure has never been easy. Says New Delhi-based advocate J.K. Mittal, Even if one claims compensation under the MVA, the amounts stated in the act are very low. The Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Bill, 2007, that sought to increase the quantum of compensation, is still pending in Parliament.        
	The amendment had suggested that the existing amount of compensation be raised from Rs 25,000 to Rs 50,000 in case of the death of a person in hit-and-run accidents. In cases of grievous hurt, the amount of compensation is proposed to be increased from Rs 12,500 to Rs 25,000. Even the amount asked for in the amendment is not much, points out Rajesh Singh, advocate, Calcutta High Court.        
	On May 21, the apex court held that courts should award monetary compensation to parents who lose their children in accidents because of the trauma they undergo over and above the loss of the victims prospective earnings.        
	But Singh does not see the point of such compensation. Awarding compensation based on the trauma that a person has undergone is an absurd idea. Determining the amount for pecuniary damages itself is fraught with the risk of unfairness. These amounts differ from case to case, depending on the deceaseds financial status, his or her age and also the ages of the claimants, and their future prospects. Non-pecuniary damages would only add to the confusion.        
	In a judgement dated April 15, 2009, (Smt Sarala Verma and others versus Delhi Transport Corporation and another) the Supreme Court acknowledged the problems arising while awarding compensation. The lack of uniformity and consistency in awarding compensation has been a matter of grave concern, states the judgement.        
	Still, a beginning has been made. As Mittal puts it, At the moment one can only be cautiously optimistic. We still have a long way to go.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | It is all about lines

	The paintings and mixed media works of four artists of different ages are being displayed at Halo Heritage art gallery in an exhibition titled Minds Eye (Aug 21-Oct 19), and the accent of most of the works is on lines. This is not surprising because two of them  Krishnendu Chaki and Prabir Sen  are well-known illustrators and both are trying to break out of that mould. Subhendu Sarkar is a young artist, while Anita Roy Choudhury is a pretty senior practitioner.        
	Sarkar seems to be inspired by music and hieroglyphs, and often, some of the forms he creates can be loosely described as frozen music, to borrow Goethes phrase describing architecture. This is not to say that his works are forbidding and glum, like a lot of non-figurative work. On the contrary, they are quite cheery, often resembling quirky musical notes, a vortex or even the eye of a storm (picture). The musical notes resembling hieroglyph seem to traipse along the border of his paintings in a nonchalant manner. Sometimes he covers the paintwork with a thin whitewash, so that they resemble blown-up, rather whimsical music sheets.        
	He hardly uses any colour in the background and this gives his work a strong graphic character. This is something he has in common with the paintings of Chaki and Sen.        
	Prabir Sen seems to cover his canvases with cut-outs of foliage, but the leaves turn out to be feral human beings and birds. He uses a limited number of colours like ochre, brown, violet and orange to create the impression of the figures lying concealed amidst bushes. The eyes of the human beings seem to burn behind the fringe of leaves, and this gives his work a somewhat mysterious and disconcerting quality like those paintings of vegetables lumped together to form a human face.        
	Chaki uses lines alone to represent a field, a woman and a tree, a paddy field and a townscape, possibly in Europe. He too uses only yellow, green and red, and the colours in unison occasionally seem to emanate fluorescent waves. To create his forms, he wields lines in a most telling manner. His lines are spare and they are mostly ramrod straight. While the starkness of both the works of Sen and Chaki is appealing, viewers may find them wanting in the complexity that one looks for in a painting. An illustration always needs a reference. Rarely can it stand alone.        
	Anita Roy Choudhury often repeats herself in her paintings. They are usually a never-ending procession of hillscapes. In these smaller works, she has introduced human and animal figures, and they are often indistinguishable from representations of nature. This gives these smaller works an enigmatic quality lacking in her canvases.

	Veena Dhanammal: The making of a legend 
  By Lakshmi Subramanian, Routledge, Rs 295                
	Dhanam. In the history and folklore of south Indian music and dance, she is a name like none other. Little is known of her personal history, and very few of her recordings survive; but the presence remains. The photograph on the cover of Lakshmi Subramanians book says it all. Dhanam stares stonily, even angrily, into the distance; a hard, unyielding face, not beautiful but commanding.        
	Tanjavur Dhanam (1866-1938), who came to be known as Veena Dhanammal, was born to Sundarammal, the daughter of Rukmini. Professional dancers and musicians of the time defined themselves by their lineage and tradition. Life was not easy for women who pursued the classical arts as a hereditary profession. Kulaparampara, or family traditions, ensured that the performing arts were protected over the generations, but the arts flourished as they did owing to the character and spirit of these women. Their lives were limited not only by the lack of opportunities but also by a crippling dependence on the whims of fickle patrons.        
	Lakshmi Subramanian has two major published works, both on the development of a formal tradition and structures of music and musical performance in the context of a growing nationalism. Caste and language influenced the tradition, as did forces of migration, urbanization and the growth of mass communication. In her most recent work, Veena Dhanammal: The Making of a Legend, Subramanian attempts to place Dhanammals life and work in this context. Or rather, to show how Dhanams life and work, over the same period, took a different path.        
	From the beginning of the last century, major changes began to occur in the nature of musical performance. By the 1930s, organized concerts were in vogue, a pattern inspired by Ariyakudi Ramanuja Iyengar. A distinction was made between classical and other pieces, with pride of place given to the compositions of the Trinity, Syama Sastri, Tyagaraja and Muthuswami Diksitar. All this was considered a substantial improvement over the largely mofussil entertainments of the previous century.        
	Tanjavur Dhanams roots were deep in the Kaveri tradition, and she grew into her family tradition of songs of the Trinity, as also of the genre of semi-erotic padams and javalis. The salon was her natural home, the cultivated man her preferred audience, the songs of the Trinity and love poetry in Telugu, some written in tribute to her by Dharmapuri Subbarayar, her repertoire of choice. She was known as a great artiste, but not one who could work the sabha circuit. Dhanammal, honoured as she was for her lineage and her art, died as a courtesan in poverty, bereft of patronage.        
	What, specifically, were the highlights of Dhanams musical style and how were they different from the trends of the day? Subramanian spends considerable time trying to understand Dhanams veena technique. Dhanammals style depended absolutely on the composed piece, and her art lay in its sensitive understanding and interpretation. The mood was always slow and reflective. There was no flashiness, no aggressive demonstration of laya, but instead, a refined performance which, to Dhanam, represented the best of a womans art.        
	Lakshmi Subramanian wisely concentrates on contemporary appreciations of Dhanam by Rangaramanuja Ayyangar and N.D. Varadachariar, among others. The book is not a biography in the conventional sense. Subramanian has not taken anecdotes for evidence, but, despite the absence of enough biographical material, helps us understand how and why Dhanammal came to be known as a legend.

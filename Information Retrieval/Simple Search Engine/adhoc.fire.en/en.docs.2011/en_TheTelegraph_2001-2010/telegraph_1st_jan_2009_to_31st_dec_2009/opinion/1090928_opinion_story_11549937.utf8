The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | The new gold rush
                                                                                                                 THE NEW GOLD RUSH                          - The oddest links have been created in Indias economic sphere        Ashok Mitra                                                  
	Norman Borlaug, the American plant pathologist and geneticist, died the other day. Eulogies and tributes to his memory have choked the media. He had developed the dwarfed variety of wheat; this is supposed to have ushered in the Green Revolution in countries such as ours. Political leaders and academic doyens are in total accord: Borlaug was a great hunger-fighter.        
	Some facts run parallel to one another and yet fail to develop a mutual relationship. Borlaug, the cognoscenti say, could claim credit for Indias attaining self-sufficiency in food. The reality that stares us in the face has a different flavour: the country is currently experiencing one of the worst droughts in recent decades and food is likely to be in very short supply. Three-fifths of the nation who depend on agriculture and allied activities for their livelihood are going to experience a steep fall in their earnings. Millions of people, particularly small farmers and landless wage-workers, will possibly starve; quite a few will commit suicide; some will die. Notwithstanding Borlaug, Indias agriculture still remains a gamble in the monsoon; output fluctuates, in frightening proportion, with the vagaries of the rain gods mood. This is a fact as solid as rock, at least as solid as Borlaugs reputation as a hunger fighter.              
	Another fact, receiving equally wide coverage in the media, concerns movements in Indias gross domestic product. It is official: our GDP this year is to grow at a rate exceeding six per cent. What a wonderful achievement; dainty ladies who come and go talking of Michelangelo will now be excitedly mentioning this fantastic feat on the part of India. A global recession, the worst in 80 years, is on; the growth rate in the United States of America is zero; in West Europe, too, it is barely positive. While such is the daunting picture in most of the rest of the world, India has by and large held on to its growth targets. The services sector continues to be buoyant, partly because orders placed earlier for softwares from the industrially advanced countries have either not yet run out or not been reneged. Growth in manufactures was rather turgid for some time, but is of late showing signs of picking up. Foreign exchange is rolling in, almost gushingly; many expatriate Indians are in fact closing down their accounts in crash-prone American banks and sending the money home. The stock market is booming because of these cumulative factors; the sensitive index might indeed touch the 20,000 mark very soon.        
	In these circumstances, why be moronic and worry over agriculture which constitutes less than one-fifth of the economy, even though it provides livelihood to more than 60 per cent of the countrys population? International recognition is awesomely dependent on a satisfactory rate of GDP growth. It is pointless to be sentimental; whether a sizeable number of people in the country go hungry or suffer from undernourishment is of no relevance in the context.        
	Parallel lines do not meet, parallel facts, too, keep to their respective grooves. Agriculture, the major source of livelihood for the Indian people, is in the throes of a severe crisis; the rate of growth in the agrarian sector could be negligible or even negative this year. At the same time, India will flaunt about the highest rate of GDP growth on the global stage. Each datum has its own significance.        
	On the face of it, the GDP can do without growth in farm output: the two categories would seem to be without any link. There are, however, other linkages at work. Take, for instance, some stray news being reported in the media. New Zealand cricket authorities, one such report says, have chosen to curtail their Test series against England. This decision was considered necessary to enable their players to participate in the Indian Premier League. It was a very serious matter. Had their cricket bosses tried to be funny, the New Zealand players would have revolted: after all, they have to eat and enjoy reasonably good living, the IPL money would help them in that direction, Test cricket gives them only a paltry sum; first thing first, namely, the IPL.        
	Another news item: Ricky Ponting, the Australian cricket captain, has announced his retirement from the countrys Twenty20 team. He will however honour his commitments with the IPL and play the Twenty20 fixtures organized by it. A third, equally exciting, piece of news is about Freddie Flintoff, undoubtedly one of Englands major cricketing heroes in recent times. Flintoff has reported physical tiredness and announced his withdrawal from any future Test series. He is nonetheless keen to continue playing both One Day Internationals and Twenty20 fixtures. He has made a further announcement: he will henceforth play as freelance. He has just turned down a contract offered by the England Cricket Board, and is busy negotiating with the IPL, which has dangled before him an amount one hundred times as much as what the ECB offered.        
	These snippets of tidings from the cricketing world constitute a collage of hardcore realities which has a direct causal relationship with Indias gross domestic product running on the fast forward track. Spectacular growth registered by Indias GDP implies availability of more money with the countrys affluent set. A substantial fraction of this money will drift towards the durable and non-durable consumer goods and services markets. The media, it follows, will be overwhelmed by advertisements to entrap customers itching to spend. The money earmarked for such advertisements will mesh in with the live broadcasts of IPL matches. A five-second television advertising spot, one report suggests, fetches Rs 500,000 for the IPL, which will sit atop an astronomically huge pile of money. Coconut water, the old Harry Bellafonte song chanted, is good for your daughter; the IPL gravy is good for cricketers of the world.              
	Brendan McCullum, Ricky Ponting and Andrew Flintoff have therefore all a stake in Indias prosperity and uninterrupted GDP growth. Three-fifths of the nation, who subsist on agriculture, cannot claim any similar stakes; they are not an adjunct of the GDP growth matrix, they are evidently not beneficiaries of this growth.        
	Sixty-odd years of independence have produced very odd sorts of links and non-links in the economic sphere. The economy, as measured by wise grammarians, expands and supposedly prospers. This prosperity does not, however, touch the nations majority. The economy bursting at the seam invites foreigners to come and partake of the feast sumptuously spread before them: it is almost like a gold rush. The nations majority is left out of this bonanza.        
	In the meantime, more exciting news from elsewhere hints of a new link. The so-called Doha initiative of the World Trade Organisation has, rumour suggests, a bright idea: the Indian government must lower tariff on import of farm products from the rich countries, the latter would then allow more of Indias manufactures enter their countries; it would be in the nature of a quid pro quo; men and women dependent on agriculture in India should agree to further deprivation in order that more affluence could be showered on the nations creamy layer; the missing link then could cease to be missing. True, a link of this nature is not much of a contribution to original thought. The British rulers had similar ideas right from the middle of the 19th century; they had also put those ideas into practice with great gusto. So we at least discover a link with a colonial past too.

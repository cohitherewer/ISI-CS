	Not above politics                  
	Sir  The controversy created by the chief election commissioner, N. Gopalaswami, by wanting to remove Navin Chawla, his colleague in the Election Commission, raises a few questions (Centre faces EC crisis, Feb 1). Chawla, who has been accused by Gopalaswami of being partisan, may not be an angel. But Gopalaswamis recommendation to the president asking for Chawlas ouster a few months before elections proves that the former is no saint either. The people of India would like to know what took the CEC so long to come up with his suggestion. As the noted jurist, Fali S. Nariman, has pointed out, had Gopalaswami asked for Chawlas dismissal a year ago, it might have been considered as a bona fide complaint. It is evident that Gopalaswamis demand is politically motivated. Who knows, he might join the Bharatiya Janata Party after his retirement. Meanwhile, he seems to be trying his best to ensure that Chawla is not made the next CEC. Arun Jaitleys remarks also make it clear that the present crisis has been created by the BJP, which is unsure about how it would perform in the coming elections. Perhaps both Gopalaswami and Chawla need to go because the EC as an institution is bigger than the two warring individuals. We cannot allow our institutions to be run on political patronage.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  In an unprecedented move, N. Gopalaswami asked the president of India for the removal of Navin Chawla. This has, expectedly, created ripples in political circles. Gopalaswami, the chief election commissioner, is close to retirement and Chawla is being tipped to succeed him, thereby raising suspicions that the CECs move is not above politics. In fact, the constitutional expert and former attorney-general, Soli Sorabjee, has reportedly stated that Gopalaswami has set a bad precedent by his action. It is now hoped that the president will take the right decision in the interest of the country and the Constitution.           
	Yours faithfully,       
R. Sekar, Visakhapatnam 

                
	Sir  Successive governments are responsible for the present imbroglio concerning the Election Commission. India has a fine system in place to appoint the chief of the central vigilance commission: the president appoints him on the basis of the recommendations of a committee, which includes the prime minister, the home minister as well as the leader of the Opposition. Why does the government not amend the Constitution so that the chief election commissioner is chosen in a similar manner?           
	There is a reason behind the governments unwillingness. Every government is only interested in misusing its powers to appoint favourites to important posts. It is disturbing to note that the present members of the EC are being perceived to be close to specific political parties. The president must replace the present office-holders with a new team whose members will be appointed by the prime minister together with the leader of the Opposition.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Subhash Chandra Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

                
	Sir  Navin Chawla has been leaning too much, and too openly, on his political mentors. Hence, he will fail to inspire confidence in the people if were to be appointed as the chief election commissioner. The country needs CECs in the mould of T.N. Seshan, J.M. Lyndogh and M.S. Gill to sustain democracy in these difficult times.           
	In a democracy, the views of the Opposition should be given more importance than those of the government, at least in the run-up to the elections. Hopefully, better sense will prevail and India will get a new, apolitical CEC. Why not nominate a retired army general in the commission to instil some discipline in the organization?                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Raghubir Singh, Pune

                
	Sir  The manner in which the office of the Election Commission has been dragged into a controversy is unfortunate. The EC needs to work unitedly to bring success in a democracy. But the present crisis  the chief election commissioner writing to the president asking for a member of the commission to be axed  is disconcerting, especially as it comes only a few months before the elections. Chawla can be removed, but not before a proper investigation is carried out. At the same time, the issue should not be politicized any further. Every political party must look at the matter objectively, and without bias, to bring the matter to a speedy end.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Manjunath R. Goudar, Dharwad, Karnataka 

                
	Sir  The Union law minister, H.R. Bharadwaj, had recently stated that the chief election commissioner has politicized the Election Commission. This is not a fair assessment. The workings of the EC should be transparent. If there is an allegation of political bias against a member of the commission, it should not be overlooked.           
	The Lok Sabha elections are around the corner and the EC is now busy preparing for the polls. This is thus a vital time, and steps should be taken to ensure that the commission is free of any controversy. Despite the lack of time, the allegations against Navin Chawla need to be probed. If the verdict comes in Chawlas favour, he should be allowed to continue with his responsibilities.          
	Yours faithfully,

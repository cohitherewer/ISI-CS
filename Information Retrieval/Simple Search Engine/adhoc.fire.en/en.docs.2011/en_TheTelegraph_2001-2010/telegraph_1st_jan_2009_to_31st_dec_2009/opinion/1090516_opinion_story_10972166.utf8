The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Comedies riddled with too many errors
                                                                                                                 COMEDIES RIDDLED WITH TOO MANY ERRORS                                  THEATARE: Ananda Lal                                                  
	For an obscure play written in 1865, The Newly Married Couple is pretty farsighted. Yet this should come as no surprise because the author, Bjrnstjerne Bjrnson, won the third Nobel Prize for Literature (1903) at the grand old age of 71. Better known as an idealistic poet, novelist and politician, he composed several good plays, but only a few comedies, including this one. We can understand from it how Ibsen got some ideas from his compatriot and co-claimant to the title of Norways greatest writer  perhaps even the character of the child-bride which he developed into Nora in A Dolls House.        
	The newlyweds here have a problem: the husband does not get to see his wife as much as he wants because they live in his wealthy in-laws house (picture); according to him, she spends more time with her parents. He implies to us that they have not consummated their relationship, and insists that the two of them move out on their own, which they do. The marriage appears headed for disaster but, as this is a comedy, resolves happily. Interestingly, Bjrnson leaves the husbands former lover stranded at the end, as one who sacrifices her desire for the sake of her friends.        
	Theatrecian chose the text well, and in a bid to contemporize, adapted it into an Indian family context, but also chasing popular appeal, dumbed it down by inserting cheap, prurient dialogue that smeared the spirit of Bjrnson. The net result was that instead of thoughtful comedy by a major literary figure, we got (in Theatrecians honest self-advertisement) the silliest play of the year dripping with innuendoes, bringing to mind the Punjabi sex farces of Sapru House in Delhi. A lot of acting talent went to waste, though one noted the uninhibited potential of Shayak Barman as the husband.        
	Mumbai theatre often does similar things, as we know, but the latest production to fly in from the west, Yogesh Shanghvis Shadi Mubarak, also a wedding drama, at least did not stoop so low. All Mir Muneer, the scriptwriter, did was to lift the story of the Hollywood classic, Father of the Bride, Hindify it and, of course, forget to acknowledge the source. Worse, rather than go to Vincente Minnellis black-and-white original starring Spencer Tracy and Elizabeth Taylor, he plagiarized the colour remake with Steve Martin, crudely and explicitly portraying its effeminate wedding planner as gay. Manoj Shahs direction left little time for the tender emotions that immortalize the movie, though Mohan Bhandaris deadpan delivery in the lead was unusual for such a commercial venture.

                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Trial and error                  
	Sir  The acquittal of the six Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad students accused of beating to death H.S. Sabharwal of Madhav College, Ujjain, on the campus exposes the vulnerability of the countrys judicial system to political pressure (Professor case in sabotage rut, July 15). The incident, which occurred in full public view and was covered by several television channels, could not be proved in court apparently because the witnesses had turned hostile.           
	One wonders why the video footage could not be construed as documentary evidence. When powerful people are involved in a crime, it is not impossible that ordinary witnesses should lose their nerve and feel reluctant to identify the accused. Some reforms are necessary in the traditional method of establishing the truth of an incident that is based mainly on witnesses depositions before the court. The original lawmakers could not have anticipated the revolution in the electronic media and so had made no provision for visual clippings as authentic evidence. Now that there is a case for it, a judicial amendment is needed to ensure that justice is delivered in such cases.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Srikanta Bhattacharjee, 

      
	Calcutta                     
	Questionable conduct          
	Sir  It is unfortunate for the Kerala chief minister, V.S. Achuthanandan, that his politburo membership has been forfeited by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) central committee for his alleged defiance of the party leadership (Kerala CM removed from politburo, July 13). He had signalled the Central Bureau of Investigation to go ahead with the inquiry on the alleged abuse of public funds by the fellow politburo member, Pinarayi Vijayan, when the latter was power minister.           
	For a section of the CPI(M) leadership, this amounted to violation of party discipline. Vijayan, secretary of the Kerala unit, controls the party organization, which, according to the CPI(M) general secretary, Prakash Karat, could be compromised if Vijayan is called to account. The action against Achuthanandan is drastic and will not bring an end to the prolonged feud between the two political heavyweights in Kerala. It will rather worsen factionalism within a party already marginalized in Kerala.           
	When he was power minister, Vijayan had favoured a Canadian firm bypassing standard practices of calling tender and made the state poorer by many crores. This could have been avoided if the order was placed with Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited, which had the lowest tender. Vijayan visited Canada several times at public expense to finalize the deal. He is accountable to the people of Kerala and only the CBI investigation can prove whether the alleged irregularities are merely a reflection of the chief ministers vendetta. Be that as it may, the central committees clean chit to Vijayan on the corruption charges is undemocratic.           
	Earlier, the outgoing Lok Sabha Speaker, Somnath Chatterjee, was expelled from the party summarily. After the Left withdrew its support from the United Progressive Alliance government, Chatterjee was asked to renounce the post of Speaker, which he did not, citing constitutional obligation. This shows that principles have no place in communist culture. Achuthanandan has to face the central committees wrath for sticking to his own ideology.           
	Known for his honesty in public office, Achuthanandan has a mass following and his expulsion will be an irreparable damage to the CPI(M) in Kerala. The fact that the decision prompted frenzied mobs to stage demonstrations on the streets manifests the great divide in the party. A Stalinist party never brooks indiscipline but is home to corruption. This is evident from the hectic activity in the central committee to cover up the lapses of Vijayan.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Subhankar Mukherjee,

	Sir  By targeting righteous leaders like V.S. Achuthanandan, Prakash Karat has shown himself in a poor light. Actually, it is Karat and his coterie who are responsible for the Lefts electoral defeat and hence Karat himself should resign from the politburo first.           
	It is a pity that Achuthanandan, thrown out of the party for manipulated indiscipline, still obeys Karats diktat. Karats attempts to cobble together a Third Front with a possible aim to become prime minister were an indication of his greed for power. Although that experiment has failed miserably, Karat still says that there is a need to remodel the Front. Surely, Karats move is intended to hide his weakness as a leader. Before the election, Karat had asserted that bereft of Left support, the Congress would be in no position to form a government. His predictions have been proved wrong, but he still sticks to his post. The fact is that the CPI(M) is losing its influence in West Bengal and Kerala. Leaders of all factions have deviated from communist principles. When most have distanced themselves from the people, it is only leaders such as Achuthanandan who still sustain the party in these states. But Karat pretends to be unaware of this.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
K. James Williams, 

      
	Alappuzha, Kerala                     
	Sir  The common people of Kerala are outraged at the dismissal of V.S. Achuthanandan from the politburo. But they do not know where to complain and how. A petition registered with the police would remain unattended if it is against a panchayat president drawn from Marxist cadre.           
	It seems that people really have lost the right to complain as many places in Kerala have seen a rise in violence, with bomb-blasts along transport routes. In this context, Achuthanandan should act firmly as chief minister to put an end to the turmoil.          
	Yours faithfully,      
K.A. Solaman, 

      
	Alappuzha, Kerala

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Vying for space
                                                                                                                 VYING FOR SPACE                                  Fifth Column - Abhijit Bhattacharyya                              
	The departure of the French from amongst the six combat aircraft bidders vying for space in the Indian arms bazaar and the selection of the 126 medium multi-role-combat aircraft by the Indian Air Force was unexpected, and hence unforeseen. Perhaps never before has Paris made such an early exit from the arms market. Till the French took leave, they were regarded as tough challengers owing to their long association with the Indian defence and civil aviation market in general, and the IAF in particular. From the 1950s to the 1970s, the IAF has used the Paris-made Ouragons and Mystres, and from 1985 to the present, the two squadrons of Mirage 2000, which is considered Indias finest fighter in both defensive and offensive air warfare. At the same time, the French exit makes the selection of aircraft somewhat easier for the Indian decision-makers.        
	Two questions would cross the minds of all those who are keenly watching the procurement procedure of Indian arms. First, what could be the reason for the unprecedented failure of Paris for whom India has traditionally been a familiar and friendly market? Second, who now could be the winner of the $10-11 billion jackpot that is up for grabs?        
	At the moment, however, the unhappy French are waiting for the official communication from India informing of Rafale aircrafts exit from the request-for-proposal process. The French feel that their Rafale was axed owing to US pressure on foreign governments over defence deals. Going beyond the Indian frontier, the French have also alleged that in the past they lost contracts in Seoul and Singapore owing to suspected US pressure. Thus, in the eyes of Paris, Washington is the villain of the piece, the departure of George W. Bush and the arrival of Barack Obama notwithstanding.                
	Grim reminder        
	The bitterness of the French is understandable, France being one of the few fighter manufacturers that compete with the product of the United States of America and Russia. Although there exist some more individual fighter producers like China, Japan and Sweden, the French have successfully created a niche for themselves in the market for combat aircraft. The French allegation of US pressure may not be all unfounded since the importance of the US in the Indian arms bazaar has been rising steadily over the past few years.         
	In May 2007, the US Congress informed India of its intention to supply the country with six C-130J transport aircraft worth $1.059 billion. The wording of the notification provided an insight into the likely US policy with regard to military supplies and co-operation. India and the United States are forging an important strategic partnership. The proposed sale will enhance the foreign policy and national security objectives of the US by providing the Indian government with a credible special operations airlift capability that will deter aggression in the region, provide humanitarian airlift capability and ensure interoperability with US forces in coalition operations, it said.        
	Thus assuming, without conceding, that the French allegation is correct, can anyone deny the increasing inter dependability between Washington and Delhi in defence and diplomatic matters? The French were more than confident of their standing in the Indian arms scenario till the cancellation of the 197 Eurocopter hit them hard in 2008. Then came the shocking ouster of the high-profile French Rafale. It was a grim reminder to the military merchants of the fact that the line dividing success and failure does not necessarily depend on mathematical calculation. There are just too many imponderables in the arms bazaar of six suppliers and one buyer. And all is fair in love, war, and in the purchase of IAF fighter aircraft.

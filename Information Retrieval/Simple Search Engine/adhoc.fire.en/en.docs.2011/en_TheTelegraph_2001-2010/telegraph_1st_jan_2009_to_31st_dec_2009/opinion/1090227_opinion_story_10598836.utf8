	HITLER rsquo;S PRIVATE LIBRARY: THE BOOKS THAT SHAPED HIS LIFE By Timothy W. Ryback, The Bodley Head, pound;13.25  
	It is as difficult to associate Adolf Hitler with love for books and reading, as it is to link Germany, the land of Goethe, Hegel, Bach and Mann, with Nazism. Both, however, are very true and represent paradoxes for which neither historians nor psychoanalysts have convincing explanations.  
	Hitler had a private library of estimated 16,000 volumes; and he had read many of these books, as is evident, Timothy W. Ryback points out, from the marginal marking many of these books contain. He once boasted that he read at least one book per night, sometimes more. This should raise the question about what he absorbed from what he read.        
	Such doubts notwithstanding, Hitlers comments on some of the books he had read were perceptive. He said Don Quixote had ingeniously portrayed the end of an era, and ranked the novel with Robinson Crusoe, Uncle Toms Cabin and Gullivers Travels among the great works of world literature. Defores novel, he remarked, captured the development of the entire history of mankind. Shakespeare he considered superior to Schiller and Goethe. His personal Collected Works of Shakespeare he had bound in hand-tooled Moroccan leather with a gold-embossed eagle flanked by his initials on the spine. He kept his Shakespeare volumes in the second-floor study of his Alpine retreat in southern Germany. These comments, by no means, suggest that Hitler was an inattentive and uncomprehending reader. In fact, they suggest a reader of some discernment, however difficult this may be to accept in the case of Hitler.        
	The fall of the Third Reich and the division of Germany between the Soviet and the Allies scattered Hitlers library to various parts of the world. From Munich, Berlin and Obersalzberg near Berchtesgaden, about 1,200 volumes arrived in the Rare Book Division of the Library of Congress. There they remained in obscurity till Ryback decided that they were an interesting source for the understanding of Hitler. Smaller caches surfaced in Brown University and elsewhere.        
	The Soviet side was, however, a different story. When Albert Aronson arrived in Berlin as part of the US delegation to negotiate the joint occupation of the city, the Soviets took him on a tour of Hitlers private quarters and allowed him to take away 80 books. Around the same time, the entire Reich Chancellery library (around 10,000 volumes) was taken away by the Soviets, sent to Moscow and never seen again. Ryback says in a footnote that in the early 1990s, a Moscow newspaper reported that these books were lying in an abandoned church in a suburb of Moscow called Uzkoe. Shortly after the article was printed, the collection was removed and has not been heard of, or seen, since. Why the Soviet regime, or even the post-Soviet one, is so shy of telling the world what it retrieved from Nazi Germany, especially from Hitlers bunker, will remain a mystery.        
	Through painstaking research, Ryback unpacks Hitlers library and reads it for clues that might help in understanding the man and his actions. Hitler was a heavy underliner; he also put parallel lines next to certain passages. He used the same devices as other careful readers who use these as an aid to memory or even to carry on ones own internal dialogue with a book.        
	It would be an exaggeration to claim that from Hitlers library, and from his reading, it is possible to gain complete access to a mind as complex and perverse as his. This book takes forward the newly-emerging subject of history of reading. What and how did one of 20th centurys greatest monsters read?

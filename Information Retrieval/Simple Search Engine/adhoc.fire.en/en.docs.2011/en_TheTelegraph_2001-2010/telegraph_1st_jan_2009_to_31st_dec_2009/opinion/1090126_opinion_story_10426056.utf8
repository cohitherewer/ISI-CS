                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Face lift                  
	Sir  The adulation heaped on Narendra Modi at the Vibrant Gujarat Global Investors Summit implies that his leadership has come full circle (Ambani push for Modi, Jan 15). He was once treated as a political pariah and the choicest abuses were hurled at him. At one point of time, it even seemed that the former pracharak of the sangh parivar would be banished from public life. Modi has proved his opponents wrong. He has won two consecutive elections with a thumping majority, and has shown his determination and skill to tide over adversities. This not only proves his political acumen but also his sincere desire to address the issue of development in the state.           
	Since the post-Godhra riots, the state has not seen any further socio-political violence, thanks to the well-oiled law-enforcing machinery. Modi has successfully invoked Gujarati pride to enthuse his people. Unlike many others, Modi has never blamed the Centre to cover his failures. The results are there for everyone to see. Gujarats elevation from a violence-prone state to the best investment destination of the country has been possible because of Modis able leadership.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Srikanta Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Anil Ambani and Sunil Mittal seem to be hopelessly out of touch with reality. If the need is for a leader, why choose Narendra Modi, whose state-sponsored pogrom following the Godhra incident is a blot in independent Indias history? Quite evidently, big business houses see nothing beyond profit, as the Satyam scandal has shown. Industrialists have no objection to setting up business where it is most profitable, even if it is on the dead body of innocent people.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad

                
	Sir  The push for Narendra Modi has not come as a surprise. Anil Ambanis statement would be welcomed by all who want rapid industrialization and prosperity in India. Unfortunately, petty politics has stunted economic growth. If Modi shows a way out of this, why not support him?          
	Yours faithfully,       
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Now that praises are being showered on Narendra Modi, it is time Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee took a hard look at his Bengal. At every public meeting, the chief minister promises to make West Bengal an industrially-advanced state and to generate employment. Sadly, coming from a government that fails to remove polluting autorickshaws from the citys streets, all that is meaningless talk. Unlike Bhattacharjee, Modi means business. This is why he can arrange for land for industries at a short notice, demolish illegal places of worship without discriminating among religions and create a vibrant Gujarat. None of this is possible in Bengal, which has Bhattacharjee as its chief minister as well as a disruptive Opposition led by Mamata Banerjee.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Tamal Basu, Hooghly

                
	Sir  Narendra Modis success in attracting investment assurances of several crores is a welcome sign in this time of recession. It shows that if there is a strong leader running a government, investors will flock to the state, irrespective of its ruling partys ideological affiliations. There is no reason why Modi alone should be able to court success. If other leaders create similar opportunities, investments will come their way too.           
	Yours faithfully,      
M. Javed Aziz, Mumbai 

      
	Sir  After Anil Ambanis endorsement of Narendra Modi as prime minister, the Congress spokesperson, Manish Tiwari, has asked why industrialists should vote for a leader who is not trusted by the Supreme Court to conduct a fair investigation into the Godhra riots. Tiwari has also pointed out that the United States of America similarly distrusts Modi and has refused him visa. But is the US, which is responsible for the killing of thousands in Iraq, Afghanistan and now in Gaza, a protector of human rights? If Guantanamo Bay is anything to go by, Tiwari should remember that the US itself has one of the worst human rights records in the world. He should also not forget his own partys involvement in communal violence following Indira Gandhis assassination.           
	Yours faithfully,       
S.B. Gupta, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The Congress is over-reacting to Anil Ambanis comment on Narendra Modi (BJP seizes on fascist barb, Jan 16). Industrialists are paper tigers, so their growls do not matter. Besides, they did not make Manmohan Singh the prime minister, the people did. So there is little chance of Modi becoming prime minister unless the people want him to be so.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Chameli Pal, Batanagar

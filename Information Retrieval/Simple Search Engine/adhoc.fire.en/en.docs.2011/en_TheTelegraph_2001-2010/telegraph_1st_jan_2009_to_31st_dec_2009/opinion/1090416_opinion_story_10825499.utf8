The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Oddities and broken dreams
                                                                                                                 ODDITIES AND BROKEN DREAMS                                  Vidya Munsi, former member of the CPI and a veteran womens activist, talks about the Left Fronts position on women in politics                                            
	The Left Front has fielded two women in the 42 seats it is contesting for in the Lok Sabha polls in West Bengal. The two women  Jyotirmoyi Sikdar from Krishnagar and Sushmita Barui from Bishnupur  are seeking to be re-elected to Parliament. Tellingly, the four communist parties that make up the Front have not been able to find a suitable new face among their legions of female members. In 1999, the Left Front had put up three women contestants; the number was four in 2004. For the elections to the 15th Lok Sabha, in Bengal, the percentage of women candidates in the Left parties put together is a dismal five per cent.         
	Significantly, the Trinamul Congress, the principal Opposition party, has nominated five women for its 27 seats. Its ally, the Congress, has fielded three women. If one were to consider the Bharatiya Janata Partys three women contestants, the total number of women candidates in the Opposition would be 11. In the 294-member state assembly, the Left Front has 25 women among its 233 members, while the Opposition has seven women among 52 MLAs.        
	One would have expected these figures to make Vidya Munsi frown. Instead, a smile broke out on her face as she sat listening to the numbers being rattled out. Munsi  a former member of the Communist Party of Indias national council and a veteran womens activist  is also possibly Calcuttas first woman journalist. In a long and diverse career, she has seen and learnt a lot. It is possible that nothing, not even the irony of the progressive Left nominating two women as electoral candidates, surprises her any more. But experience has also taught her how to conceal her disappointment. Seemingly unperturbed, she proceeded to offer an explanation.               
	Politics does not exist in a vacuum, reasoned Munsi. Social conditions, she added, have determined politics in all historical epochs, and Indias social reality still mirrors the discrimination faced by the countrys women since ancient times. So as long as women remain unequal socially, they would continue to be denied comprehensive political representation.         
	Munsi also reasoned that in elections, candidates are selected on the basis of the winnability quotient, to borrow from electoral jargon. In a skewed, patriarchal order, men always command a greater chance of winning an election. For a moment, she let her mind wander to a time when she used to tour Bengals districts interviewing people. Munsi reminisced about her interactions with women in a village in Nadia. They wanted to vote for men because men, they were convinced, are more suited for a career in politics. By prioritizing the candidacy of men over women, political parties, including the Left, merely reflect this ingrained social conservatism. Therefore, the Lefts decision to give minimal representation to women, Munsi added, is premised on political pragmatism, rather than ideology.         
	Munsi also scoffed at claims that the Opposition in Bengal is more sympathetic towards womens political empowerment. There isnt much of a difference between two and five, she said, referring to the number of women candidates put up by the Left and the Trinamul Congress.        
	But what about the importance of gestures in politics, even symbolic ones? For instance, the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, one of the most successful social programmes of the United Progressive Alliance government, may not have transformed each and every life in Indias villages. But, for the people at the grassroots, it is a potent symbol of the governments commitment to collective welfare. Some experts are of the opinion that the NREGS may deliver rich electoral dividends for its creators. I argued that even if the Left were to agree to a nominal rise in the number of women candidates, it could have been interpreted as a meaningful gesture by the activists who are fighting to make the world more equal for women.        
	Munsi responded by referring to a powerful metaphor in independent Indias political imagination: the image of Indira Gandhi being the only one wearing pants in her cabinet. An Indian woman in pants in an exclusively male domain, the cabinet, is a clever inversion, said Munsi. Symbolically, it conveys the idea of a politically powerful woman as an oddity. The language of Indias political imagination hasnt changed much since then, she contended. Most women politicians in India today, be it Mamata Banerjee, Mayavati or even Jayalalithaa, are perceived to be mavericks, misfits. Given the skewed social reality, the Left, like most other political parties, finds it politically prudent to fight elections based on ground realities rather than make concessions to symbolic gestures.         
	But Munsi conceded that the Left parties must share the blame for failing to sensitize decision-makers in their ranks when it came to expanding the political space for women. The demand for political reservation for women was aired at a time when regional leaders like Lalu Prasad started their campaign for caste-based reservation in the polity. Caste alignments and equations determine contemporary Indian politics, whereas the womens reservation bill, which endorses the reservation of one-third of Parliaments seats for women, lies unimplemented. That the percentage of women MPs in Indias Parliament has never bettered 8 per cent can be attributed to the resistance of men to the bill, rather than to the absence of a cohesive leadership in the womens movement.              
	Munsi acknowledges the critical importance of this legislation. But she is still convinced that the model of political reservation practised in India is not entirely flawless. Even if the womens reservation bill were to be passed, she said, it is possible that the embedded nature of gender discrimination would result in political parties forcing women to seek the mandate from the most conservative constituencies, thereby jeopardizing their chances of success. Munsi also pointed to the fact that political reservation for women is already a reality in Bengals panchayats. But it has not quite resulted in any meaningful emancipation for the women. A possible way out, Munsi suggested, is the adoption of the reservation model that is in place in some Scandinavian countries that endorses the reservation of an equal number of seats for men and women. There is still a need for a larger social transformation that would result in women inheriting a more equitable society and polity. Munsi may not get to see this new world order in her life-time. It had come, and gone, she knows. But then, she has not stopped hoping, she said, changing from matter-of-fact to wistful. For all their inscrutability, communists are perhaps secretly affected by the burden of broken dreams.

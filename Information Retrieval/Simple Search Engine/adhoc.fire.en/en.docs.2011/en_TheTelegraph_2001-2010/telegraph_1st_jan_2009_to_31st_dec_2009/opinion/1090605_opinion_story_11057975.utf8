	Oscar Wilde as detective is a prospect impossible to resist for those who love detective thrillers and for those who enjoy the importance of being Wilde. Gyles Brandreth makes Wilde sparkle true to form even though the master of the epigram appears in a cast of characters that includes among others Arthur Conan Doyle and Bram Stoker.        
	The story is set in London, in 1892, when the scandal that was to destroy Wilde was still far away. In Wildes Sunday supper club, named after Socrates, he introduces an after-dinner game called Murder. It is innocent enough. Every person around the table  there were fourteen of them  was asked to write on a piece of paper the name of the person he would most love to murder. As the slips are pulled out of a bag, the gathering has to guess who put down which name. It is supposed to be fun as Wilde insists, despite Conan Doyles strong objections.        
	It would have remained fun: one geniuss bizarre whim. But then came one by one the deaths of four persons whose names had been the first four to be pulled out of the bag. (The term, person, needs to be modified since the third name was that of Captain Flint, the obnoxious parrot in Cadogan Hotel.) Even someone who believed in the law of coincidences would have to concede that someone with violent intentions seemed to be working his way down the list. Wilde had to be involved in the solution of the crimes not only because he had suggested the game but also because his name and that of his wife, Constance, were thirteenth and fourteenth on the list, respectively.        
	This sets up the main plot of the novel. Oscar Wilde moves across London with his dear and loyal friend, Robert Sherard, the great grandson of William Wordsworth and one of Constance Wildes admirers. The chase takes them to Eastbourne, and out of posh London to Astleys Circus amphitheatre on the south side of Westminster Bridge. But much of Wildes deductions is drawn over elaborate and expensive drinks or dinner either at Cadogan Hotel or at Browns Hotel on Albermarle Street. Wilde was a regular at both these establishments and, therefore, on very familiar terms with the staff. Not surprisingly, Wildes uncovering of the crimes also takes place over dinner at Socrates Club in the private dining room of the Cadogan Hotel. There is drama in the denouement.        
	What is alluring about this book is not only the main plot, which is powerful, but also the way the characters are built up. None of them appears cardboard. London of the early 1890s is beautifully evoked with a wonderful aside on how Conan Doyle is trying to get rid of his own detective, the sensation of Londons reading public. It isnt only Mayfair London that is delightfully portrayed but also Londons thriving underworld  the cab drivers, the police informers and Wildes version of what lovers of Sherlock Holmes have come to call the Baker Street Irregulars.        
	This is a delightful read. Lucidly and cleverly written with a generous sprinkling of Wildes memorable bons mots.

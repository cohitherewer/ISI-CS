The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | The means to an end
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        THE MEANS TO AN END                          - How Indias Look East policy could be made more effective					 					      Sunanda K. Datta-Ray                        Lee Kuan Yew				                                             
	The word, effective, in Rajeev Paralikars e-mail intrigued me. Admissions of fallibility are rare in this country, yet here was a bunch of scholarly institutions (including the Calcutta chapter of the Society for Indian Ocean Studies which Paralikar, a retired admiral, chairs) hosting an International Seminar on Indias Effective Look East Policy. The implication that the policy might also be ineffective was reason enough to cut short my stay in London by a few days to join the debate.        
	I was not disappointed. Delivering the valedictory address, Baladas Ghoshal, with academic experience of Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Japan, denied that India had a Look East policy at all. There is no strategic vision, he said, no depth to bilateral agreements, and no contact at the civil-society level. Though India also exported Islam to South-east Asia, people there are unaware of Indias large Muslim population. This sweeping (and perhaps overstated) repudiation recalled a senior external affairs ministry official claiming off the record that looking East was only a gambit to upstage Pakistan.        
	Ghoshal corroborated to some extent my own belief that P.V. Narasimha Rao looked East as the means to an end. It was one of several coordinated initiatives that didnt cause an uproar only because of his deft handling. Feelers were sent to Taiwan. Indias Washington embassy was instructed to establish contact with Israeli diplomats. Sporting ties were negotiated with still-apartheid-ridden South Africa. A high-ranking general was sent to the American-organized Pacific Armies Management Seminar and overtures were made to the Asia and Pacific council that Washington had hailed as a bulwark against Communism and India spurned as decisively as it had rejected the PAMS. Narasimha Rao was setting the stage for the Malabar exercises, the New Framework for India-US Defence Relationship and even the 123 Agreement by ending Indias estrangement of more than four decades from the United States of America.              
	Hence the title of my new book, Looking East to Look West, which probably accounted for the seminar invitation. I have little contact otherwise with the academic and semi-official institutions like Calcutta Universitys Centre for South and Southeast Asian Studies, the Indian Council of World Affairs, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad Institute of Asian Studies and, indeed, Paralikars SIOS that hosted it. Looking East became an end only when Manmohan Singh, as finance minister, discovered an economic rationale in Southeast Asia. That was further confirmed when Atal Bihari Vajpayee subscribed to the strategic logic that had prompted Singapores Lee Kuan Yew to urge, as The Straits Times reported, a role for India as guardian of Southeast Asia ever since Britains withdrawal in the Sixties.        
	It may not have been necessary for speakers to acknowledge this inadvertent beginning. But no understanding of the nature of Indias membership of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, Asean Regional Forum and Asean plus Six grouping, or of the shortcomings Ghoshal dwelt on, is possible if todays effusions are taken at face value. Sadly, our culture of deference ordains that authority has only to state something for it to be assumed to exist. Indian officials, civil or military, never really retire. They continue after superannuation to mouth the same mantras they were obliged to while in service; the experience they should have gained generates no new ideas to fertilize debate. That is left to more adventurous souls. Lipi Ghosh, the CSSEAS director, was responsible, for instance, for introducing the novel concept of effectiveness with its concomitant of ineffectiveness.        
	Though parts of Southeast Asia (not newer Asean entrants like Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar, as Jadavpur Universitys Tridib Chakraborti pointed out in one of the most incisive presentations) have become valid destinations, it is still necessary to stress that no grand strategic, economic, cultural or genetic (as one speaker suggested) motivation regarding Southeast Asia impelled Narasimha Rao. Traditional indifference, national temperament, appallingly poor infrastructure and the influence of vested interests account for the neglect of meaningful economic measures that Amita Batra of the Jawaharlal Nehru University deplored.        
	Some other participants were equally candid. The keynote speaker, C. Chinwanno of Bangkoks Thammasat University, underlined the need for human linkages between India and Southeast Asia, suggesting redress through economic cooperation, exchange programmes and scholarships. We owe to G.V.C. Naidu, also of the JNU, the nugget that Asean was all set to offer India sectoral dialogue partnership at the 1980 Kuala Lumpur meeting which Narasimha Rao (then external affairs minister) boycotted at the last moment for reasons that were never made public. But while Indias media often sounds alarmist about China, some speakers were surprisingly confident about Indias long-term prospects. Perhaps I am comparing apples and oranges for while the media focusses on militarism, academic interest centred on political, social and cultural influence. Even so, China has stolen many marches over India in projecting soft power, and if India is still a player, its largely because the region is determined not to let go of what it sees as a lifeline against being overwhelmed by a country that, as another JNU professor, Srikanth Kondapalli, reminded listeners, was the historical suzerain. Yet, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand looked askance at Indias sudden interest in the region in the Nineties. Singapore alone saw it as the fruition of its years of painstaking advocacy. Hence my second-deck title, Lee Kuan Yews Mission India.        
	It took an impromptu summing up by a foreigner, K.S. Nathan of the National University of Malaysia, to affirm  all the more effectively for his gently diffident delivery  that India was not taken seriously until the 1998 nuclear tests. They wont say it openly of course, Nathan murmured. It bore out what Prem Singh, Indias high commissioner in Singapore, told me at the time about a foreign ministry mandarin delivering only a pro forma protest before they sat down to an agreeable tea. Lee saw Indias bomb as essential for the balance of forces that Southeast Asia needs to survive. But a balancing role entails going beyond patrolling the Straits of Malacca (which speakers discussed in detail) to taking an active interest in other Asian controversies like Taiwan, the Spratly Islands or North Koreas nuclear plans. Asia without India might be like Hamlet without the Prince of Denmark, in Pranab Mukherjees colourful words, but only a less somnolent prince can justify the title role.              
	Manmohan Singh speaks of an Asian economic community. Lee Hsien Loong, Singapores prime minister, expects a free-trade agreement to embrace Asean and the Six. Meanwhile, the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement whose pre-establishment clause entitling Singapore-registered third-country companies to be treated at par with Indian undertakings encourages the world to invest in India through Singapore on advantageous terms for all parties. Another curious omission, with a galaxy of naval personnel, retired and serving, present, was the budding defence relationship: three landmark agreements provide for joint military training, exercises and other professional exchanges, with Singapore upgrading the Kalaikunda air force base on a cost-recovery basis.        
	Singapore needs India more than India needs Singapore, as Indira Gandhi might have said, for we have suffered deprivation too long to share the compelling drive of a tiny city-state that must forever be on the look-out for bigger economies to which it can link itself to maintain one of the worlds highest living standards. If Indias Look East policy remains effective, unlike the Mekong-Ganga project or Bay of Bengal community, it is largely because this self-interest is the core of a connection from which all else flows. Other military sales, free-trade agreements, strategic alliances and reciprocal Look West policies provide the superstructure.        
	That linkage should be examined more closely at future sessions in the new year. Saturdays seminar was a useful beginning. The discourse might be more effective with fewer papers, more participants from abroad and greater scope for pointed discussion. Any deterioration in Paralikars superb cuisine would make it ineffective.       sunandadr@yahoo.co.in

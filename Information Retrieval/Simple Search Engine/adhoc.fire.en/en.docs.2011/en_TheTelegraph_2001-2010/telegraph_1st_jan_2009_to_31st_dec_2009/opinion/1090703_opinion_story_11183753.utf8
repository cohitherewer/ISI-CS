	Fallout By Usha Ananda Krishna, 
  Tranquebar, Rs 295        
	Jane Austen had warned her family that with Emma she had created a heroine no one but myself will much like. Generations of Janeites have contested this ironic reading by the author of one of the worlds best-loved heroines. Usha Ananda Krishna might well say the same of Kaveri, her un-nice heroine-narrator. Both heroines are curious, intrusive, busy arranging or rearranging other peoples lives. They are also manipulative, self-involved, even self-indulgent, and unwilling to consider the other persons feelings or point of view        
	The novel starts with a griha pravesh and a death in Bangalore. Immediately, one is made aware of many old and recent hostilities within the ancient Brahmin family, which has more or less successfully preserved its skeletons in cupboards in the old homestead, now replaced by a newly promoted building. Several theories about the death stalk the novel: accident, suicide or even murder. Kaveri takes one through all three plausible theories with wit and wordplay, some shock, but, surprisingly, no grief.         
	It is only when she back-pedals to her arrival a few days earlier that we learn some of the reasons for the lack of grief. The baring of some skeletons reveals others in the pages to come. Secretive great-uncles, the memory of Pati, the matriarch who insisted on the multiplication tables, the remainder theorem and Will Durant, the snooty mamis, the superior cousins, most of whom maintain an invisible historical divide with the Poor Relations, all people this part of the story. One can see she has been like Harriet the spy in her childhood, and understood in adulthood that the prohibitions of her childhood were more to do with the dirt within being revealed outside than the fear of bringing the corruptions of the world into the Brahmin mansion.         
	In the return to her own home, she captures with a certain sensuous delight the excitement of being back with M amp;M, her parents, of whose world she is the uncontested centre: her wacky mother, with rosy lips, orange hair and purple slippers and her adoring but exacting father. The sights and scents of this meeting are warmly and lovingly evoked with the fragrance of spices in a mode that appears to have become the sine qua non of Indian writing in English.         
	The novel again takes a jump backwards to Kaveris life in Delhi. Why has she run away to Bangalore from a moment of glory? She confronts her own dying marriage and forges a new, and near-perfect, relationship that she must leave behind because of her guilty secret. We also have two of the most wildly comic moments in the book with her oily publisher and, later, with his even more oily wife. An anonymous e-mail stalker, the British Council Representative and his vegan wife complete the dramatis personae  each etched with a searing brilliance. Only the mysterious lover escapes this scalding assessment, perhaps because he will soon become the moral centre in her strangely devious and mendacious existence.         
	Usha Ananda Krishna has a sparkling way with language. She ignores Fowler, Wren and Martin and even the intimidating red and green lines of Microsoft Word. It is fascinating to see her weave her way through this maze of relations, interrogating, judging and flaying each one, including herself, often in parentheses. Witness the moment when she makes a particularly morbid and tasteless pun (Cheap, cheap, Kaveri). We succumb to Kaveris catty charm and let her guide us through the maze because we recognize in her what we feel we should despise in ourselves.

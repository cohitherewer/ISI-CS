The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | To catch a thief
                                                                            Wednesday , November 18 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                              TO CATCH A THIEF                              Some key amendments to the Prevention of Corruption Act stand lapsed. Seetha examines why they need to be reintroduced in order to tone up the law and bring corrupt public servants to book
                        Money matters: Former Jharkhand chief minister Madhu Koda has been booked under Prevention of Money Laundering Act				                                 
	As the Enforcement Directorate and Income Tax authorities unearth hundreds of crores of what appear to be the ill-gotten wealth of former Jharkhand chief minister and current member of Parliament (MP), Madhu Koda, former head of the Central Bureau of Investigation Joginder Singh wants one question answered: why isnt Koda being prosecuted under the Prevention of Corruption Act (PCA), 1988?        
	That could well be the next step if Kodas vast wealth is found to be disproportionate with his known sources of income and if it can be linked to actions he took as chief minister (both defined as criminal misconduct under the PCA). The Act, which covers public servants, sets out what corruption involves as well as punishment, which ranges from six months to five years in some cases and from one or two years to seven years in other cases.        
	Perhaps it is just as well that an amendment to the PCA, which was cleared by the previous Lok Sabha, lapsed because it was not passed by the Rajya Sabha.        
	One of the amendments related to Section 19, which says that a public servant cannot be prosecuted under the Act unless sanction is taken from designated authorities in the Central or state governments. The lapsed amendment had extended this provision to even former public servants. As it is, this was the biggest stumbling block in taking action against corrupt public servants while they are in service; now it will become impossible since they will be protected even after they retire or resign, says Janata Party president Subramaniam Swamy, who had fought a long-drawn out court battle against AIADMK chief J. Jayalalitha in the late 1990s using the PCA.        
	 One governor of Tamil Nadu would not respond to his request for sanction (Jayalalitha was the chief minister then). He had to approach the Supreme Court, which said the governor should decide on his application. Swamy got the green signal only when the governor changed. Non-requirement of sanction in the case of former public servants was the only ray of hope for taking action against corrupt individuals, notes Madhumita D. Mitra, advocate with Delhi-based Corporate Lexport, a legal consultancy firm.        
	However, Rakesh Munjal, a senior advocate in the Supreme Court, who has dealt with several cases involving the PCA, sees some logic in the amendment to Section 19. Under the present provisions, he points out, former public servants become easy targets when they are no longer in service. With no sanction required, it is possible to use the PCA to harass or settle scores with former public servants. However, the lapsed amendment, he notes, can also be misused to protect corrupt public servants even after they have left.        
	But others feel that extending the provision of sanction to former public servants is only fair. If the government has not thought it fit to permit prosecution while a person is in service, why should that change once he leaves service, asks M.R. Madhavan of PRS Legislative Research. Either drop the requirement of sanction for serving and former public servants or keep the requirement for both, he argues.        
	Another grey area is to do with who will give the sanction in the case of MPs. This question came up when former Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao was being tried for allegations that he was involved in bribing Jharkhand Mukti Morcha MPs to support his government during voting on a no-confidence motion. A five-judge Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court had held that MPs are covered by the PCA but noted that the Act did not specify the authority which was to give the sanction. Three of the judges had said that sanction should be given by the chairperson of the Rajya Sabha or the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, as the case may be, till a law specifying the authority was passed, while two other judges urged Parliament to address this issue without delay. However, that has still not been done, notes Mitra.        
	A necessary amendment to the Act, everyone agrees, is one that puts a time frame for the sanction to be given. In one case Munjal is handling, the government has been sitting on a request since 2007. Private parties get prosecuted while public servants get away, he laments (private parties can also be tried under the Act if they are involved in the offence for which a public servant has been charged). The only solution appears to be a provision specifying a time frame within which the sanction should be either given or rejected (with clear reasons being given for rejection). If there is no response within that time frame, the general consensus is that sanction should be deemed to have been given. In the case of endless delays, evidence will fade away, notes Munjal.        
	A significant and widely-welcomed change that the lapsed amendment Bill had proposed was the dropping of Section 13 (1) (d) (iii) which says that a public servant would have committed criminal misconduct if he obtains for any person any valuable thing or pecuniary advantage without any public interest. This was seen as a rather draconian provision which could be used to question almost any commercial decision taken by senior public sector executives. This is because any such decision would always financially benefit some private party or individual and public interest is too vague a term.        
	Joginder Singh doesnt feel this provision needs to be dropped. If reasons for taking a decision are duly recorded, officials and executives have nothing to fear.        
	The lapsed amendment Bill had also introduced an entire chapter  IV A  dealing with the attachment and forfeiture of property of those charged with corruption. The provisions in the chapter gave a special judge powers of attachment before pronouncing a verdict. Earlier, says Mitra, attachment could only be done under the Criminal Law (Amendment) Ordinance, 1944, which required permission from overburdened district judges. This was often time consuming and since investigations into disproportionate assets can drag on for over a year, investigators could only watch helplessly as assets were disposed of and they could not prove the charges. Chapter IV A, which is a modified version of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Ordinance, puts an end to this.        
	Will the government reintroduce the amendment Bill in its present form or address the loopholes that have been pointed out? Its not clear. Joginder Singh feels the Act doesnt need to be changed. What investigators need is a free hand, which is not being given. Amen to that.

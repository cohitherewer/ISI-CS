The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | The veracity of Mother India
                                                                                                                 THE VERACITY OF MOTHER INDIA                                                      Conjured up                             
	Delhi: Adventures in a Megacity By Sam Miller, Viking, Rs 499        
	Reviewing a television programme called Currying Flavour, Londons Times newspaper sniffed that the Indian pun wasnt necessary. A little learning can be a dangerous thing, for the currying in the title was not culinary but equine. It stood for grooming while Flavour was a corruption of Favel, a royal horse. Currying favour was sucking up, in the schoolboy slang of my day.        
	Sadly, Sam Miller, a British journalist who lives in India, falls into the same pitfall as The Times in his immensely enjoyable and sharply perceptive analysis of India when he says that a bogey in Indian English means a railway carriage. It does, but not just in Indian English. Bogie (the correct spelling) is the undercarriage and wheels and denotes a carriage in its entirety also in Crewe or Doncaster, Britains great railway centres. Its a curious oversight by someone whose flamboyant flair for words (alphanumeric, polyzygotic, thalweg) determinedly flouts Churchills injunction that short words are best and when the short words are old, they are best of all.        
	One other flaw, if such it can be called, must be dispensed with before readers are engulfed in paeans of praise. No reviewer likes to be pre-empted by eulogies splashed on a books jacket like advertising hoardings. Most readers, too, like to come to their own conclusions. Testimonials are all right for drivers seeking new employment, not for a serious commentator who also vividly conjures up people, scenes and conversations. When those testimonials are from people who helped the author in a great variety of ways (Acknowledgements), its currying favour.        
	But enough of carping. This is several books integrated in a single readable volume. Millers long, complicated and inspired ramblings (he would call it a purposeful and systematic exploration using the metaphor of a spiral) yield wonderfully rich visions of the slightly suppurating pimple on the face of history that is Delhi. The travelogue is full of fascinating bits of information. I had always wondered, for instance, what happened to the podgy little Englishwoman who used to live in Simlas Cecil Hotel in the Seventies and called herself the last Maharani of Kapurthala. Miller tells us she is buried near Delhis Khan Market as Stella of Mudge.         
	But his Delhi is not only bizarre minutiae. It is also India in microcosm. If Delhi is a city on the make, India is a country on the make. Many of the observations made here and the lessons drawn (especially in the books second half) are of national relevance. This is an informed and sympathetic observers response to both the expanding megacity and the India that is emerging as a result of the policies that P.V. Narasimha Rao and Manmohan Singh (not that they play any part in the story) launched in 1991. The new rich never walk, Miller laments. They prefer to shop.        
	Woven into the two themes is the personal life of a writer who enjoys gloating over his predilection for accidents. We catch some tantalizing glimpses of Miller, boy and man, his Parsee wife, two children, and the detestation for Delhi that turned into addiction. So, the third book is autobiography, though not as fully documented as the other two. Its possibly also less objective, for the self-proclaimed eccentric revelling in his eccentricity is bound to gloss over mundane details for effect. His Panchsheel Park residence is depicted as an enclave of rundown deprivation in what he calls Delhis pandemic of affluenza.        
	Such a nice turn of phrase can excuse affectation. Miller has a wry sense of humour and the ability to laugh at himself. Indeed, its part of his craft to set himself up as the butt of his own jokes. The tactic personalises grim situations and helps to relieve the gloom. The situations themselves are so distressing that they are bound to raise patriotic hackles, as with Slumdog Millionaire. But vivid accounts of life in the abattoir or the rubbish dump dont only make good copies. They are facets of Delhi that Caucasian visitors and Anglophone (a description he uses more than once) Indians may not be aware of or may choose to ignore. Gandhis drain inspectors report dismissal did not question the veracity of Mother India.        
	Miller is saddened to find India yearning for the West he is trying to escape. This is an old story that has been told many times before. But I like his imagery of a pigeon trapped in a shopping mall and a childs distress as the bird flaps around manically and crashes against a glass walkway. By the time he leaves the mall, the bird-loving girl is merrily blowing bubbles into her strawberry milkshake and the pigeon is happily eating a French fry. Only the transient foreigner with his romantic notions of what should be is left mourning a past that natives are anxious to forget.                          SUNANDA K.

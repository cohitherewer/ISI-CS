The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Why exist?
                                                                                                                 WHY EXIST?                                                    
	Whatever the regime, the Union human resource development ministry has never been very good at letting go. I regulate, therefore I am, in some form or the other, has been the unspoken credo of every HRD minister. Is Kapil Sibal going to be any different? A few days ago, what could turn out to be a significant shift in its mode of functioning happened with the HRD ministry quietly giving up much of its hold over settling the internal disputes of the Indian institutes of technology. A new grievance redress committee will be resolving such matters when approached by any of the IITs. This committee is headed by a member of the prime ministers scientific advisory committee and has, as its members, chairmen of the IITs boards of governors. This is good news, and it is hoped that the IITs would seldom need to be referred to this committee, and would be able to deal with most of their internal matters by themselves, as they have always been inclined to do.        
	But a more recent revelation seems to be pointing at a different, and less reassuring, direction. Mr Sibal has promised a new, and independent, higher education accreditation authority. But its much-vaunted autonomy is likely to be seriously compromised by its members being selected by none other than the HRD ministry itself. This seems to be an alternative model to the one recommended by the Yash Pal panel on higher education, which had envisioned a regulatory body whose members would be selected directly by the prime minister, the leader of the Opposition and the Chief Justice of India. This would leave the HRD ministry out of the selection process. But Mr Sibals model reinstates the ministrys agency, and renders the prime minister and the other heads quite redundant. This swinging between wanting to let go and not quite letting go is a familiar pattern; once the HRD seriously starts thinking through questions of autonomy, it might find itself wondering why it exists at all.

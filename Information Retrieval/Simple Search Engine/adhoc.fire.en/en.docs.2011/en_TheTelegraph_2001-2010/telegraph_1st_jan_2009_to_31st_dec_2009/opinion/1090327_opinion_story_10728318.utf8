The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | no surprise
                                                                                                                 NO SURPRISE                                                    
	It is perhaps the Souths undying love for spectacle that is behind the Pattali Makkal Katchis choice of day and venue to announce its break with the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam. But what was decided at the PMKs general council meeting is not exactly news. It is what the DMK had been expecting ever since it grew suspicious about the overreaching political ambitions of S. Ramadoss and his son, A. Ramadoss, following their criticism of the DMK and its leader, M. Karunanidhi, over the past few years. The provocations were enough for the DMK to throw the PMK out of the ruling Democratic Progressive Alliance last year. But it did not press for the PMKs ouster from the ruling alliance at the Centre. Yet the break appeared certain when the PMK showed no inclination to return the DMKs apparent favour and continued lambasting the party over the Sri Lankan Tamil issue. The PMKs decision has thus not disappointed the DMK as much as it has the Congress, which had been banking on the PMKs last-minute change of heart to forge a cohesive alliance in Tamil Nadu. Given the recent reverses it has faced in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and, seemingly, in Maharashtra, in making pre-poll arrangements, Tamil Nadu had become crucial to the Congresss ability to retain its hold on the Centre. With the PMK now emphatically joining hands with the All India Munnetra Dravida Kazhagam  which is already in a pre-poll arrangement with the Left parties and the Marumalarchi Dravida Kazhagam  and the Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam deciding to go it alone, the chances of the United Progressive Alliance gaining the much-needed thrust for government-formation from the DPA become positively dim.        
	These worries cannot cramp the working style of regional outfits like the PMK. Since its political viability depends entirely on the number of seats it can wrest (and the PMKs strategy has assured it of consistent victory in most of the seats from which it has contested), the PMK has had no qualms in choosing the AIADMK. The latter offered it more winnable seats than the DMK did and seems more tolerant of its aspirations. The reason behind this magnanimity is not hard to guess. The AIADMK is aiming to win in the 2011 assembly elections. If the PMKs ditching of the DMK can ensure the latters debacle, it would mean a major part of the work done.

	Oscar rsquo;s Books By Thomas Wright, Chatto amp; Windus, pound;11.99  
	Oscar Wilde once famously declared, I never read a book that I am supposed to review, it might prejudice me. In reality, he was a voracious reader who devoured books at a fantastic speed. He possessed a huge library at his house on Tite Street in Chelsea, London.  
	This library, together with all his personal belongings, was auctioned to Wildes creditors after he had been sent off to jail. Wilde was inconsolable that his library had gone. His life was inseparable from the books he read. Books, as Thomas Wright rightly observes, were the greatest single influence on Wildes life and writings.        
	In this book, Wright takes a novel and an interesting approach to writing a biography of Wilde. He seeks to do this by tracking down the books that Wilde read and possessed, and then by assessing the kind of influence they exerted on his life. What emerges is more the story of Oscar Wilde, the book lover and reader, than an account of his life.        
	Wilde is Wrights literary hero and has been so since he read The Picture of Dorian Gray as a teenager. He decided, for his own literary education and as a preparation for writing this book, to read all the books that Wilde had read, and to read them in the same editions as those in which his hero had read them. He thus read with Wilde at his side. At the same time, he tried to locate as many volumes as possible of Wildes library, scattered across the world after the auction. He thus became familiar with Wildes marginalia. It became a kind of challenge for Wright to try and anticipate, as he read, Wildes reactions to certain lines and passages. This is thus a story of Wrights discovery of Wilde as a reader. It is also perhaps a story of Wrights discovery of himself since nothing more than reading makes an individual face himself.        
	Wildes reading and his library were varied, ranging from the classics to cheap popular Victorian fiction, from poetry to volumes of criticism. There were some books, his favourites, of which he owned many editions. Wright writes, Wildes motley taste in literature is of a piece with his temperament. A born actor, he had an unparalleled ability to enter entirely into a role or an emotion, only to discard it for another a few seconds later. Wildes library was truly his portrait.        
	Wilde did not just love books: because he was an aesthete par excellence, he loved beautiful books. Wright calls him one of the order of the dandies of books. He sought books as a harmonious aesthetic object. If the style of writing was important to Wilde, so was a books binding, its typography and its layout. Wilde often judged a book by its cover. As he said once, It is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances. The true mystery of the world is the visible, not the invisible.        
	Books, for Wilde, were the mirror of perfect friendship. He sealed friendships with gifts of books with beautiful and charming inscriptions. He was not above using books as instruments of seduction.        
	Despite occasional, if inevitable, forays into the world of speculation, this is an amazing recreation of the intellectual and personal world of one of the worlds greatest literary geniuses.

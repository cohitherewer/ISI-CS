                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Laugh in warning                  
	Sir  Many public and private vehicles are now fitted with fancy horns that emit strange sounds. While some vehicles have the cry of a child as the horn, others have a loud guffaw. Such horns are not only disquieting but they also fail to serve their purpose. Since most drivers are used to a honk as the sound of a horn, they are confused when they hear, for instance, a loud laugh, and have to take that as a warning from the vehicle behind. Will the government please impose restrictions on the use of such fancy-sounding horns?           
	Yours faithfully,         P.G.K. Patnaik, Parlakhemundi, Orissa 
        
	Worst examples          
	Sir  There have been several incidents in which shoes and slippers have been hurled at political leaders. What else can one expect from citizens who are used to such misbehaviour? Take the recent flurry of verbal assaults emanating from both the ruling party and the Opposition in West Bengal (Biman tit-for-tat for Kalyan, May 4). Leaders are supposed to set norms for countrymen. But India has a set of leaders who are morally bankrupt, who use abusive language to get back at their rivals and whose verbal outpourings are given front-page coverage.           
	Children are motivated by parents to read newspapers daily. What are they learning from that? Kalyan Banerjee, a Trinamul Congress leader, recently spewed venom against the chief minister of the state, and got his reply in the vulgar, derogatory remarks of Biman Bose, the secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in West Bengal. Are they not inspiring examples? Leaders like L.K. Advani, Lalu Prasad, Narendra Modi and others talk of a better tomorrow and a healthy India. If this is the kind of health they ensure, they should expect more chappals to be flung at them.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Tathagata Ghosh, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Biman Bose crossed all limits of civility by dragging Kalyan Banerjees mother into a slanging match after Banerjees rude remark about the West Bengal chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. Political leaders today are bereft of principles, ethics and morality. How can they do any good to the country and the people from whom they beg for votes?           
	Boses comment speaks volumes about leaders scant respect for women. People should condemn such remarks and unmask these leaders so that they refrain from mudslinging in the name of democracy. Peoples representatives should be chosen not on the basis of the promises they make, which are invariably false, but on the basis of an individual partys activities and its leaders behaviour.                     
	Yours faithfully,         Mihir Kanungo, Calcutta                       
	Hot tips          
	Sir  Readers of The Telegraph have become enthusiastic about Rahul Gandhis activities and are awaiting the result of his hard work. But apart from Rahul Gandhis engagements as general secretary of the Congress, nothing much is known about him so far. His pet theme, Garibi hatao, has been there since the time of his grandmother. Most of us from the middle class would, however, appreciate it if he gave us tips on how he built up his fortune from a meagre Rs 22 lakh (declared in in 2004) to about Rs 2.25 crore (declared in 2009) after paying his taxes and meeting his daily needs. The information would definitely help the middle class follow his footsteps to become crorepatis. The poor can hope to become lakhpatis. If the Congress retains power, the new Congress-led government should encourage people to follow Rahul Gandhis tips to free the country of garibi and thereby, slumdogs.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
A. Dutt, Calcutta

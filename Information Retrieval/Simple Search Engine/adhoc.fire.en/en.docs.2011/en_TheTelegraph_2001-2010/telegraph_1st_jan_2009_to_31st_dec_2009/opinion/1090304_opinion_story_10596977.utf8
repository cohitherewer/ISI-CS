	Safety breached                  
	Sir  The rape of a 21-year-old girl in a Santoshpur flat irreparably damages Calcuttas reputation as a safe city for women (Drug-and-gang rape shocker, Feb 17). That such a terrible incident could happen in this city, the supposed cultural capital of the country, is shocking, to say the least. One would expect progressive parents to exercise extreme caution now when it comes to granting freedom to their teenaged daughters. The free mixing of boys and girls has crossed the accepted boundary in the city. A section of the electronic media has had a hand in this: television channels often promote obscene reality shows and even invite eminent personalities to judge them. I hope that civil society will voice its protest against the attack on the girl and ensure that the accused are given the harshest punishment.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Debasish Deb, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  The sexual assault of a young girl by students of reputable colleges must be condemned. It augurs ill for society when affluent young men behave savagely. School and college students, taking the cue from films and television shows that are replete with scenes of sex and violence, have started to behave in a wayward manner.           
	In 2003, I had an opportunity to visit a boys hostel of an engineering college in Jalpaiguri to help my daughter, who was then residing in the girls hostel. To my utter dismay, I discovered wine bottles in the rooms, as well as sleazy posters on the walls. Such incidents justify the necessity of moral policing. The moral guardians in Karnataka had attacked young women in a pub recently. While this may look like a bizarre act, one must also admit that a bit of restriction is necessary to make the youth behave in an acceptable manner. Parents must take lessons from what happened in Santoshpur and keep a close watch on their children.           
	The government must also intervene to redefine freedom of expression. It must snip unacceptable content in films. Alternatively, as suggested by Malvika Singh in Blame it on these men (Feb 17), India should christen one day as Rape Day so that the youth can celebrate their lustful adventures.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  That a girl was raped by three of her friends in the heart of the city came as a jolt. The boys who committed this crime should be punished for their depravity by the authorities concerned. It seems that the culprits are incapable of differentiating between what is right and wrong. They deserve the death penalty, or must be sentenced for life at least. Such events happen regularly but are seldom made public by either the media or the police. The sale of pornographic CDs on Calcuttas streets and shops must be stopped. Otherwise, such crimes will be committed again in the future.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  I have often wondered whether the law of the land is so inept that it has enabled corrupt politicians and administrators to thrive and rule the country for so long (How the cookie crumbles, Feb 13). Unfortunately, most of our political leaders, administrators, police personnel, bureaucrats, officers, clerks, and even social reformers are of doubtful integrity. When all the birds are of the same plume, it is difficult to cleanse the system, even if someone attempted to do so. The moment a voice is raised against corruption or exploitation, the complainant is put under tremendous pressure to take back his complaint.           
	The most disheartening fact about our country is that there is very little respect for values such as honesty, patriotism, sincerity, devotion, efficiency, talent or truth. Preachers are busy delivering sermons for others that they themselves seldom practise in their own lives. Most Indians are like these people. They take advantage of the loopholes, cheat their brethren and flatter their bosses who, in turn, manipulate the system as per their whims and fancies. Even the law has been rendered toothless in the face of this ceaseless corruption. A fair hearing, along with the quick disposal of legal cases, is unheard of in this part of the world. As a result, there is no fear in the minds of those who indulge in criminal activities. On the other hand, honest people, who constitute a minuscule section of the society, remain isolated, silent spectators and are forced to compromise to survive in this unequal land.           
	I hope that in the coming days, the conscientious citizens will manage to unite themselves. They should pool their resources and display a willingness to prevent the corrupt and the criminal elements from winning the elections, the dates for which have just been announced by the Election Commission. In every constituency, citizens must cast their votes without any bias for caste, class or religion. Only then can the best candidates emerge victorious from the fray.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Danendra Jain, Agartala

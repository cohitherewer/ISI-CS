The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A for Attitude
                                                                                                                 A FOR ATTITUDE                                                    
	Attitude, values, life skills: what do these words really mean? What is it to be emotionally skilled, for instance? Social scientists, psychologists, philosophers, novelists and poets would all take deep breaths before hazarding definitions of these slippery terms. So it is alarming to see the superb confidence with which the Central Board of Secondary Education is thinking about grading students not only on their subjects, but also on matters of human character and personality. It is a question of what can be measured and standardized in a way that would be fair to human individuality and potential. One of the reasons for making the Class X examinations optional and for switching to grades was to avoid subjecting students narrowly and oppressively to a rigid evaluative system. To aim to do this, while also extending the scope of the evaluation from performance to values shows confused thinking on the part of the board regarding what its role should be in the lives of secondary students. Testing and certification are necessarily objective, and therefore impersonal, processes. So grading mathematics is one thing, and grading morality quite another.        
	That seems to be the biggest risk, and presumption in this entire exercise. To grade values, they have to be defined first in a thoroughly uniform and universally applicable way. And this, by definition is, and should remain, an impossible task that no board of education should presume to undertake. This is not to say that values are not important or relevant to secondary education. They are, deeply. But some things can be measured and graded and some things cannot, and any good and humane system of examination and certification should be able to understand this distinction. Assessing academic performance is what the board is for, and not for making moral judgments.

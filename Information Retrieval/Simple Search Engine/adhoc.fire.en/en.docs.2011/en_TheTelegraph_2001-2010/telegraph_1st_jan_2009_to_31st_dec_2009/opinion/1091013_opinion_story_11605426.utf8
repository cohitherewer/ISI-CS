The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | monster runs amok
                                                                                                                 MONSTER RUNS AMOK                                  MALAFIDE - MALVIKA SINGH                              
	Pakistan is reeling under murderous, senseless attacks planned by men who were trained by Pakistani agencies to disrupt peace in Kashmir along the Indian border, as well as in the Indian mainland. The army, State and the Inter-Services Intelligence, across the western border, created a monster, and nurtured it over the decades, aided by dole from the coffers of the United States of America. Its growth was ignored, till one day it struck the US. Positions began to alter and adjust, but not emphatically enough. The US, having been part-architect, was not proactive in dismantling the terror nexus in Pakistan and gave the State apparatus there a long leash with much money in the garb of developmental aid. That deadly and unrelenting animal has now decided to return home, back to Pakistan. Feeling betrayed, and therefore angered, it is now preparing to devour its creators. Act 1, scene 1 happened on October 10, 2009.        
	Barack Obamas Nobel peace prize comes at a time when he could swing into action, break out of the box, extricate himself from the clutches of those who wanted the subcontinent to remain on gentle boil, and who may still be the advisor-lobbyists. He could make an unconventional move that would get the immediate support of India and build faith for a resumption of peace talks in the region. The monetary links that the US has with China have given China the upper hand in the Asian/South Asian playground, diluting Indias position as an ally. India has, albeit silently, given a green signal to China to intervene aggressively on its northern borders, as well as forge operations with its neighbours  Nepal, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and now, in some manner, with Afghanistan, apart from places further afield such as Africa. Diplomatic pussyfooting has lost us a great deal. America and China together have managed to dissipate a potentially strong Saarc. Sounds simplistic, but it is true.                
	Scary silence        
	This is the right moment for India to make vigorous and categorical demands. If Obama wants to become the messiah of peace, he should begin in this region, where terror breeds, and the best time is now, as the winter sets in. Carpet-bombing is not the solution, as we know well. American intervention, political, economic and military, must cease to be partisan. It must accept responsibility for its erstwhile role of actively playing the most horrendous divisive politics that cratered the region, and start a process of correction through a shared mechanism that involves all the countries in the region. Any delays will cause havoc, now that the monster is on a rampage. It could trample civil society anywhere in the world and cause severe social, economic and political damage.        
	So will Mr Nobel Peace Prize 2009 get onto an aircraft and hold a conclave, the first of many, in the volatile region? Will he pull the plug on Pakistan for playing games instead of systematically dismantling the monster it has created? Will there be stringent accountability? Will China be made a party to the dismantling of terror as well as nuclear proliferation in the area? Or will our governments and leaders continue to wallow in words?        
	At the time of writing, on Sunday evening, there has been no real news coming out of Pakistan over the last 24 hours since the attack. The information is that there were more than 30 terrorists who entered the building. Some were killed and some taken into custody. Rumours claim that General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani was in the larger complex. It is unnerving to have nothing but silence emanating from the establishment. No official statement on Kayani, no admission that the brigadier killed was second-in-command in the Intelligence wing, no address to the nation by the prime minister or by Asif Ali Zardari. This was the scary reality on October 11.

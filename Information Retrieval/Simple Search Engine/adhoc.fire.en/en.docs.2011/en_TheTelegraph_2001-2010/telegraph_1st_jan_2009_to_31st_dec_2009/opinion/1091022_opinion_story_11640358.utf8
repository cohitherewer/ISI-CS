	The buzz words that are found aplenty in the lexicon of military warfare today are synergies, network-centric, precision attacks, information superiority, and so on. However, none of these the pillars of the Revolution in Military Affairs theory  can be substantially achieved without jointmanship, inter-operability and integration of the three services: the army, navy and the air force. It is also a fact that bringing the three services under a unified command has been a testing exercise for most countries, including India. The resistance, in most cases, has been from the services themselves.        
	The Americans may have switched to the concept of chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, but it required legislation. The CJCS was invested with far-reaching legal authority, and the model allows operational directions to flow to the armys theatre commanders globally, with the chairman advising the secretary directly.        
	India initiated the integration of the three services pretty much early by creating the National Defence Academy (NDA) where cadets aspiring to be officers in all three services continue to be trained together to promote inter-service camaraderie. In 1960, the armed forces opened their apex training institution, the National Defence College, a tri-service organization. The Integrated Defence Staff was created in November 2001 to serve as the apex tri-service organization. This organization provides staff support to the chiefs of staff committee, which has all the three service chiefs on board. The strategic forces command, often referred to as the nuclear command, was established in 2003.                 
	Fighting together        
	The exercise in integration has, unfortunately, not progressed thereafter. In effect, what has been achieved so far is the unification of the services at the ankles with the NDA, and loosely stitching them together at the shoulders with the IDS. In the Combined Commanders Conference on June 25, 2009, the defence minister stated that all three services were now attuned to the idea of a chief of defence staff. Today, technology provides the wherewithal to integrate more cohesively, be it for sharing intelligence, data, or a host of other functions. Undoubtedly, national security requires jointmanship making it more economical in terms of acquisitions and logistics.        
	However, there is a flip side to the coin. Indias defence forces have very strong inner affiliations and pride. The affiliations can make logical decision-making difficult. A CDS from a particular service may look into his service interests only. Such aberrations are likely to come up more in the area of equipment acquisitions and roles. For instance, the third-largest army still does not have fixed-wing aircraft. It has only a fleet of ancient helicopters that can at best insert a couple of companies or battalions, with its integral resources.         
	This is just one area, which might experience disservice. With the seasons flavour being 100-day schedules the home ministers 100-day internal security strengthening road map; the education ministers 100-day-reforms and so on  perhaps the defence minister could also identify contentious issues and decide on the role of the CDS in the next 100 days. The Americans legislated such issues with the Goldwater-Nicholos Act in great detail. India needs to distil its own experience and work out the formulae. With the defence minister himself accepting that the services are ready, it is his own call now. There is no debating the fact that a CDS is required, but his loyalty needs to be ensured.         
	This is at best a two-stage process: identify the fallouts first and reconcile them with objectivity. Next, get a CDS in saddle. If he is given the responsibility and held accountable, the CDS could provide the unity required in operations as well as the advice that needs to be given to the political leadership far more efficiently.

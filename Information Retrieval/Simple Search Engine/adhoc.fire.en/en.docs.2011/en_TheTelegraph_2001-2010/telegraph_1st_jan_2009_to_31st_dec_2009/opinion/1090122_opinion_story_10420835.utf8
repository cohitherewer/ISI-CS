The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Girl who lost in the end
                                                                                                                 GIRL WHO LOST IN THE END                                  Neha Sahay                              
	Xiang Limin has been trying to improve her English for years. First, she asked a regular foreign customer at the shop where she worked to help her out with the grammar book she was trying to complete. That, however, lasted only so long as her job. As she moved from job to job, she also moved from one dormitory to another. No longer free to meet her teacher, she nevertheless forced herself to keep at her English whenever she could.         
	After five years of trying on her own, Limin felt she wasnt getting anywhere. She badly wanted to get out of the rut of low-paid jobs where English was hardly required. So she decided to make a huge investment. Instead of looking for another job, she enrolled in a language school, which taught English to Chinese and Chinese to foreigners by the Total Immersion method. Students had to stay on campus and speak nothing but the language they were learning. Limin invested 7,000 yuan of her hard-earned savings in a six-week course, dreaming of coming out fluent in English and being able to land with an office job.        
	Alas, like many of her dreams, this one too was shattered pretty fast. First, she found herself the odd woman out. All the Chinese who had enrolled in the school were more educated; either university graduates planning to go abroad for further studies, or working persons whose companies had sent them here. In either case, they werent paying the fees from their own earnings.         
	For Limin, every yuan counted. She often found that she was the first to enter her classroom, and then had to wait for the rest to stroll in. In the room she shared with two others, she was the only one who observed the discipline of speak-English-only. Her reminders to her room-mates to speak in English were met with ridicule.                 
	Cruel world        
	Limin soon discovered that the years spent studying grammar hadnt been a waste. She could actually detect mistakes in her room-mates halting English. But when she tried to correct them, they refused to take her seriously. Ask the teacher, they challenged her. Really keen on improving her English, she did. But the teachers, mostly foreigners (including Indians), backed her room-mates. Confused, Limin called up her foreign friend who had been her first teacher and discovered that she was indeed right. Yet, she wasnt promoted to the senior level to which she aspired.         
	Conversation in class was aimed at making students fluent in everyday English. Often, the teachers used fun methods such as making the students stand in a circle and give examples of nouns and verbs. Its easy, you cannot learn anything from that, because everybody says simple words, Limin complained.         
	Hoping to improve on her diction and listening skills, Limin stayed on  only to learn something else altogether. Personal tastes and background were the favoured topics of conversation between teachers and students in class. While the others flaunted their 100-yuan bags, Limin proudly declared that hers cost just 35 yuan; while others spoke longingly of buying designer shoes, she said she would like to find a 10-yuan pair. When the others outlined exciting future plans, she spoke of helping her mother in the village to build a house. Till now, Limin had never been ashamed of her background. For the first time, she found teachers looking down on her, although she knew their subject better than they did. They refused to install educational software on her computer; forgot to correct her journal.         
	Sure the school could use her. Her friend advised her to give them her rsum. The receptionist who took it interviewed her about her stay in the school. Limin replied frankly that the food was greasy; the hot water had run out while she was bathing....Six weeks later, she left. They had no job for her.

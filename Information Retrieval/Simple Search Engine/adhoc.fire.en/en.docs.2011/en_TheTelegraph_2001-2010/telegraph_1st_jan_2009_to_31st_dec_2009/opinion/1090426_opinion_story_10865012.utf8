The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | From pepper pots to ice
                                                                                                                 FROM PEPPER POTS TO ICE                          - The fantasy of orientalism in Madrass architecture					 					      Malavika Karlekar                                                      
	Blending a keen travel writers eye with ethnographic perceptions, Jan Morris (Stones of Empire: The Buildings of the Raj by Jan Morris with Simon Winchester) describes British architecture in India as being slightly mutated en voyage. In her inimitable style, she comments that the Grecian, Gothic and the Baroque were cluttered with devices against the weather: porticoes and verandahs were blocked with rattan screens, while shutters and hoods shaded windows. The more innovative and adaptive learned to utilize chiaroscuros; the less skilled merely shoved on an extra verandah here, projecting eaves there, giving their work, all too often, an air of slightly hangdog makeshift.         
	While Calcutta and Bombay were clearly at the forefront of colonial building activity, Madras was a slow third, with much emphasis on its waterfront: Morris writes that at the start of the 19th century, for those arriving in the city from the water, it was as though they were approaching a foreshore lined with Grecian temples; at the end of the century, it was like sailing into some fantasy of orientalism. A fantasy that fused Eastern and Western aesthetics, says Shanti Jayewardene-Pillai in Imperial Conversations: Indo-Britons and the Architecture of South India (Yoda Press, 2007). She reminds us that unlike the other two presidency capitals, Madras was home to a native king who regarded the East India Company not as his equal but rather his servant; this factor, Jayewardene-Pillai believes, led to its peculiar architectural culture. The Indo-Britons, she writes, were those Indians and colonials involved in designing and constructing the many buildings of Madras; the product of their efforts, of course, represents the apogee of Indo-Saracenic architecture.                     
	Around the same time, the sea wall around the heavily guarded Fort St George at Madras was built. Its construction, as well as that of the sewers in the Black Town, required knowledge of local conditions and materials  an expertise that was easily available with Indians enlisted for the job. A port city till well into the 19th century, Madras consisted of the walled Black Town of native settlements. To its south was the Fort and beyond stood Chepauk Palace, home to the Nawabs of Carnatic. They patronized a Muslim courtly culture and had well-known Sufi scholar-mystics as guests. While there were some feeble attempts at bringing about an interface between cultures through, for instance the Cosmopolitan Club, Jayewardene-Pillai argues that it was the dynamism of the governor, Francis Napier, that led to a peculiar and unexpected hybrid imperial architectural style. And Robert Chisholm was the man chosen to design and implement the construction of many of these buildings. In the 1860s, the government of Madras launched a competition for the best plans for Presidency College and the Senate House of the university and 17 proposals were received; the judges decided on the designs of Robert Chisholm, an executive engineer in Bengals public works department.         
	In no time, Chisholm became a favourite of the governor, Napier, who soon asked for him to be appointed as consulting architect to the Madras government. This was not an easy request to accede to and Napier had to work hard to convince the viceroy of Chisholms indispensability. By 1870, the well-paid Chisholm was designing the museum, telegraph office, jail and cutcherry offices. A year earlier, on a direct brief from the governor, he had submitted designs for the universitys Senate House (see photograph). Its four pepper-pot minarets (Morris) clearly represented a syncretist vision and Jayewardene-Pillai feels that the Byzantian inspiration for the building came from Napier who had lived in Istanbul; while Chisholm acceded that he was influenced by Byzantine, he ruefully concluded that the building had no particular style at all. His view is shared by the author of Imperial Conversations who feels that it defies comfortable classification.         
	If Senate House is a must-see for architecturally-inclined visitors to Chennai today, so is Ice House: this two-storeyed building with its rounded frontage, elegant verandahs and classical arches is indeed a curiosity. It is also a house with a history that reflects in ample measure the hybridity of its appearance: how many buildings of yore can claim to be an ice store, host to Swami Vivekananda and then home to Brahmin widows? In 1997, the sadly dilapidated Ice House was finally gifted to the Ramakrishna Mission  always the wish of its one-time owner, Bilagiri Iyengar. The house was originally leased from the government in 1845 by a New England entrepreneur called Frederic Tudor, whose penchant for cold drinks led him to an unusual world-wide trade. Ice blocks were brought from Boston by clipper and stored in this quaint building till the 1870s. According to S. Muthiah, who has written widely on the British in Madras, the ownership of Ice House passed to the advocate, Bilagiri Iyengar, who re-named it Castle Kernan after a judge of the Madras High Court. In February 1897, Swami Vivekananda visited the house on his return from his highly successful tour of the West. Shortly afterwards, the southern chapter of the Ramakrishna movement was founded within the gracious rooms of the Castle.         
	In 1912, it required the enterprising and unconventional Sister Subbalakshmi to choose such an unusual locale for her wards, young Brahmin widows. Ignoring many raised eyebrows, she was willing to take on the ghosts that supposedly haunted the building. Local fisher-folk, who offered to do a puja to propitiate restless spirits were politely shown the door. Despite an initial visitation by a snake, strange noises and shadows, the girls settled quite happily into their unusual abode. It had been a long road for the 11-year-old child widow whose parents not only supported her desire to be educated but also had refused to have Subbalakshmis head tonsured or put her in widows weeds. Instead, they helped their Madras Presidency College-educated daughter to set up a home for young widows whose education could not be supported by their families.              
	Soon, there were over 70 girls in Ice House, and in 1920, the well-appreciated Sister Subbalakshmi was awarded the Kaiser-i-Hind. By now she had started a school for children from fisher families, and Ice House even accepted single young women who wanted to defer marriage. All, however, had to be Brahmins and Subbalakshmi resisted the suggestion of the reformist doctor, Muthulakshmi Reddy to admit the daughters of devadasis. The Sister, who was clearly alarmed at the thought of the daughters of DGs (dancing girls) being admitted to the home was merely expressing a dominant sentiment of those days.         
	An abiding conundrum remains: buildings that survive from the raj are often the product of many diverse  if not competing  architectural traditions. What is less known is that these hybrids have, over time, been homes to persons who might never have normally met nor interacted with each other. If, as in the case of Ice House, one is able to unearth a lineage of residents, an interesting matrix of the colonial interface emerges. One that would lead us to ask how would Sister Subbalakshmi have reacted if she chanced upon the swashbuckling Frederic Tudor supervising the unloading of his cargo of ice on the lonely beach? Would she throw up her hands in alarm  as she did at the thought of DG inmates? Or would she accept it as one of the ironies of history? Given her pragmatism, it would perhaps be the latter  though this might not have been the response of many of her associates and wards!       karlekarsgmail.com

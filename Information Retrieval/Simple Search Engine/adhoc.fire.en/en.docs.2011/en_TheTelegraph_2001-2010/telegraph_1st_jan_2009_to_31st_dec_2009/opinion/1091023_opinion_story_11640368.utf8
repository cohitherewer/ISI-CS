	A Time of Transition: Rajiv Gandhi to the   21st Century
  By Mani Shankar Aiyar,   Viking, Rs 599  
	This is a compilation of 88 of what were presumably the best articles published by Mani Shankar Aiyar in the The Indian Express from 1996 to 2005, when he held no formal governmental post. There is an additional piece based on edited extracts of a speech made by Aiyar at a meeting of the Confederation of Indian Industries in 2007 when he was a minister, and an introduction longer than any of the articles in praise of his political mentor, Rajiv Gandhi. Was it worth re-treading these pieces? The answer is emphatically in the affirmative.  
	The articles have been grouped arbitrarily into compartments: Democracy, Secularism, Socialism and Nonalignment and Neighbourhood Policy. The mould does not quite fit and there are duplications and repetitions. But it suits the author, because we get here the Mani Shankar Aiyar we know  devotee of Jawaharlal Nehru and Rajiv Gandhi, dedicated Congressman, implacable critic of non-Congress leaders, irredeemable socialist, undaunted secularist, occasional side-swiper of his Congress colleagues, brilliant wordsmith and wit. There is no side to Aiyar: he is truly a man who speaks, acts and writes without fear or favour.         
	This is not a book for personal revelations of what transpires behind closed doors in top government circles. There is no need for Aiyar to pull his punches, and he does not. Profound and serious research has gone into the authorship of these articles, but this learning is applied with the lightest of touches. The history of the period that the book presents and the political analysis it provides are valuable for specialists and laypersons alike. The language is delightful and the humour mordant.        
	In riding his well-known hobby horses, Aiyar tries valiantly, but not always convincingly, to square the circle of human rights, poverty alleviation, globalization and economic liberalization. He treats the concept of non-alignment with a sure and delicate touch, though one may disagree on the relevance of non-alignment today even with a change of name and definition  which have not yet come about. Aiyar is remarkably prescient about the absence of Saddam Husseins weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. He launches an illuminating critique of the post-Pokhran II nuclear policies of the BJP-led coalition. He justly applauds Rajiv Gandhis comprehensive disarmament address to the United Nations in 1988.         
	Aiyar makes a tantalizing suggestion that he would offer himself as a special envoy for talks with Pakistan. On this subject he offers eminently sensible advice  the talks should be more or less continuous, in a neutral venue somewhat inaccessible to journalists such as one on the Indo-Pakistan border, discussions should include issues related to Kashmir, and on Indias part there must be a recognition that there are inevitably contrary mindsets to be encountered, even the paranoid military one for which Pakistan is notorious.        
	The books listed price is modest, but Aiyar has been badly served in the editing and proofing. Among the innumerable howlers, it is impossible to believe that Aiyar would write corruption corporate, lap for tap, or place Rajiv Gandhi in the UN in 2001. Showcasing his many intellectual qualities would have been far from Aiyars mind when he published this book, but his subtlety in handling foreign affairs and his passionate commitment to the welfare of the underprivileged cannot be contested. Congress is not so blessed with talent as to leave out a person of his calibre: there is no one today who articulates the Nehru-Rajiv Gandhi principles better than Aiyar.                          KRISHNAN SRINIVASAN

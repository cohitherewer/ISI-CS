	Footloose in Eden                
	The Moti Mahal Cookbook: On the Butter Chicken Trail (Penguin, Rs 250) by Monish Gujral is a compilation of recipes from the kitchen of the famous Moti Mahal restaurant in Delhi. The history of Moti Mahal is the stuff that legends are made of. Moti Mahal started off as a humble dhaba in Peshwar in undivided India in 1920. Its founder, Kundal Lal Gujral, who also happens to be the authors grandfather, later made it into a brand with the introduction of such dishes as the tandoori chicken and butter chicken with which the restaurant has now become synonymous. In the days after Independence, the guest-list of Moti Mahal boasted of such names as Jawaharlal Nehru, Lal Bahadur Shastri and Indira Gandhi. Maulana Abul Kalam Azad is claimed to have said to the Shah of Iran that Visiting Delhi and not going to Moti Mahal is like going to Agra and not visiting the Taj Mahal. Courtesy Monish Gujral, the reader would now get to know the secret of such delicacies as the pasanda kabab or gucchi biryani. However, it is doubtful as to how many of these recipes can be tried at home since most assume the availability of certain equipments that we associate more readily with restaurants than with households.                         
	How to Talk so Kids will Listen amp; Listen so Kids will Talk (Piccadilly, Rs 250) by Adele Faber and Elaine Mazlish should touch a chord in the hearts of all those parents whose children have been giving them sleepless nights. It teaches parents the ways to cope with their childrens feelings of anger, frustration or disappointment, to express anger without hurting the child, to resolve family conflicts peacefully and to use alternatives to punishment. The book comes with illustrations by Kimberly Ann Coe and with assignments and questionnaires for harried parents.        
	The Genesis Secret (Harper, Rs 325) by Tom Knox may read like just another pot-boiler that unravels yet another mystery of the ancient world. But there is more to it. However fantastic the story at its centre may sound, it is at least partly true. At Gobekli Tepe in Kurdish Turkey, archaeologists have uncovered a site which is a whopping twelve thousand years old. The age of the Gobekli Tepe site makes it the handiwork of the early men who were essentially hunter-gatherers and who have not been known till the discovery of this place to be capable of craftsmanship. The speculation of the archaeologists that Gobekli Tepe may actually be a temple in the Garden of Eden might be just that speculation  but it does provide a few important points to ponder. Knox mixes facts with the fiction of a neurotic serial-killer to make a thick brew but the part about the gory murders actually weakens the plot by sensationalizing it.                                  
	West Bengal: Travel Guide (Eicher Goodearth Private Limited, Rs 290) is a beautifully produced and well-written guidebook that will be of real help to travellers to this state. The photographs are quite breathtaking. In fact, they seem to make West Bengal look lovelier than it really is. The write-ups provide more than just touristy information. There is a separate section at the end of this book  produced with support from the directorate of tourism, government of West Bengal  on the art, culture and handicraft of the state. The list of tourist lodges under the West Bengal Tourism Development Corporation would come handy to tourists. So grab this book if you are planning to visit West Bengal.                         
	Of Ghosts Wizards and other Fantasies (Sterling, Rs 95) by Anirudh Vasdev is a collection of dreary, immature stories which actually say much about the fantasies of its 19-year old author. Characters keep going to dates, falling in love, getting murdered or eaten by wolves. The stories are accompanied by illustrations, which are, in fact, better than the writing.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | To Find Fresh pastures
                                                                                                                 TO FIND FRESH PASTURES                                  Sumanta Sen                              
	Reports from Guwahati say that Assam is about to make Hindi compulsory at the school level. This is likely to happen within the next couple of years, as the infrastructure is put in place. The ruling Congress should not face much problem on this score as neither the Opposition, the Bharatiya Janata Party, nor the Leftists would be against the move in principle although they may have a thing or two to say about the manner of implementation. The Asom Gana Parishad too cannot be seen as being chauvinistic on the issue in the manner of the Dravidians of Tamil Nadu, as the state government is not seeking to impose Hindi as the official language. Reportedly, students are also happy because learning Hindi will remove the language barrier that they often come across in north India and also in the western parts. Some, of course, have said that they would like to learn the language to appreciate Hindi film songs better but many others are more serious.        
	There is today a change in the mindset. Gone are the days in the Fifties and Sixties when the average Assamese felt that life began and ended with the Brahmaputra Valley. They chose to remain insular, happy with the rich yield of the soil. This insularism, however, slowly gave birth to the feeling that the outside world was the enemy and, with time, slogans such as Assam oil belongs to Assam caught the popular imagination. The appearance of the United Liberation Front of Asom was a natural outcome of such parochialism. Today, the reported welcome to the teaching of Hindi should indicate that such forces are on the backfoot. The realization that for their own good, the Assamese have to be one with the rest of the country seems to have ultimately dawned. It should have come much earlier as the states economy is almost wholly in the hands of the non-Assamese now.         
	The Assamese must find a space for themselves in the rest of the nation. The Brahmaputra Valley may shudder at the suggestion but in this it can take a cue from Bengalis. In the days to come, the Assamese will be in a more advantageous position as the state government itself helps them to overcome the language barrier. Bengalis, for the most part, have to pick up Hindi on their own.                
	Open up        
	Talking of mindset, no transformation will be complete without a change in outlook towards the Barak Valley. The history of Assam since Independence is marked by violent intolerance towards the Bengali language and the Bengalis. The last expression of such intolerance was in the Nineties when every attempt had been made to stall the opening of a Central university at Silchar. On this issue, the educated Assamese have always chosen to project themselves in a poor light even though they insisted that it was their identity they were fighting for. They never bothered to explain how the identity of the majority could face any threat from the minority. Unless this attitude changes, the Assamese will never be able to claim freedom from chauvinism.         
	Tripura in the Northeast presents a similar picture. The Bengalis there, who comprise the majority of the population, have always, like the Assamese, been happy to live in isolation, dependent wholly on government jobs which include those in educational institutions. Naturally, Hindi, and often also English were not needed to earn a livelihood. Now, the chief minister, Manik Sarkar, is seeking to open up the state and he would do well to ensure that the traffic moves two ways. Even a working acquaintance with Hindi will help young men and women from Tripura seek fresh pastures in distant states.        
	The Northeast as a whole needs opening up. For that, easy communication between the people is a must. And as a vehicle of communication, the importance of Hindi cannot be ignored.

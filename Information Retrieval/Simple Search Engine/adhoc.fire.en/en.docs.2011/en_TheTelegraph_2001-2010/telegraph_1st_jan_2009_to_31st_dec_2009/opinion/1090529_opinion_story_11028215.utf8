The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Theatre of the absurd
                                                                                                                 THEATRE OF THE ABSURD                                  BONA FIDE - Malvika Singh                              
	The last week has produced some of the funniest, often absurd, talk shows anchored by Indias leading television personalities in English. They revelled in their own contained spaces, declaiming in high-pitched voices from their comfortable studios in glass-fronted buildings, for the last three months in particular, who had missed the wood for the trees. They had been unable to change their preconceived notions about the real India, and were happily helped along by the same old boring faces of erudite men and women, the we-know-it-alls, who pontificated about what was happening in India and were hugely judgmental about the personalities that were in the fray  fighting an election that may well be the watershed from where the contemporary narrative of Indian politics may start to change.        
	One went to sleep at night with a particular view that was being vociferously mouthed and woke up the next morning to find the position had changed one hundred per cent! Never has one had to witness such a bizarre and mindless turnaround in which lies were being thrown at viewers about how right these men and women had been, when, in fact, they had all been wrong.         
	The players  old men in their seventies and eighties  were delivering lectures based on failed experience, damning the young politicians for not knowing enough. The commentators, mostly retired people from either the administrative services or from the academia, bored us silly with their predictable statements. Psephologists spoke with caveats, instead of commas and pauses, and ended up projecting all possibilities, thereby offering nothing of consequence. Those on the road, who sensed the rumblings under the surface, were never invited on the programmes because they were not people on the you-scratch-my-back-I- scratch-yours circuit.                
	Bad news        
	Then, Act three, Scene one, opened with agile somersaults performed beautifully by the players, most of whom are regulars at gymnasiums and health clubs! A rather clumsy and delayed cabinet formation gave the television butterflies an opportunity to criticize the ruling dispensation and vent their frustration, having been caught on the wrong foot about the Congress gain.         
	The electronic media have presented news rather superficially. The questions are unimaginative and simplistic, based on whims rather than on research. Interviews are insubstantial because the interviewers tend to go in unprepared, and are content with non-serious sound bites. Their comprehension is wanting, and their need to cover up for their ignorance is veiled in the attempt to stop others from speaking their minds.         
	Professionals with something thoughtful to say that adds value to the shows, triggers debate and compels anchors and hosts to ask probing questions are nowhere to be seen or heard on television. Recently, when by sheer accident, I heard Farid Zakaria respond to a rather sarcastic question about Rahul Gandhi and his agenda for India which was put to him by a rather loud and ill-mannered programme host, it made for sheer viewing pleasure. He reacted sharply with his trademark smile, put forth a cogent answer, and, without raising his voice, established without doubt the host was wrong in judging the events and reality, and lacked the intellectual depth, clarity and exposure that are required to become a world-class television programme host.        
	Speculation, snide comments, personal attacks, lack of evidence and research, little or no homework, using the same faces and a small coterie of acquaintances for pedantic comments and more have infused most English-language channels with superficial, sensational non-news and some high pitched hysteria.

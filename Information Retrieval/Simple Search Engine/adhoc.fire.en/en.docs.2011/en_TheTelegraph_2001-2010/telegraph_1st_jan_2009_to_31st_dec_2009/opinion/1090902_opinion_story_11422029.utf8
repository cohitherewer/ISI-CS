The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Let it stay at Home
                                                                                                                 LET IT STAY AT HOME                                  Stephen Hugh-Jones      
	And at this point, umpteen users of British, or for that matter, Indian English, will jump down my throat denouncing that use of hopefully. Its a beastly Americanism, theyll say, let it stay at home.         
	As to its origin, they are right. American it is, derived from the German hoffentlich, taken across by the many emigrants to the United States of America whose native tongue was German or its Jewish version, Yiddish. The usage grates on British ears.         
	I share that dislike of it. Yet on what ground? In that first paragraph above, no one would object to happily or luckily. Yet they are precise parallels to it. They are not saying that my wife and I are happy in our home, though in fact we are; if you say happily hell be back in time for his fathers funeral, you are hardly implying that hell be a happy man when he arrives. Still less does luckily suggest that the house was lucky to turn up.         
	No, they simply mean by good fortune and by lucky chance. And there are plenty of other parallels: regrettably, presumably, sadly and more. So why not hopefully, to say it is to be hoped that (and using one word instead of six)?        
	Frankly  theres another example  I cant see any logical reason why not. This isnt one of those bits of regional vocabulary that can breed confusion if exported elsewhere. An American may keep his pants up with suspenders, and drive a car with a hood and a trunk, where a Briton has trousers and braces, and a car with a bonnet and boot; and both should stick to the words their listeners understand. Nor yet is this hopefully akin to the transatlantic barbarism that can turn almost any noun into a verb (not that that barbarism is in fact especially American: countless English words double up as both nouns and verbs, and have done it for so long that we dont even notice).        
	No: hopefully, in this usage, would fit perfectly well into the pattern of any non-American English, and one day I expect it will. Theres just one problem: today, so far, it doesnt. And that problem is a huge one: not in logic, but in the mixed-up, irrational, real world of language, a world where tradition and prejudice matter just as much as reason or commonsense.         
	Just as much? I should have written more. And, Id add, justifiably so. The quirks of language, its deep-rooted survivals overlaid by ever-changing idioms, its oddities and absurdities, its regional varieties are what make it what it is, and us what we are, individual humans using it as we decide, not standardized word-processors. In a strictly rational world, I dare say wed all be using basic American (or maybe Esperanto). God forbid.         
	Theres a specifically Indian edge to that thought. Indias English has been moulded, for some two centuries, on a British model. But times are changing, and language with them. Outsiders can still offer advice, and sound advice it may be (I hope you find it so), but it can only be advice these days, not instructions. Just as I wouldnt try to ape the style or idioms of Macaulay or Dickens, admirable as both those long-dead writers were and are, theres no reason today for any Indian user of English to bow the knee to any non-Indian model.        
	Hopefully, quite soon few Indians will remember there ever was.                    THEWORDCAGEYAHOO.CO.UK

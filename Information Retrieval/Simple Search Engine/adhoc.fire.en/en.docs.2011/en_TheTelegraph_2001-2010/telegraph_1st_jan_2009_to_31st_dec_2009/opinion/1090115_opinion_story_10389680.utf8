The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Just a front
                                                                                                                 JUST A FRONT                                                    
	Hope springs eternal in the politicians breast. As the Lok Sabha elections loom closer, rapid calculations and swift oscillations are once more visible among political parties angling to form a third front. Third is an honourable, even a gallant, place to take up. It is in opposition to the big two, the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party. The era of coalition politics has made such pre-election planning almost routine, in spite of the fact that two earlier third front governments, headed by H.D. Deve Gowda and I.K. Gujral respectively, needed Congress support from outside to stay in power. V.P. Singhs government needed both the Left and the BJP to prop it up. The sporadic history of the third front in India does not inspire much confidence in its thirdness, since one or the other of the two acknowledged national parties was always needed. But then, history would cease to exist without change. One of the most visible among the changed factors is the Communist Party of India (Marxist)s eagerness  it would be rude to call it anxiety or desperation  not just to show the Congress that the Lefts moral righteousness regarding Indias nuclear deal with the United States of America will win in the end, but also to show India that the CPI(M) matters. Another is Mayavatis declared desire to be prime minister. The CPI(M) and Ms Mayavati are leaning towards each other, although the Uttar Pradesh chief ministers intentions regarding alliances remain, as usual, shrouded in enigma. But with the canny but politically dissatisfied Mr Deve Gowda and his Janata Dal (Secular) doing the honours, anything might happen.        
	The idea is inspiring. At the meeting of its central committee in Kochi, the CPI(M) called on all non-Congress, non-BJP parties to come together to contest the elections. According to the CPI(M), the fight would be for secular traditions, for a foreign policy that would exclude a strategic alliance with the US, and economic policies targeted at peoples welfare. Having talked to Ms Mayavati, the Left has also persuaded J. Jayalalithaa, evidently confident that a third front in power at the Centre would contain them all. It has talked to both N. Chandrababu Naidu and Chiranjeevi, although their parties are rivals in Andhra Pradesh. Leaving no stone unturned may be a useful principle, but it may also turn up embarrassments. Whatever the war cry about policies, electoral arithmetic rather than foreign or economic policy seems to be the driver. Ideology is never a match for mathematics.

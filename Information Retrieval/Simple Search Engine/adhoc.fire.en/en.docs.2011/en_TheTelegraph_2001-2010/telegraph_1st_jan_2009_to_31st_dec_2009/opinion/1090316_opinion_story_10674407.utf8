	Periodic thinking is a laudable exercise; it may even result in some transitory good. The government of West Bengal is once again consumed with anxiety for wandering tigers and disappearing dolphins. It is busily arranging meetings, committees and panels. Out of this hustle and bustle will emerge, it is hoped, newer ways to preserve critically endangered species, to revitalize the food chain in the states many reserve forests, especially the Sunderbans, to replenish plant and animal life in order to revive the creatures waning sense of habitat, and to keep human beings strictly out of demarcated areas. Newer ways to do things that should have been done years ago are hardly likely to be helpful, since the reasons behind the destruction remain exactly the same. River dolphins have not faded out of sight overnight, neither have tigers decided to wander into villages or die unseen over the last week. Confident that the Sunderbans have the largest number of Royal Bengal tigers in India, the state government has not bothered to get a correct count by scientific means. West Bengal does not know how many tigers it has  it can be anything between 279 to 65. If that. The level of neglect towards other birds, beasts, insects and plants can be imagined.        
	Replanting hetal trees to rekindle the tigers sense of home and studying the effects of increasing inland salinity, or releasing herds of deer to provide tigers with food are all excellent measures, ranging from the very long-term to the frankly desperate. Reckless trading, felling and poaching have eaten away at the sanctity of the forest habitat for years, and the administration can hardly claim innocence. Now when the law grants indigenous people and forest dwellers the right to forest produce, and conservation models are relying on the involvement of local people, to talk virtuously of strictly banning human beings from entering specific forests is either anachronistic or simply thoughtless. Even these periodic sessions may require a little more thought.

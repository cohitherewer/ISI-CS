The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Work at last
                                                                                                                 WORK AT LAST                                                    
	Damage control takes many forms. The constant stream of migrant labourers, moving from the less developed western districts of West Bengal towards the more promising eastern ones, is living proof of the failure to implement the national rural employment guarantee scheme in the state. To reverse the stream, the block development officer of Sainthia in Birbhum district has had an idea that is being much appreciated by officials in charge of the scheme. People will be posted at bus terminals and rail stations to persuade potential migrants to return to their villages with the guarantee of a period of temporary employment with daily wages. This would also reduce school drop-out rates, for children accompany their migrating parents. Although Birbhum district, and Sainthia block especially, have done better than the districts most affected by seasonal migration, such as Purulia, Sainthia is setting an example. In the last 10 months, Birbhum has achieved an average of 20 days of work under the NREGS, and Sainthia block 32 days out of the required 100, while the state average is 25 days. Comparisons can be unfortunate whenever West Bengal is concerned. The highest national average of 100 days work given to job card-holders is Rajasthans  that state has achieved the full target with 10.33 per cent of its total number of job card-holders. In all of West Bengals 18 districts covered by the NREGS, there were only 88 lakh job card-holders in October 2008, and of these, 21 lakh had been provided with any work at all. One of the many reasons given for the states failure was that there was no demand for work. It is amazing that the same administration should appreciate the creativity of an official who has thought up a way of stopping people from leaving their districts in search of work.        
	However promisingly couched, the basic idea is coercive. People guarding buses and train routes to persuade poor people with the promise of daily wages  when a Central scheme with funding has proved futile  hardly sounds pleasant. Why is this necessary at all? If there are plans for the promised jobs, why could plans not have been made for projects under the NREGS? The answer to these questions alone can uncover the root of the problem of implementing the NREGS. And without uncovering this root and correcting the flaws, even the brilliant idea of the BDO will prove pointless. All it will do is confuse the workers and increase the suffering of the poorest families.

	A glorious comeback                  
	Sir  India has every reason to hail the victory of Sheikh Hasina Wajed of the Awami League, which came to power with a staggering parliamentary majority in Bangladesh (Hasinas hurrah, Dec 31). A decisive defeat of fundamentalist elements, headed by Begum Khaleda Zias Bangladesh Nationalist Party, by a secular grand alliance would not only bring relief to minority Hindus in Bangladesh, but also help maintain peace on the eastern borders of India. The external affairs minister of India, Pranab Mukherjee, who has exhibited exemplary diplomatic skills to bring global pressure on Pakistan since the infamous 26/11 terror attack on Mumbai, should now take advantage of the regime change in Bangladesh to develop an amiable relationship with our eastern neighbour.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Madhu Agrawal, Delhi 

                
	Sir  The stupendous victory of Sheikh Hasina Wajed in the general elections in Bangladesh is welcome news, especially for India, towards which she has made overtures of friendship. Given the increasing terrorist attacks and infiltration along the porous Indo-Bangladesh border, the new government in Bangladesh should help India tackle terrorist activities. Further, like her late father, Sheikh Mujibur Rehman, Wajed owes gratitude to India for its help during the war of independence against Pakistan. The main advantage of Wajeds return to power would, of course, be the restoration of democracy in Bangladesh, which was, until now, merely a pawn in the hands of an authoritative military regime.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
R. Sekar, Visakhapatnam

      
	Sir  The parliamentary elections in Bangladesh have produced a massive victory for Sheikh Hasina Wajed and her Awami League. This win is a landmark for several reasons. It will reverse Bangladeshs move towards authoritarianism and religious extremism. Economic betterment of around 150 million people requires a government with a sense of accountability, along with foreign investment and aid. That the Awami League has a forward-looking vision for the country would certainly help.           
	For India and the world at large, the events in Bangladesh are encouraging. The Awami League is credited with favouring intercommunity harmony in Bangladesh and a foreign policy based on regional and international cooperation. It is important that Bangladesh, which has been vulnerable to forces of religious intolerance and has seen the rise of terror outfits, be led towards social stability and prosperity. Muslims across the world have embraced democratic political systems in growing numbers. Bangladeshs return to this fold scores an important goal for democracy.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Raihan Ahmed, Calcutta

                
	Sir  By winning an astonishing three-fourths majority in the single-chamber National Assembly, the Awami League and its grand alliance have given the entire subcontinent a reason to cheer. The return of Sheikh Hasina Wajed is heartening, especially at this time when democracy in Bangladesh was becoming a puppet controlled by the military regime.           
	This overwhelming victory also indicates that whenever free and fair elections have been held in the subcontinent  be it in Pakistan or Bangladesh or the assembly polls in Jammu and Kashmir last year  voters have strongly disapproved of extremist elements and political parties courting fundamentalists by crushing them decisively.          
	The people of India, who have tremendous sympathy and goodwill for the Awami League, would like to wish the party every success, more so because its leader has already declared that she would not allow her nation to be used for terror attacks against its neighbours. Wajed must also realize that her country is one of the poorest nations in the world, so it is one of her primary duties to end poverty as well.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Different destinies          
	Sir  Manjula Sen must be congratulated for her article, Girl, interrupted (Dec 28). The serial, Balika Badhu, aired on prime-time television, has gripped the entire nation. The makers of Balika Badhu deserve credit for bringing out the stark reality of how a large number of women still live in modern-day India  a country that has recently sent an expedition to the Moon, has already tested nuclear weapons, has had a woman prime minister decades ago, can boast of a woman president, and the government at the Centre has a woman as its chairperson. In spite of these achievements, glaring differences between men and women remain, even though the Constitution provides for the equal protection to both sexes. In the serial, the protagonist, Anandi, gets married before puberty in open violation of the laws against child marriage. Another girl, Phooli, widowed at nine, even before she can even understand what marriage means, remains a widow all her life, despite the Hindu Widows Remarriage Act, 1856.          
	Watching this serial, I am reminded of Raja Ram Mohan Roy and Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar who spent their lives fighting for the equality of women years ago. Since Independence, legislations have been enacted to protect women, the latest being the Domestic Violence Act. Sadly, these laws are only good on paper.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Tanaya Mitra Ghosh, Howrah

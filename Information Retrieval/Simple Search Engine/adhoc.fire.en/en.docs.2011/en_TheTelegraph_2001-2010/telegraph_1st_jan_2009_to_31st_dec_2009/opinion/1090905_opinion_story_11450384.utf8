The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Sylvan joy diminished
                                                                                                                 SYLVAN JOY DIMINISHED                          - Politicians and peasants are a deadly combination in West Bengal					 					      Sunanda K. Datta-Ray                                                      
	As Mamata Banerjees silence over the resort that is neither vedic nor a village reaches a deafening crescendo, I am reminded of an episode in Dhaka with Bhutans long-serving foreign minister, the late Dawa Tsering. Dawa had never heard of smoked hilsa, so we went to the dining room of the Sonargaon hotel, then the citys smartest, to sample the Anglo-Bengali delicacy. The Bangladeshi chef stared at me scornfully. We dont serve local fish, sir, he said. We have smoked salmon.        
	Vedic Village is not pretentious in that way. It leans in the other direction, ostentatiously affecting kinship with the poetry of Rabindranath and Jibanananda, the music of the Bauls and the Santhal dances. Perhaps that is even more pretentious, if pretentiousness is delusion and boasting. The mud and tiles it flaunts while the brochure rambles lyrically about sylvan joy (The concept to attain Nirvana in the lap of luxury reads a crass advertising slogan), mask a hard commercial purpose. Its the contrast, not the profit motive, that jarred.        
	The combination of faked rustic simplicity, elegant comfort, and a high-powered clientele made the resort the cynosure of surrounding villagers. Admiration begets envy. Envy goes hand in hand with greed. But the cultivators who sold the land at between Rs 3,000 and Rs 4,000 a cottah have absolutely no reason to feel aggrieved because the current price is Rs 3 lakh or more. It wouldnt have soared if they had been left in peaceful possession of their fields, huts and arrack shops. Its only because of the intrusion of profit-driven enterprises like Vedic Village in the wake of the Rajarhat township mega-project that land prices have spiralled so recklessly. They are still going up and will continue to do so.              
	The innocent buyers whose investment went up in flames deserve more sympathy than the supposedly dispossessed peasants. That might have included me for at one time my wife and I seriously considered Vedic Village as a retirement retreat. Had we taken the plunge, a lifetimes savings might have disappeared. Authority cannot evade responsibility since, clearly, Raj Kishore Modi enjoyed full official and ministerial patronage. The state government should also be concerned about the message that the crisis has sent out. Will any non-resident Indian feel safe about risking his money in a state that is periodically overrun by mobs whose rampaging exposes collusion and conspiracies at many levels? Non-resident Indians and private buyers dont excite public sympathy. There are not enough of them to constitute a vote bank. Qualitatively, they do not lend themselves to mass hysteria. But peasants and politicians make a deadly partnership as West Bengal knows to its bitter cost from Nandigram and Singur.        
	No development plan can afford to overlook the consequences of this volatile combination. It should be built into all programmes for construction so that one institution after another (realized or visualized) is not sacrificed at the altar of artificially whipped up populist emotion. That means proper husbanding of land on the basis of adequate information, an acceptable acquisition process, mobilizing opinion and punishment for crooked officials and politicians. Ratan Tata was luckier in Sanand because, thanks to Narendra Modis foresight, the Gujarat Agricultural University was sitting on 1,100 acres it did not need. Modi knew that land, like foodgrain during a famine, is a scarce resource that must be hoarded as India marches ahead. Land may be essential for economic development but is even more useful as an instrument of political leverage.        
	But just as another scarce resource  water  is squandered, land, too, is wasted. Studies indicate that a factory needs an acre to produce 1,000 cars. Hindustan Motors was allotted 750 acres in 1952 but was using only 300 acres by 2002. The Tatas could have been obliged to be content with the remaining 400 acres instead of being given 997 acres at Singur of which they needed less than half to manufacture 350,000 Nanos. In another case, about 75 per cent of the land acquired for the HAL-MIG factory in Orissas Koraput district reportedly lies unused though 16,000 tribals displaced in 1966 have still not been resettled.        
	Mishandling creates opportunities for the land sharks of whom one hears so much in connection with Vedic Village. Real estate is a cash industry bringing quick profits that escape the tax net. It encourages speculation. Of course, there are many sound promoters with a global reach in India, including the Singapore government which seeks to enlarge its stake. But the construction industry has also spawned a breed of fly-by-night criminal operators who employ toughs such as the absent Gaffar Mollah  a latter-day Gopal Pantha  is said to be. They cut corners, foist shoddy buildings on home-seekers and go scot-free because they are hand in glove with political parties. I receive plaintive appeals for help from people who have paid the price but not received the accommodation they thought they had bought. The Communist Party of India (Marxist)s financial dealings may have earned it the sobriquet of CPI(Marwari) but its the main culprit only because it enjoys sanctioning power. The other parties are just as guilty.        
	One shudders to think of the manipulation, extortion, bribery and bullying that must engulf the hundreds of proposed special economic zones, each covering up to 5,000 hectares. Tourist resorts, hotels, townships and other lucrative commercial ventures will be permitted on half the land. No wonder businessmen with no manufacturing or exporting experience but with an eye on the main chance are clamouring for a stake. They expect to reap a fortune from development, which used to conjure up a congestion of poky rooms in brick monsters that were ugly as well as unsafe. Now, it evokes glittering shopping malls, theme parks, multi-storey car parks, amusement arcades, spas, resorts and other fancy edifices.        
	Its neither possible nor desirable to impose a moratorium on these additions to the landscape. They reflect the accretion of wealth in a large section of society that yearns for world- class living and leisure facilities. Money is flying around, as Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee rightly says. But he is wrong to conclude that wrongdoing and sin automatically flow from wealth. That happens only when governments lose their sense of purpose and justice, and when venal ministers and officials are in league with corrupt businessmen. Vedic Village may be an innovation in deprived West Bengal but gated housing estates providing American-style amenities are dotted around Mumbai and Delhi. They will continue to proliferate: Marxist ministers no less than NRIs and desi tycoons crave luxury and therapeutic relaxation.              
	But it is absurd to label Vedic Villages attractions as ethnic just because two Delhi showpieces, Hauz Khas Village and Dilli Haat, set the trend in linguistic make-believe. If a shop in Paris or Madrid sells Tanjore glass paintings or Rajasthani carvings, it would be called ethnic, specifying which particular ethnicity it represents. Shops in India with similar wares are just Indian. Though the visiting foreigner might call them ethnic, it is demeaning for Indians in India merrily to use the word to describe things Indian. Would a Bengali say he had an ethnic meal after feasting on machher jhol and bhaat? Would a Punjabi claim to have an ethnic wife because she is also from Punjab? Surely it is not an inevitable concomitant of growth that the rich should to be able pretend to be foreign at home.        
	Though Partha Chatterjee, Trinamuls leader in the assembly, snaps at the ankles of the Rajarhat township, Mamata Banerjee has confined herself to only demanding an inquiry into the arms cache found at Vedic Village. Not a squeak from the rampaging tigress of Nandigram and Singur about the suspected land fraud. Why?        
	Meanwhile, Vedic Village is licking its wounds instead of the promised delicacies  smoked salmon?  at its much-advertised Dhakai Fish Festival which was scheduled to continue till September 14.

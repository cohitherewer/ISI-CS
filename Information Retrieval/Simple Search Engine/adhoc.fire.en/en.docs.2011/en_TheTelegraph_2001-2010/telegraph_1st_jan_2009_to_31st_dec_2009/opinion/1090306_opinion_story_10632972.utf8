                                                                                                                 SIGNS OF HARD TIMES                          - Putting off harsh economic decisions is self-defeating        SWAPAN DASGUPTA                                                  
	There is a charming indefatigability about the panchayati raj minister, Mani Shankar Aiyar, that endears him to people across the political spectrum. Equally, it alienates him from those who see politics exclusively as short-term manoeuvres and transient loyalties. Aiyar, without mincing words, is a bit of an overgrown public-school boy caught between romantic idealism and juvenile naughtiness. If the first trait is thought to be needless in a party that sees the exercise of political power as a divine right, the second is viewed disparagingly as an affectation. Buffoonery is the sole preserve of outlanders such as Lalu Prasad; others are at best permitted the luxury of clever one-liners which are invariably lost in translation.        
	Last month, to mark the publication of a collection of his articles published between 1996 and 2004, when the Congress was out of office and Congressmen could afford to be indiscreet, Aiyar organized a convivial gathering at his ministerial bungalow on Delhis Akbar Road. The evening was centred on a discussion, ostensibly about Rajiv Gandhis contribution to world history, a subject most speakers deftly skirted. What struck me as significant was Aiyars personal contribution to the proceeding: enlarged reproductions of a Newsweek cover proclaiming We are all socialists now and an Economist cover proclaiming The return of economic nationalism.        
	An economic crisis of the magnitude the whole world, not least India and China, is facing, should have been the occasion for subdued introspection. For the likes of Aiyar and other unreconstructed socialists who have drifted into non-communist parties, it has prompted glee. Closet Reds who did a U-turn after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet Union are whispering We told you so to anyone who cares to listen. The prime minister, Manmohan Singh, the public face of Indias gradual repudiation of inefficient socialism, hasnt made his observations too public. But for many like Aiyar, the final crisis of capitalism that communist parties have been predicting since the world reacted crazily to a killing in Sarajevo in 1914 is there for all to see.              
	The signs of an intellectual retreat from the market economy are clearly visible in India. At party forums, the Congress president, Sonia Gandhi, has complimented her late mother-in-law for having the foresight to nationalize the banks in India in 1969. Without this step, she has argued, India may well have had a banking crisis to supplement the economic meltdown. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) on its part has congratulated itself for preventing the passage of legislation that would have further deregulated banking, insurance and pensions.        
	Even the reputedly rightwing Bharatiya Janata Party hasnt fallen behind in competitive capitalist bashing. At a recent function to showcase the philosophy of integral humanism of Deendayal Upadhyaya, L.K. Advani suggested that both capitalism and socialism were inappropriate for India. It was unclear whether he was endorsing a Gandhian perspective or merely arguing for flexibility of approach. Advanis views in any case seem different from the doctrinaire opposition to globalization by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief, K.S. Sudarshan.        
	It is pertinent to take note of the pre-election posturing because a considered approach to the economic crisis that threatens to put India back in the doghouse has been put off till a new government assumes office. Whereas it is customary in democracies for rival claimants to debate the different remedies on offer, the Indian political class has gone about either pretending there is no crisis or that the problems can be resolved by honesty and sincerity. As such, it is extremely unlikely that any political party will come into the new Lok Sabha with a clear mandate on the economy. The problem may well be compounded by the possible lack of an overall mandate, as it happened in 1996, which will subject the next prime minister to wildly conflicting sectional pressures.        
	A roll-back of the market economy may seem appealing to a political class wedded to statism. But there are two real constraints. First, the socialist model envisaged by Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi was premised on austerity which translated into shortages. For the past two decades at least, living conditions in India have witnessed a steady improvement. The middle class, which was an insignificant part of the electorate even as late as 1991, has expanded enormously. It now constitutes a voting bloc that all parties have to cater to. Most important, the aspiration levels and even greed of Indians have soared to dizzying heights and are disproportionate to what the economy can offer. Any tightening of the belt can work more in India than in the fattened West, but even a modest curb on popular expectations is certain to be unpopular and costly for an incumbent government. It is possible that Pranab Mukherjees well-meaning suggestion for pay cuts to offset possible job losses could cost the government dearly in the elections; and more so because it was immediately followed by a generous pay hike for government employees.        
	Second, the ability of any government to spend its way out of trouble is severely limited. For much of its tenure, the United Progressive Alliance government has been living way beyond its means, borrowing too much, putting off difficult decisions and putting welfare above public investment. The strategic shift of resources from the national highways project to the national rural employment guarantee scheme was an example of Sonia Gandhi-style socialism. Measures such as these were responsible for the Indian fiscal deficit touching nearly 11 per cent of the gross domestic product and becoming one of the highest in the world. With promiscuous government borrowing squeezing out the rest, a consumer-led boost to the economy has proved difficult.        
	The general election campaign is certain to add to the dysfunction of politics. Both the political formations are certain to make extravagant promises such as guaranteeing 25 litres of drinking water for each citizen and converting the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act into a constitutional obligation. How are such schemes going to be funded in a downturn?              
	The strange paradox of India is that while the private sector is now at the commanding heights of the economy, the expectations from the government havent diminished. From subsidizing inefficiencies in agriculture and holding up a bloated public sector to being blamed for Indias indifferent performance in the Olympics, there are too many expectations from the State. Indias remarkable growth story for the decade after 1998 was primarily entrepreneur-driven. Yet, this did not lead to a corresponding shift in popular attitudes to the State. The much-reviled political class has remained the perceived annadata. The over-hyped Bharat Nirman advertisement campaign, which gave the government credit for all the good works in India, has bolstered the mindset. It naturally follows that if the government is to hog the credit for Indias remarkable growth, it must happily accept the fusillade of rotten vegetables in case things start going wrong.        
	Invoking the golden age of socialism when telephones never worked, queues were unending and the Ambassador defined the road may still tickle the fancy of those who were privileged to be the rulers. But it has hideous connotations for an entire generation who either left the country or rued Indias inability to harness its potential. Todays India is emotionally expansive. It wants to take on the world  and win. A regression to accommodate temporary fears is just a convenient way to put off harsh decisions. India needs decisive leadership. If the usual suspects are found wanting, it will sooner or later opt for the style of a Vladimir Putin or Narendra Modi.

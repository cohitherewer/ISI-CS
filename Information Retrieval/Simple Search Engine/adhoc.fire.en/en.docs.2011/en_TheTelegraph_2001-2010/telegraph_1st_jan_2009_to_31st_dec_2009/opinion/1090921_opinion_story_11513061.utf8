	Green crusader                  
	Sir  The world has lost a champion of modern agriculture with the death of Norman Borlaug, father of the Green Revolution (Plant genius passes away, Sept 14). India should not forget the man who helped the subcontinent tide over a severe food crisis in the 1960s. His discovery of a new strain of wheat saved many underdeveloped countries from large-scale famine. No doubt, the heavy use of fertilizers and pesticides his technique involves needs to be controlled, but this is a problem common to most modern methods of agriculture. Borlaug showed that science can make a positive difference to human lives if it is put to proper use. Hence, it is no wonder that Borlaug has inspired many scientists to work for peace in their efforts to solve the problem of food-shortage.           
	If India has become a fast developing country today, it is because it has sufficient food security. Besides government efforts, credit for this should also go to Borlaug, who worked closely with Indian scientists to make the Green Revolution possible here. In recognition of his work, India had honoured him with a Padma Vibhushan.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The death of crop scientist and Nobel laureate, Norman Borlaug, signals the end of an era in agricultural research. I recall reading about an incident where Borlaug showed his scientific magnanimity at a function which took place in Vigyan Bhavan, New Delhi, in 2005, where he was to be conferred the Dr M.S. Swaminathan Award. The former president, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, and M.S. Swaminathan shared the dais with Borlaug. Kalam has portrayed the scene vividly in one of his lectures: When [Borlaugs] turn came, he got up and highlighted Indias advancement in agricultural science and production and said that the political visionary, Sri C. Subramaniam and Dr M.S. Swaminathan, pioneer in agricultural science, were the prime architects of the first Green Revolution in India. Even though Prof Borlaug was himself a partner in the first Green Revolution, he did not make a point on this. Then the surprise came. He turned to scientists sitting in the third row, fifth row and the eighth row of the audience. He identified Dr Raja Ram, a wheat specialist, Dr S.K. Vasal, a maize specialist, Dr B.R. Barwale, a seed specialist. He said, all these scientists had contributed to Indias and Asias agricultural science. Dr Borlaug introduced them to the audience by asking them to stand and ensured that the audience cheered and greeted the scientists with great enthusiasm.          
	The moral of the incident, as Kalam has pointed out, is that if one aspires to greatness, one must be magnanimous enough to recognize the contribution of others, and encourage the young, or ones subordinates, if they have done their job well. Kalams observation, great mind and great heart go together, is not only an apt description of Borlaug but also a lesson for all, particularly for individuals occupying positions of power and responsibility.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Play master          
	Sir  The death of Raj Singh Dungarpur (Elegant raconteur falls silent at 73, Sept 13) is indeed a sad loss for Indian cricket. His contribution to the game is undeniable. However, his relationship with Sourav Ganguly during the period when the latter was the captain, was unfortunately not good. It may not be an oversimplification to describe the late Dungarpur, an otherwise elegant personality, as a supporter of the anti-Sourav lobby. It is nice on the part of Ganguly to refuse to engage with the criticisms Dungarpur once heaped upon him.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Debasish Chatterjee, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  A colourful character, as Raj Singh Dungarpur was, is certain to be remembered. Unlike many other administrators on the Board of Control for Cricket in India, he was a first-class cricketer of some repute. Dungarpur served the Indian cricket management and administration. He was the manager of the team during the 1984 tour of Pakistan, a chief selector, a BCCI president, and was the moving force behind the setting up of the National Cricket Academy in Bangalore.           
	He was controversial though, and somewhat a loose cannon, in his later years. He had feuds with the media, and had differences of opinion with Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev, Mohinder Amarnath and Sourav Ganguly. One might sometimes be peeved by his idiosyncrasies, but he was his own master and was steadfast in his stand on issues relating to cricket. One cannot forget the contributions of the BCCI triumvirate of Jagmohan Dalmiya, Raj Singh Dungarpur, and Inderjit Singh Bindra to Indian cricket before they fell out.          
	Yours faithfully,

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Stick to the Rules
                                                                                                                 STICK TO THE RULES                                  STEPHEN HUGH-JONES      
	Two weeks ago, I looked at the uses and misuses of both. Lets now turn to its cousins, either and neither, with their concomitant...or and ...nor. These, like both, are mere molehills on the mighty expanse of the English language. But they too can trip you up.        
	Its a bold man who lays down the law about them. Strictly, they should be used of only two alternatives and no more (just as pedants claim for alternative itself): hes either/neither rich or/nor stupid. But that rule is so fluid as to be barely even a convention.         
	The latest version of Fowlers Modern English Usage says that in formal English it is advisable to stick to it, but cheerfully records that in conversational English it is often broken. Indeed in journalistic and much other English, Fowler could have added: you will often meet phrases such as either Russia or China or the Americans will intervene, and still more often (and not merely for geopolitical reasons) ones like neither Russia nor China nor the Americans...        
	The correct positioning of the words also is uncertain. Strictly, you should say he went either to Delhi or to Jaipur, with either immediately preceding the first alternative, just as or precedes the second; and ditto with neither...nor. But here too the real world disagrees. Phrases such as he either went to Delhi or to Jaipur are common  and acceptable.        
	If some verb follows the two alternatives, should it be singular or plural? If both possible subjects are singular, so should the verb be: either the train or the track was at fault. Use a plural verb only if one subject  or, of course, both  is plural: oh no, either the signalman or the six motorists were asleep (or, better, either the signalman was asleep or the six motorists were). In the past, not even serious writers always obeyed this convention. Fowler cites Ruskin: neither painting nor fighting feed men. But these days stick to the rule.        
	The same rule holds if either/neither stands on its own, without any or/nor. Eg: either suitor was acceptable to her, though neither was rich. But you may, with neither, meet a plural verb even for two singular subjects: neither of them were millionaires. And that is still more likely in questions: have (rather than has) neither of her parents any doubts? Ditto even with either: do either of you care about your daughter? My advice is, stick to the rule, but its not a hanging offence to break it.         
	A few stray uses deserve comment. Either may end a sentence: I dont speak Bengali either. Such sentences can be ambiguous  is it I or Bengali that is emphasized?  but the verbiage is correct. Yet, in the 19th century, the sentence could well have ended with neither. Today that would be decidedly plebeian. Ive just read an American novel in which one character makes that very point. Dont imagine all Americans are democratic about demotic.        
	For its part, neither can start a sentence, as in a film review I once read: Its not Hollywood. Its not Bollywood. Its not even Ealing Studios. Neither is there a star in sight. Yet... I would always use neither there; Im sure its more idiomatic than the seemingly more logical nor used by most of todays journalists. I cant prove Im right. Neither can they.

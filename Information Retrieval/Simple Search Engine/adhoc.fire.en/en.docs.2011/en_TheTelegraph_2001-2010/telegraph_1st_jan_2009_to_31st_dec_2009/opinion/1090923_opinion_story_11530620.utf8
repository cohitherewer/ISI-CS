The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Sorting out the   battle over land
                                                                                                                 Sorting out the   battle over land
          The Land Acquisition (Amendment) Bill and the Rehabilitation and Resettlement Bill are scheduled to be tabled in the winter session of Parliament. Seetha analyses their pros and cons                        Land grab: Mamata Banerjee protesting against the acquisition of agricultural land in Singur                                        
	Call it nipping criticism in the bud. When the railways ran into stiff opposition from land owners after issuing a notification for acquiring land in Gautam Budh Nagar in Uttar Pradesh, it promptly backtracked. Henceforth, it said, it would only buy land from willing owners and not acquire it forcibly. After all, railway minister Mamata Banerjees ongoing agitation against forcible land acquisition in West Bengal couldnt be subject to taunts of double standards.        
	That decision  a clear indication of Banerjees uncompromising stand on land acquisition  raises doubts about the future of two crucial and interlinked bills  the Land Acquisition (Amendment) Bill (LAA) and the Rehabilitation and Resettlement (R amp;R) Bill. The two bills had first been tabled in December, 2007, but they had lapsed. They were to be reintroduced but right now the fate of both is unclear, apart from the fact that they had come up for discussion in the Cabinet and had prompted a near walk-out by Banerjee.        
	There is general agreement among those battling forcible land acquisitions by the government and the displacement of affected people that the LAA Bill does address many of the drawbacks of the colonial LA Act, 1894. They say that the R amp;R Bill too is a welcome move to give legal sanction to the National Rehabilitation and Resettlement Policy, 2007. There are many features that are extremely positive, says Vijayan M.J. of the Delhi Solidarity Group, a solidarity network of peoples movements, covering a range of issues. The most important one is the provision in the R amp;R Bill for a social impact assessment (SIA) study, which will do a social cost-benefit analysis of a project, much like the environment impact assessment studies.        
	But there are a fair number of problems as well.        
	The 1894 Act had eight definitions of public purpose for which the government could forcibly acquire land. These covered a range of rural and industrial development-related projects. The amendment bill whittles this down to just three  strategic/defence purposes; infrastructure projects of the government; and for any other purpose useful to the general public for which a person has purchased 70 per cent of the land. Person, the bill says, includes any company or association or body of individuals, whether incorporated or not. It is this last clause that has Banerjee seeing red.        
	On the face of it, this is an improvement over the earlier provision under which the government could acquire land for private industry. By keeping the government away from any land acquisition for industry  except when a small group holds up a project  the bill protects it from controversies like the ones seen in West Bengal.        
	Vijayan fears this provision will be misused by companies to armtwist landholders unwilling to sell by saying that they will get far less compensation than what the company is giving once the government acquires land.         
	N.C. Saxena, former rural development secretary who had first drafted amendments to the LA Act in the late 1990s, is against the government withdrawing  even partially  from the land acquisition process. This is one point on which both industry and non governmental organisations agree, for different reasons. While Saxena feels that leaving land acquisition entirely to the market could open the doors to the land mafia, industry feels it is the governments responsibility to facilitate industrial development.         
	Given the extremely fragmented nature of land holdings and the lack of clear titles, agglomerating land from numerous owners is not a task which the corporate sector can do effectively, the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) said in a statement in December 2008.        
	What also worries activists is the liberal use of the word may instead of shall as well as if in the two Bills. The R amp;R Bill, for example, says land for land will be given if government land is available, that affected families may, wherever possible be resettled in groups. Most of the positive changes are not binding on the government, rues Saxena. The parliamentary standing committee that studied the LAA Bill in 2008 flagged this issue and suggested the use of shall so as to leave no discretion in the hands of bureaucrats.        
	The compensation package appears to be an improvement over the original LA Act, under which the collector only needed to determine the current value of the land. Now, the collector has to take the highest of three criteria  the minimum land value for the area as specified in the Indian Stamp Act, 1899, the average sale price of at least half the higher priced sales of similar land in the village or vicinity or the average sale price of at least half the higher priced land purchased for the project. A big plus is the stipulation that the collector must factor in the intended use of the land while determining the compensation. This takes care of the problem of land being bought cheap and its value appreciating almost immediately because it is for industrial use.        
	To address the issue of speculation in real estate after acquisition, the LAA Bill insists that 80 per cent of the profits made in subsequent sales of the land should be shared with the original owners. However, tracking original owners could be hugely problematic, points out M.R. Madhavan of PRS Legislative Research, especially since the bill does not specify a time frame for this proviso to kick in.        
	A tad puzzling is the requirement in the LAA Bill that a company acquiring land must offer shares or debentures to the landowner. While shares give the holder a stake in the profit (or loss) of a company, a debenture is a debt instrument. When a landowner is given a debenture, notes Madhavan, it means that he is lending money to the company to purchase his own land! It is not clear, however, if this was just a drafting oversight or whether there is a sinister motive behind this.        
	Some are also worked up over the retention of the urgency clause in the original LA Act, under which land can be acquired within 15 days if needed. The amendment bill only stipulates that, in such cases, 75 per cent of the market value of land will be paid, in addition to the normal compensation. With urgency not being defined, Vijayan points out, the clause is certain to be misused to bypass all the other procedural mechanisms laid down in the bill.        
	Will the bills get a smooth passage with these problems? Wait for the winter session to find out.

                                                                                                                 LOUD FOLLY                                                    
	There are certain shockingly revealing moments when a person exposes that he is unfit for the responsibility he has taken up. Feroze Varun Gandhis amazing campaign speech in Uttar Pradesh directly targeted the minority community using crudely threatening rhetoric and making quite a drama of his own religion. Mr Gandhi is the Bharatiya Janata Partys Lok Sabha candidate from Pilibhit, a seat vacated by his mother, Maneka Gandhi, for her sons debut. His speech was not just incitement to violence or a violation of the Election Commissions model code of conduct, it was also flagrantly against the law. Both the Indian Penal Code and the Representation of the People Act make very clear that promoting enmity between different groups on the grounds of religion or garnering votes on the same basis, and public statements hurtful to national integration or to communal harmony are serious criminal offences. Allegedly, Mr Gandhi managed to break the law on all these counts. The rapidity with which the EC moved to register a case with the police once it had received a complaint from the Congress is an indication of the weight accorded to such violations.        
	Any observer would say that law in India is honoured more in the violation. And it is true that many politicians may be accused of incitement to violence or attempts to create communal disharmony. The slogans cheering on the demolition of the Babri Masjid or the carnage in Gujarat in 2002 would be revolting to any civilized person. It may be pointed out that not all these politicians and their followers have been punished. But there are certain crucial moments when these laws become especially important, when even the most communally-minded politician knows to hold his tongue. The run-up to the elections is one such time. The ECs strict monitoring of this period, together with the model code of conduct, provides enough warning of the checks being in place. Mr Gandhi failed to notice. Apart from that, his rhetoric exceeded that of some of the most prejudiced speeches of recent times. It would be wise of the BJP to be seen chastising its fledgling candidate. It cannot get away by shrugging off Mr Gandhis alleged remarks, as one member has, as Congress, not BJP, culture. For its own credibility, the party must be seen to take a stand.

	When India begins to move, it may also start to trot. Years of struggle went to loosen the tentacles of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code that made homosexuality punishable, until the Delhi High Court took the first big step towards decriminalizing homosexuality last July. But by November 2009, India had taken another step that has made it unusual in the whole world. The Election Commission has decided to add a new category to the gender column in voting rolls. The third gender, including transsexuals, intersexed persons and eunuchs, can now identify themselves as Others or O instead of as male or female if they so wish. Although this group, usually included under the umbrella term hijra or eunuch (in a unique modification of the words original meaning), had been given voting rights in 1994, its members were identified as either male or female. From an ideal point of view, the situation was obviously unsatisfactory, for the limited option reflected the inability of society to think beyond two genders, and its discomfort with the idea of fluid gender roles and unorthodox sexualities. On the practical level, it threw up unexpected problems. A member of the third gender had become a successful mayor in Madhya Pradesh, but was identified as male on the voters list while winning the election in a seat reserved for women. This political career came to an abrupt end.        
	The addition of O symbolizes freedom of choice, not something that Indian society is famed for. But Indian institutions do have a way of sometimes stepping out on their own within their own jurisdictions, initiating changes that force changes in other areas, either through logic or by example. In this case, an earlier step had been taken by Tamil Nadu last year, where the civil supplies department had added T or third in the gender column on ration cards. That marked an achievement of the highly organized and articulate third-gender movement in the South, and the tireless efforts of gender rights campaigners and non-governmental organizations. Even earlier, a separate category for those who wish to be identified as the third gender had been introduced into the online version of the passport form. Freedom of choice has taken time to evolve, but it has come with a bang. Logical repercussions and illogical politics are yet to follow.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | The fair art of power dressing
                                                                                                                 THE FAIR ART OF POWER DRESSING                                                                            
	The vision of the Hindu wife taking on the world is unmatched in its power and glory. Look at Sushma Swaraj. Not all wives are anxious to display their wifely status when they take on the world, but for Swaraj this collocation of the home and the world seems central to the identity she wishes to project. Her wish, of course, is the wish of the superiors in her political party. Warm, bright colours in traditionally woven saris, long hair neatly tied in a low-slung, modest bun, a surging stream of vermilion in the neat middle parting coming to a reluctant stop a fraction below the hairline, a large   
	bindi, an assertive, many-stringed mangalsutra cascading down the neck and chest  each feature is carefully designed to emphasize the great tradition of the Hindu wife and her honoured place in the Hindu world-view.   
	Hindu female shakti takes many forms in the imagination, although care has to be taken to distance it from the reality. That is why the bright colours, the smug prosperous contentment, the in-your-face vermilion: they hold the eye and demand obeisance. One might even find Shiva  or rather Ram  in a calendar incarnation peeking over Swarajs shoulder  if one looks hard enough.        
	When the USP is different, the accoutrements are different too. No wifeliness about Mayavati; she represents the triumph of the Dalit. At least, that is how she began. So why does she glitter in diamond and gold, shimmer in designer silk salwar-kameezes, and change her clipped hairdos apace with the latest styles? There may be a couple of sparkling crowns and even a throne here and there on special occasions, in a nostalgic echo of that other great matriarch of fantasies, J. Jayalalithaa. To be fair, one should discard the personal  the addictive attraction of the moving toyshop of the female heart, embracing both prettiness and power  for the political.        
	Her appearance, Mayavati claims, is a message for all backward, deprived people. They can all look like her, they have a right to. They will just have to play their cards right, that is, follow her clarion call to their glittering, shimmering destiny.        
	The style is the message. Yet how different both can be when two masterless women, rising fully armed from the remnants of some unfortunate deitys split head, lead two different segments of people seen as deprived, or victimized, or disaffected. One seeks to give a caste the dream of diamond and silk, the other seeks to merge into a class to inspire its loyalty. Mamata Banerjees saris often have beautiful borders and weaves, but they are emphatically cotton, white or cream-based, occasionally with the thready Bengal stripe or tiny check. But she is deft at making them look crumpled and uncared for, as if she is too busy cooking up a storm for an army of restive brothers and beaten-down sisters. She is the eternal Didi-next-door, merging her blood, sweat and tears with those of her unnumbered siblings  and wiping all of it on her sari. Her anchal is very long, so she can use it to cover both her shoulders when the time is right, giving the impression that she is wearing the sari informally, as Bengali women from all communities, especially in the villages, do at home. Closer home, she actually wears it informally too, raising the comfort level.         
	Banerjees hair, in striking contrast to Swarajs elegant modesty and Mayavatis showy smartness, is never quite all there, tied as if in a mad hurry, for real work is waiting. She might even carry a gamchha to work as a handkerchief. And neither Swaraj nor Mayavati would be seen dead in Banerjees usual footwear. It seems to proclaim that barefoot is better. Banerjees is an entirely different collocation of the home and the world, raising the spectre of the jhanta and the bonti as effective weapons of an unvalued, unglamorous army awakening to power.                          BHASWATI CHAKRAVORTY

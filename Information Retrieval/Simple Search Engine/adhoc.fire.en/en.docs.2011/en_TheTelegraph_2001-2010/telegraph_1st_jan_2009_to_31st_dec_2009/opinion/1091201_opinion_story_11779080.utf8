	Unpleasant truths                  
	Sir  Even without the clarification, one would have understood that the statement made by the vice chief of air staff, Air Marshal P.K. Barbora, regarding the feasibility of inducting women as fighter pilots, represented his personal views and not those of the government (Air cleared on fly jab, Nov 20). Barboras comments highlighted the insensitivity towards women that prevails among our defence forces in particular, and not in the country in general. In future, Barbora should limit his comments to what he knows  the defence of the country, instead of speculating on womens propensity to get pregnant or accusing politicians of getting in the way of modernization of the armed forces (Air marshal hits out at politicians, Nov 20).           
	Barbora said that politicians across party lines are upsetting the armed forces procurement programmes. One doubts whether this allegation is true. But if we take for granted that it is valid, then the reasons behind this supposed interference would not be hard to find. Given the frequency with which the armed forces have been getting themselves embroiled in scams related to procurement deals, any representative of the people would naturally think twice before spending public money on such deals.           
	In recent years, Indias defence scenario has not improved greatly. Pakistan Occupied Kashmir and Aksai Chin are still thorns in every patriotic Indians heart. In such a situation, officers in the defence forces need to concentrate on the job at hand instead of hitting out at anyone and everyone.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Chameli Pal, Batanagar 

                
	Sir  P.K. Barbora had said that the Indian Air Force cannot have women fighter pilots because they get in the family way and therefore cannot justify the expenses incurred on their training. This is truly shocking. If we do not believe in equal share and rights for women, why do we have the Equal Remuneration Act in place? It is time people in positions of responsibility thought twice before making outrageous public statements.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Manash Kumar Das, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The outbursts of P.K. Barbora against politicians speak volumes about the increasing maturity of the defence forces, which till now have largely been unresponsive to the glaring loopholes in Indian politics. Barboras statement brings out the frustration of the armed forces in the face of bureaucratic controls. When the air marshal says that The weapons, ammunition and systems with the armed forces are getting outdated faster than the government is able to replace them, the country should feel seriously concerned. One can easily figure out why such delays happen. It has become a fashion for every opposition party to cast aspersions on the policies of the ruling government, irrespective of the merits or defects of those schemes. Every deal that the government signs to procure military hardware comes under the scanner of the Opposition, which then gathers political mileage by opposing it. As Barbora says, in India, No one cares a hoot.           
	Politicians did not take Barboras remarks regarding the unsuitability of women in the IAF kindly, giving credence to the feminists who had protested vehemently against him. This is hypocrisy. These politicians are the same leaders who are still opposing the womens reservation bill in Parliament. Let them pass the bill first and then they can think of inducting women into the IAF.           
	We can imagine women in G- suits only after we have achieved their social emancipation. As of now, the country has enough men to defend its frontiers and can do without womens help. Feminist organizations that took umbrage at Barboras remarks largely consist of elites who are disconnected from ground realities, and need petty issues to sustain themselves.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Prabhakar Bhattacharya, Ichapore, North 24 Parganas 

                
	Sir  P.K. Barbora has rightly said that political interference is affecting the armed forces modernization. While Indians never did lack in valour, they have lacked modern arms and techniques when dealing with the incessant waves of attack from the West. During the Kargil War, it was the much-maligned Bofors which had saved the day for India. But politicians ensured that we blacklisted the company so that there was a scarcity of high-calibre guns later. While netting the Bofors agents, the fact of the superiority of their guns was overlooked. For todays armed forces, we need superior quality weapons which we, through our faulty legislations, have ensured are not manufactured in India.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Long wait          
	Sir  The bus service of the Calcutta State Transport Corporation in the Howrah to Sector V (via Sealdah-Beliaghata) route is very poor. Except S-12, almost no other CSTC bus runs on this route, and the number of S-12 buses is also decreasing by the day. Most of the S-12 buses are old and outdated. Everyday, during the peak office hours in the morning, there is a long queue for S-12 in the absence of sufficient buses. Most often, we have to wait for about 30 minutes or an hour to get a bus. We face similar problems in the evenings while returning home from office.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Susobhan Banerjee, Baidyabati, Hooghly 

                
	Sir  In the recent past, several buses have met with accidents because they were running on resoled tyres. Resoled tyres tend to lose their grips easily. I was shocked to see a CSTC bus (WB04B 7895) plying in the Ultadanga-Sector V route that had at least two tyres with flattened grips. The front tyre looked resoled, and it was obviously without any grip. How did this bus get the certificate of fitness from the transport department? If the CSTC can allow such buses to ply, how can we expect private operators to be strict on these matters?                     
	Yours faithfully,

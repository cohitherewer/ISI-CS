The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Letters to Editor
                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Love of the common people                  
	Sir  Devadeep Purohits article, Butus burden of wants (April 25), offered a realistic glimpse of elections through the eyes of a common, rural Indian. Someone as poor as Butu Karmakar does not reportedly miss an opportunity to vote even though she has been denied the basic amenities of survival. In fact, Karmakar represents that section of the populace that does not care which party forms the government or who gets elected to the Parliament. This is not because people like Karmakar are indifferent to politics, but because they have learnt from experience that elections come and go but very little changes in their lives.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Abhijit Das, Singapore 

                
	Sir  I was moved by the photograph of Butu Karmakars smiling face on the front page of The Telegraph. Karmakar, a poor village woman, is so fascinated by Rahul Gandhi that she travelled 40 kilometres to see her god, who made his maiden solo appearance on a political podium in the state that day. Karmakar, who is not literate, seemed not too bothered about her miseries, although the Constitution has given her the right to elect a representative so that her problems can be solved. The story is the same for most poor people of India. It must be awfully difficult for the poor to choose the right candidate when educated city dwellers find it challenging to elect a representative who can change things for the better. One doesnt know how to describe those who betray the poor after promising them the moon during elections.           
	However, the subject of Karmakars affection, Rahul Gandhi, was impressive during his press conference in Calcutta. He answered the tricky questions in a mature manner and even outshone the veteran leader, Pranab Mukherjee, who was by his side. It only goes to show that Rahul Gandhi is now ready to hold important posts, although the prime ministers chair would have to wait for a few more years.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Wise words          
	Sir  Colonel Karunas statement that the Tamil Tigers chief, V. Prabhakaran, will fight to the death instead of surrendering should be taken in all seriousness (Prabhakaran will fight to death: Former aide, April 27). Prabhakaran is still alive and is directing the Liberation Tigers for Tamil Eelams operations. Karuna, who accuses Prabhakaran of being ruthless, should remember that he too was as cruel when he was the LTTEs deputy chief. If one were to go through the history of the Sinhala-Tamil conflict, one would see that the Tamils have been discriminated against by the Sinhalese. The atrocities perpetuated by the Sinhalese forced Tamils to take up arms. The LTTE, headed by Prabhakaran, proved to be the frontrunner of the Tamil cause. Prabhakaran will try and flee his country to continue with his struggle if he remains alive. Karunas words make one thing certain  Prabhakaran is not afraid of death. He is fighting to liberate his people and is willing to die for them. He may, however, be captured if he is betrayed by someone from the LTTEs inner circle or by his personal bodyguards.           
	While one cannot fault the Sri Lankan army for battling with the LTTE, the death of thousand of civilians caught in the crossfire between the army and the rebels cannot be condoned. Given the current situation, a separate homeland for the Tamils can no longer be considered a reality. Instead of continuing with its armed struggle, the LTTE should take the Tamil political groups into confidence and opt for a political solution. Unless this is done, the situation will be similar to that in Palestine or Kashmir. Both the Sinhalese and Tamils will then end up being losers in the game.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
S. Balakrishnan, Jamshedpur

                
	Parting shot          
	Sir  Both the Twenty20 matches on April 23 were exciting affairs and gave television viewers immense pleasure. However, I have a few things to say about the Kolkata Knight Riders who played the Rajasthan Royals in the second match. It is true that the owner, Shah Rukh Khan, can do as he pleases but must he keep on hitting his own wicket? For the last two months, Khan has kept his team in the news for all the wrong reasons.           
	Even the coach, John Buchanan, needs to answer a few questions. Why was Lakshmi Ratan Shukla promoted in the batting order even though he failed to bring the run-rate down, making it difficult for Sourav Ganguly to win the game? In the super over, why was dada not sent out to bat with Chris Gayle? When will Khan and Buchanan start making the right moves?           
	Yours faithfully,

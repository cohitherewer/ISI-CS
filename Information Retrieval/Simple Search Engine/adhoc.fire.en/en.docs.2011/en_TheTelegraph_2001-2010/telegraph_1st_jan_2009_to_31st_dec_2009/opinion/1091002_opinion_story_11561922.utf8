	THE COLLECTED WHAT IF? EMINENT HISTORIANS IMAGINE WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN Edited by Robert Cowley, Putnam, Rs 499                        
	Purists among historians will scoff at the idea of speculation in history writing. History is to do with facts, not with the counterfactual. The question of what might have been is thus relegated to an elaborate intellectual game. The historian E.H. Carr called it an idle parlour game. Long before Carr, the famous quip that said that if Cleopatras nose had been a bit shorter, the history of Europe would have been different had pointed to the absurdity of the what if question in history. But sometimes, the counterfactual does produce significant insights. This volume, in which essays by some very good and well known historians have been brought together, try to provide some interesting suggestions on past events. It goes without saying that all the essays are not equally successful. When used by a deft historian the what if question brings out startling details and highlights, though in an indirect way, the consequences of an event. There is another important aspect to the what if question. This is what the editor of this volume aptly calls the hindsight bias. History, almost always, becomes the story of the successful and the victorious. This leads to the assumption  sometimes even the conclusion  that the success or the victory was inevitable. Analysing what might have been helps to shift the focus. Often critical battles were close run things. Ideas that emerged dominant were always hotly debated and contested. These are some of the reasons why the essays in this volume make for delightful reading. Unfortunately, there are no essays on Indian themes. It would be interesting for historians to think about what would have happened, for example, to the 18th century if Sada Shiv Rao Bhau had won against Abdali in Panipat in 1761 or if Clive had not routed Siraj at Plassey in 1757.                              
	WEDDED TO  THE SEA  
	LORDS OF THE SEA: THE EPIC STORY OF THE ATHENIAN NAVY AND THE BIRTH OF DEMOCRACY By John R. Hale, Viking, $24.95          
	For most students of history Athens is a name to conjure with. It was the cradle of many things  from democracy to drama. It is Hales contention that Athenians were wedded to the sea. One Spartan said that the people of Athens fornicated with the sea. The fame and fortune of Athens in the ancient world was predicated on its continuing quest for sea rule. Greek historians, Hale informs us coined a term for this kind of power. They called it thalassokratia or thalassocracy. This quest was partly the outcome of Athenss geographical location. The Athenian thalassocracy began at the battle of Salamis in 480 BC when the Athenians manoeuvred a Greek naval victory over the fleet of the Persian king, Xerxes. It ended at the Piraeus, close to Salamis in 322 BC when the successors of Alexander the Great sent a Macedonian garrison to take over the naval base. Between 480 and 322 BC stretched the golden age of Athens. Hale writes with only a hint of exaggeration, Without the Athenian navy there would have been no Parthenon, no tragedies of Sophocles or Euripides, no Republic of Plato or Politics of Aristotle. This claim is based on the fact that before the victory at Salamis, the Athenians had produced no great traditions of philosophy, architecture, drama, political science and history. All these great achievements  perhaps unparalleled in European history  happened only after the Athenians voted in the fifth century BC to build a fleet and transform themselves into a naval power. Is there a cause and effect here or was it mere coincidence?

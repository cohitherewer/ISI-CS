The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Weave the different threads together
                                                                                                                 WEAVE THE DIFFERENT THREADS TOGETHER                              Sharmila Basu Thakur      Dance                                                
	Regular training and vigorous practice are a must for professional dancers. Besides these two things, these artists also depend on their interaction with the audience to enrich themselves and their art. This is a necessary condition for every kind of performing art, including dance.         
	Meera Chandam presented Classical Evening, a dance programme that was organized at Rabindra Sadan recently. Under the able guidance of Molly Roy, a veteran Kathak and Bharatnatyam dancer, the event provided a wonderful opportunity for young, gifted and enthusiastic dancers to present the different genres of classical dance. It was also a perfect opportunity for the participants to display their talent. Classical Evening included 23 dance numbers straddling myriad dance forms. Each performance was marked by discipline and a wonderful sense of timing.        
	The evening commenced with Guru Vandana in Kathak style. There were eight dancers in this particular performance, and their simple and elegant movement set the mood for what was to follow. The inaugural performance was an indicator of the high standard of the entire programme. Guru Vandana was followed by Ganesh Stuti and Pushpanjali  two invocatory numbers in Bharatnatyam. Usually, it is difficult to accommodate every student of an institution in an annual programme within a specific span of time. Maintaining the diversity of a presentation of this scale can also be challenging. However, to her credit, Molly Roy overcame these twin challenges in an intelligent and efficient manner. Ivy Saha, a senior student of Roy, presented Kirtanam with a mixture of confidence and grace. Dressed in the traditional white costume, the talented dancer maintained a spontaneous circular body movement, the hallmark of this form of dance.         
	Three other artists  Subrata, Swati and Dwaipayan  put together an item from the Kathak repertoire which was based on dhamar. All three artists proved their mettle with the help of their nimble footwork. After watching the three perform on stage, there could be little doubt about the fact that they had been able to grasp the nuances of this idiom perfectly.        
	Somdeepa, Nishita, Susmita, Shraddha, Debrupa, Soumanti, Amrita and Anindita presented traditional Kathak numbers in teental. Their movements were well-synchronized, and the speed and precision with which they demonstrated their skills made the performance thoroughly enjoyable.         
	Then, it was time for Panchakshara Stotram and Natesha Kavuthuvam. A large contingent of student dancers participated in this particular performance, and this was followed by Adavu, an integral element within Bharatnatyam, in which the basic steps of this form of dance were choreographed with the help of bol and musical notes.         
	Tarana, an innovative experimental composition, was presented by the dancers that brought Bharatnatyam and Kathak together. This required tremendous taiyaari and mutual understanding among the performers. Fortunately, they rose up to the challenge and performed wonderfully.         
	The participants of the evening were guided by Sutapa Banerjee, Radha Bhattacharya, Swati Nandy, Ivy Saha, Satavisha Mitra, Subrata Pandit and Tanushree Paul. The light was designed by Ashoke Tapan Adhikari and Soumen Ghosh and Tarit Sarkar acted as the compre for the evening.

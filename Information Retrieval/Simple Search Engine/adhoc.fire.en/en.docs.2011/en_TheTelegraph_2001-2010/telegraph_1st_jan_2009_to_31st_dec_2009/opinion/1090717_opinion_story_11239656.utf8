The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | For a fresh start
                                                                                                                 FOR A FRESH START                                  BONA FIDE - Malvika Singh                              
	Omar Abdullah has been put through the wringer in Kashmir with the Shopian rape case. Sadly, the old horses in the Congress party, unable to deviate from their devious political agenda at a time when the chips are down for their coalition partner, have been operating behind the scenes to divide the government and the partnership. There are rumours about the involvement of senior leaders with those who are guilty of the rape and murder in Shopian. In a country where the oral tradition carries as much weight as the written word, the people believe in what the Western, English-speaking lot term gossip, and the perception clearly is that well-connected people were saved by political intervention in this particular incident.        
	There is nothing new in this belief. Indians know well that their protectors are in cahoots with the mafia and participate in or condone all kinds of illegal social activity for a fee. Patient citizens have learnt to live within a corrupt and uncivilized framework, finding ingenious ways of side-stepping the authority that has rapidly become self-serving and corrupt.         
	The shameful assault in Shopian and similar such incidents across India demean us as a people. Real life images on television have begun to expose this hitherto silent menace that was protected by the State apparatus, thereby injecting fear in the lives of law-abiding, ordinary people. With Abdullah turning the police force inside out, he has shown great guts in taking on an entrenched and corrupt nexus between the State and a burgeoning and fearless mafia. He may also be in danger because of his attempt to disturb the comfortable status quo of corrupt practitioners. But we need more of such political leaders who can start the process of cleansing.                
	Licence to cripple        
	The smaller examples of how a corrupt authority harasses entrepreneurs on a daily basis need constant reiteration. If you are running a successful restaurant in Delhi, with a legitimate bar license, you are constantly plagued by the excise mafia  employees of the State who will arrive for a hefty hafta during working hours. As a result, customers are left watching the crude spectacle of pot-bellied inspectors harassing the entrepreneur. Instead of getting the license at an exhorbitant yearly rate, some prefer to just pay the inspector in cash as well as with bottles of English wine. This is the horror of trying to do legitimate and honest business in India.         
	Recently, a very successful restaurateur tried to convince the Delhi government to create a license for beer and wine only, excluding hard liquor, and was told that it would not be possible because the liquor mafia would never allow it. Are we openly admitting that the mafias hold our governments to ransom? Surely elected leaders need to extricate themselves from the clutches of such activity and begin anew.        
	With the Commonwealth Games around the corner, the Delhi government should initiate a fresh bar license category for beer and wine. What stops this kind of sensible decision- making and implementation? Excise officers demanding hafta need to be suspended from office. The Delhi government needs to formulate a transparent mechanism to identify the corrupt, and get a team of volunteers  citizens who face harassment  to do some of the counter policing by bringing complaints forward and ensuring redressal. Delhi is a good place to begin the exercise especially since the Games are coming up next year.        
	With political will, many simple changes can be instituted and undertaken in a manner that keeps the representatives of the corroded and misplaced authority away from clean business. This will bring about vitality amongst those who would like to follow their dream, however small it may be in the context of the larger jigsaw.

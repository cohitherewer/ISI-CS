The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | An outstanding cricketer and a witty gentleman
                                                                                                                 AN OUTSTANDING CRICKETER AND A WITTY GENTLEMAN                                  CUT TO PERFECTION       Excellent though his career statistics are, they still fail to do justice to Gundappa Viswanaths genius                                                  
	Gundappa Raghunath Viswanath was given a lifetime achievement award recently. Highly impressive though Viswanaths statistical record may be, the 6,080 runs he scored for India were certainly not his major contribution. The essence of his contribution lay in the innumerable match-winning innings, the courageous fight-backs in defence of Indias honour and, most significantly, the endless hours of pristine pleasure that he gave to cricket-lovers the world over with his charming style and manner.        
	Yet, his own initiation to international cricket had neither charm nor grace. As the young debutant walked back with a nought against his name, a team-mate remarked, Why have these fancy types when we have hardened ones available? In the second essay, an innings of infinite charm and variety unfolded: wristy cuts and flicks fetched 25 boundaries in a score of 137, captivating the Kanpur crowd. In the following Test in Delhi, he helped India to a resounding victory against the likes of Graham McKenzie and Ashley Mallet.        
	Viswanath played many such sterling knocks the world over. But exactly where would he be in the pantheon of batsmanship? His consistency never matched Sir Dons. Neither did he possess Sir Jack Hobbss technical acumen nor Denis Comptons glamour. He lacked the sheer power of Vivian Richards, and Sunil Gavaskars mammoth achievements have also eluded him. Then how should he be evaluated?        
	When cricket addicts discuss Vishy, they do not waste time on his statistical record as figures cannot tell the story of his artistry. His batsmanship was not a thought, but a feeling. Vishy took the spectators to rarefied realms. He had every orthodox stroke in his repertoire, but he executed them in his own unique way. For him, to cut or flick from the stumps, that too against the movement, was as simple as dipping an idli into sambar. He never seemed to lose his composure, his balance or his natural elegance.        
	Viswanath performed beautifully wherever he played the game. He was the first Indian to score centuries against every Test-playing country at home and abroad. He felt at home against pace and spin. One of his finest performances was against Clive Lloyds West Indies at Eden Gardens in 1974: a flawless knock of 139, which laid the foundation of a grand victory as V.B. Chandrasekhar drove the final nails on the last day. A scintillating knock of 97 not out enabled India to win the following Test in Chennai.        
	Away from India too, he was his relaxed self. On that fateful day at Port of Spain in 1976, when the West Indian fast bowlers were peppering the Indians with bouncers, Viswanaths century helped India record a historic win by chasing down a total of more than 400. One pertinent point about Vishys batting was that he scored his centuries so rapidly that it allowed Indian bowlers enough time to run through the opposition.        
	He held 63 catches in his 91 Tests. His Test average is as high as 41.93, and includes 14 centuries, with 222 as his highest score. Excellent though his figures are, they still fail miserably to do justice to this noble cricketer. Such was his spirit that once he called back a batsman on being given out. At Mumbai, in the BCCIs jubilee Test against England in 1980, Bob Taylor was given out caught behind. Taylor told Vishy that he had not touched the ball. Viswanath promptly informed the umpire that he was withdrawing the appeal. Taylor and Botham added vital runs and India lost the match. Expectedly, he was criticized from all quarters, and even lost his captaincy. But he did not show any regret and merely smiled the troubles away. Vishy is a man of remarkable wit. Once, when an umpire turned down an appeal against him, the suffering bowler, Subroto Guha, suggested, That was a straight ball. Immediately a smiling Viswanath retorted, Bacchu, marvellous swinger that you are, the ball must have been swinging away. When people applauded, Vishy would modestly doff his cap and raise his bat to acknowledge them.         
	Viswanath is regarded as an artist who played tunes with the willow. In cricketing pantheon, he is Shiva: a deity with a noble head and heart.                          RAJU MUKHERJI

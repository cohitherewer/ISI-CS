The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | who cares?
                                                                                                                 WHO CARES?                                                    
	Most Calcuttans support the ban on smoking in public places, yet Calcutta has managed to implement the ban least successfully compared to the other Indian metros. What does this say about the city, about its citizens and its keepers? The kindest way to look at these findings from a recent survey is to think of Calcutta as up to date in medical awareness, yet laid-back and stylishly unanxious about its lungs. But the citys present, and the history behind that present, suggest an altogether gloomier reading. According to this view, most Calcuttans are perfectly aware that smoking is lethal, but a combination of civic apathy and misgovernance makes them fatalistically resigned to the status quo regarding the consumption of tobacco. Awareness, in this case, is no antidote to the citizens passiveness and the authorities indifference and inefficiency. All Calcuttans, apart from those whose air is perpetually conditioned, are completely aware, for instance, of the poison that they are breathing each time they step outside into the street. But this poison has now been accepted as part of the natural human condition, so that very few people think twice before getting into an illegally fuelled autorickshaw, taxi, bus or private car. This also lets the authorities  the government and municipality  off from the crime of not implementing the courts rulings on air pollution.        
	For the smoking ban to be a success, the administrative infrastructure of the city as well as the individual and collective civic sense of its citizens have to be in functioning order. Mumbais compliance record is 98 per cent, compared to Calcuttas seven, and one would have to be blind to the two cities recent history to be surprised at this contrast. When it comes to making a concerted effort to change an evidently self-destructive tradition, Calcuttas political leaders, civic keepers and citizens alike have a legendarily abysmal record of making any sort of difference to their own lives. A few month ago, The Telegraph found government officials to be the biggest offenders against the ban on smoking, flouting it with impunity in the Calcutta High Court, the Writers Buildings and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation. One babu in the CMCs civic health department pointed out that smoking increased productivity, and whenever he got stuck at work, he lit a cigarette and found his mind full of ideas.

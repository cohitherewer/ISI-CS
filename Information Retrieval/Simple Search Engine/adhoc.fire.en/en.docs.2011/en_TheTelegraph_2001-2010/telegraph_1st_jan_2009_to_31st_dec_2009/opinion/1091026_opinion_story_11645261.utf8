                                                                                                                 BASIC IDEA                                                    
	It is easy to get lost in the thicket of official acronyms. BPLR does not stand for below-poverty-level racketeers, but for benchmark prime lending rate. The Reserve Bank of India compels all banks to declare one. The chiefs of the RBI travel much, and meet their peers from other central banks all over the world. Over soft drinks in some resort, they heard that banks in other countries declare prime lending rates at which they lend to their most valuable customers; they charge everyone else more. So they came home and ordered Indian banks too to declare their PLRs, which they obediently did.        
	The banks did not tell the RBI, but eventually it found out that they were lending even below their PLRs to specially favoured customers. The RBI realized that it had been had. As is its custom under such circumstances, it appointed a committee of faithfuls to tell it what to do. This committee has recommended replacement of BPLR by a base rate  a rate below which banks would promise on their honour never to lend. It would be the sum of all the costs a bank simply has to cover  the average interest the bank pays on its deposits, overheads, a mark-up from which it would cross-subsidize what it has to lend to the government, and a minimum profit margin. The interesting thing is that the RBI expected the BPLR to be the minimum interest to be charged to lenders. To its discomfiture, banks lent to some customers at below BPLR, so the RBI does not know what animal the BPLR is; it is looking for an animal it can recognize. One would have thought that there was a simple way of finding it out  just ask banks to declare their minimum lending rate. But that does not suit the RBI; it also wants the minimum rate to cover a banks costs, for it is determined not to let any bank make a loss.        
	One would expect a central bank to know the difference between interest and profit. Interest is what the bank pays a particular lender or charges a borrower; it applies to a single loan or deposit. Profit is what the bank makes at the end of a period out of its income after paying its costs. It is not necessary for a bank to make a profit on every loan; all that matters is that it should make a decent profit at the end of the year. It is understandable that the RBI, as a zealous regulator, would like to have some figures of actual interest rates from the banks. It would, however, be quite sufficient if it were to ask the banks for any of four rates, namely minimum, maximum, modal and weighted average lending rates. It should abandon its obsession with cost-plus pricing.

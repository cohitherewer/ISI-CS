                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        IN THE ROGUES GALLERY                                  MALA FIDE - Malvika Singh                              
	The cold has started to set in, and rumour has it that because of changes in climate patterns, Delhi will witness an unprecedented cold winter this year, with temperatures dropping to below zero degrees. When that happens, the power supply will become erratic, and the atmosphere will be further polluted with the smoke of rubber burning at every roadside, as people huddle around the fire to keep themselves warm. Within the thick walls of Parliament, snug in the warmth of a building well-conceived and constructed, the elected representatives of our young democracy continue to adjourn the House with predictable regularity, instead of working for the delivery of essential goods and services to those outside the walls of privilege.        
	For the Shiv Sainiks in Mumbai, breaking into the offices of the IBN network and beating up journalists seem to be the top priority in their scheme of social work and selfless commitment to Maharashtrian nationalism. The cosmopolitan ethos of the Bombay of my youth has been diluted into that of a parochial little town where the local leadership is desperate to shut out Indians from other parts of India. This only happens when there is a profound sense of insecurity vis- -vis the rest of the nation, or when people believe that they are not competent enough to compete and would, therefore, like to keep quality skills, ability for hard work and intellectual activities at bay.        
	To allow this kind of blatant abuse of the law of the land to flood the public space is nothing short of criminal. And when governments fail to bring in the corrective through strong and urgent action, the result is frightfully undignified. Watching Ashok Chavan on television, promising to bring the culprits to book, makes one wonder whether the charade will continue this time too. Or will he, as the chief minister, rise out of the mire that is Mumbai and, even at the cost of betraying his hitherto exploitative political class, ensure stern and definite action, regardless of the consequences and the constant threat of a backlash? Will he be the first to set the blurred lines straight and draw the lakshman rekha of appropriate, honest, clean and lawful behaviour?                 
	More queries        
	Will the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party oldies, used to playing one horror against the other that creates impossible-to-handle monsters on whose back they then climb and ride for short-term gains, abruptly and decisively discard their failed, manipulative strategies and reform the politics of Maharashtra, in this particular instance?         
	Bhindranwale was one such creation, and Raj Thackeray is being seen as the new boy on that block! The chatterati in that city, along with the few well-heeled who wanted to make an impact on India by entering the political fray to cleanse a corroded system, seem to have lost their voices on this recent issue. They are not seen on television channels and are definitely not sitting in dharnas, leading peaceful civil disobedience movements in front of Bal Thackerays home or office. In contrast, the chief minister has been very vocal and comes across the footlights as being genuine in his anger at the happenings. Will civil society in Mumbai, as a start, address this peculiar, irrational and unconstitutional premise of the Shiv Sena and the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena that Maharashtra is for Maharashtrians and the rest are second-class citizens?        
	As a symbolic gesture, all non-Maharashtrians in Mumbai could cease work, completely and wholly, for one week. Then cut all resources from the Centre to the state. Maharashtra will stand still and begin to crumble. When confronted with this stark reality, all Indians in Maharashtra will rethink their allegiances and the definition of Marathi nationalism in 2009.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | all change to circle line
                                                                                                                 ALL CHANGE TO CIRCLE LINE                                                          
	The expression, caught between the devil and the deep blue sea, has become more than a figure of speech in contemporary West Bengal. Change in the state is imminent, that much is evident. The drama, the disruption and the violence that will be integral to that process of change are phenomena that in the coming months will haunt all those who live in West Bengal. Events on Friday provided a glimpse of what the people will have to endure in the near future. What occurred is a series of incidents which is individually and collectively indefensible. A brief recapitulation will help to underline the point. Since the Lefts setback in the Lok Sabha polls, violence and inter-party strife have been on the rise in the districts. The state administration has done precious little to curb this. A district level leader of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), in the course of a blood-curdling speech, imposed a half-hour deadline on the police to arrest some miscreant owing allegiance to the Trinamul Congress. In retaliation, a prominent leader of the Trinamul Congress  in fact, the leader of the Opposition in the state assembly  and three of his colleagues laid siege to the chief ministers chamber in the Writers Buildings. They demanded the arrest of the chief minister and pointed out that no miscreant belonging to the ruling party is ever arrested by the police with such alacrity. The Trinamul Congress protesters were removed forcibly from the Writers Buildings. The sequel to this was a number of demonstrations across the city by the Trinamul Congress which disrupted life.        
	Time is long past when such a sequence of events could be laughed at and ridiculed. That the police in West Bengal acts at the behest of the ruling party is a point that has been made more than once by many people. It seldom, if ever, moves against those comrades who flout the law. Neither violence nor incitement to violence when carried out by communists is acted upon by the police. On the other hand, the Opposition makes a good point badly by making the ludicrous demand that the chief minister should be arrested by his own administration. They then proceed to disrupt the city when their theatre of the absurd in the Writers Buildings is broken up by the police.        
	What the Trinamul Congress and its redoubtable leader are oblivious to are the remarkable similarities between their methods and rhetoric and those of the CPI(M) when it was on its way to power. Like the communists, the Trinamul Congress has also chosen the path of disruption and street violence. Its leader spoke recently about how the state would burn if the CPI(M) touched intellectuals known for their closeness to so-called Maoists. This is the rhetoric of the young and firebrand Jyoti Basu. It could well be asked if these are really signs of change or signs of a change of political labels.

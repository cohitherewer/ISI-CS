                                                                                                               DIARY
                  
	 The Bharatiya Janata Party emerged bruised and battered in the battle for parliamentary seats. But its members are now fighting one another over the seating arrangement in Parliament. Jaswant Singh, already miffed with Sushma Swarajs elevation as LK Advanis deputy in the House, suffered yet another blow when he discovered that he had been relegated to the back benches. Since his unpleasant discovery, Jaswant is reported to have been absent from the House frequently. Yashwant Sinha is equally unhappy with his position: he has found himself sharing second-row seats with junior leaders like Shahnawaz Hussain. But the battle for the front seats has spilled over into other parties and several leaders have joined the fray. Two former Union ministers, Lalu Prasad and T.R. Baalu, had demanded this special privilege. They were turned down by the Speaker who reminded them that they are not entitled to such premium accommodation. But with the row over the seats still raging, it seems that Meira Kumar will have a tough time trying to find every member a hot seat.                 
	 Prithviraj Chauhan, the Union minister for science and technology, is an exception in many ways. Unlike most other leaders, he has a sparkling sense of humour. Whats more, he can also laugh at himself.       
	There are two television sets in Chauhans office, and both are supposed to run with the help of a single remote control. But recently, when the minister tried to operate the remote, things went out of control. Even though Chauhan had pressed the remote button, both the televisions continued to beam the same channel. Soon, an exasperated Chauhan put down the remote and was heard muttering And I am supposed to be the science and technology minister?                            
	 While still on matters of technology, here is what a senior government functionary discovered about his predecessor. G.K. Pillai, the new home secretary, having taken over from Madhukar Gupta, searched in vain for the latters laptop or computer. When Pillai did not find what he was looking for, he thought that the PC had been sent for repairs, but was told that his predecessor did not use one. Did someone say that only the netas needed to be wired?                            
	 Before the elections, Rahul Gandhis critics mocked and laughed at his pro-Dalit gestures and utterances. After the polls were over, however, Rahuls opponents discovered that the joke was on them. No one should be surprised by the fact that the Congresss babalog are following in the steps of their young leader. Jyotiraditya Scindia has been spending time with Dalits and tribals in the Gwalior-Guna region. Not to be left behind, Sachin Pilot has also adopted the same strategy to score points in his territory. But what has raised eyebrows is the decision taken by Shivraj Singh Chauhan, the chief minister of Madhya Pradesh. Chauhan has been so impressed by Rahuls idea that he has now decided to spend a few nights in the homes of Dalits and tribals in his state. One wonders what the hosts have to say about the sudden rush among VVIPs to be guests in their humble homes.                            
	 At a time when the world is reeling under a prolonged recession, economists have taken a backseat in the BJP allowing lawyers to call the shots on matters related to the economy. Yashwant Sinha, who had served as the finance minister in the Vajpayee government, may have mended the fences with Rajnath Singh but is still unwilling to lead the charge against the Congresss recent aam admi budget. Jaswant Singh is equally well-versed in economic matters, but he is often not present to lend his voice to those on the Opposition benches during the proceedings.      
	With the leading players unwilling to shoulder the task, the responsibility has now fallen on the shoulders of Arun Jaitley. Jaitley is supposed to take the budget to task in the Upper House with the help of Arun Shourie and Venkaiah Naidu. Sushma Swaraj is expected to do the same in the Lok Sabha.      
	BJP supporters will be hoping that the lawyers in the party rank and file will be able to rest the case with the people successfully.                
	 Family, the grape vine has it, does not always come first for all members of the Bachchan clan. Jaya expectedly cancelled the shoot for a Revathy film  Aap Ke Liye Hum  to be by the ailing Amar Singhs side in Singapore. The Samajwadi Party leader is in Singapore where he is supposed to undergo a kidney replacement surgery. However, it was Big Bs absence from his brothers side that set tongues wagging. There has been some speculation that the reports of Amitabhs illness have been exaggerated to justify his non-appearance in Singapore. (Recent reports in the media state that the actor has been suffering from stomach pain.) There are also rumours that the actors health situation is not that grave: Amitabh apparently went to Lilavati hospital for some basic tests, but since then, he has been kept under observation at home. Amar is unlikely to be happy with what is being churned out by the rumour mills. He has gained one filmi brother (Sanjay Dutt) but seems to have lost another.

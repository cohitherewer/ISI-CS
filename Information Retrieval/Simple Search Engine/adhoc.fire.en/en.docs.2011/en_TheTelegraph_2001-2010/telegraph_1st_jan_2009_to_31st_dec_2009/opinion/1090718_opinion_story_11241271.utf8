The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Lacking credibility
                                                                                                                 LACKING CREDIBILITY                              
	Theatre Workshops latest, Jadio Galpa, is a revival of the Bengali play, Satyameva, by Sudipta Bhowmik, who lives in the US and composes drama for the Bengali community there. The original production had come to Calcutta two years ago. It is relatively simple compared to Bhowmiks more accomplished work, Ron, and it does seem that the director, Ashok Mukhopadhyay, recognizes this but wants to encourage new playwriting. The subject is globalization, seen through the professional relationship of two Bengalis by birth: a successful North American executive who must sack an unsatisfactory engineer freshly recruited from India. In a plot faintly reminiscent of the game in Peter Shaffers Sleuth, the latter concocts various tales about the dangers awaiting him at home in a do-or-die attempt to stay on in America. These twists, and the two mens changing equation as the evening progresses, form the story.         
	Bhowmiks script has some credibility issues, however, that impede us from suspending our disbelief, mainly concerning the unlikely sympathetic readiness of the boss (acted by Mukhopadhyay himself) to hear his employee (Krishnagati Chattopadhyay) out, surprisingly revealing his own marital troubles in the conversation, and a certain too-easily-accessible letter that plays a crucial role. Mukhopadhyays somewhat forced American English adds to these brakes on acceptability, though Chattopadhyay is believable as a great pretender.

	Lyrical evening        
	Robimon presented Mukulito Kisholoy at Sisir Mancha on July 2. The entire programme was carefully structured by Krishna Ray, who had strung together a cluster of Rabindrasangeets with a script that was brilliantly narrated by Soumitra Chatterjee.        
	The young singer, Shinjini Acharya Majumdar sang 14 songs. Her voice was bold but not comfortable in the higher octaves (where she hit a few jarring notes). She could certainly do better to fulfil the audiences expectations. However, Acharya Majumdar gave competent renditions of songs like Dure kothaye dure dure, Akashbhara suryatara, Aaj nobin megher sur legechhe, Ganer vitor diye jakhon dekhi bhubonkhani, Aamar sakal kanta dhanyo kore and Tomarei koriachi jibonero dhrubotara. Soumitra Chatterjees immaculate elocution in his inimitable style bewitched the audience. His sober and sensitive reading of the script made up for whatever was lacking in the evening. The same cannot be said for the somewhat over-enthusiastic accompaniment provided by the instrumentalists, especially on the keyboard, which felt totally dissonant with the innate spirit of Rabindrasangeet.        
	Kaberi Mitra Sarkar

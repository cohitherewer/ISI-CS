The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | how the cookies crumble
                                                                                                                 HOW THE COOKIES CRUMBLE                                  BONA FIDE - Malvika Singh                              
	The one really positive role played by television in India is the ruthlessly honest exposure  that which comes live  of the particularly shameful actions, language and general demeanour of many elected legislators and members of our parliament. It has been disgusting to witness the unacceptable and abusive behaviour of the men in the assemblies of Uttar Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh over the last few days. Trading charges of corruption of various kinds against one another, all are unmindful of the fact that the citizens is beginning to find it all abrasive and despicable, something they want to protect their children from. Acts of this nature are a blatant and conscious abuse of constitutional authority by elected representatives, who must be compelled to operate with probity and not disgrace the Indian people. Earlier, the Left treated the Speaker, Somnath Chatterjee, with such disrespect that it too has blotted its copy-book.        
	Through the recurring images and sounds that come via the small screen, the irresponsibility, lack of intellect and profound superficiality of our leaders smack us on the face. The raging corruption, inability to govern with integrity, subjective moral policing, support of goonda gardi and illegitimate activity in the public space, all of which the political class seems to encourage and condone with the tacit support of a feeble and fickle bureaucracy, have led the nation into becoming a banana republic, a fast failing State. In the 1950s, those early, heady years of being an infant republic, India was proud of its Constitution and determined to show the world that despite being economically and culturally ravaged by colonial domination, our leaders were of a different calibre. They were committed, wise, lettered and cultured. The administrators, too, were trained in the best traditions  upright, unbending, living and working by staunch ethics, the dynamic face of an emerging nation-state.                
	Strange bedfellows        
	Over 60 years, the descent into the political mire has been palpable. The time is perfect for a new, comparatively unknown and untested politician to rise and stem the rot, to reach out and speak in a fresh, clean language, promising to chuck the filth overboard and demanding a clean-up of political processes. There is no merit in waiting a few years, hoping to put a structure in place to deal with the required overhaul because people are sick and appalled by their leaders, and are looking for alternatives. Sadly, hardly any exists. If one is to believe the feedback from UP, for example, Mayavati is on the decline, the Samajwadi Party is losing ground, the Bharatiya Janata Party is in a mess and the Congress non-existent on the ground. Therefore, the party with nothing to lose seems to be the Congress. Why not grab the opportunity and take the calculated risk of putting a local Congress supporter to stand in all 80 constituencies of the state, defying the advice of all those general-secretaries who have, over the decades, brought the party to heel, and thus go alone? Chances are that the Congress would win a number far higher than what it has today because there is no other party outside of caste-based politics. If the experiment fails, the Congress will remain where it has been, regardless.        
	This constant refrain that coalition politics is here to stay makes one mad. What we witness day-in and day-out is, by no stretch of imagination, coalition politics. It is rather the most self-serving, destructive and corrupt use of political authority through the legal democratic process. It has become unacceptable and illegitimate. It needs a young face to step out and establish a new benchmark of intellectual morality. If the Congress wants to lead the cleansing, it should sit in the Opposition, not be part of a selfish coalition, watch the mahayudh of strange bedfellows explode, and come to power once that cookie crumbles.

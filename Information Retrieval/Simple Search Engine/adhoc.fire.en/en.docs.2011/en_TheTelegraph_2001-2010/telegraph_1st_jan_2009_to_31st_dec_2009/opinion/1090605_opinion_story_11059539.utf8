	Money matters                  
	Sir  The pay and perks to be enjoyed by the newly-appointed ministers are nothing less than astronomical (Ministers of state need not worry, May 29). With free accommodation, free business-class air tickets, government-sponsored foreign trips, unlimited liberty to make telephone calls, and access to several vehicles with free petrol, the ministers are in for a royal treat for the next few years. In addition to the freebies, they will get a staggering sum of money every month. No wonder, the politicians are ready to go to any length to win elections.          
	The government generally says that these measures are necessary to attract bright, young minds into politics, and to prevent them from making a beeline for the private sector. What is missed in this line of argument is that there is a certain mechanism called appraisal in the private sector, which, sadly, is non-existent in governance. Why not let the ministers have a basic pay package to start with and then, in accordance with their performance, give them incentives? It is no secret that many of our members of parliament are multi-millionaires. Why do the tax-payers need to add more to their already overflowing coffers?          
	Yours faithfully,       
Alokananda Bhattacharyya,

	Sir  In India, a large section of the population either live below, or bordering on, the poverty line. These people, who take great pains to gather two square meals a day, would gasp at the stupendous pay and perks of their ministers. The power packet seems to make little distinction among the privileges enjoyed by cabinet ministers, ministers of state with independent charge, and ministers of state. The former nawabs and maharajas of India would have felt jealous of the package that has been bestowed on the ministers. Our reformist prime minister and finance minister should make an endeavour to put an end to the widening disparity in the distribution of wealth generated in the country.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Phani Bhusan Saha, Durgapur

                
	Face the facts          
	Sir  In Wholl bell the pig (May 31), T.V. Jayan draws attention to some aspects of public health in India. A country is in serious danger when the government makes a deliberate attempt to fudge data and suppress medical facts without caring for the lives of its citizens to earn a good reputation before the international community. It is thus not surprising that the standard of healthcare in India is abysmal.           
	The report highlights the efforts of the health department to squelch information about communicable diseases like Saharanpur encephalitis, swine flu, chikungunya and dengue. However, certain facts about other common, but serious, diseases like HIV/AIDS have also been covered up by the Indian government in the past. The number of people infected with HIV was reduced to almost half by the National AIDS Control Organization using a new surveillance system in 2006. Until then, India was projected to have more than 5 million HIV cases, second in the world. Yet horrific stories of the spread of HIV continue to appear in the media. To curb this menace, the government must make a genuine attempt to uncover the truth behind each of these stories. It is well known, however, that the health department largely ignores even formal complaints against the sporadic spread of HIV through unnatural means.          
	Numerous allegations have been raised against the possible use of substandard kits for testing of HIV in blood banks across India. The use of flawed test kits in the blood banks is likely to spread deadly viruses like HIV or hepatitis among unsuspecting patients through transfusions. A public uproar forced the West Bengal government to initiate a criminal case in 2006 against Monozyme India Limited, one of the suppliers of allegedly spurious HIV kits during the second national AIDS control programme. This case is still pending before the Calcutta High Court.           
	In any other civilized nation, a governmental AIDS control agency like NACO would have taken a keen interest in the matter and tried to uncover the truth about the possible utilization of substandard test kits. It is mandatory to test all blood donated in blood banks for the presence of infectious viruses. However, the use of defective test kits in the blood bank can pose a serious threat of transmitting deadly viruses through contaminated blood.          
	The government must appreciate the far-reaching consequences of suppressing medical facts from the public. The international community is not going to put Indian healthcare on a high pedestal only because a rosy picture is painted by the government. The true scientific status of the medical system should be acknowledged and necessary corrective measures must be adopted in an honest and candid manner for the sake of Indian citizens. Only then can the tarnished image of Indian healthcare be restored before the world.           
	Yours faithfully,

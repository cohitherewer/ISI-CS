	THE THING AROUND YOUR NECK   By Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Fourth Estate, Rs 299
    
	Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, one of the finest voices to have come out of Africa in recent years, was born in Abba, Nigeria, but grew up in the university town of Nsukka, where, by a stroke of luck, she lived in a house once inhabited by her literary hero, Chinua Achebe. Adichie was born in 1977, almost a decade after the Biafran War (1967-70) in which both her maternal and paternal grandfathers were killed. But the curse of mutual religious intolerance between the Igbo Christians (Adichies community) and the Hausa Muslims of south-east Nigeria, which was one of the causes of the civil war, never fully went away. So Adichie spent the first two decades of her life amidst tumult and then left for the United States for higher studies. Since then, she has spent sporadic, and now increasingly longer, stretches of time in the US, which does not make the task of locating her on a literary map any easier.  
	Adichie fiercely maintains her allegiance to Africa, especially to the Igbo community, in spite of what she calls her complicated affection for America. The Biafran struggle is at the heart of her Orange-Prize-winning second novel, Half of a Yellow Sun (2007), and the story of her repressive childhood forms the stuff of her first book, Purple Hibiscus (2003), which got the Commonwealth Prize. Her literary antecedents  from Gabriel Garca Mrquez to Chinua Achebe  are varied, just as her style is unpredictable. She habitually mixes Igbo with English, which not only gives a fair measure of the bilingualism of the Igbo people, but also indicates Adichies close affinity with her origins. At the same time, Adichies prose has the cadences of James Joyce, Raymond Carver or even Charles Dickens. This makes her something of a literary puzzle: neither an outsider in America, nor an insider in Africa, not even suspended between two worlds. Rather, she occupies a unique position, that of an aloof, but involved, observer.         
	The unremitting bleakness of Adichies worldview comes through in its fullness in this latest collection of a dozen short stories. There is nothing maudlin or sensational about these little vignettes. In her earlier novels, Adichie had faced the horrors of life full on, as she turned her gaze to the troubled history of her native land. Since most of the tales in The Thing Around Your Neck are set in America, a nation overwhelmed by the abundance of hope (as one of her characters puts it), there is a superficial semblance of order in them. Anarchy is no longer merely an external reality, but resides deep within the mind; the dread of life simply becomes bitter disappointment in a foreign land. There is an edginess about these tales, even in the less successful ones, which hits the reader subliminally. Yet Adichies prose is never heavy; if anything, it often runs the risk of being a victim of its own gracefulness. But every now and then, stray moments  when suspense is relieved by a sudden reversal, as in the traditional denouement of a short story  magically rescue the stories from the anodyne. Cruelties, confusions, crises keep shattering the prospect of a comfort zone.        
	Adichies seemingly placid tone keeps the reader on tenterhooks. We keep anticipating something unspeakable about to overwhelm the delicate drawing-room dramas; the best intentions end up producing the most undesirable results. In Purple Hibiscus, for instance, 15-year-old Kambili has to survive the full blast of her fathers reign of terror, which, ironically, is unleashed out of the goodness of his heart and a deep concern for the well-being of his family. Men like Kambilis Papa are a common feature of Adichies literary universe. In The American Embassy, a Nigerian journalist rallies fearlessly for democracy, writing seditious reports on the misrule of the military president, General Abacha. Finally, as the army comes hunting for him, he goes into exile, leaving his wife and child to face the brunt of the retribution. It would be simplistic to reduce the politics of this story to feminism. Adichie achieves something far more complex than feminist propaganda: good and evil, glory and misery, are inextricably connected in her work. Even the typical situation of an Igbo Christian girl given refuge by a Hausa Muslim woman during a riot exceeds its parable-like structure when the elderly lady, on learning that the girl is a medical student, pulls out her breast and says, My nipple is burning like pepper.         
	The best stories in the book seem to have been written in response to two pioneering chroniclers of Africa. The Headstrong Historian comes last in Adichies collection. It is a succinct rewriting of Chinua Achebes celebrated African trilogy. In Achebes Things Fall Apart, it was Obi Okonkwo who had started writing the imperial history of his nation in a book he called The Pacification of the Primitive Tribes of the Lower Niger. In Adichies story, the historian is Grace Afamefuna, a feisty Bush-girl-turned-academic, who reimagines the lives and smells of her grandmothers world in her own book, Pacifying with Bullets: A Reclaimed History of Southern Nigeria.         
	Adichies other story, Jumping Monkey Hill, is told from the perspective of Ujunwa, an aspiring novelist who is shocked by the racial stereotyping she faces at a writers workshop organized by a prissy British couple in South Africa. Is it merely a coincidence that the eponymous heroine of Elizabeth Costello  the masterpiece by the South African (now Australian) writer, J.M. Coetzee  also feels a near-identical outrage as she listens to Emmanuel Egudu, a Nigerian writer, giving a sermon on the Novel in Africa, riddled with clichs about what Africans ought to write?         
	In spite of their seriousness, it would be unfair to miss the glints of lightness that flash out of Adichies stories. Humour, like fine gossamer, is ever so gently woven into these tales. Readers are left teetering on the edge of a smile. On Monday of Last Week abounds with brilliant passages that capture the paranoia of an American father fussing over his child. In the eyes of the little boys nanny, Kamara, recently arrived from Nigeria, this parental dotage is absurd. Kamara decides that such anxiety must stem from having too much food: A sated belly gave Americans the time to worry that their child might have a disease that they had just read about... gave [them] the luxury of praising themselves for being good parents, as if caring for ones child were the exception rather than the rule.        
	Life on the stranger shores forges strange friendships, as the one between Nkem, married to a Nigerian business tycoon, and her housegirl, Amaechi. [America] forces egalitarianism on you so the mistress of the house ends up sharing her most intimate secrets with the maid. Different hells get entangled in a shared knot of sadness. Chinedu, the heartbroken gay man, Ukamaka, abandoned by her boyfriend, or Chinaza, stunned by her husbands bigamy, all hang together from a common noose of grief. It is this last image of bearing a cross, like a very special necklace, that lends the collection its title.                    SOMAK GHOSHAL

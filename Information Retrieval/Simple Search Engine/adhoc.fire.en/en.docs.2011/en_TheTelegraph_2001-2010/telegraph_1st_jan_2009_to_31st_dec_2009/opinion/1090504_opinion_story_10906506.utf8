	By the time this is in print, a few rounds of polling for the 15th Lok Sabha will have been completed. This is boom time for psephologists and we have already been privy to several predictions about what is in store for the various parties and alliances. Typically, psephologists in India never seem to agree with one another. But, this time around, there has been a remarkable degree of uniformity in the forecasts, with all psephologists agreeing that none of the existing fronts or alliances will get an absolute majority. The two leading contenders remain the United Progressive Alliance and the National Democratic Alliance, but they are predicted to fall well short of capturing a majority of seats in the Lok Sabha. There is now a very real prospect of a hung Lok Sabha unless either the UPA or NDA manage to cobble together a majority through dubious means.         
	Even if we can avoid a hung Lok Sabha, the next government will undoubtedly be formed by a large and unwieldy coalition. This will be a consequence of the highly fragmented Lok Sabha, a trend which has been increasingly apparent in the last four elections. For instance, the number of parties gaining representation in Parliament has increased to 38 and 37 respectively in 1999 and 2004. Not surprisingly, many of these parties were very small, with just one or two members. For instance, approximately a third of these parties had only one representative in Parliament, while over half the parties had less than five seats.              
	This would not have mattered so much if the two largest parties had captured the lions share of the remaining seats. Unfortunately, the two biggest parties, the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party, have together won less than 300 seats, so that both parties had a long way to go in order to reach the magic figure of 273  the halfway mark in the Lok Sabha. Both parties  the BJP in 1999 and the Congress in 2004  did manage to obtain majority support for their alliances. Of course, the large degree of fragmentation in the Lok Sabha meant that both coalitions contained a very large number of parties. Indeed, the NDA had as many as 13 members, while the UPA fell just short of this number.         
	Why should we care? After all, both coalitions did manage to last their full terms in office. Unfortunately, ruling coalitions with a large number of ideologically disparate members are likely to introduce various kinds of policy distortions. Typically, every policy change has its victims. That is, some group is always affected adversely. The party whose specific vote bank is hurt will then oppose the change. So, very few policy initiatives will be undertaken by such coalitions. On the other hand, each constituent will also promote spending on projects catering to the interests of its own group of supporters leading to overall excessive expenditure.         
	The increasing fragmentation in our legislative chambers reflects the growing divisiveness in our society. Caste, religion and ethnic divisions have all assumed greater significance. New parties representing narrower interests have become more popular, and have grown at the expense of national parties, whose vote and seat shares have recorded an alarming decline over the years. The kingmakers have now become the regional parties, such as the Telugu Desam Party, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, the Shiv Sena, the Samajwadi Party and the Rashtriya Janata Dal. The Bahujan Samaj Party, whose influence is spread over several states, is likely to join this list after the election results are announced.        
	Hopefully, an equitable distribution of the fruits of economic progress can help arrest the growing cleavages in our society. But this can only be achieved in the long run. In the immediate future, we have to find other ways of combating some of the consequences of social divisiveness.        
	As far as the electoral environment is concerned, the most pressing problem is clearly to reduce the extent of fragmentation in the legislative chambers. And the only way to achieve this is through electoral engineering, a topic which does not receive much attention in India. An interesting exception to this is the 1999 election manifesto of the NDA. It contained two proposals on electoral reform. The first was to bring about legislation to ensure that the Lok Sabha cannot be dissolved before its full term of five years. The second proposal was a suggestion to adopt the German system where the incumbent government can only be defeated if the no-confidence motion is simultaneously a vote of confidence for a new government.         
	Both proposals will certainly prolong the duration of governments, and also ensure that we can avoid the high expenditure involved in these elections. The latter must have been particularly relevant in 1999, since the Indian public had good reason to be disenchanted with the electoral system that year, with a third general election being foisted on them in just three years. However, the emphasis on avoiding elections is missing the wood for the trees. The first priority must be to bring about systemic changes which will promote stable and effective governance, and not simply avoid frequent elections. For instance, the two previous Lok Sabhas have lasted full terms, and we have also witnessed just two governments in these 10 years. But the vast majority would agree that we have not witnessed very efficient governance.              
	The root of the problem is the fragmented Lok Sabha. So any electoral reform must address the issue of ensuring that perhaps no more than three or four parties obtain the lions share of the seats in the Lok Sabha. Of course, any move in this direction will tend to violate a principal objective of an electoral system  the need to be representative and promote social inclusiveness. It is well-known that there is no ideal electoral system and some trade-offs between conflicting objectives are inevitable.         
	There are several ways of achieving greater concentration of seats in the Lok Sabha. For instance, there can be a stipulation that only parties which win seats in (say) at least four states will be eligible to gain representation in the Lok Sabha. An alternative would be the use of what is called the legal threshold in political science literature. The threshold would stipulate that only those parties which win at least a minimum fraction of the aggregate votes be eligible to win Lok Sabha seats. Although, the threshold is not normally used in majoritarian electoral systems, there is no conceptual problem in employing it. The use of something like a 2.5 per cent threshold would ensure a significantly greater degree of concentration in the Lok Sabha.         
	Several other countries have modified their electoral systems, sometimes quite drastically, over time. These modifications have been inspired by the feeling that the existing systems are not compatible with the changing environments. There is no reason why we cannot adopt the same approach.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | hard to sell
                                                                                                                 HARD TO SELL                                                    
	Selling Calcutta as a business-friendly city was always a hard job. A World Bank survey of 17 Indian cities, which ranks Calcutta as the toughest place to do business in, only re-confirms the old truth. The whole story could actually be worse than what the survey suggests. It takes into account only a few of the parameters such as dealing with construction permits, registration of property and payment of taxes that directly affect the running of a business venture in a city. If it included infrastructure, skill levels of the workforce and other macroeconomic criteria, the citys image as a business destination would have been even more dismal. But what is it in the citys ethos that makes it such a waste land for all kinds of enterprise? The easy answer is its notorious political culture that thrives on antagonism and hostility to change and innovation. It is only in Calcutta that a street protest against the use of computers in banking services can be a cause for political celebration by the ruling Marxists. Ironically, the supposedly radical politics that came to be associated with the city frustrated all attempts at change. When Jawaharlal Nehru called it a city of processions or Rajiv Gandhi termed it a dying city, the leftists saw it as New Delhis conspiracy against West Bengal. It did not occur to them to ponder what was wrong with the city and how to set it right.         
	The citys problems seem to be rooted in a mindset that is simply incapable of facing reality. This is evident from the responses the World Bank survey has evoked in the states bureaucratic circles. To claim that the surveys finding is more perception than reality is typical of the refusal to accept unpleasant truths. If things do not improve in Calcutta, it is primarily because of its politicians and officialdoms inability to realize how deep the rot has gone. Things can never even start to improve if the citys rulers think nothing is actually wrong with it. That is the worst thing to have happened to Calcutta  the general acceptance of incompetence and mediocrity at all levels. This survey is clearly an indictment of the way the Calcutta Municipal Corporation works. But the mayor, Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya, reacted to it perfunctorily. Rather than owning up to his responsibility for the citys problems and offering to try to solve them, he tried to find scapegoats. With such men in charge, Calcutta can only go from bad to worse.

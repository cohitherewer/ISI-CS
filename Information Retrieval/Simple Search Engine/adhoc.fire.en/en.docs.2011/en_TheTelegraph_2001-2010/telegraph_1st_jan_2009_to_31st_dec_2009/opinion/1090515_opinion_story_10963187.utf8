The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Far From A Clear Verdict
                                                                                                                 FAR FROM A CLEAR VERDICT                                  Bona Fide - Malvika Singh                              
	As we watched the so-called results of endless surveys and exit polls, it was clear that nothing was clear! Some of the hosts showed supreme disappointment on the evening of May 13 when vote shares in Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh, for example, reflected an upward swing for the Congress, while others claimed that the outcomes were totally wrong. Most tried to veil their faulty calculations and speculation by pitting the United Progressive Alliance and the National Democratic Alliance against each other, suggesting narrow and slender margins and a neck-and-neck race. No channels disseminated information that was simple and uncomplicated  such as the numbers for individual parties in every state  because anchors have a great sense of self-importance and cannot bear to give out information that is straightforward and real. Instead, they indulge in convoluted contortions that are meaningless.         
	One thing is clear  the Congress, on its own, will better its performance from that of 2004. Five years down the road, having had to deal with contentious political issues such as the nuclear deal arrangement and having succeeded despite the threats and betrayals by alliance partners in government, there seems to be no real anti-incumbency.        
	One has to salute the UPA for bearing up with dignity something that is in short supply within our political and public space. Congress numbers will go up and not down. Because the electorate was silent this time round, surveys and exit polls can merely project a possible trend and nothing more. To spell out the number of seats in the states at this juncture is sheer folly.                
	Gut feeling        
	The Bharatiya Janata Party in Gujarat and in Madhya Pradesh will hold its own and remain strong. In both these states, the broken down Congress, peopled with feuding members jockeying for personal power and gratification, has killed the party credibility and hence the party infrastructure at the grass roots. It is time the Congress retired the senior players who have failed the party in those states. Since the Youth Congress has conducted a positive membership drive in Gujarat, adding 700,000 young people to its rolls, it needs to elect the new leaders and start the process to prepare for the next elections. This truth needs to be analysed by experts, and the people need to know what is happening on the ground in Gujarat for such a large number of young people to be drawn into the Congress fold. The BJP, on its own, will probably hover around 130 to 135 seats because of the gains in Uttar Pradesh.        
	The Left is on a downward trajectory, despite the arrogance of the young Prakash Karat. The older, more cranky, leaders of the Communist Party of India, when they appear in person or on the small screen, only reinforce how far removed they and their ideologies are from a changing, energetic contemporary world. The Left leaders trying desperately to broker deals to share the cake at the Centre and be a part of the mainstream, despite their disconnect and inadequate numbers, make a mockery of what was once upon a time a political dispensation to contend with. The brokers of the Left have let down what could have been a transformed Left movement that could have adjusted to the realities of today.        
	The regional parties ruled by the local satraps are seen to be merely greedy for power and are losing ground. Experts expound all manners of theory based on self-generated bits of data that are based on preconceived positions, political beliefs and many superficial hunches to create new myths. Television channels spew propaganda relentlessly, much like they did when they believed India was shining. In the end, voters will be influenced by their individual and collective realities. This remains a semi-final!

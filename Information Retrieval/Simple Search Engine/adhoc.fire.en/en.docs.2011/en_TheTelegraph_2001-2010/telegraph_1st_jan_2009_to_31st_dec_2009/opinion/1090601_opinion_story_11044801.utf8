	Multiculturalism is a bizarre game. Its official celebration of difference is usually double-edged. Difference is entertaining from a distance, and as long as it remains recognizably different. But get closer, confound the stereotypes and try to mingle, and the situation invariably becomes tricky. What has happened to a significant number of Indians in Australia is appalling by any standards  both the numbers and the nature of the racist violence, verbal as well as physical. There has been no clear response, hands-on or token, from the Australian government, and the Indian authorities are still at the stage of venting outrage. Grand gestures, like refusing honorary degrees from Australian universities, are ultimately not much help either. So, every level of the Australian State, civil society and the academic community will have to make a concerted attempt at improving the racial environment in the country. In this, even symbolic gestures and rituals are important. But the situation will also have to be tackled as a law-and-order crisis. Is the police simply inefficient or are they silently endorsing the hostilities? To what extent do the Australian immigration laws foster, or even reflect, these prejudices?        
	Globalization will continually throw up situations like the one in Australia, which can never be resolved once and for all. Racist abuse is always played out at the levels of both perception and of resources. So, the cultural and the economic are inextricable in contemporary racism. With the redistribution of resources and geographical mobility acquiring their own momentum, consciously globalizing economies (or nation-states) will have to rethink, quite radically, deeply entrenched territorialisms, many of which have long histories specific to the regions in which they occur. The world will have to take another step forward to overcome the anxieties that globalization has bred.

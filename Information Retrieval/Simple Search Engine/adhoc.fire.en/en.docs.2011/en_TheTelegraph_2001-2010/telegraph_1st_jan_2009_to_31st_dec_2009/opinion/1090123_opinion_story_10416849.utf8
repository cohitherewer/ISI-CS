	Never before have authors become part of the selling mechanism as in the last decade or so. We see them everywhere, sandwiched between the publisher and the distributor: at launch parties, in book-signing sessions in bookshops, talk-shows on TV and, of course, in the interviews on the making of the book that are appended to serialized extracts in the press. You may say that they had always been backroom boys who have come out of the closet now.        
	But does this pro-active role of the authors help the sales of the book, and if so, why this urge to rope them in? What are the reasons why the author has taken centre stage in the marketing and distribution of books that were hitherto the publishers prerogative and responsibility, aided by the distributor or the bookseller?        
	There are two pat answers. First, since our attention span has been warped by the visual media and other distractions, publishers need to introduce another factor to attract potential buyers. Traditional marketing techniques like advertising, mailing of publicity leaflets arent enough in an overcrowded market place; something new and gimmicky is required. What better that the creator in flesh and blood? Besides, he is free and willing to be there, because he is an interested party to enhance the sales.        
	Second, publishers have realized that it is impossible to know every segment of the market and their key decision-makers. Authors, too, have their contacts who should be brought in to supplement marketing and sales efforts. Besides, if they are brought into the loop, authors can no longer complain that nothing was done after the first flush of publicity to promote their book.        
	But these two explanations dont tell us enough why there has been a surge in the authors presence in the market. There are two other reasons. Success, which means a larger number of copies sold, depends on communication skills and personal contacts. It isnt enough to mail out publicity materials or advertise at regular intervals; field representatives need to talk to their regular customers, who could be booksellers, librarians and teachers (in case of academic books).         
	In India, personal contacts and talking points take you a long way. Sadly, many representatives are not equipped to do so, partly because of the heavy portfolio of books they need to carry; personalized attention is no longer possible because of the large number of new books published every year, quite apart from the backlist. In the absence of better-informed sales representatives, it is best to bring in the author.         
	Long-term success in publishing comes from the reputation a publisher has in the market. The author is the best ambassador to convey this image both to the market and to other authors looking for publishers. It is word of mouth, not advances, that brings new authors into a publishers fold. A satisfied author, who will not switch to another publisher merely because of a slightly higher advance, is what every publisher is looking for to build a list. Publishers have realized that a happy author is their biggest asset; and if this means a little pampering to let him play his hour on the stage, why not?

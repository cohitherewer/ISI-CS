	 Maharashtra is turning out to be quite a minefield for the Congress. The post-poll uncertainty is the chief worry, and it has invited the concern of no less than Manmohan Singh who is usually not too keen on interfering in intra-party affairs. As expected, the good doctor has his own prescription, and this calls for batting for the Union minister, Sushil Kumar Shinde, who is also the head of the partys campaign committee in Maharashtra. Singhs calculation is that Shindes projection can win the Congress the support of the weaker sections, and counter the threat from the Nationalist Congress Partys Chhagan Bhujbal. But not everyone is willing to read Singhs sudden interest in Shinde on such simple terms. Many believe that Singhs prescription is for an entirely different ailment. Apparently, the PM wants Shinde to be shifted from the power ministry where reforms have not taken off in spite of the PMs express wishes to accelerate them. Shindes stature is what is preventing a direct action. Hence the maha-formula.                
	 Another formula is at work in Maharashtra. Sharad Pawar is said to be trying hard to convince his political ally to accept his daughter, Supriya Sule, as the bearer of his mantle. If the plan gets off the ground, one may see Sule assuming the chief ministership of the state, and the NCP quietly agreeing to a merger with the Congress. The buzz is that the nitty-gritty is being worked out. But then the spoilers are also at work. Pawars legacy is being claimed by his nephew, Ajit Pawar, who, unlike Sule, is an old hand at politics. So expect more Pawar-play.                            
	 Lovers of Hindi are extremely upset with the United Progressive Alliance governments disinterest in promoting the national language at the international level. The ministry of external affairs was assigned the task to lobby for Hindi as the seventh official language at the United Nations. But the one hundred crore project has not made much headway. As part of the programme, the ministry was supposed to have lobbied for Hindi in 50 countries. Activists feel that one major reason for the lack of an aggressive drive is the absence of Hindi-speaking ministers in the ministry. Neither SM Krishna nor his predecessors went beyond the routine to promote Hindi internationally.                             
	 Kapil Sibals Midas touch seems to be failing, particularly in his effort at modernizing madrasas. The Union human resource development ministry has revived its proposal to set up a national madrasa board to assist and modernize thousands of educational institutions that focus primarily on religious education. But the All India Muslim Personal Law Board is not too happy with the move as it fears that State funding may harm the thrust on religion. When the HRD ministry sent a proposal to the AIMPLB, the board quickly returned it, asking for its Urdu translation. Now, copies of the translated version have been sent to dozens of board members across the country, but that is no guarantee that the board will change its mind anytime soon.                             
	 An epic battle is on at the Jawaharlal Nehru University between two grandsons. Rahul Gandhis surprise visit to JNU proved to be a shot in the arm for the National Students Union of India, the student wing of the Congress. Now, the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad wants Varun Gandhi to work the same magic for it. Hectic efforts are already on and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh has been sounded out to prevail upon top Bharatiya Janata Party leaders to sanction Varuns visit to the university. Varun himself is said to be keen to interact, although he is unlikely to offer anything close to the Pilibhit flavour. Some say this, surely, will disappoint the ABVP.                             
	 The grapevine has it that the PM is upset with Praful Patel, and is of the opinion that the two strikes in two major airlines are proof of Patels mismanagement. It is also being said that the civil aviation minister is no longer enamoured of the UPA, and his disinterest created the crises. Is it then time to touch ground Mr Patel?

	 Shock waves ran down Srinagar when balloons bearing the lotus symbol and LK Advanis mugshots went up in the air one Friday morning. But if the people were surprised, members of the National Conference-Congress government were doubly so. It turned out that the BJP had no hand in the act. The balloons had been released by children participating in the inaugural ceremony of the 55th national school games. The most embarrassed person was the Congress minister for sports and youth services, RS Chib. Not only did he have to watch the balloons but it also became clear that his department had supplied the balloons without checking the fine print.

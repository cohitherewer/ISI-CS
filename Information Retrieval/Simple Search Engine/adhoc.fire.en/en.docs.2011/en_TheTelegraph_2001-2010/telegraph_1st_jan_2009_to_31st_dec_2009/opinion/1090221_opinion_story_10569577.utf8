The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Familiar formula
                                                                                                                 FAMILIAR FORMULA                                  Agatha Christie, matriarch of the murder mystery, has never received critical acclaim consonant with her popular success in theatres. On stage, too, in India her plays have appeared only occasionally. One reason for this apparent neglect is that, frankly, she wrote very few perfect dramas. Something or the other always gets in the way of our full appreciation. In the case of The Unexpected Guest, produced by Stagecraft, she followed the formula too scrupulously, tossing suspicion on every character turn by predictable turn. Second, since we all know the whodunnit clich about the least likely suspect, we can spot the probable culprit pretty early on. Third, with a title like that, Christie inexplicably presented a dead giveaway. Considering these drawbacks, Rohit Pombra directs it acceptably and enacts the titular role with a credibly feigned objective detachment. Rajorshi Bose stands out among the others as the murdered mans rather scary mentally-challenged brother. Everyone else plays their parts as required, though Ritika Singh, the waif-like widow and self-proclaimed killer, should not wait next to the body for so long at the beginning as if prepared, because the visitors entrance is, after all, unexpected.

	Strange turmoil        
	Turmoil, when represented, can assume strange shapes. In the paintings of Jonaki Pal, it takes the form of a jumble of lines in which decapitated bodies and dismembered organs are trapped (Gallery Exposure, till February 28). Pal makes intelligent use of colours. Screaming shades of pink or red are juxtaposed with black or grey and sometimes outlined with a bleak, watery white. The effect is one of rawness, as if the body has been cut open and exposed to the viewers eye. In an untitled painting, a red mouth lined with blackened teeth scream at the centre of a dark triangle with pink borders. Cups and saucers float absurdly on the margins, and a pale, incongruous flower is tucked into the left-hand corner. If colours denote moods, then the painting, Golden peaks, signals a change from the tortuous emotions that seem to break out of the other canvases. Here, suddenly, is a proliferation of yellow, gold and white. Patches of turquoise standing for blobs of cloud lie gathered at the foot of the glowing triangles. There is again a shock of motley colours in I must win. Taxis and buses, which look like glow-worms, seem to move round in circles in a patch of green. There is a lonely road, emptied of the moving vehicles, leading out of the maze to some place beyond the frame.

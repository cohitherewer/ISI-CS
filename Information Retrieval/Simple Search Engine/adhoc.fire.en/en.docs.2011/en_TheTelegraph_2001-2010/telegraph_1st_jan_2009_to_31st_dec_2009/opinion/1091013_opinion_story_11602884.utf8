	Untimely honour                  
	Sir  By awarding the Nobel peace prize to Barack Obama, the Nobel committee has reached the nadir of silliness, and scaled new heights of twisted political correctness (Audacity of Nobel, Oct 10). Many Nobel awards, especially the ones for peace, often come laced with controversies about the candidates, but giving the prize to Obama is downright absurd. Here is a man, who so far, in the very short time he has been the president of the United States of America, has done nothing concrete about any issue, although he has been talking a lot.          
	The dream of a world free of nuclear weapons is hardly a new one. Obama has waxed eloquent about it, asking all nations to strive to destroy such weapons. But has his own nation taken the lead in any way, except by keeping a disarmament balance with Russia? Greeting an applauding Arab audience in their own language during a tour of West Asia has not resulted in peace there. The need for a Palestinian State is not Obamas original idea, and so far there has been no active sign to suggest how he means to carry it out. Obamas scrapping of a proposed European missile shield was only a rollback of a policy by the Bush administration, and once again, it turned out to be primarily a US-Russia matter.          
	Given this track record of ten months, it is baffling as well as amusing when the Nobel committee praises Obamas extraordinary efforts. Giving the Nobel peace prize for good intentions, without a single achievement as such, is farcical. Obama has a brilliant speech-writer, he is an excellent orator, and has charisma. He may have awed people with his speeches, but sincere-sounding, hope-tinged words and assertive body language are hardly the criteria for getting the Nobel peace prize. In his response to the prize, Obama mentioned the fact of millions of Americans being out of work. The Nobel peace prize is supposed to deal with universal issues, affecting people all over the world. The mention of unemployment problems in the US was a clever input for a domestic audience.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Barack Obama has done precious little to deserve a Nobel peace prize. He has undertaken no pathbreaking diplomatic initiatives that will stand the test of time. He has not yet resolved the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq. It would not be an exaggeration to say that he is the least accomplished of all those who have been given this award. The same prize was given to the Dalai Lama and Mother Teresa. However, by giving it to Obama, it has not only been devalued, but politicized as well.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Barack Obama assumed office a few months back, and has since then tried to assuage fears and apprehensions about the intentions of America, particularly in the Muslim world. He has attempted to engage with Iran, while leaving other nuclear powers like North Korea untouched. It is still too early to award the prestigious Nobel Prize to him. After all, he is yet to deliver something tangible on every count. It is uncertain how Iran will respond to his calls or how Obama will stop North Korea from pursuing its clandestine nuclear programmes. Pakistan remains a source of great worry, what with travel restrictions being lifted from people like Abdul Qadeer Khan. Obama has only agreed to engage with what George Bush had called the axis of evil  is one entitled to the Nobel Prize just by expression of intent? It seems as if the prize has been doled out to please a superpower.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The most incredible news of the year is Barack Obama winning Noble peace prize. How is it that without accomplishing much in diplomacy he could win such a prestigious award? It is understood that a winner should have achieved something real, and done solid work. Mother Teresa was a fitting candidate for the award; her selfless service to the poor spoke for itself. But Obama has not yet done anything worth mentioning. So is the award just a poke at George Bush? Or perhaps it has been inspired by other political intentions? Whatever the reason behind Obama getting the prize, it seems that the importance of hard work is steadily diminishing. Ordinary people, who are dedicated and faithful workers for social justice, remain unnoticed while celebrities keep getting rewarded.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  There could not have been a better headline than  Prize for Obama, surprise for world  (Oct 10) on the US president getting the Nobel Prize for peace. As debates continue, one cannot but admit that Obama is indeed a very noble person, as he made it clear he was both surprised and humbled by the decision of the Nobel committee, that he does not deserve to be in the company of so many transformative figures who have been honoured by this prize, that he would accept this award as a call to action, and that the award is not simply about the efforts of his administration, but about the efforts of people around the world. While Mahatma Gandhi was nominated for the peace prize five times, he could not get it. It is satisfying that at least one of his best-known admirers, who wants a nuclear-weapon-free world and people of all races and religions to co-exist peacefully, has got the honour.           
	Yours faithfully,

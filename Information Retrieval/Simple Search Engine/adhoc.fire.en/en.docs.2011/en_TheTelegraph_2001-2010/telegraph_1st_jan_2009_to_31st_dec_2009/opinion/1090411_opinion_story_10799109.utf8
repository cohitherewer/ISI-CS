	Cut out the excess                  
	Sir  These days, political parties are targeting the electronic media for publicity. It is not good to see parties that promise to provide quality education and food are wasting their money like this. A government that fails to provide proper midday meals is buying the rights for Jai Ho, and there is another party that is planning a counter-attack with Bhay ho. Few parties think it worth planning to make short films on their political agenda. In a country where millions are still below the poverty line, do we really need such campaigns?          
	Yours faithfully,

	Rolling on          
	Sir  A decade ago, when Lalu Prasad was the chief minister of Bihar, he announced in a public rally that he would make all the roads in Bihar like the cheeks of Hema Malini. But at this point of time, only the people of Bihar can judge whether the roads are like the cheeks of Basanti or of Samba. If Prasad had used the rollers properly to smoothen the roads things would have been different. But he is now threatening to crush Varun Gandhi under a roller for the latters alleged remarks against Muslims (Lalu jab, April 7). This is how politicians like Lalu Prasad play with democracy every five years.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Sudhir Mishra, Bhubaneswar 

                
	Sir  Lalu Prasad has now been issued a notice by the Election Commission for his public remarks on Varun Gandhis speech against Muslims. It is perhaps wiser to take Prasads comment as a joke, and not as a literal promise for action. It is only a veteran politicians humorous response to an improper statement by an immature politician who could one day become Indias prime minister. Lalus remark is perhaps in tune with what ordinary, right-thinking people feel about unnecessarily aggressive outbursts. Further, barking dogs seldom bite. If you want to kill somebody, would you announce it in advance?           
	Yours faithfully,

	Act fast          
	Sir  The number of cars on Guwahatis streets has increased exponentially in the last few years, leading to congestion, pollution and other human as well as environmental consequences.           
	One solution could be to have a metro-railways for the city. The line that could be used for it is the twin-track railway line that runs through the heart of the city. This would allow two lines going in opposite directions to run side by side. They would, of course, have to be elevated, so as not to impede traffic. This would entail making Kamakhya railway station the main railway station for all the inter-state and the inter-city trains. The present station could then serve as the main station for the metro, that is, for the intra-city trains. A bypass would have to be created for trains going to Lumdning and Dibrugarh.           
	These decisions should be taken as early as possible. First, because the Kamakhya station is being renovated. So making these changes now would mean less added costs. Second, if the decision is not taken now the long-term damage to this city will be catastrophic  ecologically, and in terms of its already-fragile infrastructure.           
	The Delhi metro has significantly decreased the number of cars on its roads, and led to a noticeable decrease in the pollution levels. There is no reason why this would also not happen in Guwahati. A city has to set new benchmarks and innovate rapidly. This once-beautiful city is getting uglier and more unlivable in every day. We have to think out of the box, and cosmetic changes are not enough.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
P.S. Guha, Guwahati

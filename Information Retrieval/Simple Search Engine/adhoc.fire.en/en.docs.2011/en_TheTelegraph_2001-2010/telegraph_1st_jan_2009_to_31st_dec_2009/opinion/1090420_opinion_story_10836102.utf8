	Uneven past, rocky present                  
	Sir  In With a past to honour (April 11), Ramachandra Guha mentions a few stalwarts  Surendranath Banerjee, Bipin Pal, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Gopal Krishna Gokhale and, of course, Mahatma Gandhi  who played an important part in building up Congress nationalism. But why does a renowned historian like Guha leave out Subhas Bose? Guha insists that despite the present condition of the Congress, its past makes it one of the greatest political parties of the world with a record comparable to that of the Labour Party of Britain, the Social Democratic Party of Germany and the Democratic Party in the United States of America. He papers over the ugly episodes that have besmirched the partys reputation. Take the unceremonious removal of Bose as party president or Indira Gandhis imposition of the Emergency. Guha forgets that the Congress has not always been true to democratic principles throughout its history.           
	Despite Rabindranath Tagores profound influence on the Congress, it is Gandhi whose influence has lasted. His principles of simple living and high thinking continue to guide Indian politicians, particularly in Bengal. Guha holds Congress nationalists in high regard, but underplays the contribution of the socialist revolutionaries led by Jayaprakash Narayan to Indias political ethos.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  There is no doubt in my mind regarding the greatness of Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru, and the role played by the Congress in the liberation of India. But there is no reason to expect the same excellence from Nehrus descendants, because lineage alone does not ensure quality. It might be admitted, then, that it is the fear of the Bharatiya Janata Party, and not the success of Congress politics that is forcing secular Indians to stay together. The BJP is trying to create further divisions. This is evident from L.K. Advanis letters written to leaders of all faiths, promising all a voice in governance (BJP offers power to religion, April 12). He does not realize that communalism, like feudalism, has run its course. The Congresss policy of appeasement, too, deserves notice. Take the Haj subsidy, which benefits the rich in the minority community, while the economically backward in the same community seldom receive government help.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Unique voices          
	Sir  The report, Nothing to lose but deposit (March 15), on independent candidates proves that India gives its citizens the constitutional right to participate in a peoples democracy, not a party democracy. The independent candidates play a viable role in the panchayat, municipality and local body elections. In most cases, they are defeated, but this does not mean they are rejected by the people. The lack of funding and organization make it impossible for them to compete against party candidates.           
	Independent candidates often raise unique issues that provoke much more debate than the banal manifestos of political parties. Their presence and participation help voters to think while parties merely brainwash the electorate. Almost 35 per cent of voters do not vote, mostly because of the antipathy and disillusion caused by political parties. This figure may increase if there is no candidate espousing causes distinct from those championed by party leaders. Independent candidates are no spoilers as the prime minister would have us believe. The real spoilers are the regional parties on which the prime ministers party depends. They destabilize the government by their tendency to bargain and blackmail.           
	Yours faithfully,

	In knee-deep          
	Sir  I am a state government employee posted at Gosaba. A few days ago, on my way back home from Gosaba, I had to walk across the Matla river in Canning with two colleagues through the knee deep water. There is no ferry service during ebb-tide. While crossing the river and the muddy fields after that, we decided that we would not pay the ferry charges demanded at the ghat as a mark of protest. This money is collected by persons representing the lessee of the ghat. When we refused to pay, the men started abusing us and threatened they would not let us go if we did not pay. With the incident gradually turning into a contest of muscle power, we paid up, against our conscience. We eventually took a paid boat, but could not forget the humiliation. Lakhs of people, mostly poor daily labourers and peasants, cross the Matla daily through Canning Ghat and are forced to pay ferry charges although they do not use the ferry during ebb-tide, when the lessee does not run the service because of insufficient water.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Subrata Das, Calcutta

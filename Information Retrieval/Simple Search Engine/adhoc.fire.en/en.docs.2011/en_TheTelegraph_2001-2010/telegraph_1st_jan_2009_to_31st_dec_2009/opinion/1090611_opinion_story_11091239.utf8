The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Whither Europe?
                                                                                                                 WHITHER EUROPE?                                                    
	European polls? Who he? This seems to be the general attitude all over the European Union to the recently concluded elections to the European Parliament. Most Europeans are too busy protecting their jobs and savings to bother very much about the existence of a European Parliament, let alone ponder the idea of Europe as an exciting political reality. Wouldnt such an idea mean letting the Poles and Gypsies invade ones country, over and above the Asians and the Islamic fundamentalists, and take away the remaining jobs? Besides, who are these Members of the European Parliament anyway, but self-important, pin-striped politicians shuttling superfluously between Brussels and Strasbourg because they havent quite made it in their own countries and are waiting for the Treaty of Lisbon to give to their existence a little more purpose? These elections happen every five years, and this year the turnout was a record low of 43 per cent. But those who did bother to vote are trying to say something that their own countries as well as the EU would do well to heed.        
	European voters have voted out the democratic socialism of Europes centre-left parties and turned to the centre-right, bolstered by extremist and other fringe (mostly green) formations, for security in these uncertain times. Champions of mass political progress over the past century, like the German Social Democratic, the Dutch Labour and the British Labour parties, have all performed wretchedly, as have centre-left governments in power in Spain, Portugal, Hungary and Austria. And in many of these countries, rightwing, nationalist and often xenophobic parties have crept up the ladder of representation in the European Parliament. Britain is perhaps the most spectacular example. Gordon Brown, the British prime minister, has just about managed to stem rebellion in his own Labour party, which has suffered its worst national election results since 1918. The Conservatives have topped the poll in Britain, with the transnational conservative coalition, the European Peoples Party, emerging the largest and most influential grouping in the new European legislature. But the alarming fallout of the Labour catastrophe is the far-right and racist British National Party gaining two parliamentary seats and 6.2 per cent of the national vote. Here too, the national, rather than European, implications seem to matter more, making the European polls not much more than mid-term national elections.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Letters to Editor
                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Hardly for the people                  
	Sir  The article, A sorry state of affairs (Sept 19), about the lavish amounts spent from the public exchequer on government advertisements proclaiming its achievements, was thought-provoking. It was impossible not to correlate the contents of the article with the quarter-page coloured advertisement of the South Eastern Railway  carrying a picture of the railways minister  that appeared in The Telegraph the next day. The function of that advertisement may appear obvious to some. But it may also seem intriguing to others.          
	Yours faithfully,        Tapan Lal Dasgupta, Calcutta
        
	False spirit          
	Sir  V. Kumara Swamys feature, High priests at low ebb (Sept 20), explored all the factors that have contributed to an overall decline in the quality of priests performing rituals during the Durga Puja, especially in the community pujas. But the article has left out the financial aspect, which is the most important factor in this context. People often do not feel the need to be suitably prepared for executing the duties of a priest because the job does not pay very well. Moreover, the purohits hardly command the respect of people, other than of some elderly ladies. The organizers of community pujas often treat the priests with contempt. Swamy has rightly said that the major part of the priests earnings comes from the daily offerings to the goddess. But such offerings are mainly in kind  fruits, sweetmeats, saris, alta and sindur, and sometimes, bedding and cosmetics. Many of these have no resale value as they are ersatz, especially made for the occasion, and not for use in real life. If the Hindu society wants an improvement in the standards of its pujas, then it in general, and the community puja organizers in particular, need to pay the purohits more  at least, the amount that a skilled and educated worker would earn in five days.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Tapan Pal, Batanagar 

      
	Sir  Can monetary rewards be the incentive for organizing a Durga Puja in the true spirit? It appears that a True Spirit Puja cannot be arranged without enticing the organizers with lucrative prizes. After West Bengal had been hit by both the recession and the Aila, I was hoping that the spendings on Puja themes would be cut down for a more productive and constructive use of that money. However, it seems that no one is bothered.           
	After dashami, people will throw the idols into the Ganga and pollute it. If this is the fate of our goddess, then is it not better to worship her through our work rather than by showing off? A celebration can be successful only if everyone participates. But I do not think the Aila victims will be able to enjoy the Puja. People nowadays attach more importance to themes than to the spirit of dedication and worship. The bonding of people during the Pujas and respect for the deeper significance of the goddesss presence are gradually fading away. It is sad that people hanker after prizes, completely forgetting some sections of the society during the festivities.          
	Yours faithfully,        Amrita Mallik, Calcutta      Parting shot					  
	Sir  People gossip because they enjoy it (Kiss and dont tell, Sept 13). Quite often they get some required information, or the truth about life and social behaviour from gossips. Gossips are mostly harmless, but sometimes there can be facts hidden behind them. Gossiping is an art. In general, it is a light-hearted exchange of words. But sometimes, a serious matter is presented in a lighter vein. The popularity of gossip can be gauged from the prevalence of the newspapers, magazines and television channels that dish out juicy Bollywood tales.          
	Yours faithfully,         Mahesh Kapasi, New Delhi

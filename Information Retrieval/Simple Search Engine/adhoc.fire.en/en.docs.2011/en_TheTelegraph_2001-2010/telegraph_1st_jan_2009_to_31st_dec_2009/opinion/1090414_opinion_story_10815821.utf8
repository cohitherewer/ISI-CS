                                                                                                                 ONE LANGUAGE FOR MANY PEOPLE                                   FORKED TONGUE      Indians will gain by resisting political attempts to oust the English language                                                        
	The Encyclopedia Britannica Year Book 2008 gives the linguistic composition of India thus: Hindi 27.58 per cent; Bengali 8.22 per cent; Telugu 7.8 per cent; Marathi 7.38 per cent; Tamil 6.26 per cent; Urdu 5.13 per cent; Gujarati 4.81 per cent; Kannada 3.87 per cent; Malayalam 3.59 per cent; Oriya 3.22 per cent; Punjabi 2.76 per cent; Assamese 1.55 per cent; Bhili/Bhilodi 0.25 per cent; Santhali 0.62 per cent; Kashmiri 0.47 per cent; Gondi, Sindhi and Nepali 0.25 per cent each; Konkani 0.21 per cent; Tulu 0.18 per cent; Kurukh 0.17 per cent; Manipuri 0.15 per cent; Bodo 0.14 per cent; Khandeshi 0.12 per cent; Others 3.26 per cent. It also informs that 66 per cent of Indians speak Hindi and 19 per cent know and speak English, the lsquo;foreign rsquo; language.  
	The above figures clearly show that 27.42 per cent of the non-Hindi speakers have voluntarily chosen to follow Hindi, the language of 38.58 per cent Indians. The statistics also indicate that a sizeable number of non-English-speaking Indians is taking to the language of the British.  
	What would happen if leaders vow to work against the use of English in education and in computers to take the country forward? Has anyone thought of the possible ramifications of such an absurd proposition? Indians seeking mandate from the people should desist from inciting unrest because of the existence of several faultlines in Indian society. Leaders need to take lessons from past follies: how can one forget the language riots that took place in the recent past?        
	Indians must remember that the nation-building process has no place for dogma, inflexibility and rigid ideology. Those who are speaking of banning English would do well to remember that even during the 19th century, Sir Syed Ahmad Khan defied all opposition to propound the necessity of English education.        
	The price that one pays for eschewing English can be seen in West Bengal today. The Bengalis, who once reaped the benefit of English education, have made a monumental mistake by ignoring the foreign language for the sake of the vernacular medium.         
	Meanwhile, the ultra-conservative Chinese went all out to ensure the success of the Beijing Olympics by arming themselves with the knowledge of English. Today, Indians are teaching English in China as well as in the West. If India were to discard the English advantage, one would surely find thousands of Chinese teaching English all over the globe ten years from now.        
	Since elections bring Indians closer to their prospective rulers, they witness fantastic proposals and grandiose schemes that promise to uplift the people. Seen in this light, the demand for a separate Dalit regiment in the army, for instance, is not surprising. But what if similar demands are raised by other groups too? Not too long ago, the former Gujarat chief minister, Keshubhai Patel, L.K. Advani and Narendra Modi had demanded a separate Gujarat regiment. Fortunately, the idea was shot down by the then chief of army staff, General V.P. Malik, who felt that the army could not be divided on linguistic lines. Indians  voters and netas  stand to gain from understanding the importance of unity. They should shun divisive utterances and remain united.                          ABHIJIT BHATTACHARYYA

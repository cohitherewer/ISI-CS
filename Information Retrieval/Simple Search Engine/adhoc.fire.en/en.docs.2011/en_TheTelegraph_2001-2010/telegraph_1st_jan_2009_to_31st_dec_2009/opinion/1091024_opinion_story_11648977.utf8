                                                                                                                 WHAT IS LEFT UNSAID                              Uddalak Mukherjee      Visual Arts                                                      
	The photography exhibition, Face Up (Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre, Oct 10-22), brought together the works of two photographers, Sunil Gupta and Anna Fox. Gupta and Fox showed their work together perhaps for two reasons. Both photographers employ the portraiture style, and their images are bound thematically. The photographs are intended to be visual metaphors of truths that demand to be confronted.        
	Guptas photographs form a part of a series called Mr Malhotras Party. They comprise frontal shots of men and women, who pose in different locations in Delhi. This project, we are told, differs from his Exiles Series, which included photographs of unknown gay men in Delhis architectural spaces. Here, we are reminded that Guptas subjects  people we would understand as being lesbian, gay or bisexual  are willing to be identified. This, apparently, marks a significant shift in gay politics in India.        
	It is one thing that Guptas photographs are quite unremarkable. What is equally worrying is that the idea, as the form, is lacking in complex thinking. Each portrait suggests a three-tiered relationship, among the subject, the viewer, and the photographer. But Gupta disturbs the inner parity by establishing inflexible parameters of viewing queer as a visual space which is actually a complex phenomenon. Is Guptas approach the only way of looking at, and understanding, homosexuality? And what is it that Gupta wants us to see? Isnt this kind of identification potentially hazardous, as it can re-establish iniquitous notions of otherness? Gupta perhaps should think about why he chose not to depict lesbians, gays and bisexuals for what they are: citizens with one kind of sexual orientation.         
	Guptas claim that the portraits are a sign-post of empowerment for a marginalized people is as hollow as his photographs. His subjects are urban, seemingly upwardly mobile, and relatively affluent. Empowerment of a sexual minority, in Guptas scheme of things, is decidedly elitist, and hence limited in scope. Finally, can a few random shots of men and women (Kaushiki, picture, below) standing in and around Delhi, and looking straight into the camera, signify the end of a longstanding, cruel inequality, one that permeates Indias legal, social and cultural practices?        
	Anna Foxs intelligent and haunting images thus come as a relief after Gupta. Foxs work brings together photographs that have been taken over a nine-year period, and belong to three different series: Zwarte Piet (Black Pete), Country Girls and Back to the Village. The settings differ, and not every photograph is a portrait. Yet the vignettes capture the hidden purpose behind dressing up and performing. The two acts are meant to convey how truth, and bits and pieces of history, are camouflaged to resist accommodation in the collective consciousness.        
	Zwarte Piet portrays white women and children (picture,top) dressed as dignitaries, but with blackened, impassive faces. The re-enactment of a Dutch tradition during Christmas  Saint Nicholas arriving on a boat with his retinue of black servants known as Zwarte Piet  involves an ingenious switch in colour, but the images force us to acknowledge a historic injustice. There is also the eerie image of a smiling girl, her head partially covered by a scarf, sitting on a mat in a misty field, with two (dead?) roosters in Country Girls. There is a subtle hint of violence and repression that raises uncomfortable questions about an idyllic life in the country. The photographs in Back to the Village are also about masquerades: people are seen participating in innocent, bucolic rituals but the subjects distorted poses and the cluttered settings convey a twistedness that chills the viewer.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | all the hoops
                                                                                                                 ALL THE HOOPS                                                    
	Genetic modification has opened up exciting opportunities, but human reactions to them vary enormously. Americans run trials for utilization risks more or less simultaneously with the development of a modified organism. Europeans shun genetically modified products like the plague. Indians have their own homegrown way of confronting the novelties. They set up a pyramid of committees, all the way from run-of-the-mill biologists to the Grand Union Cabinet, and make a GM product run a hurdle race across them. The committees beyond the lowest couple are pointless; they are populated by ignoramuses who more or less rubber-stamp the decision of the lowest committees. But the structure addresses four inbuilt Indian principles. The first is not to trust anyone. The second is to diffuse responsibility amongst as many people as possible. The third is to take everything to the highest level. The last is to take as long as possible over everything. All these desiderata have been fulfilled four times over, and Bt brinjal is kosher at last.        
	The only other product, which jumped through all these hoops, Bt cotton, has transformed the Indian cotton landscape. India was a marginal producer of mostly second-rate cotton. The advent of Bt cotton enabled India to triple its production, and to find a market abroad. India has not derived as much benefit from it as it might have because the countrys textile industry is spineless. But Bt cotton has been a godsend for farmers. Bt aubergine will not be such a record-breaker. The annual output value of aubergine is a fraction of cottons; and it is not exported at all. Bt aubergine is more resistant to pests; so its adoption will lead to a doubling or tripling of output even if the area under it does not increase. But aubergine is not such a prized vegetable; nor does it have close substitutes. As its costs come down, its price will collapse; but that will not lead to a significant expansion of its consumption. It may find a small market in the Middle East where there is a large Indian population; that apart, the prospects of export are not bright. So the most likely outcome is shrinkage in area under brinjal.        
	However, that will open up an opportunity for innovation. Who knows what undiscovered properties reside in and what promising chemicals can be extracted from aubergine? If it were to be found to contain an anti-cancer drug, it would find a vast market. Now is the time for bright young scientists to gird their loins and set about working on brinjal. Meanwhile, the example of aubergine illustrates a more general principle, that the more open the worlds agricultural markets are, the greater the promise of innovations like Bt products. India should reverse its traditional opposition to the liberalization of world agricultural markets and stop being an ally of such protectionists as Europe and Japan.

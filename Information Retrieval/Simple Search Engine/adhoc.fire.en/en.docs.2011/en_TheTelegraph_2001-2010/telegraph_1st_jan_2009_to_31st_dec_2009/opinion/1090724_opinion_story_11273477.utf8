The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | still fuming
                                                                                                                 STILL FUMING                                                    
	For all their differences, the government and the Opposition in West Bengal have one thing in common. They seem to be perpetually conspiring to make life miserable for the common people. The threat of an indefinite transport strike shows once again how a callous government and an irresponsible Opposition can together hold peoples lives to ransom. Yet the issue on which the transport operators have called the strike leaves little room for debate. Calcutta has a disastrous level of air pollution, thanks to the foul fumes emitted by the old vehicles that ply its streets. That such vehicles have been allowed to run so long should have been enough proof of the governments inefficiency. The corruption in the departments that are supposed to monitor the state of the vehicles is public knowledge. Repeated interventions by the judiciary had earlier failed to push Writers Buildings into taking decisive action. The government faces an ultimatum by the Calcutta High Court to ban all 15-year-old vehicles from August 1. The trade union tyranny that now confronts the government is a legacy of the Lefts own politics of blackmail in another time.         
	However, the government has only one option now  to act firmly and comply with the courts order. The peoples right to breathe less polluted, if not fresh, air must not be surrendered to an inept government, its cynical rivals or oppressive trade unions. The ruling Marxists themselves have been the worst offenders in terms of irresponsible trade unionism. How his government deals with the transport operators threat is one more test that the chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, cannot afford to fail. It is also his opportunity to redeem the image of his government, which lies shattered on so many fronts. For his rival, Mamata Banerjee, the strike comes barely three days after she publicly promised to leave behind years of streetfighting and graduate to constructive politics. Some of her party colleagues lead the transport operators unions. They see the strike as another opportunity to settle scores with the Marxist government. Her partys role in the strike should indicate whether the people can take her promise of constructive politics seriously. If she supports the strike, the message will go out that she remains as unreformed and unchangeable as her Marxist adversaries. But then, the people get not just the government but also the Opposition they deserve.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | readiness is all
                                                                                                                 READINESS IS ALL                                                    
	Do not panic, wait, watch and be ready for the worst. That seems to be the thing to do with Influenza A at the moment  and it is all right to state the obvious when a pandemic is possibly imminent. But it is also true that the six people suspected to have brought the flu into India have all tested negative. However, the fact that they were screened off, tested and then released is reassuring. It shows that there is, this time, some sort of a system in place and it seems to be working. This is what it should be like everywhere in the country  and Calcutta should be no exception. At the airport, everyone must cooperate  passengers, doctors, paramedical and immigration personnel. The screening should work efficiently and without harassing those who pass through it. The wards in the hospitals for treating infectious diseases to which the flu suspects are taken must also be prepared to be civilized: the people who come are not offenders or crime suspects, but ill, or possibly ill, people who need careful medical attention. China seems to have incarcerated, in various hotels, a significant number of Mexicans almost all of whom show no signs of the flu. This sort of thing is better avoided.         
	In a country like India, especially during a heat wave, it would not be difficult to find people with symptoms that would be perfectly innocuous in other times, but could now indicate Influenza A. So levelheadedness and restraint must also be there with vigilance and efficiency. It is important that all governments treat this as a medical, rather than an economic, emergency. Even if certain inevitable measures prove to be bad for the economy, they should nevertheless be taken. A pandemic is still not out of the question, although level-six panic is premature. But preparedness is all. So facilitating the testing of suspects, keeping stocks of medicine ready and channels of communication open are the priorities.

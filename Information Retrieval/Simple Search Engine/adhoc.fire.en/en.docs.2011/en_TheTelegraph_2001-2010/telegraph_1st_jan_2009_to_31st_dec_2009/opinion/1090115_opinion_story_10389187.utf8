                                                                                                                 MIXED REPORT                                                    
	Nowhere are quantity and quality more problematically entwined than in the sphere of education. How does a nation of Indias size and complexity measure its development through a progress in schoolgoing? The Annual Status of Education Report 2008, brought out by an NGO, offers a set of findings after surveying 3.35 lakh rural households across 564, out of 583, districts. The first thing that the report renders problematic is any simple idea of progress or linear improvement. It shows that the number of children staying out of school is continuing to fall, as in the last couple of years. This is definitely a kind of improvement, particularly when certain traditionally backward states are looked at more closely. However, this quantitative finding that more and more children are going and remaining in school is then counterpointed by a worrying, and more qualitative, trend. These schoolgoing children seem to be able to read and perform basic mathematical operations less well than before. Given the United Progressive Alliances increased spending on education, how is one to assess the consequences of this spending? Obviously, something is going wrong in what the children are learning. Instead of spending more on infrastructure, should a significant sum of money be spent on teaching the teachers? Teaching children to recognize letters, read texts (in the vernacular and in English) and to deal with numbers is more difficult than the State thinks, and the basics of pedagogy have to be thought through again.        
	The states have also shown surprising results, upsetting some connections that are usually made unthinkingly. Narendra Modis Vibrant Gujarat has been showing a consistent fall in most learning indicators, often falling below the national average in both literacy and numeracy. But Bihar has shown a remarkable improvement in sending both girls and boys to school and preventing them from dropping out. So have Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, dramatically improving numeracy, compared to Kerala, the legendarily educated state, which has shown a decline in numeracy. Private school enrolment has also increased significantly. The links among government funding, development and the actual enhancement of learning are necessarily complicated.

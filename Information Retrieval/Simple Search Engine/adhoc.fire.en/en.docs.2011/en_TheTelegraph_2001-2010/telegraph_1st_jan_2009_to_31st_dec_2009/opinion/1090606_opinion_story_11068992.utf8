	Gallery K2s tribute to the Buddha (May 9-May 30) on his birth anniversary was a rather strange melange of paintings (nine artists) that turned Sakyamuni into a calendar deity with sculpted features and a pretty, epicene smile that had none of the serenity and peace one associates with this enlightened human being who never wanted to be deified. It had some bizarre likenesses of the Buddha, with, as in the case of Subuddha Ghosh, the countryside with a field of yellow corn showing through his robes. Sanatan Dindas trompe-lil proved his skill but had no relevance to the theme. Puzzlingly, Katayun Saklat had turned the Buddha into a pair of women with bouffant-like hairdos, one wonders why. Brotin Khans Buddhas were a series of beautiful boys amidst lotus bloom, Ajanta-like, but without the magic and strength of the cave paintings. Ramkumar Mannas terracotta figure with a girdle of rivers, however, had dignity. So did the rather fierce-looking Buddha heads in Atin Basaks etchings. As a work of art, only Tapas Kumar Dass canvas qualified as something worth serious thought. A few hasty lines depicted the Buddha walking along like any pedestrian, and looking at him was a passerby, a nude man in red  Everyman startled by an amazing presence.

	Ode to Krishna        
	Kolkata Mayur Lalit Dance Academy presented Raaslila, an Odissi dance ballet at Rabindra Sadan on May 24. Divided into two parts, the evening began with traditional mangalacharan, an invocation to Lord Jagannath by the young students of the institution. It was followed by Nachanti Range Shri Hari, a number depicting the gorgeous and graceful dance of Krishna, utilizing nimble footwork and intricate rhythmic pattern. The last item of the first half of the evening was pallavi based on raga Hamsadhwani. Raaslila is one of the many song sequences that make up the corpus of padabali kirtan. To revive the popularity of kirtan, Debamitra conceived and choreographed the ballet in an experimental manner. It began with an ode to Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu where srikhol players from Nabadweep created an appropriate ambience. The dance drama was intertwined with melodious songs by Seema Acharya Chowdhury. The duet sequence of khol and pakhawaj, each representing a woman and a man respectively, was enjoyable. Debamitra as Krishna was convincing with her bold movements while Amrita Das as Radha was pleasing and graceful.

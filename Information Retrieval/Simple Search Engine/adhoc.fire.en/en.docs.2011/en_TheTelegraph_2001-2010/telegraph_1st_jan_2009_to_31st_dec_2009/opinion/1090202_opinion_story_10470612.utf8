	If numbers are anything to go by, then the recently concluded provincial elections in Iraq should be hailed as staggeringly successful. In 14 of the 18 provincial councils that went to polls last Saturday, unprecedented numbers turned up to exercise their democratic rights. In the Sunni-dominated Anbar province, for instance, around 60 per cent of the electorate came out to vote  an amazing improvement on the less than 2 per cent turn-out in the last provincial elections in 2005. It is equally heartening that more than 14,000 candidates have contested the polls this time, with close to 4,000 being women (there is a mandatory 30 per cent representation of women by laws governing the provincial elections). This time, more than 400 parties are contesting 444 seats, once again a stupendous 75 per cent increase from 2005. Although the outcome of these elections do not have a direct influence on the central government, they would still be an important landmark in the career of Nuri al-Maliki, the prime minister. Free and fair regional polls would not only bolster the credibility of his cabinet, but also create a platform for the emerging nationalists, trying hard to rise above the old-guard exiles installed by the Western powers in the aftermath of Saddam Husseins downfall. These elections are, in more ways than one, going to decentralize the structure of power and accountability that presides over Iraq now.        
	The most visible change from these polls, however, is the steadily retreating shadow of the United States of America. Even a shoe in the face was not enough for George W. Bush to concede a moral defeat in Iraq. But his successor, Barack Obama, has minced no words. Iraq, as he has said, is not his war and his government is simply unwilling to foot a billion-dollar bill every year for a cause that has been lost long back. Prudence in the time of economic crisis makes sense, although it leaves the question of nation-building in Iraq unresolved. So, regardless of the fate of the provincial leaders, American troops are ready to go. Not that the US has much choice left, after the trail of blunders it has left behind. Even earlier this month, the Blackwater security agency, which was given a lucrative contract by the committee appointed to reconstruct Iraq, killed 17 civilians. Given this state of disaffection, and Iraqs deepening friendship with Syria and Iran, Mr Obama has acted wisely for the sake of his nation  though where this leaves Iraq is another matter.

                                                                                                                 BLOODY ACT                                                     
	Killings in the name of a secessionist movement are not new in Indias Northeast. But the carnage in a village near Tezpur in Assam comes as a grim warning to both New Delhi and Dispur. It shows that the banned National Democratic Front of Bodoland is far from a defeated force. True, a major faction of the outfit now favours a dialogue with the government. But another faction, which is opposed to any peace talks, seems desperate to scuttle such moves at any cost. The tragedy at Tezpur is thus, to a large extent, intended to be this factions show of strength. It is usually of no concern to these militant outfits in the region if innocent people die in the battle for factional supremacy. Ranjan Daimary, the leader of the group that perpetrated the Tezpur killings, was expelled from the parent organization last year following the serial blasts that killed about 90 people. Of course, such killer groups do not need mass support. Their ability to strike at the police or innocent people is no measure of their popularity. They operate very much like small but deadly bands of outlaws, using their secessionist demands as cover.        
	For the administration, though, the killings show how ill-prepared it is to prevent such outrages. On Assam Police Day a few days ago, the chief minister, Tarun Gogoi, warned policemen that the NDFB was still a threat. Unfortunately, this knowledge did nothing to prevent the bloodbath in Tezpur. Mr Gogoi had an opportunity in the NDFB split to strike harder at the anti-talks faction. It now seems that his administration does not have enough intelligence on the activities or hideouts of the group. Success in the battle against insurgent groups depends largely on effective intelligence-gathering. It is known that some of the militant groups use bases in Myanmar, China or Bangladesh. But the challenge is to bust their networks and support bases inside Assam.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Experiments in style and content
                                                                                                                 EXPERIMENTS IN STYLE AND CONTENT                              THEATRE      Ananda Lal                                                        
	Among regular Bengali playwrights, Sekhar Samaddar has made an impact in recent years for consistently experimenting with content and style, as in his current works: E Maya-kajal by Ekush Shatak and Bhalobasa Bharatbarsha by his own troupe, Abhaash. He posits an intriguing situation in E Maya-kajal, that a man stops recognizing people intimately known to him when he senses their dishonesty or that they have deceived him. The protagonist, an otherwise normal man with a seemingly happy family, first fails to identify an old friend, then a woman who claims he was her lover, and even his own wife (whom we find is having an affair with his colleague behind his back). Indeed, he mistakes his wife as the con-woman and nearly throttles her in a highly charged scene (picture). He communicates easily only with his young daughter. Naturally, he must undergo treatment for what the shrink diagnoses as a psychosomatic disease of our times. Having conceived this unusual condition, though, Samaddar relaxes his grip on it after the interval, unable to drive it home forcefully. The end comes too quick, and becomes too facile, rosy and tame. But Apurba Roy convincingly depicts the man as a simple, confused soul withdrawing into a dream world. Enakshi Sen and Turna Das perform credibly as his unfaithful wife and innocent daughter. Adhir Basu directs the switchovers well; for instance, the con-woman plays the wifes role when the husband sees the hypocrisy in his spouse. The scenes in the psychiatrists clinic are much less believable.         
	In Bhalobasa Bharatbarsha, Samaddar upsets the conditioning of Bengali theatregoers with a consciously nonlinear and abstract tribute to the eminent Malayalam modernist, Vaikom Muhammad Basheer, on his birth centenary, stitching together three of his short stories into what appears to be a narrative, but is not, adapted into 1972 Calcutta. Samaddar himself enacts the author drifting from one story to the next (Basheer often used to place himself, or a writer figure, at the centre). Poverty-stricken and dependent on loans in Birthday, a prisoner convicted for subversive literature in Walls, and renting a haunted house in Blue Light, he possibly allegorizes through this trajectory the tortured artists disenchantment with leftist politics and futile search for love and compassion instead. As director, he creates some pretty scary moments in Blue Light as he talks to the tormented spirit of the dead girl, whom we see (but he does not) sitting just in front of him. Bhalobasa Bharatbarsha also contains the long-awaited application of precision, computerized lighting (by Sudip Sanyal) in Bengali group theatre.

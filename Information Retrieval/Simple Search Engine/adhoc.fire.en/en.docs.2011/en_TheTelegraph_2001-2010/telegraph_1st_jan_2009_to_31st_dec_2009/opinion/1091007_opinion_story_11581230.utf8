The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Messages from the people
                                                                                                                 MESSAGES FROM THE PEOPLE                                  Sumanta Sen                              
	The recent by-election results in Bihar have a political message for the state, and perhaps for north India as a whole. In fact, there are two messages, one positive and the other negative. The positive message lies in the defeat of all those who had ditched Lalu Prasad and his Rashtriya Janata Dal and joined the ruling Janata Dal (United). Their rejection by the people may be interpreted by Prasad as the people reposing their faith in him once again. But the real truth is that defection is not being taken kindly any more.         
	North Indian politics has always witnessed people switching sides for electoral gain. But the Bihar by-elections have put a question mark on this practice and politics in India is likely to gain as a result of this. Both the ruling and the major Opposition party in Bihar should now think twice before engineering shifts in loyalty in the run-up to the assembly elections next year.        
	The negative message is that Bihar, and north India as a whole, are still not prepared to allow any changes in land-holding patterns. The chief minister, Nitish Kumar, had initiated steps towards land reforms and his partys poor showing is being attributed to these measures. The wealth of Bihar stems from its fields, and the owners of these vast tracts, often held in contravention of the law, are unwilling to have sharecroppers and labourers eating into their pie. Soon after the results were declared, the chief minister announced that he was not going ahead with land reforms. This may help him win back support but the state will emerge as the big loser.         
	Feudalism has been allowed to prevail, along with its accompanying evil, casteism. Bihars land owners  many of them Rajputs  must have been angered by the possibility of not only losing land but also losing it to the lower castes. After this aborted attempt at land reform, claims by leaders like Kumar and Prasad to be champions of social justice in the Hindi- speaking belt are bound to sound hollow. In a primarily agrarian society, there cannot be any social justice without land reform.                
	Winners and losers        
	Prasad has emerged as the principal winner after the by-elections but does not seem as jubilant as one would expect him to be. He is aware that the chief ministers chair may elude him if the vote against the JD(U) and the Bharatiya Janata Party is allowed to be split. This means he must win over the Congress to his side, but that party seems more inclined to go on its own. When Lalu Prasad and his current ally, Ram Vilas Paswan, present their cold arithmetics, the Congress may have to think twice, not only in Bihar but also in adjoining Jharkhand where it is time to end Central rule. However, even if the alliance of 2004 were to be revived, will the people be able to forget the bitter fights among the parties in the intervening period? Prasad wants to patch up, but is there any guarantee that in the event of success coming his way he will not turn high and mighty once more?         
	On the other hand, the BJP in Bihar should be in a happier frame of mind. Its leaders in the state have always felt uncomfortable about Kumar treating them as poor cousins, and they had nearly revolted once. Now with Kumar coming second to Yadav, the BJP will most certainly seek to make it clear that in a coalition allies must be shown the respect that is due to them. With the Opposition still very much a divided house, the chief minister, a clever politician, will realize the need to present a picture of greater cohesion. Unless, of course, all the talk about him being an able administrator has clouded his judgment. That will be unfortunate, both for him and the state. For in the last four years, he has given Bihar an administration that was not there in the previous years.

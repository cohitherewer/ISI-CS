	United stand                  
	Sir  One feels sorry for the loss of lives in Pakistan owing to terror strikes in recent times. In the latest incident, 19 people were killed in a series of attacks in Lahore (Cascade of attacks on symbols of might, Oct 16). Terrorism can never be justified in the name of religion. Pakistan is now paying the price for nurturing terrorists within its borders to destabilize India. In the process, the country has ended up destabilizing itself. The former president, Pervez Musharraf, has gone on record saying that during his tenure, the aid given to Pakistan by the United States of America for fighting al Qaida and the Taliban was used to strengthen its defences against India.          
	Pakistan must come out of its anti-India mindset and take the militants head on. It must take steps to destroy their training camps and choke their supplies of money and material, as well as identify the elements with a jihadi mindset in the Inter-Services Intelligence, army and police. Only recently, a former defence personnel was arrested by the Pakistani authorities for conspiring with the terrorists to attack the army headquarters at Rawalpindi (Hostages out, Pak gets attack brain, Oct 12).           
	India will always walk the extra mile with Pakistan in fighting terrorism, provided the latter trusts the former and prevents infiltrators from entering India. A stable and prosperous Pakistan will surely benefit India.           
	Yours faithfully,      
S. Balakrishnan, Jamshedpur

                
	Sir  The deteriorating situation in Pakistanis a matter of serious concern for India. It is ironic that Pakistan, which sponsored terrorism in India, faces the same threat from insurgents supported by the Taliban today. It is shocking to learn that certain leaders and outfits in Pakistan are in denial, and have accused India of engineering the Lahore attacks and funding the Taliban. Meanwhile, India continues to face a serious challenge from the Pakistani Taliban, whose chief, Hakimullah Mehsud, has threatened strikes against India. The Indian government should not only take Mehsuds threat seriously but also silence those who blame India for the violence in Pakistan. India should use its political leverage and diplomatic powers in dealing with the situation. Pakistan, too, should join hands with India to fight terrorism. Both countries should bury their differences and work together to destroy the terror outfits in Pakistan for the sake of peace in the subcontinent.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad

                
	Useful crop          
	Sir  It is heartening to learn that the Genetic Engineering Approval Committee has endorsed the cultivation of the genetically-modified variety of brinjal in India (Cleared, super-brinjal in frying pan, Oct 15). The decision makes this product Indias first GM food crop ready for commercial cultivation. The move will benefit the farmers by way of increased production with lesser dependence on pesticides, and will also help the consumers by way of reduced prices. It will be good for the environment as well, as the use of pesticides in the cultivation of brinjal will be much lower. In a country with such a huge population, the approach to ensuring food safety and food security needs to be pragmatic.          
	Activists are up in arms every time a change is on the horizon. This time, these activists are trying to stop the introduction of the new variety of brinjal. The pesticide-makers will be hard hit by the introduction of this crop. It is obvious that they will try and turn public opinion against GM brinjal by spreading false information about it.The news report states that a senior biologist who participated in a GEAC meeting had informed The Telegraph that at least three members of the GEAC had expressed concerns over GM brinjal during the meeting. But it is doubtful whether a senior biologist from the GEAC would talk to the media about what was discussed in an internal meeting.           
	On the other hand, it is not clear what Pushpa Bhargava, the former director for the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad, meant when she said that the decision to introduce GM brinjal was an example of intellectual corruption. It is Bhargavas duty to now explain why she thinks so, and what she meant by the phrase. It is unlikely that the activists are having to buy brinjal at a high price from the market. Had that been the case, would they have opposed the move?          
	Yours faithfully,       
Tapan Pal, Batanagar 

      
	Sir  Genetically modified brinjal will soon be available in the country. Despite the fact that the yield of GM brinjal would be much higher, and that the cultivation of the crop would require less pesticide, a comprehensive test must be carried out to ensure that the crop is safe enough for consumption.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  Compact fluorescent lamps have emerged as a viable option to save energy. These lamps also have the potential to earn carbon credits. The introduction of these lamps is certainly a welcome step, but they have brought with them the problem of disposing toxic chemicals such as Mercury.           
	Despite the seriousness of the issue, it has not received much attention either from the Pollution Control Board or the city administration. Mercury, in its metallic form, can pose severe health hazards. In order to ensure their safety, consumers should not discard these lamps in litter bins meant for general waste.           
	A possible solution could be the levying of a small charge on the price of a new lamp, and refunding it when the lamp is returned to designated collectors. It is also essential to set up recycling units to complete the waste management cycle. The success of such initiatives depends largely on the sincerity of state governments and the PCBs in redrafting the regularity norms for manufacturing units as well as for consumers.          
	Yours faithfully,

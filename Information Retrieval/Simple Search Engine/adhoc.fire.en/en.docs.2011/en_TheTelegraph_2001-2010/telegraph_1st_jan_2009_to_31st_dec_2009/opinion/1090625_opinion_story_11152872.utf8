	The debate is not new in France, only this time it is more dramatic. The French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, has declared that the burqa is not a symbol of religion; it is a sign of servitude. Hence Muslim women wearing a burqa are not welcome in France, as, instead of being a marker of freedom, the burqa is a token of enslavement and loss of identity. There is always a crux on which enduring debates break their shins; this is one on which the tension between perceptions of individual freedoms and the demands of a secular State collide and turn head over heels. As a secular republic, France claims to respect the freedom of religion while disapproving of the exhibition of religious difference in public. This lay at the bottom of the battle over the States prohibition of Muslim girls wearing the hijab to school. With the presidents recent declaration, and the decision to form a committee to look into the matter, the interwoven ironies of clashing perceptions have erupted onto the surface.        
	Mr Sarkozy will have many in the world on his side, among them Muslim women too. Instead of a freely chosen expression of religious fervour, the burqa can be seen as an imposed custom designed to display the womans secondary status. But a woman may feel she is freely choosing the veil; it is impossible to disprove it unless there are clear indications that the women are empowered to choose. A free nation will desire the freedom of all its people. But can such freedom be achieved by banning an article of clothing? And if the State bans it, is it freedom at all? What does that make of a secular democratic State? What the French president sees as freedom from coercion by cultural and religious leaders, the American president saw as the freedom to express religious faith, when he said in Cairo that no one should be told what to wear. The problem seems insoluble, yet there may be a simpler approach. To enable women to choose freely, without bans or admonitions, the State must ensure ways of empowerment for them. Mr Sarkozy cannot make a statement of lofty ideals and then choose the path of least resistance. For the women he is talking about are residents of France; he cannot say they are not welcome as if they are outsiders. Banning the burqa by law would be a way of increasing the distance between Muslim women and the French State that is already implicit in his words.

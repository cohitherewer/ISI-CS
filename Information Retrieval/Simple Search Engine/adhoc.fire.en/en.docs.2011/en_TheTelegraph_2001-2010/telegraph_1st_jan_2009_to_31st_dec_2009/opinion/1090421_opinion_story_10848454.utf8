The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Clothes and the politician
                                                                                                                 CLOTHES AND THE POLITICIAN                                  Saris and hairdos, kurtas and the loincloth, silk and khadi, dark glasses and the stick, create specific codes of communication between the leaders and the people                                            
	Clothes are what we keep between our bodies and the world. They are what the eyes hit against when we look at another person. They remove most of the body from view, compelling a few immediate responses in the viewer. First, a mix of hinting and hiding makes the viewer imagine the invisible body or wish it away altogether. Second, clothes give to the uncovered bits, usually the face and the hands, the status of revealed truth, the truth of the person. This is further expressed by the voice, by facial expressions and the way the body moves, by all the things that the phrase, body language, denotes. So, personhood is, among other things, this play of body and clothes, in which visible and invisible, private and public, closeness and distance, nature and culture, corporeal and political are continually fused and severed from one another.         
	Most of our encounters with other bodies happen in spaces and contexts that are not intimate. So these encounters counterpoint what we know about our own bodies with what we do not (and cannot) know about the bodies of others. And this silent guessing game is made more tantalizing or poignant by the little accidents of shared human flesh that elude control and act like ironic slips of the tongue within the public language of other bodies: dark sweat stains in a spotless, white blouse, or innerwear faintly showing through the severest of attires, a flash of belly, even a sneeze or yawn, or the bodys briefest surrender to tiredness or boredom (think of that clichd photojournalistic prank, the neta caught napping in Parliament). To all this, add the mystery, and the mystique, of power, especially of power in a teeming democracy: the One and the Many, the One among the Many. And, as always in the subcontinent, so many bodies, too many bodies...         
	What do we look at, and look for, when we view the Indian First Family, for instance  at Sonia, Rahul and Priyanka, and behind (or through) them inevitably, at Rajiv, Indira and Jawaharlal? (Perhaps looking at and looking for are two ways of viewing political presence and its imagery, and are linked, in turn, to two ways of being gullible, critical or curious as citizens of a modern democracy.) A great deal of pre-election visibility  both the campaigning itself and its moving or photographic images  depends on having to strike a balance between separation and identification. The leader has to be set apart, and also protected, from the people: this is a question of both mystique and of security. Yet, the secret of charisma lies in knowing when to break the rules, when to step out of the barricade and become One among the Many, to shed the untouchability of distance and bestow the largesse of proximity and even of touch. Thousands of hands reach out across the barricades, and among them the few men, women or children who become, out of pure accident, part of the elect of the touched or the spoken to betray on their faces the magical sense of being in a state of grace.        
	Clothes become an important element in this drama of reaching out to the people, for they stage both a removal of the body from the public gaze and its insertion into a whole realm of coded meanings and histories. The heat of summer and the demands of tradition call for clothes that keep the body well covered, and to this is added the meanings of white in Indian menswear and of every aspect of the sari and the blouse. With the younger Mrs Gandhi and her children, family resemblance and the specificities of their wardrobe, the way clothes and accessories are worn or carried (down to the watch and sunglasses) continually evoke corridors of time that open out behind each persons presence in the present towards moments in the past that are as powerfully recalled in the collective memory of the viewing public. And in this history, the radiance of dynastic fitness becomes inseparable from a sense of tragic inevitability, dynasty becoming destiny through the sheer power of history repeating. The body inside the clothes is powerfully inaccessible as well as epically vulnerable.        
	The king, in late-medieval Europe, was supposed to have two bodies: a natural, mortal one that would perish like that of every other creature, and an imperishable, supernatural one that could not be destroyed, even by regicide. The second body lives on not only in the succeeding monarch but also in the body politic, the collectivity over which the monarch rules. It is worth playing havoc with history by invoking this piece of royalist double-think to understand the enduring ways of the modern worlds largest democracy.                    AVEEK SEN

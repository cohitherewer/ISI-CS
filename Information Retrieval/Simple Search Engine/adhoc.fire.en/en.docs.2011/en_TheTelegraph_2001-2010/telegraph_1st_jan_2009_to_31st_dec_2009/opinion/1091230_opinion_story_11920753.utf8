	When a group of westernized oriental gentlemen sat down in December 1885 to discuss how un-British the rule of the British was in India, little did they imagine that they were laying the foundation stone of a political party, the Indian National Congress, which would transform the history of modern India. In the early 20th century, the Congress emerged as the principal political force committed to freeing India from British rule. The character of the Congress and the movement it led underwent a dramatic transformation under Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, who linked the people of India to the Congress. It was through a series of Congress-led mass movements that India was brought to the threshold of independence. Freedom came, unfortunately, with the partition of India, a process to which all Congress leaders, save Gandhi, acquiesced. Given the fact that the Congress had been at the forefront of the movement for freedom, it was natural that it received the reins of government in 1947.        
	Under the prime ministership of Jawharlal Nehru, the Congress consolidated its position as the party of India and of Indians. This was the main strength of the Congress: its identification with the Indian people and the Indian State. There was no viable alternative to the Congress as Nehru, the undisputed leader of the Congress and of India, went about fashioning the new nation-state. Democracy with full adult franchise, economic growth through state planning, and secularism were embedded in the making of a modern nation. The policies of Nehru helped the Congress to win successive elections till the first overwhelming defeat of the Congress came in 1977 when the country voted against the Emergency that Indira Gandhi had imposed.        
	Since that time, the fortunes of the Congress have never been the same. It never regained its former unassailable position. In the 1990s it did seem that the Congress had been reduced to an also-ran in Indian politics. Its power and influence had dwindled. Its mass base among scheduled castes and tribes, and among the Muslims, had been eroded by the emergence of other parties. The success of the Congress had always been its umbrella character to which people, irrespective of their caste, religion and creed, had been attracted. The rebuilding of the Congress began under Sonia Gandhi. The process has been slow, but the results are already visible. The Congress is trying to regain its all-India and umbrella character. A 125-year-old political party inevitably has an enormous amount of political baggage. That the Congress still marches on  albeit sometimes out of tune with its own history  is a wonder. Indian democracy is too capacious to be dominated by one party. The Congress has learnt to live with its recent contemporaries.

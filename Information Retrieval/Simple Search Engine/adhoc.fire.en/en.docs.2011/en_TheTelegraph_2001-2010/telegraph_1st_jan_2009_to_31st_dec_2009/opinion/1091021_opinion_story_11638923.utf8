                                                                                                                 LEGAL FAQS                                   Advocate Nibedita Roye answers your queries                              
	Q: When I was working in the Gulf, I had given a relative the power of attorney (POA) to sell my property. Now that I am back and the sale has not taken place, is the POA still valid and can the authorised person still use it?        
	Yousuf Kutty, via email                
	A: Yes, the power of attorney is still valid, entitling your relative to use it till you cancel the power by making a notice of revocation of the POA. Make sure to communicate the revocation to your constituted attorney and also publish the notice for the general public in some daily newspaper.              
	Q:An acquaintance built a house on a co-operative society plot and made his son the nominee at the society. The son acquired the house after his fathers death. The father also had about Rs 25 lakh worth of National Savings Certificates and fixed deposits held jointly with his daughter. But after he died, the son had all the NSCs and deposits encashed and took the entire amount, saying that the money would be needed at the time of her marriage. Yet, not more than Rs 3 lakh was spent at the wedding. Can the daughter claim the money and a part of the house now?        
	Dilip Chatterjee, Salt Lake, Calcutta                
	A: It appears that there is no documentary evidence to prove that an amount of Rs 25 lakh had been handed over to the son who misappropriated the same. In that case, the daughter cannot claim the money now. As far as the house is concerned, the daughter is not entitled to a share in it since the son is the sole member of the co-operative society.         
	Q:I am a 76-year-old ailing, single man. I have six brothers. I have deposited my savings in various fixed deposits and post office savings schemes. All the accounts have been opened jointly with one or the other brother on an either or survivor basis. My younger brother, who has been looking after me, holds almost half of the accounts jointly with me. I want to know if my other brothers can claim an equal share of my savings after my death. Also, I have executed a will in my own writing, duly witnessed and noted by a notary public. Will that be enough to safeguard the interest of my brothers?        
	Name Withheld                
	A: Since you have opened joint accounts on an either or survivor basis, on your demise your share shall pass on to the joint holder and the others cannot claim the same. Though you have made a holographic will (a handwritten will), it is desirable that a will should be typed on plain paper and attested by at least two witnesses.

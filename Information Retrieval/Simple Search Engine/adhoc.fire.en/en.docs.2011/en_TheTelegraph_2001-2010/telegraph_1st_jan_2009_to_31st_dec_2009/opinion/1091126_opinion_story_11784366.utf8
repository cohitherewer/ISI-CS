	Barack Obama may not have minded. But the authorities were taking no chances. After all, Chairman Mao isnt exactly a favourite with the Americans. So they hurriedly ordered the Oba-Mao T- shirt that has become a hit here to be taken off the shelves, before the president of the United States of America reached Shanghai, his first stop. The shirt has Obamas face in place of Maos, wearing the signature green Communist Party cap with a red star, and a green jacket. The Chinese characters on the shirt spelt out one of Maos most popular sayings: Serve the people. But the authorities werent fast enough  a CNN reporter covering the US presidents visit last week was holding one of the T-shirts up for the camera when security men pounced on her and tried to snatch it away.        
	This kind of ham-handedness was again seen in what was touted as the highlight of the presidents visit  his interaction with Shanghai students. It turned out that the interaction was limited to students handpicked by the Communist Youth League; in fact, one of them was actually a lecturer. But the presidents men were up to their own games they managed to get questions online of the kind they wanted. Then the president asked his ambassador to China to ask one of them, relating to the internet. No less ham-handed! But Obamas reply was true to the persona he has built for himself  self-critical, yet saying exactly what he wanted to  that though at times it annoyed him, the free flow of information on the internet made him a better leader and the US a stronger democracy.        
	This interaction came about only after a lot of negotiation on both sides  on the size of the audience, whether it should be telecast live around the country (it was, but only in Shanghai), about questions from netizens. The Chinese were naturally worried about what might be asked  the charismatic and unconventional US president was to meet President Hu Jintao the next day. Already, the US embassy had made its intentions clear by inviting prominent bloggers for a briefing on the eve of the visit.                
	Iconic image        
	The authorities need not have worried. Before Obama landed, the official newspaper, China Daily, carried opinions from ordinary people about what they expected from the US presidents visit. The US protectionist measures against Chinese products was a major issue, but what came across most strongly was the feeling that China was now an equal to the US, and the US should get that straight. A lot of giggling girls gushed about the presidents good looks, too. Some Chinese websites asked for questions from netizens.        
	These were an eye-opener, proving the fears of both the Chinese and the Americans wrong. It wasnt their own lack of freedom that bothered the netizens; what bothered them was the USs denial of human rights to others, like Iraq and Afghanistan! So the US authorities benefited as much as the Chinese from the controlled interaction in Shanghai.        
	Notwithstanding all this, Obama swept China off its feet the moment he landed, according to a China Daily columnist. It was raining when his plane landed in Shanghai, so Obama opened his umbrella and started down the aircraft steps. The most powerful man in the world opening and carrying his own umbrella was an iconic image that spoke more than any rhetoric Obama could have mustered, wrote the columnist. In China, even presidents of organizations do not hold their own umbrellas. It showed that this president was a man of the people, like Prime Minister Wen Jiabao, who not only held his own umbrella but also got down in the slush to talk to a child trapped under debris after the Sichuan earthquake. Ironically, the prime ministers assistants all had underlings holding their umbrellas.

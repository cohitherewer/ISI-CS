	Virtue against vice                  
	Sir  I agree with Mukul Kesavan that the speech Barack Obama delivered on the day he was sworn in as the president of the United States of America was moving (Our leader, Jan 22). It was simple and pithy, focusing on the need for the people of diverse races and religious affinities to come together. By pointing out that We are a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus, and non-believers, Obama made clear where his priorities lay. During the last regime of George W. Bush, racial hatred and violence had assumed an alarming proportion in the US. If Obamas performance is to live up to his pre-poll pledges, then he must start fighting divisive sentiments tooth and nail. Only the future can say whether Obama will succeed or not but for the time being, one has to praise his oratorical skills. I had been in the US for five months since February last year, when the presidential election campaigns were in full swing. I saw for myself how Obama won over the average American, even staunch Republicans, to his side.           
	Nobody, not to speak of those who are habitually anti-US, expects Obama to bring about a miraculous change in Americas economic and foreign policies. Perhaps no one knows better than Obama how difficult it would be for him to make a radical departure from the policies pursued with by his predecessor in the last few years. But in his presidential speech, he at least promised a change. Obama seems indeed to possess the knack of restoring to good intentions [the] original force and urgency of a worn piety, as Kesavan says. It is this talent that made millions upon millions of Americans gave him their money and their votes. Even plutocrats like Warren Buffett and Bill Gates, whom Obama is going tax, have apparently fallen for his appeal.          
	The situation is different in India. The super-rich of this country would rather have as their leader the man who has the blood of thousands of innocent men on his hands. The attitude of the Indian industrialists can be understood from that of Ratan Tata. The disruptive politics practised by Mamata Banerjee caused him to pack his bags and leave West Bengal for Gujarat. The antics of Banerjee notwithstanding, it was not impossible for Tata to stay on, particularly since the government had assured him full security. But he would rather do business with Modi than endure Banerjee. This is not to hold a brief against Tata but an attempt to understand the mindset of the Indian tycoons. No industrialist likes to have his investment go down the drains. But there are other ways of securing personal interests than asking to be lead by a man who masterminded a pogrom of hatred against the minority community.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Some members of the Indian intelligentsia, especially those who value the foreign more than the indigenous, tend to snap at everything that is Indian. Mukul Kesavans article, Our leader, provides ample examples of this tendency. His attempt to draw a parallel between Barack Obama and Narendra Modi is absurd, since the former is the president of as mighty a nation as the US and the latter is only a humble chief minister of a state in India. Even if we ignore the vast differences in terms of position, power and global status between Obama and Modi, Kesavans arguments in favour of Obama would still not be valid. Presented as they were just a day after Obama was sworn in as the new president, his conclusions were hasty. At that stage, Kesavans hopes regarding Obama remained precisely that  hopes, no matter how weak or strong.           
	Kesavan has also expressed his disapproval of the top industrialists who had stood up for Modi as the future prime minister of India. To criticize the Indian industrialists while praising their American counterparts for backing Obama is to be biased. The American business magnates had backed Obamas candidature not selflessly but only after carefully considering his economic policies as laid out in his election manifesto. Similarly, if the Indian industrialists had espoused the cause of Modi, it is because they have found reasons to be optimistic about him after looking at his performance as the chief minister of Gujarat.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Mukul Kesavans article was thought-provoking. But I think that it is unfair to condemn Narendra Modi on the basis of the Godhra episode alone while overlooking his economic reforms in Gujarat that have benefited all communities. If we consider the latter, we would see the point the Ambanis and the Mittals had in praising Modi. And, communal clashes are common in India. They take place in other states too, but we rarely vilify the chief ministers of those states in the way we have did the head of Gujarat.          
	Yours faithfully,       
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Mukul Kesavan has lamented that Ratan Tata, Sunil Mittal and Anil Ambani forgot to mention Godhra and the pogroms that came afterwards while extolling the virtues of Narendra Modi as the chief minister of Gujarat. Kesavan has perhaps forgotten the fact that the industrialists, especially Sunil Mittal, were commending Modi for his CEO-like qualities in relation to programmes for Gujarats development, and not assessing him otherwise.           
	Besides, the Gujarat riots are not the only ones to happen in independent India. The Bhagalpur riots or those following the demand for Khalistan also resulted in innumerable deaths. I find it intriguing that the so-called intellectuals always have much to say against the Gujarat riots while they tend to be silent on previous instances of communal clashes in India. It must be remembered that although there were mass murders in Godhra, the carnage was prevented from assuming even more horrific proportions by Modis timely intervention. The accusations against the Hindus of Gujarat, who supposedly connived with Modi to destroy the lives and properties of hundreds of Muslims, are actually a farrago of half-truths and lies. As such, they cannot be cited as grounds to censure Modi.          
	Yours faithfully,

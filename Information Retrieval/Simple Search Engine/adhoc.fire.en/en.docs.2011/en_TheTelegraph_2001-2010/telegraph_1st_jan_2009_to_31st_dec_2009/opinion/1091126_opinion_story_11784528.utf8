	The rhetoric of India and the United States of America being natural allies, vintage 2009, received some substance when the prime minister of India, Manmohan Singh, met the US president, Barack Obama, in Washington on Tuesday. There was the lurking fear that the bonhomie that existed between India and the US during the presidency of George W. Bush  especially at the individual level between Mr Singh and Mr Bush  would not endure during Mr Obamas term. All such gloomy predictions have been dispelled. The special partnership between the two countries was signed and sealed in the course of the meeting. At one level, there is nothing surprising in all this since the Indo-US nuclear deal had made it clear that the superpower was according to India a special status. But it was important for the new president and the prime minister to talk and recognize that they were on the same wavelength despite some amount of external crackle. What needs to be realized is that the goodwill between the two countries is actually based on common interests, the bedrock of all foreign policy decisions. The US needs Indias cooperation to counter the rise of Islamic fundamentalism and the growth of China as an economic giant. India needs the US to fight terrorism and to be placed at the high table of international relations. Both Mr Obama and Mr Singh expressed this commonality of interests in their different ways.        
	The general optimism of the meeting was prefaced by Mr Singh, the economist prime minister, who announced that there were no reasons to see the end of the dollar. This was good news to a nation that is creeping out of recession and has been for a variety of reasons very nervous about the future of its currency. Mr Singhs statement on the dollar also opened up the door for his comments on the Indian economy, especially the opportunities that exist  and will open up  for increased US investments. Thus both in terms of politics and economics, the Indo-US relationship is buttressed by genuine areas of cooperation that benefit both countries. Those who live in the perennial fear that Mr Singh is poised to sell India off to the US need to follow the content and the tone of the dialogue between the two leaders. India and the US have entered an era of partnership, they have not signed a merger deal. On the Indian side, confidence needs to replace fear.

	Genteel ways                  
	Sir  Ian Jack discusses a pertinent point of the Nehru-Edwina correspondence in his article, A taste of other summers (Nov 1). Edwina Mountbatten was Jawaharlal Nehrus confidante, in whom he confided his problems and difficulties. The love affair between the two is a hush-hush topic. The Indian government has strengthened this impression by objecting to the romantic scenes in the film about the two, Indian Summer. Jack suggests that it is the personal and political, rather than the romantic, nature of Nehrus confessions to Edwina that is the real reason for the secrecy. It could have been premature for Nehru to disclose his political plans and ambitions to Edwina, supposing he had than that.           
	Both the families, of the Nehru-Gandhis and of the Mountbattens, are reticent on this matter and are not ready to disclose the content of the epistles. But it is doubtful how long they can be kept away from the media and the public. If the families were less stringent and revealed the contents of the letters, the rumours about the relationship would have lessened.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Oindrila Thakur, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  The last part of Ian Jacks column, about the dress code in some of the gentlemens clubs across the West End of London, makes interesting reading. Jack writes that most clubs in Calcutta, unlike those in London, do not observe such stringent dress codes. But the insistence on dress code is not so uncommon in Calcutta. Some of the clubs here are stricter about such codes. To begin with, in the Bengal Club mentioned by him, there are dress codes for certain occasions and also for some parts of the club. But perhaps the greatest irony lies in the dress codes of a certain club, more than 100 years old, and started by some very important Indian gentry feeling indignant and insulted for not being allowed in clubs such as the Bengal Club of that time on the ground of colour of the skin and ethnic differences. This august club will not allow anyone without a tie and jacket in its dining room in certain months of the year, when it is autumn and winter in Calcutta. And, one will not be allowed in some lounges if one is not accompanied by women and in some, if one is. Almost all such gentlemens clubs will not allow one to partake of the fun and revelry in a Christmas or New Year party unless clad in a jacket and tie, even if the person happens to be one Sir Vivian Richards. M.F. Husain will be a persona non grata to such a club purely on sartorial grounds and not because of protests from the khaki pants.          
	The most famous horse-racing club, still bearing the name, Royal, will shut its doors to someone who does not have a tie and jacket on. A friend of mine who tore his Achilles tendon cannot enter the racecourse as he has been advised by his doctors to wear slippers and not covered shoes. His wearing a jacket and a tie with slippers (if allowed by the club authorities on medical grounds) will surely be a wonderful sight and a new fashion statement. This letter-writer, a member of such an elite club for at least 30 years, was thrown out of the dance floor of the club on a New Years eve party because he was not wearing a lounge suit but only had a jacket and trousers of different shades with a tie on. So the gentlemen of the Oriental Club can take solace from the fact that there is still a little England somewhere in the jewel in the crown of the Empire, very proud to be a relic of the raj.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Susanta Ghosh, Calcutta 

                
	Legendary loss          
	Sir  Legends believe not in words but in deeds (Sachin keeps raising bar, Nov 6). The breathtaking innings at Hyderabad from the living legend of cricket, Sachin Tendulkar, against Australia proves this point.          
	One hopes that this superb innings, which also earned Tendulkar the Man of the Match award, will satisfy the Australian captain, Ricky Ponting, and make him think twice before criticizing the master. Tendulkars style, as well as his commitment to and passion for the game, is beyond the reach of any other cricketer of this era. Ponting must now have understood why Tendulkar is called the God of Cricket by millions of fans across the globe.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Ratan Sharga, Lucknow

                
	Sir  Once again, it was a case of high hopes and faded dreams. The opportunity for India to win the fifth one-day international against Australia materialized as Sachin Tendulkar tore apart the inexperienced Aussie attack to get past his 17,000 ODI runs. But after his dismissal the team failed to seize its chances and eventually finished as the losing side.           
	Tendulkar always plays with a lot of passion. His batting was a lesson for youngsters. Tendulkar lavished praise on Suresh Raina but groaned with disappointment as the hosts proved to be chokers on the big stage once again.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Subhayu Saha, Khagra, Murshidabad 

                
	Sir  Looking back on the exciting fifth ODI at Hyderabad, it can be said that cricket is a game of great uncertainty. The match would not have reached a climax if Sachin Tendulkar and Suresh Raina had not raised ones hopes through superb batting. But the way both batsmen got out raises some doubts about their judgement. India was stable at that stage of the game and did not need any risky or innovative shot. Sensible batting could have led India to victory. But both Raina, and Tendulkar after him, got out playing irresponsible shots.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Arup Sen Gupta, Siliguri

                
	Parting shot          
	Sir  The report, Web yes for Hindi script (Oct 31), says, The non-profit body that oversees Internet addresses today approved the use of Hebrew, Hindi, Korean and other scripts not based on Latin characters in a decision that could make the Web dramatically more inclusive. I would like to point out here that Hindi is not a script. It is a language. The script in which Sanskrit, Hindi, Marathi and many other Indian languages are written is called Devanagari.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Chhaya Bhattacharya, Calcutta

	THE BIKINI MURDERS By Farrukh Dhondy, HarperCollins, Rs 395        
	In the mythical world of conmen and psychopaths, fact and fiction are frequently interchangeable. And in the cutthroat world of modern media business, truth (read, news) is often made stranger than fiction with dollops of fiction itself. In other words, to base a work of fiction on a real-life badman in these times is something of a lost game. Particularly when the man in question is no less an iconic figure than Charles Sobhraj.         
	It is doubly difficult to understand Farrukh Dhondys motives behind writing The Bikini Murders, given that, besides reams of media stories on the serial killer, there are also books like Richard Neville and Julie Clarkes The Life and Crimes of Charles Sobhraj and Thomas Thompsons Serpentine that, together, provide facts, fiction, psycho-analysis, thrill  everything a reader could ask for. Dhondy was possibly banking on the fact that most of the Charles Sobhraj literature draws the curtain on his saga with his daring escape from Tihar jail. His reappearance in Nepal in 2003, followed by his arrest and life sentence in 2004, is not as well represented as his exploits of the 1970s and 1980s, in Thailand and India, are.        
	Its is understandable that Dhondy, the scriptwriter and former media executive, would want to capitalize on the less publicized second innings of Sobhraj. He starts off with Kathmandu, therefore, where Johnson Thhat, the serial killer and conman posing as Eduard du Monde, is rounded up in a casino by Inspector Ganesh Pradhan (Dhondy retains the first name of the real-life inspector who caught Sobhraj in Kathmandu). What follows are half-heartedly pieced together tales of a deserted and troubled childhood in France, the search for a father in India, entry into the world of sleaze and fraud, progression into a life across countries devoted to high pleasures and low crimes, interspersed with a short and a long stint in jail. When the narrative comes back to Kathmandu again, Dhondy adds the bits that would update Sobhrajs life closer to the present than any other book has done so far. This includes details of the international criminals contacts with Masood Azhar (Haji Ghulam in the book), the hatching of the plot to hijack an Indian Airlines flight by the Taliban, the publication of books and production of documentary films that turn a serial killer into a celebrity and spawn in him a desire to tell his own story  of course, only in return for a fat advance. The little fictional twist to the tale that Dhondy tries to give, involving Thhats daughter with his one-time accomplice, Ravina, fails miserably to tie up the loose ends in the story that keep hanging  limp and lifeless as Thhats victims.        
	Dhondy might actually consider if he has jumped the gun. Had he waited just a little longer, he would have had a made-to-order closing chapter in the 64-year-old Sobhrajs marriage to 20-year-old Nihita Biswas, and the girl and her lawyer mother preparing to prove Sobhrajs innocence before the world. In the hands of a good thriller-writer, this would have become matchless fodder for a tale of how one of modern worlds most feared serial killers walked into love, and freedom.         
	As a thriller, The Bikini Murders might have been salvaged if Dhondy had managed to come full circle with the murder of Mary Ann Smolinsky, the crime committed 25 years ago for which Johnson Thhat is wanted by the Nepalese police. The fact that Inspector Pradhan fails to crack it, even as Thhat seems eager to reveal so much else, works as a betrayal for the reader. Sobhraj must have more than one reason to sue the publishers of The Bikini Murders, though he has only cited his interest in substantial damages.                    SREYASHI DASTIDAR

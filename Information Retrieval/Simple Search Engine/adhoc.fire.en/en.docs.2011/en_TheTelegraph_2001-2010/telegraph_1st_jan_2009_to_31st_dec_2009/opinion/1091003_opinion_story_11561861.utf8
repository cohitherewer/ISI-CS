The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | As the holes with scorched edges become one giant gap
                                                                                                                 AS THE HOLES WITH SCORCHED EDGES BECOME ONE GIANT GAP                              Anusua Mukherjee      Visual Arts                                                
	Installation art, being site specific, depends heavily on the space where it is placed for making its impact. It becomes difficult to evaluate it properly if something as important as the lighting in the gallery is imperfect. The works of Ng. Bidyut Singha, on show in Experimenter (In Memory of an Ideal, Sept 12 -Oct 31), suffer badly because of the gallerys carelessness. The viewer is told that Singha uses the gallery space to create an imaginary village, Irabot Nagar, named after the famed Manipuri socio-political poet, Hijam Irabot Singh, whose poems fuelled passion in the idealistic principles of early socialism in the Northeastern states. With most of the lights in the gallery being switched off, the viewer cannot be blamed if he thinks that the artist wanted to present Irabot Nagar as undergoing a perpetual power cut.        
	The sloppiness of the gallery was unfortunate because that really did come in the way of assessing Singhas art. There was a minimalist quality to his installation works that demanded to be supplemented by such necessary adjuncts as the lighting. The wire meshes in the shape of rectangles and a star, suggesting the bare bones of a system of belief that has withered away in the hands of its practitioners, looked banal without the lights. The same was true of the paintings, which were mostly line drawings making negligible use of colour. There was a series that featured a pair of hands constructing bit by bit the iron framework that would form the skeleton of a building. The surrounding paraphernalia of saws and hammers, in addition to the sprinklings of red on the canvases, summoned up the communist ideal of dignity of labour, only to undercut it by the implication of a prison in the scaffold being created.         
	Excepting the paintings in this series, each of the rest made telling use of absence by having holes with scorched edges in the middle. In the sequence featuring a red star, the holes advanced progressively from one frame to the other, until they became a giant gap in the last, eating up almost the whole of the star.         
	The blankness left by the burnt places evoked different ideas for different drawings  of speech balloons without the speech in the painting of a tubewell, of clouds in that of a footbridge, or of smoke in the one depicting a sugarcane cart. In the painting showing a half-finished construction site, the holes assumed the shape of worms crawling over the iron spikes, heaps of sand, abandoned spade, unclaimed slippers and the incomplete wall with bare bricks.         
	Singha gives socialist realism, the form of art officially approved by the erstwhile Soviet Union, an ingenious twist to reveal what it was meant to conceal. He paints objects of everyday use such as the hurricane lamp or the tubewell with clear, sharp lines only to puncture them, and so deconstructs the realist style. The ubiquitous holes become windows to the waste left behind by the god that failed.

                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Difficult times                  
	Sir  According to several members of my family who are engineering and management freshers, there has hardly been any recruitment of new graduates in companies. Even those who had got their offer letters last year havent yet got the call to join. Most of the private sector companies have not increased salaries for the last two years. Companies that have revived a bit have done so by shelving future plans and cutting down on their manpower expenses which is not a very commendable thing to do. The long-term impact of this could be negative.          
	Yours faithfully,        Bhartendu Sood, Chandigarh
        
	First concern          
	Sir  In what could be a shameful episode in national politics and a degradation of the office of the first citizen, the Congress is faced with an acid test to prove that the president is above politics (President plays, Cong sweats, Sept 23). The initiative taken by Pratibha Patil to pressurize the party to give an electoral ticket to her son, Rajendra Shekhawat, for the Maharashtra assembly elections is a blatant abuse of the office of the president.           
	It appears that Congress is persuading the sitting member of the legislative assembly of Amravati, Sunil Deshmukh, to step down in order to accommodate Patils unjustified demand. The Congress acknowledges the popularity of the present MLA, but it is also conscious of the risk of evoking the first ladys wrath if it acts otherwise.           
	The Congress should know that belligerence on Deshmukhs part may prove costly to its rejuvenated image. The president is beyond party affiliation. The oath taken by the president states this very clearly and it should be recapitulated for Patil if she has forgotten it, blinded by the love for her son. This issue may become the talk of the next Parliamentary session and the Opposition will leave no stone unturned to stall the proceedings. Sonia Gandhi should nip the issue in the bud before the party is engulfed in controversy, and save the dignity of the presidential chair.          
	Yours faithfully,      
P. Bhattacharya, Ichapore, North 24 Parganas

                
	Sir  It is alleged that Pratibha Patil had pressurized the Congress selection panel to allow her son, Rajendra Shekhawat, to stand as a candidate from Amravati in place of Sunil Deshmukh. If there is even an iota of truth in these allegations, then they amount to highly objectionable behaviour, and misuse of power by the president. They would diminish the countrys image before the world.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Wazir Hossain, Calcutta 

                          
	Not fair          
	Sir  Ashish Kotharis article, Protecting the beautiful and endangered creatures (Sept 24), made for an interesting read. It is a pity that a casual remark about the Assam agitation spoilt it. According to Kothari, the agitation was against outsiders settling in the state. This comment, which is extremely unfair, makes the Assammese look like someone of the ilk of Raj Thackeray. The main plank of the agitation was the increasing influx of Bangladeshis into Assam. The agitators never objected to Indian citizens.           
	The Assam agitation of the Eighties started as a non-violent movement, in protest against the partisan politics of the Congress. The movement echoed the sentiment of every Assamese. They marched together to defy curfews imposed in Guwahati and to hold satyagrahas although it is true that a year or two later, the protests took a militant form. Instead of depending on hearsay, Kothari should have gathered his information from the local people mentioned in the article.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Arindom Borah, Calcutta

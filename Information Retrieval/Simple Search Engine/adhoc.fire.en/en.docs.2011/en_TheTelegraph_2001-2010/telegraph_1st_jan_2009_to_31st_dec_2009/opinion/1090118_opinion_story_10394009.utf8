	From the 1850s onwards, commercial uses of the camera and the proliferation of photographic studios, were, so to speak, the public face of the new form of visualization. However, there were other areas in which visual representation was found to be indispensable. Apart from the more covert activities of Empire through police and military photography, the growth of the colonial disciplines of anthropology, ethnography, archaeology and so on found imagery indispensable. In the early years, detailed drawings and lithographs were used extensively, and often, individual artists with nothing more than pecuniary interests in mind became pioneers of a style that lent itself easily to professional use and analysis. Amateur enquiry grew hand in hand with scientific and professional interest, the two often interfacing in innovative ways, such as in meticulous descriptions accompanied by detailed sketches. A few artist-travellers like Tilly Kettle, William Hodges, Johann Zoffany, Franois Solvyns, William Daniell and his nephew, Thomas, produced impressive folios, many of their visual depictions providing insights into the countrys geographic and ecological diversity, and architectural sites as well as into Indian society, occupations and customs.         
	In some cases, these accompanied written accounts, impressive precursors of todays travelogues. Such travellers were not only tourists but also missionaries, military men, engineers, doctors and government officers, who had a keen interest in recording the environment of an alien, if not intimidating and fascinating, land. For instance, the lithograph of The Adjutant reproduced here is part of a set of 22 original drawings that William Daniell had done to accompany a descriptive volume by Hobart Caunter.               
	Titled The Oriental Annual or Scenes in India, it is an account of the missionarys travels in the country published in 1836. Apart from vivid descriptions of his sea voyage, the infamous high surf at Madras harbour, and inland journeys to Madurai and Tanjore in the south, Caunter was also a keen observer of nature. It is likely that during his journeys  on which Daniell accompanied him with the express mandate of acting as visual recorder  the author saw many birds and was able to identify a few as ornithology as a science had just about arrived in India. By 1820, using the binomial nomenclature of the Swedish botanist, Carl Linnaeus (1707-1778), birds started being classified.        
	For the benefit of the mere English reader who was unfamiliar with the bird, Caunter describes, with considerable skill and detail, the adjutant stork  a bird of the crane kind very common in India  at some length. He had seen several on the banks of the Balliapatam (Vallapatanam) river that flows through present-day Kerala and Karnataka. It was almost five feet tall with a wingspan of 15 feet. The bill, he wrote, which opens far back into the head, is so vast a size, that it will readily enclose a full-grown goose: it is near three feet long. The head and neck of this bird are bare, but deformed by small spongy excrescences like warts, and thin patches of strong curly hair. A long pouch hangs from the bottom of the neck over the breast, thinly covered with a short feathery growth, and terminated by a tuft of long hair resembling a stunted tail. The author felt that the bird had acquired its common name from the fact of the singular circumstance of its appearing at a distance like a person in military undress, which in India consists of a white jacket and trousers. He felt that adjutant storks were truly the scavengers of watercourses, devouring whatever they could find. However, they had a special status among the Hindus who believed that the souls of Adjutants are possessed by the souls of Brahmins; shooting them, therefore, they consider an act of unpardonable wickedness. Caunters account is a close approximation to the bird as described in modern-day field guides to Indian birds; a tribute not only to his powers of observation but also to Daniells capacity to reproduce visually the adjutant stork, its distinctive features as well as its domain of mangrove and water. Caunter describes at some length the mangrove tree whose sturdy roots were covered with oysters: it is no uncommon thing for the crew of boats gather from these strange beds a generous meal of those crustaceous luxuries.        
	Caunter and Daniell belonged to the tradition of individuals who felt that it was their duty to present a true account of India to those back home. The growing emphasis on realism was a reflection of the evolution of positivistic enquiry and a movement away from romanticism: ecstasy at the sublime was giving way to a pragmatic approach to the universe and a belief in the laws that governed it. By the early decades of the 19th century, the Asiatic Society of Bengal that had been set up in 1784 by Sir William Jones, the Sanskritist and lawyer, had an important role to play in the growth of systematic enquiry in India, including ornithology. Edward Blyth, who was recruited as curator of the societys museum in Calcutta in 1841, had a passion for natural history, much of it in the area of ornithology and entomology. For over 20 years, he published many descriptions of new species  while drawing a pittance for a salary. He was Allan Octavian Humes mentor, a man generally well known in history for his role in Indian nationalist politics. Hume was deeply interested in education and theosophy, and was a proficient ornithologist as well. In 1849, when he was posted to the Bengal Civil Service, he combined his duties as magistrate and later commissioner with a great interest in education for rural youth, in agricultural reform, conservation of forests and of course, birds. Known variously as the Father of Indian ornithology or as the Pope of Indian ornithology by those who found him too dogmatic, Hume pursued his interest with an almost missionary zeal, believing that the study of Natural History in all its branches offers, next to religion, the most powerful safeguard against those worldly temptations to which all ages are exposed.              
	In his spare time (such as it was), Hume studied the birds of the Indian subcontinent, and spent about 20,000 of his own money  a huge sum in those days  in establishing an ornithological museum and library in his home, Rothney Castle at Jako Hill, Simla, the largest in Asia at that time. It consisted of 63,000 bird skins and 19,000 eggs. He had planned to write a definitive book on the birds of India based on his voluminous notes, but in 1884, while he was away from home, a servant sold the manuscript in the market for waste paper. The following year, a deeply dejected Hume presented his entire collection to the Natural History Museum in London. Earlier, in 1872, he had started, at his own expense, the journal Stray Feathers: A Journal of Ornithology for India and its Dependencies. He was its editor and chief contributor, and published descriptions of his new discoveries such as the Humes Owl, Humes Wheatear and Humes Whitethroat. Using his contacts and position in the civil service, Hume built up a network of well over 200 ornithologists writing in from various parts of India. Images were, of course, indispensable and apart from the ornithologists, skilled artists were pressed into service by the indefatigable Hume. The journal was published until 1899 when he discontinued it, as by then he was living in England.         
	A man of immense intellectual and physical energy, Allan Octavian Hume, combined a challenging career in the civil service  he had had a significant role to play in Etawah district during the uprisings of 1857  with his interests in ornithology and theosophy, writing extensively on both. Hume took early retirement in 1882 and was one of the founders of the Indian National Congress three years later. He remained general secretary of the Congress for several years, even after his return to England. Humes death in 1912 was widely mourned in the colony as he had clearly established himself as a committed friend, one who believed that the British needed to be more self-analytical about their continued role in India.

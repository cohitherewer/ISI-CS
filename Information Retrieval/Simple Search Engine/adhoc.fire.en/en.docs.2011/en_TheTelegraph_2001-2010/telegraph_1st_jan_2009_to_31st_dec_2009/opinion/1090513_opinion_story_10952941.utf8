	Welcome move                  
	Sir  The Visva-Bharati authorities have taken the welcome step to make English the mode of instruction and examination at last (To bring back the world, May 10). This decision ought to have been taken decades ago. Rabindranath Tagore, the founder of this hallowed institution, wanted to give it a global character by opening its doors to students and teachers from all over the world. During his time, scholars from various countries used to come and teach at this university. Students from different countries would also enroll themselves there.           
	Tagore had dreamt of making Visva-Bharati a unique seat of learning where leading academicians from different parts of the world would converge to enhance the quality of education. Sadly, of late, the standard of education there has been compromised to such an extent that the institution has been reduced to the status of the university of Bolpur in Santiniketan.           
	If Visva-Bharati wants to retain the character of a central university, it must improve the quality of the education it imparts. This will enable it to attract the best teachers and students from across India and the world. Surely, the decision to change the medium of instruction from Bengali to English is one way of making that happen. The authorities at the university, who cannot evade blame for tampering with the vision of Tagore, should now act decisively and not give in to any kind of pressure to implement the move. This will benefit students who, on account of their weak English, have not been able to do well in examinations and job interviews so far.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Visva-Bharatis decision to change the medium of instruction deserves praise. I have been teaching students preparing for their civil services examinations in two reputed institutions for the past 11 years. My personal experience is that WBCS students have a poor grasp over English. This is indeed sad because at one time, Bengalis were known to have a good command over the language. However, what is heartening is that these days, students have woken up to the importance of English. There are a few institutions that teach excellent English, one of them being the School of Languages at the Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture in Calcutta, and students should avail themselves of the opportunity provided by this institution. One of West Bengals biggest tragedies has been the step-motherly treatment accorded to English by its present rulers. They have politicized education to churn out semi-literate cadre, thereby ruining the future of virtually two generations of youth, while taking care to offer the best English education to their own children.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Down and out          
	Sir  The beleaguered captain of the Kolkata Knight Riders, Brendon McCullum, seems to have realized that he should better chicken out now than later (No end to KKR woes, May 12). McCullum has been disastrous as captain and player. But he continues to find a place in the team with ease.          
	The Australian coach, John Buchanan, should also be blamed for airing theories like multiple-captains that have distracted the team and its players. Buchanan and his support staff have reduced the side to a laughing stock. Poor Sourav Ganguly, what can one say about him? He can do little for a team whose players lack international experience.           
	The morale of the side went down after it lost the first match. A string of defeats later, it is now beyond repair. McCullum will never be able to steer his team out of this mess. He will be remembered as a captain who never really fitted the bill. He should be handed the pink slip immediately.           
	Yours faithfully,       
A. Moulick, Secunderabad

                
	Parting shot          
	Sir  Recently, I hailed a taxi in front of a shopping mall on Elgin Road to go home to Ballygunge. Two white women were also waiting for a cab, and although I had flagged down the taxi first, the driver decided to take the two women as passengers. But when I refused to get off the taxi, he pulled out the key and walked out of the car. I ran after him and demanded to see his licence. He was brazen enough to say that he did not have one, and told me that I could take any step I wanted. So I tried calling up the police on the number that one is supposed to dial in case of taxi refusals. It was busy, and after five attempts, I gave up. What is the point in giving out helpline numbers if they dont work?          
	Yours faithfully,

	Different history      
	Technology in Medieval India c. 650-1750 By Irfan Habib, Tulika, Rs 275                        
	Neither age nor historiography can stale the commitment of Irfan Habib to spreading the knowledge of Indian history. He is a self-proclaimed Marxist and remains one despite the collapse of the Soviet Union and all that has been revealed about the horrors perpetrated by communists wherever they held power. His Marxism has led him to take the initiative of producing the series called A Peoples History of India, of which this volume is a part. The phrase, Peoples History, might appear to be loaded ideologically since it carries the baggage of earlier histories sponsored by communist parties, especially the one in Great Britain. Stripped of all that, it means providing, in the words of Habib, accurate information in a non-technical style, while at the same time introducing the reader to the larger problems of historical analysis. Readers may well ponder why this noble aim should not be pursued by all historians whenever they write, instead of being confined to a rubric called Peoples History. But this is not a question addressed to Habib alone. This volume is on a highly specialized subject on which Habib has been working since he was a young historian. The book carries the clarity of his distilled knowledge and wisdom. One cannot describe it as a well-written book since style has never been Habibs forte, but there are no barriers here to clear communication and comprehension.              
	A teacher to guide              
	Ishaavaasya upanishad: knowledge and action By Vishnu Kant Shastri, Rupa, Rs 395                
	The Upanishads represent the fundamental storehouse of ancient Indian philosophy. They are also probably among the toughest books in the world to read and comprehend. Even in ancient times, a young student was guided through them by a guru. Vishnu Kant Shastri, a scholar with formidable knowledge of Sanskrit and Indian philosophy, acts here as a guide to one of the books of the Upanishads. The importance of the guru is explained in the manner in which Shastri translates the word, Upanishad: complete knowledge that is gained by sitting close to the guru. This particular Upanishad comprises the 40th chapter of the Yajur Veda whereas all the other major ones have come down as Brahmana or Aranyaka (appendix) of the Vedas. Shastri explains the book shloka by shloka.              
	Elite concerns              
	Discordant Democrats: five steps to consensus By Arun Maira, Viking, Rs 395                
	The most significant thing about contemporary India is perhaps the fact that it is a thriving and functioning democracy. The democracy may be raucous but there can be no doubt that it is functioning since millions of people participate in it. This is significant and remarkable because there are so many factors that actually divide Indians and Indian society. Also, one of the basic conditions of a functioning democracy  literacy and education  is not present to the majority who participate in the democratic exercise. This absence raises doubts about one of the recommendations that Maira makes  mass dialogue. Who talks to whom and how? The examples Maira gives are often inadequate. The search for a consensus may well turn out to be an elite concern. Discord and difference are essential parts of Indian democracy, and perhaps comparisons should not be drawn with what prevails in the United States of America.

                                                                                                                 DEEP CONCERN                                                    
	Israel and Palestine may have pushed the semantic possibilities of the word, ceasefire, to the limits, but it seems that the limits are infinitely, insidiously stretchable. After the attack on a couple of United Nations schools in Gaza, Israel is, under intense international pressure, contemplating a ceasefire  of sorts, one hastens to add. The terms and conditions of this truce, brokered by Egypt and France, are outrageous. Israel wants to stop the demolition of Gaza for three hours every day to let a humanitarian corridor supply aid to the war-ravaged Gaza Strip. The interim prime minister of Israel, Ehud Olmert, will discuss this pact with his cabinet, alongside new ways of escalating the conflict by sending more troops into Gaza. The absurdity of the situation is heightened with the United Kingdom, the European Union and the United States of America (responsible for supplying Israel with state-of-the-art bombs) finally deciding that enough is enough. With the numerical skills befitting a seasoned financier rather than an experienced statesman, the British prime minister, Gordon Brown, has been lamely parroting the inventory of aid that has been earmarked for Gaza by his government. This twisted spiel is not going to save Mr Browns skin, nor is it going to let off his predecessor, Tony Blair, for perpetuating a foreign policy subservient to the wishes of his dear friend, President George W. Bush.        
	The Bush-Cheney brigade, however, is past caring, as Barack Obama is poised to arrive at the White House on January 20. Mr Obama was emphatic about a change of US attitude towards the Muslim world during his presidential campaign, but fell inexplicably silent since the invasion of Gaza began last December. He seemed keen on enjoying his vacation in Hawaii before the onerous task of leadership befell him. However, when Islamic terrorists attacked Mumbai last November, he was quick to condemn the siege. Which is why his protracted silence on Israel, and the taciturnity of his designated secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, and vice-president-elect, Joe Biden, have been deafening. But before his selective adherence to protocol did lasting damage to his reputation, Mr Obama has spoken out, telling the world he is deeply concerned, and that he would have plenty to say after the swearing in. One hopes, as much for the sake of the Palestinians as for Mr Obamas career, that he would have useful things to tell the world.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | The big joke with democracy continues
                                                                                                                 THE BIG JOKE WITH DEMOCRACY CONTINUES                                  The peace deal in Swat is being projected by Pakistan as the only way to contain the Taliban. But neither the means nor the end of the deal can be justified, writes Chirosree Basu                          No time for rest                                  
	An indefinite ceasefire has been announced by the Taliban in the Swat valley following the peace deal between the government of the North West Frontier Province (NWFP) and the Tehreek-e-Nafaz-e-Shariat-e-Mohammadi (TNSM) for the implementation of the sharia in Swat and Kohistan. Soon after the announcement of the deal, Maulana Fazlur Rehman of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) welcomed it. But the disappointment in his voice was unmistakable. He pointed to two things. One, the failure of similar deals scripted in 1994 and 1999, and two, the fact that a secular government, that of the Awami National Party (ANP), has enforced the sharia.         
	It must be the second fact that is worrying the maulana more than the first. After all, Rehman  one of the principal architects of the (failed) ceasefires between the government and the Taliban in north and south Waziristan  cannot be expected to be grieving over dead deals. He knows that such deals are condemned to die the moment they are born. This was true of deals he brokered himself. It is also true of the current truce in Swat.        
	What is worrying Rehman is a sudden loss. A secular government has not only run away with its thunder  the Islamization initiative  but has also enlisted the help of a pariah militant organization (the TNSM) to do so. Worse, following the overwhelming public support for the peace overtures of Sufi Mohammad  which itself is not surprising, given that the people have had to suffer almost two years of incessant fighting  the entire operation is being cast as a new experiment with democracy. That completely undermines the long democratic struggle the JUI-F has had to go through with its own programme of Talibanization of the NWFP during the time the Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal (MMA)  of which it is a part  ran the provincial government in the Pervez Musharraf era. The hisbah and sharia bills were repeatedly stalled by secular parties like the ANP and the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and were held up as reasons for keeping the MMA out of power in the federally and provincially administered tribal areas in Pakistan. Dont you think that was a joke with democracy? cries out the maulana.         
	It was. And it still is. The peace deal in Swat is being sold by the Pakistan government as the only way to contain the steadily-progressing Taliban in the region. But neither the means justify the end nor the end the means. The Nizam-e-Adl, or the system of justice that the deal promulgates, is apparently an answer to a prolonged indigenous movement for judicial reform  started by Sufi Mohammad and his TNSM in the early 1990s  that has fed the unrest in the Swat valley. The Swatis never seem to have got over their nostalgia for the inexpensive and expeditious system of justice (though at times harsh and unjust) that prevailed in these princely states before they were turned into districts under the Pakistan government. This, coupled with the often confusing, inefficient and ineffective judicial system imposed by the Pakistan State, is supposed to have spread popular disaffection, leading to links with the Taliban militia beyond the borders. Under the Sufis son-in-law, Maulana Fazlullah, with his talent with the radio and public relations, the movement seems to have reached unprecedented heights.         
	By answering the need for judicial reform (which was not fully met by the previous attempts in 1994 and 1999), the government wishes to deny the militants their moral high ground. Fair enough. That is a democratic governments most intelligent choice. But then, the rest of the things just go haywire. To implement a judicial reform, the State rehabilitates a man it had sent to prison (Sufi Mohammad), enters into a deal with his organization on which a government ban still holds, and expects a family agreement between a father-in-law and son-in-law to be good enough to throw the Taliban off its scent. What makes it even worse is the governments attempt to convince the people, many of whom have been driven out of their homes and faced death because of the workings of this duo, that this is the best possible way out.               
	There is no doubt that the ANP had been hardpressed. An earlier ceasefire with the Taliban in Swat had ended up strengthening the militants, and the army, since then, has not stopped pointing out what a grievous mistake that had been. More than a hundred ANP members have been killed in the last few years, and its ministers have been on the run. With little substantial help forthcoming from the army, the steadily spreading tentacles of the Taliban towards Mingora and beyond (to Islamabad) made for a frightening spectacle, both for the ANP and the PPP.         
	But is the deal the answer? The new Nizam-e-Adl, by the way, makes no significant addition to the previous drafts of 1994 and 1999 (neither could satisfy the TSNM) other than adding more courts and setting down time-frames for the disposal of criminal and civil cases by the qazis. It just subjects Pakistans penal code and the criminal procedure code to the approval of the Council of Islamic Ideology. Clearly, neither additional courts nor swift justice is the selling point of the deal. It is a fact that the deal allows all existing laws, considered repugnant and redundant to the sharia, to be abrogated summarily. And, quite conveniently, it appoints no one in particular to judge the conformity of the laws with the sharia. This is the deals most attractive part so far as the Taliban and its sympathizers in Pakistan are concerned. They are free to interpret the laws as they like, provided they keep peace.         
	In other words, in one fell swoop, all that the religious political parties, like the JUI-F, were trying to get for themselves through their painstaking experiment with democracy, which often left them at the mercy of either whimsical generals or selfish politicians, has been granted to an outlawed party with the sanction of the president. Not merely that, the fact that peoples aspirations have been answered  both in terms of legal reform as well as the fervent call for peace  has changed the democratic standing of the TNSM, which has always shown a visceral hatred for the politics of vote practised by the religious political parties. As the powerful new clients of a democratic State (as opposed to the MMA parties that were clients of a military dictatorship), the TNSM will be able to Talibanize society the way the religious parties have always wanted to, minus the speedbreakers democracy had put in their path.               
	A look into how the MMAs attempts with Talibanization were defeated would make Rehmans sense of hurt clearer. Religious political parties like the Jamaat-e-Islami and the JUI-F have always believed that the Islamization of society was necessary before Pakistan became a full-fledged Islamic State. For this, the support of the ulema, the army and the bureaucracy was necessary because they lacked an adequate mass base to push through their ideals. To enlist this support, the Islamists have often had to dilute their concept of ideological purity, change their political objectives and ally with whichever dispensation allowed them a say or hold over the political machinery of the State. For the governments in Pakistan, support for the Islamic parties became a way to either prove their Islamic credentials and seek legitimacy or to keep political rivals at bay.         
	It was one such arrangement that worked between the MMA and Musharraf, and worked reasonably well for a long time. Although a moderate, unlike Zia-ul-Haq, Musharraf realized early on how he could use the Islamists for his own specific political purposes. As Ashutosh Misra points out in Pakistan: Engagement of the Extremes, for executing the presidential referendum in 2002, for passing the 17th amendment of 2003, and for the vote of confidence in 2004, Musharraf entered into deals with the religious political parties. Jihadists were set free and encouraged to join politics so that they could canvas for him. The cumulative effect of Musharrafs benevolence towards the Islamists manifested itself in the unprecedented number of seats the MMA acquired in the national assembly in the 2002 elections, which also brought them the governance of the two provinces of the NWFP and Balochistan. This was where the Talibanization was attempted in the next few years of Musharrafs reign.        
	The sharia bill was passed in the NWFP assembly in 2003, followed by the hisbah bill in 2005. These bills made the hijab compulsory for women, closed down cinemas and the cable network, prohibited dancing and music, besides making Islamic punishments, such as stoning, amputation of limbs and death for blasphemy, permissible. The hisbah bill provided for the creation of a ministry for the promotion of virtue and prevention of vice, which would be accountable to no court of law of the Pakistan State. So long as the MMA paid dividends to Musharraf, he turned a blind eye to its workings in the provinces. The bills were, however, severely contested in the assemblies by the secular parties, including the ANP that is what rankles with Rehman now.         
	Throughout Musharrafs dictatorship, Rehman had played a vital role. Misra says it could have been for their cordial relationship that this maulana eased for Musharraf many a twisted plot, sometimes even going against the grain, against the MMAs other heavyweight components. In concluding his study of this relationship, just before Pakistan went to the polls in February 2008, Misra says that Rehmans standing remains undisputed not only in tackling the Shia factor, but also the Taliban in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, and the government drive for regulating madrassahs in the NWFP.         
	The ANP victory in the February elections obviously could not change all that. But ANPs associations with TNSM possibly could. This, above all, suggests that new liaisons, just as undemocratic as those that took place between the Musharraf regime and the JUI-F, are being made to replace the old ones for the benefit of the deal-makers. New patron-client relationships are being forged, and on the same basis as the previous ones, leaving people like Fazlur Rehman without the bargaining chip.               
	The JUI-F leader, obviously, doesnt like being left out. The day ANP entered its deal with TNSM, he, too, entered into another with the ANP and the PPP for the senate polls. Together, they formed a joint panel of candidates for the elections. Last heard, on February 21, the seven members from the NWFP have been elected unopposed, thereby reducing the Pakistan Muslim League (Quaid), previously known to be the kings party, to a minority. The war of religion is on. And there will not be a moments peace for the people living in the middle of it.

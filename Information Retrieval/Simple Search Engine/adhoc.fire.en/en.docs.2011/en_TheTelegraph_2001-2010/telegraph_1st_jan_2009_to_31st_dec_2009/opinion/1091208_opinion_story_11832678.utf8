                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Sinking ship                                                                      
	Last week, in an effort to stem the rapid decline in popularity of the Left Front in general and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in particular, Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee made a passionate plea before a multitude of supporters, urging them not to desert the sinking ship, and posed the question, In the 32 years, have we done nothing? Later in the speech, he observed, Amra Paschimbangake samner dike egiye niye jete cheyechhilam (We wanted to take Bengal forward). The use of past tense, with its implication of a sense of resignation, may not have been a slip of tongue and reflects the present mindset of a large section of Left Front supporters in the state.        
	For political observers, that a coalition of like-minded parties which has ruled the state for 32 long years would lose ground at some stage was a given, but the rapidity with which this has come about has taken everyone by surprise. There is little doubt that the present downturn emanates from a combination of failed policies and promises, with the resulting loss in confidence spread across all segments of the electorate.        
	But how has the Left Front fared in the 30 odd years at the helm? As regards growth rates, West Bengal matched Indias 3.1 per cent for the period 1970 to 1980. Between 1980 and 1990, the state fell significantly behind, as it grew at 4.2 per cent against the 5.6 per cent of the country as a whole. During the Nineties, it was a full percentage higher than Indias 5.7 per cent. Thus, on this score, the state is slightly ahead of India as a whole. Unfortunately, growth rates and domestic products do not tell the whole story. A clearer picture emerges when the state is judged on the human development index  a summary measure of living a long and healthy life, being educated, with a decent standard of living  and the human poverty index as measured by the probability at birth of surviving till the age of 40, adult literacy rate and access to improved water source. According to a study made available by the national human development report of the Planning Commission on the HDI, West Bengal ranked 22nd in 1981, an equally dismal 20th in 1991 and in a study covering only 15 states in 2001, it ranked 8th. HPI rankings for 1981 and 1991 show West Bengal in the 17th and 20th positions respectively. No drastic economic changes have taken place in the intervening years, and it is safe to assume that the state has more or less retained its rankings on both these indices.        
	The prime reason why even a well-meaning government cannot significantly improve on these indices is that this would require a sizeable investment and, with its finances in disarray, the state government is not in a position to do so. For the last few years, wages, pension and interest payments have constituted 100 per cent or more of revenue receipts and of this, interest liability alone accounts for 43.3 per cent, the highest among frontline states. Significant investment has come from the private sector primarily in areas where employment is largely restricted to white-collar jobs. A majority of the literate unemployed cannot be absorbed into the fast-growing services sector because they lack communication skills in English. The decision to banish English from state government schools and making it optional in colleges more than 20 years back is haunting a whole generation.        
	When one scrutinizes the performance of the Left Front government over its three- decades-plus span, one finds a depressing story of how the finances of the state were utilized only to strengthen its cadre-based panchayats and not towards the general well-being of the population. The causes behind the Left Fronts remarkable longevity are to be found in the way it kept the vast majority of the electorate deprived so that they looked up to the Front to solve their day-to-day needs while the CPI(M) successfully projected itself as the only pro-poor party, there being no worthwhile Opposition till now.        
	There are several social and political fallouts of the prolonged Left rule. The most significant one is a contempt of authority  a result of the refusal of law-enforcers to bring law-breakers to book. From office-goers who do not find it mandatory to report on time, political parties that successfully call a bandh irrespective of the court order banning it, a government that disdainfully flouts a court order preventing it from fouling up the Maidan by holding a book fair or a political rally, to the health minister who, in response to questions regarding the sorry state of affairs in government hospitals, answers with a deadpan face that they must be good or else why would people flock to them, the list goes on.        
	Will a change in government alter things? Unlikely would be too harsh a judgement on the future. The smart money is on what is undone in 32 cannot be done in five.                          SATRUJIT BANERJEE

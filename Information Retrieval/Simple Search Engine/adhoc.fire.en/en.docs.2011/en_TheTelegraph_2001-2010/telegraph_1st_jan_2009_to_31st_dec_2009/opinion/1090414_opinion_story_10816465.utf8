                                                                                                                 LOST FAITH                                                    
	Bengal has long been a case study in what happens when the rule of law is replaced by the writ of the ruling party. Both the administration and the peoples faith in it collapse, resulting in a drift or even a dangerous void. If the people of Lalgarh lost faith in the police and the West Bengal government, it was because they found the police to be not an organ of the State but an illegitimate arm of the ruling party. Lalgarhs revolt against the police thus has a larger context that applies to many other parts of Bengal. For the people in large parts of the state, the administration simply does not function; when it does, it is primarily at the behest of the ruling Marxists. The decision of the peoples committee in Lalgarh to not allow the police to enter about 15 villages is a desperate act born of the peoples frustration with the ways of the government. It is only incidental that the resistance started with the police arresting and abusing innocent people, including school students, following a landmine blast on the chief ministers convoy last year. Obviously, the peoples anger against the police and the administration had reached such levels that any other incident could have triggered a backlash.        
	All this is not to suggest that Maoists or any other rebel group should be allowed to create liberated zones in Lalgarh or any other place, where the State will cease to exist. Even if Maoists had taken advantage of the popular discontent at Lalgarh and infiltrated into the area, the task of fighting them lies with the administration, and not with the cadres of the Communist Party of India (Marxist). Unfortunately for Bengal, the CPI(M) has always blurred the distinction between the party and the government. The bloodbath in Nandigram two years ago was essentially a consequence of aggressive party cadres trying to usurp the functions of the administration. There are several other areas in Bengal where the partys rule has forced the administration to wither away. This really is at the heart of the stand-off in Lalgarh and any solution that ignores this reality is bound to be ineffective. The Bengal government has to first decide what it wants the police or paramilitary forces to do in Lalgarh as and when they can enter the area. It is not enough to conduct the polls there with the help of these forces. The people need to be reassured that the police will not act as the partys foot soldiers.

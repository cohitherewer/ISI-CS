	The speed at which the Centre has conceded to the formation of a separate Telangana must have come as a surprise even to K. Chandrasekhar Rao, the founder-leader of the Telangana Rashtra Samiti, whose fast-unto-death precipitated the current crisis in Andhra Pradesh. What compelled the government to act was apparently the desire to forestall bloodshed in the state. The TRS had planned a mammoth march to the legislature on December 10 which created apprehensions of more violence. However, violent rallies and prolonged bloodshed have not worked similar wonders elsewhere when demands for state formation have been raised. Had the TRS not resorted to such open blackmail and the handling of the matter by the state government inspired more confidence at the Centre and in the ruling party, the events would have unfolded differently. But now that the concession has been granted, the government cannot hope that the matter will be resolved by less threat of violence. Already, about 60 MLAs, cutting across political parties, have resigned or threatened to do so in protest against the Centres decision. This means that the resolution for a separate Telangana will not have a smooth passage in the assembly. There are far too many issues hanging in balance to be resolved by one nights brainstorming. First, the status of Hyderabad, which is technically part of Telangana but is also the state capital. This is an unprecedented problem not confronted when the bifurcations of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh had been decided. The dividing of water and economic resources also promises to be acrimonious.         
	Even if the dust settles on Telangana, questions will be raised about the Centres hurried decision, and will lead inevitably to the indecisions over Gorkhaland, Bodoland, Vidarbha, Harit Pradesh and many other demands. Each of these regions is fighting for the status of a separate state as a means to ensure better governance. But does size, per se, ensure that? Is Goa any better governed than Rajasthan? The political experience in Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Uttaranchal should convincingly dissuade proponents of fragmentation. Since their formation, many of these new-born states have set a record in corruption and political instability. The answer to challenges such as Telangana does not lie in fragmentation, which does not guarantee efficient administration.

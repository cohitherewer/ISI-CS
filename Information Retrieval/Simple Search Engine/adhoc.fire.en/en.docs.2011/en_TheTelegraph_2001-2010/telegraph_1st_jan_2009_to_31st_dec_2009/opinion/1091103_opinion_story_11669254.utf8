	Distant dream                  
	Sir  In the article, Climate change (Oct 26), Ashok Mitra has rightly condemned the growing nexus between politicians and corporate heads. Salman Khurshids comment about vulgar corporate salaries drew a few sharp retorts from the corporate honchos. But Khurshids concern was ultimately just eyewash, lacking any genuine motivation.          
	With a dearth of strong, visionary leaders at the helm and with criminals entering politics in increasingly large numbers, money, combined with muscle power, has become the sure formula of winning elections. Political parties are hugely dependent on the corporate world to fund their activities. So why spoil the goodwill by putting a cap on corporate salaries when it is likely that politicians often get more than a humble share of the pie? With the public sector incurring losses in the past few years, the private sector, with its ruthless money-minting drives, is shouldering the burden of sponsoring the politicians princely lifestyle.          
	It is only natural then that politicians, in turn, would keep the reins relaxed on corporate activities, and formulate tax laws in such a way as to give maximum elbow room to the private sector while outwardly pronouncing the mantra of India first. Even questions in the Parliament sessions are often dictated by the corporate heads to the members of parliament so that the former get the benefits of waivers and subsidies. The kin of ministers occupy key positions in private industries and businesses.          
	Mitra rightly points out that this nexus has been there even in the days just following Independence. But then its scale was smaller than what it is now. Indian masses have always been fond of hero-worship. They have considered it a sacrilege to even think of the darker side of their so-called leaders, who then took full advantage of this blindness to secure their positions. Revamping the system seems a distant dream, now that dynastic and provincial politics rules the roost. Thus, the aam aadmi is left with hopes and dreams for better days. But then, miracles do not happen that often.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Poetic truths          
	Sir  Arundhati Roy, the social activist and writer, has protested against the government offensive against Maoists (Activists target PC for war on Maoists, Oct 20). I understand that the root cause behind the Maoist turmoil is poverty. But as a sociologist, I feel that we should help eradicate poverty rather than just sign up for some cause, probably for the sake of publicity. Has Roy, like Amartya Sen or Mani Bhowmick, set up a trust with her Booker prize money for the poor?           
	There are also some Bollywood stars who campaign for causes at times. But do they contribute from their earnings whenever there is a crisis in the country? Suicides by the debt-ridden farmers of Vidarbha continue to occur. Shouldnt the Bollywood stars form a trust with a tiny portion of their huge earnings to help these peasants?                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Annapurna Sanyal, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The views of Arundhati Roy on Maoists are noteworthy. Ever-widening gap between the rich and the poor, and the injustices suffered by commoners at the hands of influential men are definitely the root cause of the social unrest among people. The sudden switch to the capitalist free economy from a mixed economy, which tilted towards the socialist pattern, has been instrumental in increasing the disparity between the haves and the have-nots. Before Independence, India had been the slave of one East India Company. Now Indias common people have become the slaves of many East India Companies operating in the form of multinationals.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi 

                
	Here and there          
	Sir  It is good to know that the Calcutta High Court has given the government a fortnight to come up with a status report on the citys parking and pavement chaos (Glare on parking and pavement Oct 26). The high courts initiative provides a ray of hope to Calcuttans. On many occasions in the past, we have heard the war cry of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation and the Calcutta Police against hawkers and illegal parking, but matters have cooled down in no time. Now the situation has so worsened that the Calcutta High Court has pulled up the government for neglecting its duty.          
	I live in the southern outskirts of the city. From here, the journeys to work and other places have become a nightmare. It takes about an hour to travel a distance of about two kilometres down the Diamond Harbour Road from Chowrasta to the Ajanta cinema. The pathetic state of this stretch of road brought about by hawkers and illegal parking has to be seen to be believed. The situation is so alarming that relatives and friends tend to avoid visiting us unless there are some untoward incidents in our family. The same is true for us too. The southern fringe of Calcutta has become, so to say, a colony of Robinson Crusoes. Barring Sourav Ganguly, no celebrity lives in Behala. He uses his private transport and heads for the Eden Gardens via the Bypass. Other VIPs pass through this portion of the road under pilot protection, in air-conditioned comfort, behind tinted windows. So, they see nothing. The mayor is requested to visit this area, if he can take some time off his busy schedule. This poor fringe area can, at least, expect a step-fatherly treatment from the pauropita.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Sumitra De, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike has taken certain effective steps to ease the ever-increasing flow of traffic in the city. It recently cleared the Madivala market from one side of the road, which is to be expanded. A bus bay has been created, and the stalls on the left side of the road have been shifted to the right without any political intervention. I simply cannot imagine the same happening anywhere in West Bengal. Being born and brought up in Calcutta and then having shifted to Bangalore, I can clearly see the difference between the mode of functioning of the two cities. Almost all the streets of Calcutta are filled with hawkers. They are increasing common peoples misery by the day. They stain the walls of the Indian Museum with gutka and transform all thoroughfares into marketplaces. The administration is blind to this menace. Unfortunately, there is no mass movement or public petition against hawkers.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Supartha Mustaphi, Bangalore

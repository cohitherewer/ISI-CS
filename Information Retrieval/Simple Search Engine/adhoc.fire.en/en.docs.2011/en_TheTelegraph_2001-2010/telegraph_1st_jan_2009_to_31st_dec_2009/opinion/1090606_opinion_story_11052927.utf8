	Sir  The yawning fiscal deficit needs to be looked into more seriously by the government. The need to increase infrastructural spending through internal fund-raising by way of bonds and other instruments from financial institutions such as the India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited and the Infrastructure Development Finance Company is paramount. The government plans to more than double its spending on infrastructure by 2011. One option is disinvesting the public sector undertakings by bringing small investors to the bargaining table.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir The news that Meira Kumar has become Speaker deserves applause, given the fact that the office of the Speaker of the Lok Sabha has been predominantly a male chair (Consensus on lips, Meira takes charge, June 3). In an era when women in India are being empowered in different spheres on a par with men, this is not a surprise.          
	However, one must not forget that in the recent past members of the Opposition often created great pandemonium during Lok Sabha sessions, causing an impasse in the proceedings. Such untoward situations should not be repeated. Members of parliament need to learn to speak one at a time, not in a discordant chorus that leaves the Speaker baffled. The chaos in parliament often reminds one of a raucous fish-market.           
	Yours faithfully,        Ashok Jayaram,   Bangalore                      
	Sir  Among the MPs, Meira Kumar is one of the most graceful and sober personalities. Some may doubt her capabilities as Speaker with regard to controlling the habitually unruly MPs. It seems to me that things can turn out to be exactly the opposite: it will not be easy for the shouting-brigade to disobey the gentle lady. However, it will require extra-strong loudspeakers so that Meira Kumars voice can match the MPs lungpower.          
	If a woman Speaker was the need of the hour, then the office would also demand the qualities of a school principal. On that count, Mamata Banerjee might have done even better than Somnath Chatterjee. It will be interesting to watch a soft-spoken lady control the the din in the House.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir The editorial (Another fall, June 2) analyses why Meira Kumar is being appointed the Speaker of the Lok Sabha. The Congress has tried to kill many birds with one stone by installing a Dalit from Bihar to counter Mayavatis Dalit trump card.          
	Sonia Gandhi should realize that the Speakers office is a sensitive one since its incumbent needs to have a deep understanding of the Constitution and of parliamentary practice. Meira Kumar seems an inadequate successor to Somnath Chatterjee, who was an institution by himself.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir The Supreme Court had issued an order forbidding smoking in public places. But is it really being observed? Is anyone ensuring that the order is being followed? I am an employee in a Central government undertaking. I am a migraine patient and cigarette smoke aggravates my pain. I have to implore my male colleagues not to smoke inside the office, especially in closed rooms, but to no avail.          
	These are all educated individuals who yet boast of defying a law that does seem ineffectual. If educated people behave like this, what will the young learn? And what about those who suffer the most from passive smoking? How do we really educate these people?                     
	Yours faithfully,

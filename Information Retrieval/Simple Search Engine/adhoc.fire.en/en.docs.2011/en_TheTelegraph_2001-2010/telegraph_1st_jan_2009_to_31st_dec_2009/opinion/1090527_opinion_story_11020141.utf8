	Another stint                  
	Sir  After achieving stupendous success in the Lok Sabha elections, and having assisted the United Progressive Alliance to form a stable government, Mamata Banerjee deservedly bagged the railways ministry (Saturday Six (to be contd)), May 24). It is now hoped that just like the Trinamul Congress, the railways department will also be able to attain lofty heights under Banerjees leadership. But Banerjee should desist from following the footsteps of Lalu Prasad, who, in order to make a profit, resorted to populist measures such as promoting express trains to the superfast category. Instead, Banerjee should accord top priority to the safety of passengers who are often left at the mercy of robbers. Moreover, she also needs to protect bona fide passengers from harassment by unruly elements. Eunuchs should also be reined in as they pester travellers.           
	The recruitment process of the railways also needs to be looked into to ensure that Indian Railways does not turn into  Bihar Railways. Banerjee should also change the preference of Hindi over other languages in a multi-lingual India. Announcements in Bengali in many stations in the Raniganj coal belt, apart from Durgapur and North Bengal, are being done away with. Some of the display boards in Howrah, Sealdah and Asansol are bereft of instructions in Bengali. Banerjee should not imitate her predecessors who meted out special treatment to their home states. But what she must do is ensure that Hindi isnt used to systematically erase Bengali in Bengals railway stations.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  It was indeed a proud moment for the people of Bengal to see Mamata Banerjee being sworn in as the railways minister in the new Congress-led government. After a long time, the people on the streets were seen glued to the television screen, watching the live telecast of the oath-taking ceremony. Even members of the middle class, who were fast losing their interest in politics, seem to have been bolstered by Banerjees victory against the Left Front in the Lok Sabha polls. Banerjee has a reputation of leading a simple life. One hopes that she will understand the plight of railway passengers in this state and soon come up with projects that are going to help the people of Bengal.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Subhayu Saha, Khagra, Murshidabad 

                
	Sir  After the TMCs spectacular performance in the recent Lok Sabha elections, Mamata Banerjee has been vociferously demanding the dismissal of the state government, paving the way for mid-term elections in West Bengal. But Banerjee should remember that the people can deliver conflicting verdicts. For instance, the party they voted for in the parliamentary polls this year may have to sit in the Opposition in the Writers Buildings. So Banerjee should not act in haste. She should concentrate on her new portfolio and try and extend the benefits of this network to Indias hinterland.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Vineet Phadtare, Mumbai 

                
	Sir  Mamata Banerjee should participate in the new government with the same vigour and zeal that she demonstrated while driving the Tatas out of Bengal. However, her admission that she does not care for a ministerial berth would not do any good to the people of the state who have given her an overwhelming mandate. Banerjee should try and act more responsibly, and with maturity. She must aim at getting a few important ministerial berths for her MPs and turn her own attention to projects that would benefit the people of her own state. The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, for instance, has a fewer number of MPs in Parliament but is bargaining hard for plum ministerial berths. It is to be noted that when the United Progressive Alliance was in power earlier, some ministers from Tamil Nadu had done everything in their power for the sake of their home states development. It may sound parochial, but Banerjee must follow the example set by them. However, it may be a matter of some concern for Banerjee that most of the elected MPs in her party do not really have the experience to become competent Union ministers. She has thus very few names to propose for the cabinet posts. Banerjee needs to deal with this problem effectively, and at the earliest.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Sujoy Ghosh, Nagpur 

                
	Sir  I was happy to read that Mamata Banerjee has shown interest in the upgradation of the Alipurduar railway division. But on reading the report, Trinamul draws up Dooars list for Didi (May 25), I found that nothing has been done about building a flyover at Binnaguri. The local TMC leaders have not been of any help, but if Banerjee were to look into the matter, the people of Binnaguri will be thankful to her.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Amar Ghaley, Jalpaiguri

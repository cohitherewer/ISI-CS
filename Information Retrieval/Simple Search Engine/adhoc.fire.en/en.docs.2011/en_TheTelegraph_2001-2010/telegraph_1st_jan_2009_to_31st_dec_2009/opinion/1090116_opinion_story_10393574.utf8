The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | not just one bad apple
                                                                                                                 NOT JUST ONE BAD APPLE                                  MALVIKA SINGH                              
	Satyam, Sharam, Scandalum! It all seemed so over the top as companies such as Satyam grew at an absurd, rather unimaginable, pace, that some of us, old-fashioned cynical types, often wondered how long it would take for the bubble to explode. The Indian stockmarket was in the same viewfinder, and when it dropped dramatically, tumbling down many points to reach a realistic level, one realized how right we were, instinctively, about the wild and poofy boom. The godfather of the Delhi Metro, E. Sreedharan, had pointed out the horrors, much of which have been substantially proven. Yet again, he stands apart. While other head honchos of fast-growing new generation businesses are desperately protecting their breed by referring to the Satyam shocker as just one bad apple in the crate, it is becoming increasingly clear that land grab, buying land at ridiculously low and inappropriate prices, has become the additional business agenda for future projects and therefore, changing and enhancing valuations is the major, ongoing scam that needs to be checked immediately.        
	Con games and their players are being bailed out with tax-payers and other government monies. This could, in itself, be deemed a scam. This nation has not been able to deliver water, electricity, roads, health and education to its people, from the metros to rural villages, therefore, it has no business to bail out cons and failures who operate in a free market. Those men and companies should just as well pay the price of their corrupt practices, rampant exploitation and misjudgment. Let the Maytas land pay for the monies required to bail out Satyam. It is ironic how the poor never scam like the rich and mighty do, protected by a failed governing authority and corrupt, colluding agents of governance.                
	Explosive case        
	Some simple questions arise. Why is there no regulator for the real estate and construction industries? Soon that scam will erupt in our faces, one that has cheated the common man. Buy land cheap from eager farmers who want quick, easy liquidity (believing it will help better their lives and fulfil the first step of their aspiration to join the growth process), exploit them, then inflate land prices by a pretence of value addition, create shares and borrow money from banks and institutions against those falsely-valued shares. The prices have tanked; therefore, why are banks and institutions continuing to fund those companies? Why are their loans being carried forward? Why is the government giving those companies the time of day, considering bailouts? These are all scams of huge proportion and it is time to tell the people the true story of this greedy, personal growth, using land transactions to become instantly rich. Look at all the companies that have been recklessly buying up land. Scam upon scam.        
	The other area with a great potential for an imminent scam, is in the area of the privatization of milk and farm produce, collection and distribution. When Verghese Kurien engineered the White Revolution, he created and nurtured human stakeholders in a joint venture. Today, there is a plan afoot to dismantle that by making a corporation, bringing in partners and investors from India and overseas, endorse middlemen to rake in percentages and thereby take the retail price up and up, and generate corporate wealth at the cost of the erstwhile stakeholder. People were recently talking about who will, very soon, benefit from the wide network that Kurien had woven across India and the answer was a unanimous you-know-who. Nothing changes. As long as such individuals and companies continue to fund political parties and players, there can be no cleansing at all. The nexus has to be broken for the scams to be exposed, and business practice corrected. Alas, it is not a case of one bad apple in the crate. It is a case of exploding apples!

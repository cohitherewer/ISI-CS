	Sri Lanka recently released more than 41,000 of the internally displaced persons from one of its relief camps in the north. The people were transported to their respective villages, which, according to the government, had been de-mined and made suitable for resettlement. But it is not merely the earlier unsuitability of habitations that has been holding up the release and relocation of IDPs. The perceived security threat from them was a major factor behind the delay. That this was suddenly overlooked after months of hedging is what makes the government move unprecedented. The release, which came days after a 10-member delegation from Tamil Nadu visited the country, may have done wonders for the delegations popularity rating. But the Sri Lanka government was more concerned about itself than about the Indian visitors while taking the decision. Only six months after its stupendous military victory, the Mahinda Rajapaksa government is facing an uphill task holding on to its achievements. It is suddenly beleaguered by pressures from the international community and from domestic politics. Already warned by the European Union that its access to the generalized system of preferences plus trade scheme that sustains its textile industry may be suspended, Sri Lankas problems have been compounded by the American war crimes report that alleges human rights violations. The United States of America has shown that it means business by summoning the Sri Lankan army general, Sarath Fonseka, who was on a personal visit to the US, allegedly to testify against the defence secretary, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa. Although the diplomatic impasse resulting from this is likely to be cleared up, the message will have been conveyed to Sri Lanka.        
	Given the build-up in international pressure that could lead to cuts in aid, Sri Lankas humanitarian gesture is perhaps rightly timed. It cannot afford to allow a financial crisis to worsen the domestic situation. The Rajapaksa administration now faces opposition in the form of the United National Front that includes powerful adversaries, and the resurgent and troublesome Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, with the trade unions and students groups under its aegis. It is not without reason that elections have already been declared, although they may, in fact, reduce the possibility of more substantial releases from camps.

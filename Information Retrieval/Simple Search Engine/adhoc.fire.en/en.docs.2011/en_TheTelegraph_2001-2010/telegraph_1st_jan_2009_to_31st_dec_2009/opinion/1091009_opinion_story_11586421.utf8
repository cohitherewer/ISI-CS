	A quaint and spirited pilgrimage                
	The Perplexity of Hariya Hercules (Penguin, Rs 199) by Manohar Shyam Joshi, translated from the Hindi by Robert A. Hueckstedt, is a quirky quest romance seasoned with wry humour that tells of how latter-day myths find their meanings. But this deep truth is sugared with the the rasa of wonder that, administered in the right amount in the homely traffic of tales, is believed to bring on that sweet sleep that is the mother of dreams. As one follows Hariya Hercules on his august task of redeeming a curse his ill-starred father brought on the community by stealing the property of a deity, Joshi does transport his reader into a dream-scented wonderland. But he is too good a raconteur to let you fall asleep over his book.                                  
	Behind the glitz: exploring an enigma called Indian film industry (Thema, Rs 80) by Someswar Bhowmik is an attempt to chart the sea change the film business in India has undergone in recent times at the levels of production, distribution and consumption. From the earliest cinema audiences who came from a plebeian, if not always proletarian, background to a richer, more sophisticated audience that patronizes multiplexes and shopping-malls, it has indeed been a long journey. Bhowmiks project is to explore the economic contours of Indian cinema, taking, as his point of departure, the conjunction of cinema with monopoly capitalism whose mechanism applies as much to Bollywood as to Hollywood. Bhowmiks study is soundly researched and closely argued, and could be of use to the specialist.                         
	Basic Transformational Yoga (Sterling, Rs 100) by Swami Vidyanand asks the reader Do you wish to free yourself from the pressures of modern-day life? and goes on to answer, Transformational Yoga offers many techniques that relieves us from the pressures of modern day life.

In between, the author gives a digest of the arcanum of yogic philosophy.

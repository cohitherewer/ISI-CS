	Petty games                  
	Sir  Bal Thackerays objection to Sachin Tendulkars comment that Mumbai belongs to all Indians is unwarranted (Thackeray targets Sachin, Nov 17). By condemning a celebrated cricketer like Tendulkar, Thackeray is just playing petty political games. He is only a regional leader with his own agendas to promote. The local politicians of Maharashtra cannot have a monopoly over the city. Mumbais fame as the financial capital of India is a result of the hard work of all its inhabitants irrespective of regional identities.          
	Yours faithfully,      
K.A. Solaman, Alappuzha, Kerala 

                
	Timely note          
	Sir  The way government employees at Writers Building misbehaved with press photographers over the issue of the new attendance code recently enforced by the West Bengal government was highly deplorable (Late lamented, Nov 20). Rules that may improve Calcuttas work culture are welcome. The government has finally woken up to the issue of late-coming. The new code will encourage the workforce to be more responsible. But it is rather depressing that many government employees are protesting against the attendance code. The government provides numerous opportunities for employment at a time when unemployment is a major problem. It is quite legitimate for it to claim a certain amount of productivity from its employees.          
	The government, it seems, has lost control over its staff owing to certain flawed policies. The furore over the enforcement of the new attendance rules reveals the gap that remains between policies and their implementation.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Jayanta Datta,

	Sir  The enforcement of strict punctuality at Writers Building has become a farce. Employees addicted to the habit of coming in late and leaving early are flouting the new attendance rules citing unreasonable excuses such as traffic rush during peak hours, show of defiance, and so on. It is disheartening that these pampered employees consider the rules requiring them to be on time as encroachment on their rights to come in and leave as they please. It might be an uphill task for Asim Dasgupta to impose such stringent rules on these employees. He may even succumb to pressures from his own party, which may not want to lose its popularity by imposing such rules.          
	Yours faithfully,       
W. Hossain, Calcutta

                          
	Unreal dreams          
	Sir  In the article, From dream to reality (Nov 19), N.K. Singh has played up Bengals achievements with dubious facts. The title of the article should have read, From reality to dream. Bengal has actually deteriorated more than it has improved  a fact that Singh has accepted by saying, ...and for a good three decades the state remained in the shadows, for reasons complex and mostly man-made.          
	Singh has compared Bengals growth with the countrys average growth, instead of comparing it with that of other successful states like Gujarat and Punjab. Singh points out that Bengals child mortality rate is below the Indian average. In this case too, Bengal should have been compared not to India as a whole, but to other Indian states. Bengal will improve only when the state has a government that knows how to achieve growth.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta

                          
	Erratum          
	In From dream to reality (Nov 19) by N.K. Singh, it was mentioned that The verdict of the 600-odd listeners went against the motion. The correct figure, however, is 6,000. The error is regretted.          
	 The Editor

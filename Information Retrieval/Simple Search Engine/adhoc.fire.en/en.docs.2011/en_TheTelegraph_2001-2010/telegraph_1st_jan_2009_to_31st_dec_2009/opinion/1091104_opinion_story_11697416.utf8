	Q: I have an office space that I wish to let out. An interested party wants it for at least three years with the option of renewal for another three years with a 15 to 20 per cent increase in rent. How can I ensure timely rent payment and the return of my premises at the end of the agreed period?        
	Sheila Jain, Calcutta                
	A: It would be better to let out your property on leave and licence basis for an 11-month period with the option of renewal. In case your licensee refuses to vacate the space on the expiry of the licence period, you can file an eviction suit without having to establish any other ground besides the termination of the licence period. For timely rent, you could negotiate with the company to issue post-dated cheques for the entire period or for every quarter so that non-encashment or dishonour of cheques would make the company liable for criminal offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act.              
	Q:My parents were joint allotees in a co-operative housing society. After my fathers death my mother is the sole allotee. How do I get the flat mutated in her name?        
	Abhijeet Chatterjee, Calcutta                
	A: You should inform the co-operative society about your fathers demise in writing. You should also give them a copy of your fathers death certificate. Then you can apply for the mutation of the flat in your mothers name by furnishing the relevant documents to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, which will abide by the provisions of the West Bengal Co-operative Societies Act and mutate the flat accordingly.         
	Q:I have a sister and two brothers. My parents had a property which was handed over to a builder who constructed eight flats on the premises and gave my father four. My father, who is still alive and is the legal owner, has gifted two flats each to his two sons. My sister and I were not given anything. Can we challenge this in a court of law?        
	Sougata Banerjee, Calcutta                
	A: If your father is the sole legal owner of the flats, you cannot challenge any gift made by him nor can you ask for a share of his property during his lifetime. But if your mother was a joint owner of the property, then legally the 50 per cent share owned by your mother should have devolved upon your father and the four siblings. In that case you and your sister should inherit one fifth each of the share of your mothers property. Hence, on this ground, you could claim your share, challenging the exclusive title of your father to the property.

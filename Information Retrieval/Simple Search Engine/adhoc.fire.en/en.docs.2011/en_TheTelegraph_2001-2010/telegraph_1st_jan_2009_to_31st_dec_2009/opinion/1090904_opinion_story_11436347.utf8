	The Nobel is a ticket to ones own funeral. No one has ever done anything after he got it.  T.S. Eliot on winning the Nobel Prize in 1948        
	Eliot has been proved right in a great many cases, but with the Nobel, the writer has truly arrived in the literary world and can recycle all his journalism, lectures and jottings to produce a string of selected writings. While some general-editor familiar with the work of the Nobel-winning writer usually undertakes this task on the latters behalf, and the assorted pieces may not be as great on the whole, but all the same, such endeavours help the writer to remain in the public eye for a long time to come. In some cases, the writers post-Nobel life could become even more interesting, with these bits and pieces of writings revealing facets of his personality that are often lost in the original works. So, even if the anthologies appear dated and a bit tiresome at times, the crucial question remains whether these would do as well as the originals. If they do  or do not  then what does that reveal about the nature of readership today?        
	Lets be clear on the basics. The only criterion for success or failure in publishing today is the number of copies sold and over what period of time. If the book doesnt sell, that is, if it doesnt recover the costs of production within, say, six months of its publication, it has bombed, and in a great many cases, it is then relegated to the bargain counters. From this follows the post-mortem, covering four main areas: the timing and relevance of the book for its intended readers, the price and terms of trade, the physical quality of production, and the sales promotion that accompanies any new book. Any these factors can make or mar the book. Editorial quality is often mentioned as the deciding factor, but this matters in the long run because it is not immediately discernible to the common reader.        
	Books that are anthologized from the occasional writings of well-known authors  they need not all be Nobel Laureates  very often go off well for two reasons. First, these authors are already well-known for the quality of their work, and their reputation goes a long way in a highly competitive market, where there are just too many books chasing too few buyers. Second, most of the anthologized pieces, culled from larger books or brought together from disparate sources, are short and possible to read in a single sitting, which the original books that made the authors reputation are often not.        
	This brings us to the changing nature of readership today. First, readers dont want to read more than what is strictly necessary now. There simply isnt the time, with our attention spans targeted by powerful images. Short pieces are much more acceptable, which means, in practical terms, not more than 7,500-10,000 words and finished books not exceeding 250 pages  anything more would need to be pruned to make it saleable. All great writers recognize you cant have too much of a good thing, and therefore putting these pieces together is just a question of what should be included or left out. And all readers first browse through these selections before going on to buy more of the authors books. To put it simply, the anthologized writings of great writers sell more copies than their original works.        
	Above all, publishers spin out collections of bits and pieces of writings by great authors because such volumes are easier to produce: there are fewer copyright hassles and the writing has already been tested for its quality and relevance in the market. Its a win-win situation on all sides.

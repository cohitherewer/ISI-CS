                                                                                                                 NEW RULE                                                    
	The return to power of Benjamin Netanyahu, supported by a bevy of rightwing parties, cannot be good news for the Middle East. Mr Netanyahu, the leader of the Likud Party in Israel, is no stranger to the top job, having been the prime minister between 1996 and 1999. But this does not necessarily make him more competent to deal with the deepening crisis in the region. There is no reason to suspect that his rival, Tzipi Livni of the Kadima Party, would have been better suited to the task. Earlier, Ms Livni had staked moral claim to form the government after her party beat Likud by one seat (neither got an absolute majority). Even if morality had won the day, and Ms Livni become the ruler, the peace process in Israel could scarcely have got any better. The general elections have clearly shown that despite a fractured mandate, people have chosen the far-Right ultra-nationalists over the moderates. In the event of Ms Livnis premiership, the nation would have been encumbered with an ineffective Kadima government, easily overridden by the nationalist brigade on important foreign policy matters. So, it makes better sense for Kadima to sit in the opposition instead of playing into the hands of its opponents by aiming for the high chair.        
	If anti-incumbency has become a blessing in disguise for Kadima, the sudden turning of the tables in favour of Likud has left Mr Netanyahu in a spot. The popular will would like him to continue the Zionist struggle with renewed glory, but the West, particularly the United States of America, is increasingly pushing for the two-nation solution. Mr Netanyahu, though he proudly proclaims himself to be a pragmatist, was not on the best of terms with Bill Clinton. He dishonoured the Oslo peace accords in 1993, criticized Israels withdrawal from Gaza in 2005, and now wants to crush Irans hegemony to teach a lesson to the Hamas in Gaza and the Hizbollah in Lebanon, the obvious beneficiaries of Irans growing nuclear power. He is willing to concede the West Bank to a future Palestinian State, while retaining Israels strategic control over the borders and the airspace. But, like all politicians, Mr Netanyahu has a common weakness: he would love to remain in power by hook or by crook. If this requires him to strike deals that go against the grain of his ideology, he may not mind bending the rules just a little.

	Whos the father?        
	 A child filed an application for a declaration of legitimacy and directions for a DNA test before a family court. The defendant (the alleged father) resisted the application and denied any relationship with the mother, claiming that the mother was already married to another person, and that such a test would amount to infringement of his personal liberty. He also claimed that since the mother had stayed away from the proceedings, he alone could not be directed to undergo the test. The Madras High Court held that the DNA test of the father and the child can give accurate results even without the mother being tested. The Court also held that such a test did not amount to interference in ones personal liberty and hence the defendant should undergo the test to establish the truth about the childs paternity.

	Right recovery        
	 A man took a loan from the Karnataka State Financial Corporation (KSFC) to build a hotel. When he was unable to repay the loan, the KSFC auctioned the property. The man filed a writ petition, stating that the hotel could be sold for a much higher price and selling at the auctioned price was unfair and arbitrary. The Karnataka High Court held that although a notice for recovery had been published 10 times in newspapers, the man had not paid up and that the corporation was within its rights to recover what was due to it. (S.G. Lakshminarayana Naidu vs KSFC)                     
	Elephant death        
	 An elephant died from electrocution after coming in contact with a high voltage wire belonging to the Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation. The mahout asked for damages from the corporation. The corporation resisted the claim as only a sole witness, who was not even present on the spot, deposed that the elephant died after coming into contact with the wire. The Allahabad High Court awarded damages to the tune of Rs 7,00,000 to the mahout, holding that in case of an accidental death by electrocution, it was the liability of the Power Corporation to provide compensation. The Court also said that in this case, the onus was on the corporation to prove that the negligence was on the part of the mahout. (U.P. Power Corporation vs Bijendra Singh)  
	SOLON

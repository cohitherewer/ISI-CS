	On Friday, September 18, the English-speaking world celebrates the 300th anniversary of the birth of Dr Johnson  Samuel Johnson, author of its most famous dictionary. And it is right to celebrate.         
	Johnson truly was a man of letters. After a brief and unsuccessful venture as a schoolmaster, his entire living  and he survived until 1784  was made by writing, albeit from 1762 supplemented by a crown pension awarded in recognition of his work. His dictionary, published in 1755, after nine years of single-handed labour, has long been superseded. But, though not the first English dictionary, it was the pioneer of all our modern dictionary-making.         
	It included his own definitions of words, with supporting evidence, and clear distinctions between one meaning and another; plus an etymology, an account of the words origins. His citations of usage were aimed, as he put it, to contribute to the stability or enlargement of the language. But, though he accepted that language changes over time, stability more than enlargement was his aim: he concentrated on well-established words, not outlandish ones or passing novelties.         
	His etymologies, we know now, were sometimes mistaken. His definitions could be prejudiced. One famously reflects his dislike of literary patrons: Patron: commonly, a wretch who supports with insolence and is paid with flattery. Of his own trade he wrote: Lexicographer: a writer of dictionaries, a harmless drudge; and remarked that every other author may aspire to praise; the lexicographer can only hope to escape reproach.         
	Yet his dictionary was accepted as authoritative long into the 19th century. And praise for its author continues undiminished today. His reputation, of course, depends on more than his dictionary. He had in 1763 the good fortune to acquire the warm admiration and affection of an extraordinary acolyte, James Boswell, a Scottish lawyer 30-odd years younger than himself. Boswells Life of Samuel Johnson, published in 1791, is a lasting work of literature in itself.         
	Boswell meticulously recorded (or maybe meticulously edited and recorded?) Johnsons plain and forthright speech  a good deal plainer than some of his writing: for example, When a man is tired of London he is tired of life; or his view of a womans preaching like a dogs walking on his hinder legs  it is not done well, but you are surprised to find it done at all. A phrase of Boswells own nicely sums up the older mans combative style. Johnson: Well, we had a good talk. Boswell: Yes, Sir; you tossed and gored several persons.         
	Not that the two were always in accord. It must surely have been Boswell who dragged the 64-year-old Johnson off on a tour of the Hebrides, wet and windy islands off the north-west of Scotland, a country for whose people the Londoner Johnson had no huge esteem and did not greatly add to it during his visit to those islands and the mainland. And Boswell records a good-natured poke from his guru: Sir, you have but two topics, yourself and me. And I am heartily sick of both.        
	Besides his dictionary, Johnsons output was huge: a novel, a play, an edition of Shakespeare, many essays, poems long and short, political pamphlets, countless magazine articles and more. Very little of this is read today except by scholars and literary historians, though his Lives of the Most Eminent English Poets, a work of his old age, is  I am told  far from negligible.         
	What survives are three things; the memory of his honest, humane, generous and combative character; the many epigrams  they werent intended as such  that it gave rise to, culled from his own works and those of Boswell; and his dictionary. Few people, Id guess, have ever set eyes on it either. But many have heard of it, and every user of the language, however unaware of it, owes thanks to it and him.

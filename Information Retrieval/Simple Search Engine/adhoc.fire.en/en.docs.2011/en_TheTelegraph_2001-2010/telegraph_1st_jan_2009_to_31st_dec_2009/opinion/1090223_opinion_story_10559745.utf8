	A ship I once served in had a small brass plate on the bridge with a quotation from Thucydides, the Greek statesman, historian and seaman of the fourth century BC: A collision at sea can ruin your whole day. It is still true. In the North Atlantic Ocean, on the night of February 3-4, at an undisclosed depth, the British nuclear submarine, Vanguard, and the French nuclear submarine, Le Triomphant, ran into each other. Both boats were boomers, missile-firing submarines carrying 16 ballistic missiles, each of which can deliver several nuclear warheads at intercontinental range.         
	The North Atlantic is the second biggest ocean in the world. The submarines are considerably smaller: around 145 metres long. So there they are, puttering along at six knots or less, with an entire ocean to play in, and they run into each other. The damage was slight, but it ruined the day for two whole navies. How could they have been so stupid?        
	All right, its not quite that simple. The boomers  not just British and French missile-firing submarines but American and Russian ones too  congregate in specific parts of the Atlantic that are called nesting grounds. They need deep water that is relatively quiet, and they need to stay in range of their targets, so in practice they have only a quarter of the Atlantic to play with. That still ought to be enough, but they are also deliberately running blind. If they operated their active sonar, they would detect everything on and below the surface for many kilometres around them  but everything they heard would also hear them.They mustnt do that. Their job is to hide out in the depths of the ocean as a last-ditch nuclear deterrent that cannot be found and destroyed in a surprise attack. So they only run the passive sonar, which listens to all the noises in the water but does not give away their own positions.        
	Unfortunately, passive sonar cannot hear vessels that are not making any noise. Modern submarines are designed to be ultra-quiet. In this case, they actually closed to touching distance without detecting each others presence, which suggests either that the two boats are astonishingly quiet or that there were two very negligent sonar operators.                
	Stop cruising        
	The subs were obviously on courses that converged only slowly, because the damage was minor and all in the bows. If one had gone straight into the side of the other, however, then both of them could have been destroyed. Down to the bottom go their nuclear reactors, plus anything up to a 100 or so nuclear warheads on their missiles.We have just been reminded that although the Cold War ended 20 years ago, all the nuclear weapons are still there. Not only that, but the submarine-launched ones are still out on patrol as if this were 1975. There is not a single good reason for them all to be doing this, but nobody has told them to stop. Why not?        
	Because you dont know what the future might bring? I didnt say scrap the subs tomorrow, but tie them up in port and stop this nonsense. If we all end up in a new Cold War one day, then you can have them back, but why are they cruising around out there now? If you could all agree to stop these ridiculous patrols, it would be a useful step towards the more sweeping measures of nuclear disarmament that President Barack Obama has adopted as a serious goal.        
	Obama is the first occupant of the White House since Ronald Reagan with the vision to imagine a future free of nuclear weapons. He has a lot on his plate right now, but heres a step in the right direction that costs nothing: announce that the US Navy will no longer run combat patrols with its nuclear missile-firing submarines, and invite the worlds other nuclear weapons powers to follow suit. After this little demonstration of folly, theyd all come along pretty promptly.

                                                                                                                 NATURAL DIVIDE                                                    
	Whoever thought natural calamities united the people obviously did not think of West Bengal. Nothing happens in the state, it seems, without causing a political division. So, even a natural disaster, like the cyclone earlier this week and its devastations, is grist to the political mill. The cyclone, Aila, left a trail of devastation in Calcutta and many other parts of Bengal, ruining homes, making thousands homeless and disrupting power and drinking-water supplies. The administration in Bengal is not particularly known for its competence. That the civic and other authorities failed to deliver should be no surprise in a state which has long been known for its lack of a work culture. But what clearly worsened rescue and restoration efforts was the obstructionist approach of the Trinamul Congress. The partys leaders took a greater interest in blocking roads than in helping agencies supplying power, drinking water and other utilities. Its elected representatives stayed away from the meetings the chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, and the finance minister, Asim Dasgupta, called to coordinate relief measures in the districts. These politicians were more interested in exploiting the peoples suffering and discontent than in helping them. The cyclone, to them, was one more opportunity to settle scores with the Left Front government and the Communist Party of India (Marxist).        
	By acting in such a blatantly partisan manner, the TMC has tarnished its huge election victory. One of the reasons why the people so overwhelmingly voted for it was that they had been angry at the Marxists ways of politicizing all aspects of life in Bengal. This is an example Mamata Banerjee can certainly do without emulating. The peoples mandate for her party also indicated that they would like to see an end to this political culture. Elections are a time for contesting ideas and programmes of governance. But no people anywhere would like to see such contests disrupt their normal life. It is easy to see why the Opposition politicians behaved this way in the aftermath of the cyclone. The next round of elections  to 19 municipalities across the state  are a month away. These will be followed by polls to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation next year and to the assembly in 2011. The TMC cannot wait for the final push. But its disruptive politics does not inspire great hopes for change.

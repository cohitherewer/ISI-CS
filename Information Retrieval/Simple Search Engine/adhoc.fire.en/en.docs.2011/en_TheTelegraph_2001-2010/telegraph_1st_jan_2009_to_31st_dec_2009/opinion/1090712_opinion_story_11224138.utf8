                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Deadly fumes, dysfunctional state                  
	 Sir  The patch-up between rival trade unions in Calcutta over the governments proposal to ban polluting vehicles from the streets of the city reflects opportunistic politics at its worst. Even the Trinamul Congress is unwilling to protect the hapless citizens, who have no one to turn to, and are caught between deadly pollution and a dysfunctional government that chose to sleep over the high court order on polluting vehicles for more than a year. It is time for the civil society to speak up against the chaotic state of transport in Calcutta.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Subal Basu, Calcutta

      
	Card game          
	Sir  The editorial, States card (July 2), points towards the possibility of the worlds largest electronic-governance project beginning in India. The system of issuing a unique biometric identity card to every Indian citizen will empower democracy. Greater transparency will help curb corruption and improve social security. By now, the common man is quite comfortable with using mobile phones, computers or debit cards. So a unique ID card should not be difficult to handle.           
	Although the card is supposed to be issued to individuals who are 18 years or above, it may be useful to issue it from birth. To accommodate linguistic differences and make the system intelligible to less-educated people, local languages must be included alongside the national ones. The cards must be made user-friendly for the physically challenged. All this will require a lot of money and manpower. So efficient planning is essential to make the project a success.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
R. Subhranshu,Chandernagore, Hooghly     
	Sir  Nandan Nilekanis ambitious vision for India, and the sway of his vision over the countrys government are indeed noteworthy. But what is worrying is his enthusiastic assumption that the lives of average Indian citizens require the States surveillance. Nilekanis observations may lead one to imagine that he has not read the Constitution properly or attempted to understand how the citizen and the State are placed in it. The spirit of the Constitution holds the will of the citizens to be supreme. So, this spirit should actually translate into a situation where, instead of citizens being issued unique identity cards and monitored by the State, the process is executed in the reverse way.          
	Every government official should ideally be issued a unique identity card, which will make their activities transparent enough to be tracked by the citizens. The expenses involved in the process should be borne by the officials personally, and not by the public. This process should also apply to the global corporate houses and the people at the helm of international affairs, as they are the ones who control the national governments. In this case, the cost of the procedure should be met by the corporate houses themselves. The authority to decide on the mechanism and implementation of such a project should lie with the citizens.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
C.K. Raju, Kharagpur

                
	Sir  The editorial, States card, rightly points out the pitfalls of introducing unique biometric identity cards. It will be a hugely ambitious project and a great boon for the information technology sector if it happens in India. But, on the flip side, we will have Big Brother watching us all the time. New laws will have to be implemented to prevent illegal monitoring of citizens. Even if the State assures us that it will not misuse its power, who will keep a tab on the misuse of these ID cards by corrupt individuals? It is not without reason that activists have opposed the introduction of biometric cards in some developed nations.

	Unhealthy practice                  
	Sir  The Centre is reportedly considering a bill to prohibit doctors from accepting gifts from pharmaceutical companies (Bill to bar doctors from taking pharma gifts, Dec 1). Action ought to be taken against pathological laboratories that remit a certain percentage of their revenue to doctors for recommending patients to their labs. Doctors allegedly prescribe unnecessary tests to patients in order to get a commission. Healthcare expenses rise significantly because of this immoral nexus between doctors, pharma companies and pathological labs.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Conservative vote          
	Sir  Minarets are perhaps as unwelcome in China and France as they are in Switzerland (Neutral Chill, Dec 7). Closer home, the demolition of the Babri Masjid was a classic example of intolerance towards a minority religion. The 26/11 attack in Mumbai by terrorists is likely to make ties between religious communities even more tenuous. The Taliban impose their crude ideology on their own brethren in northwestern Pakistan. Besides, they also organize suicide attacks in Pakistani cities on a daily basis with abandon.          
	With fundamentalism of this nature sweeping the globe, a shift to the Right is now clearly discernible. Targeting symbols such as minarets is an indication that societies across the world are now defenceless in the face of the onslaught of religious extremism that threatens to rip apart the global secular fabric, which is cherished universally.          
	Yours faithfully,      
R. Narayanan, Ghaziabad

                
	Sir  Switzerland, a liberal nation, has voted in favour of a ban on the construction of minarets. Before condemning the incident, we must reflect on what could have prompted the Swiss to act in this manner. It is well known that Europe is undergoing a demographic shift. There are fears that the burgeoning Islamic population will result in the locals being outnumbered in their own continent. This, coupled with the fear of radical Islam, may have led the Swiss to ban the minarets.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Climbing high          
	Sir  Neither the Central nor the state governments has introduced measures to regulate the prices of foodgrains in spite of the public clamour. Every minister has been clucking in sympathy at the plight of the people but no concrete action has taken place. Sharad Pawars agricultural ministry has resorted to the refrain that the rise in the price of onion is only temporary. Under Pawars tenure, farmer suicides have continued in Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka.          
	While regulating prices, the government must ensure that there is no cascading effect on the prices of other items. Hoarders and black marketeers must be identified and their storehouses raided so that larger stocks come into the market.          
	Yours faithfully,      
S. Kamat, Bardez, Goa

                
	Sir  The government inevitably gets blamed for not taking steps to curtail rising prices. But it is not always the State that is responsible for the mess.The root cause of the problem is the unchecked growth of Indias population. The need for shelter to accommodate the countrys growing population has put pressure on agricultural land.           
	The trouble is that the Union government cannot do anything forcibly in a democracy like ours. India needs leaders like Sanjay Gandhi who can take drastic measures to check the growth of population. The time has come for some hard talks and tough decisions.          
	Yours faithfully,

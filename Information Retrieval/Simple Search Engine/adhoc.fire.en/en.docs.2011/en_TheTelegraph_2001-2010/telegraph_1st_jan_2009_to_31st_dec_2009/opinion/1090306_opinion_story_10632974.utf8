	 How important a painter was Amrita Sher-Gil (1913-1941)? And how important was she for modern Indian art? These questions are worth asking afresh only if they are asked and answered in an art-historical way, and not confused with questions of her beauty, the nobility of her family, the allure of her Indo-Hungarian background, and the bohemian brilliance with which she lived her tragically short life. It is one thing to live a brilliant life, and quite another to be a brilliant painter. But with Amrita, it has become virtually impossible now to separate the legend from the artist, the person from the personae. Looking at AMRITA SHER-GIL: AN INDIAN ARTIST FAMILY OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY (Photoink, Rs 3,500)  beautifully made, and based on exhibitions at the Tate Modern and the Haus der Kunst (Munich), curated by Chris Dercon in 2007  one is struck by how the perception of her art has now become inseparable from the self-conscious exoticism of the familial paraphernalia that she has become part of. Left to herself, it is possible that her best work would only appear to be at the threshold of something original. Amrita died when she was 28, and she got just about enough time, as a painter, to get some glimpses beyond her academic training in Paris. There is nothing remarkable about a young student of art being infatuated with Gauguin and Courbet, or with the Ajanta frescoes. What is really fascinating (and eventually a bit claustrophobic) about this book is the story that unfolds in it of how her life, her person and her paintings were, and continue to be, variously appropriated and incessantly fashioned and re-fashioned, first by her father, the photographer Umrao Singh Sher-Gil, and later by his gifted descendants, the most creative of these archivists being Amritas nephew, the contemporary artist, Vivan Sundaram, who has conceptualized this book with Dercon. Even Deepak Ananths exquisitely learned essay seems to be breathlessly in awe of this familys aristocracy (of spirit and of class), a quality that seems to express itself best through a sort of hand-me-down narcissism, be it in bromide or with Photoshop. It is time, perhaps, to unsettle the frames around Amrita, and come up with a truly objective critique of her art, which could go against the grain of her familys enduring aesthetic and emotional investments in what she stands for to them.

                                                                                                                 TARGET PRACTICE                                                    
	The Americans are once again on top. The new order in the United States of America has replaced the hesitant, blow-hot-blow-cold Bush doctrine on Pakistan (never more evident than after the Mumbai tragedy) with a definitive, iron-cast policy. True to all warnings, Barack Obamas first day in the White House saw him declaring Pakistan as the central front in the war on terror. The next few days witnessed his determination to bolster this front with the appointment of Richard Holbrooke, a special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan with wide-ranging powers. This was followed by the sanctioning of drone attacks on high-value terrorist targets that have carried the war deep into the tribal areas of Pakistan. These moves were supplemented by the wielding of smart power, which directly linked US aid to Pakistans performance in, and compliance with, this war within and beyond its borders. The result has been a drastic deduction of $55 million out of the $156 million bill set by Pakistan for its military expenses that Pakistan now attributes to an auditing hazard rather than to American vindictiveness.         
	Pakistan is undoubtedly hard-pressed  and trying to hide this. Having set an accommodative tone immediately before the change in presidency through a sudden spurt in anti-terror measures, it finds itself in an uncomfortable spot. The Obama administrations apparent backtracking in giving Kashmir the pride of place in its Afghanistan-Pakistan policy has been cause for further embarrassment. Both the civilian and the military establishments in Pakistan have, however, decided to let things be for now and get busy with the job at hand. While General Ashfaq Kayani is once again trying to seize the initiative from the Taliban, who have already overrun Swat, the prime minister, Yousuf Gilani, is doing his bit to convince the US and the world, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, that poverty is at the root of all ills in the region. Mr Gilani has also drawn attention to one peculiar aspect of the regional problem that Mr Obama should not forget in his zeal to do it all in a days work. Limiting military aid is all very well, but the high civilian casualties in the drone attacks are counter-productive even in the short run, and will do more harm than good to the American cause by uniting the dissenting tribals with the marauding militants.

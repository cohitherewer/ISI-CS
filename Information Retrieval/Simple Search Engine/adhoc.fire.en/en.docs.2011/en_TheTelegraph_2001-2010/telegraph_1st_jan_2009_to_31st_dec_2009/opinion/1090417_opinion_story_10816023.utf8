	Stinkspeak                  
	Sir  It is unfortunate that Indian politics has little to offer save the mud-slinging and personal attacks that leaders of all hues are exchanging among themselves in this election season (Tyranny of demonocracy, April 11). There is no longer any sense of decorum, only the zeal to ensure victory by means fair or foul. While the Varun Gandhis feel no qualms about delivering vitriolic speeches against a particular community in order to garner votes, a certain powerful party in West Bengal is asking Mamata Banerjee to disclose the amount she has received for driving away the Tatas from Singur. It seems that all norms of civility and decency have been thrown to the wind by political parties and their representatives. Indian politicians zealously gloat over the rich tradition of liberalism and humanity in their country when the real picture is far from it. Since India is the largest democracy, the general elections here are eagerly followed across the globe. It is a shame that Indian values have been rudely exposed to the world by a bunch of insensitive politicians.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Kajal Chatterjee, Sodepur

      
	Sir  With the Election Commissions announcement of the schedule for the general elections, the pitch of verbal abuse among politicians grew shriller. Such diatribes are as much directed against the policies or programmes of opponent parties as at the candidates themselves. One wonders why instead of limiting the criticism to election manifestoes, certain individuals choose to lavish so much time on campaigns to vilify their rivals. As the Indian democracy has matured, the values enshrined in the system of governance have been diluted instead of becoming entrenched. Taking advantage of the liberal provisions of the Peoples Representation Act, which allows anyone to contest polls by complying with some basic norms (which do not include restrictions in terms of educational qualifications, the number of times a candidate can contest, or the maximum age limit), a great many people with questionable integrity and educational background are jumping into the fray. For these self-serving individuals, elections are the means to achieve power, money and glamour. Being generally bereft of any concern for the development of the country, they are motivated solely by self-interest and ambition. During elections, they have nothing constructive to offer the voters, and so they engage in badmouthing. Sadly, many political leaders who maintain dignity in their speech and behaviour are unconcerned about the deterioration of electoral ethics, and reluctant to apply the brakes to arrest the erosion of democratic values. However, the real threat to Indias democracy lies in the apathy and indifference of the modern educated youth who tend to shy away from the elections.  
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  It is a matter of regret that aspiring leaders with foul mouths are having a field day in the wake of the general elections. Hardly a day goes by without a would-be representative spewing venom in public. The hooligan tongue is fast becoming the chief law-and-order problem of these polls and it is keeping the EC engaged. Whats worrying is that this oral offensive is neither the outcome of momentary lapse of discretion nor limited to exceptions  this is becoming an indispensable, and accepted, part of everyday political discourse.  
	The standards have been steadily falling over the past decade, and the campaign this time decidedly took off on a scary note, promising to plumb new depths. Even seasoned rallyists have faltered this time. If political leaders show restraint in their utterances and maintain dignity in their speeches, they will be best served by the electorate.  
	Yours faithfully,      
Dilbag Rai, Chandigarh

      
	Mind over money  
	Sir  In response to the editorial, Fee crisis (April 10), I would like to point out that government policies are solely responsible for the discontent brewing over the proposed salary hike for teachers, and the consequent increase in the fees of private schools. Increasing the salary of teachers is a good idea, but the accountability of the teachers should first be established. The new increment given to teachers is illogical since most students are forced to go for private tuition, which puts great financial pressure on the hapless guardians. So if private schools are forced to increase fees, then guardians too have no option but to take to the streets in protest. They are finding it increasingly difficult to foot the bill of rising educational expenses.           
	The advice that funding should be arranged through alumni associations sounds like wishful thinking. Unlike The Doon School, most of the schools do not have well-established alumni networks, and even if these exist, it is difficult to elicit regular contributions from them. The government has to step in to resolve this crisis. It must share some portion of the additional burden which schools are forced to take on as a result of the salary revision. While granting aids to the schools, the government can examine the fund position of the institutions. Schools also need to be reminded that they are not traders of goods and vegetables but agents of nation-building and as such, must shun the idea of profiteering. Teachers must put the education of their students first and selfish monetary concerns later.          
	Yours faithfully,        Soumendra Datta, Calcutta

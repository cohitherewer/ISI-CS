	The interim budget presented to Parliament by the acting finance minister, Pranab Mukherjee, met most conservative expectations but belied the more optimistic ones. A complete absence of any new tax measures was complemented by a few signals on the fiscal situation that will unfold over the next 18 months: a frightening scenario. The vote on account also included the usual perquisites for rural voters at election time: a new programme for widows, a larger-than-budgeted farm waiver programme and an enlarged rural employment guarantee scheme. Add to this a larger corpus for the rural infrastructure development fund (Rs 14,000 crore), and a 35 per cent increase in defence spending in light of new security threats (about Rs 1,42,000 crore).         
	Missing was a third stimulus package, and its omission was perhaps a well-advised decision. For folded into the highlights of the United Progressive Alliance governments achievements over the last five years were a few hair-raising numbers. For one thing, government borrowings are likely to be much higher (at Rs 3,62,000 crore); at the same time, tax collections are expected to continue to fall, which will widen the fiscal deficit further. The consolidated fiscal deficit, including off-balance sheet items and state deficits, is expected to be over 10 per cent of the gross domestic product in 2009 and 2010. Should the global economy worsen, that number could go higher, perhaps to even 11 per cent of the GDP, driving the debt-to-GDP ratio to above 80 per cent. The next government has the unenviable task of presenting the full budget in May.        
	While going through the highlights of the two stimulus packages announced by the government in November and December 2008, Mr Mukherjee took pains to point out that the new government may have to consider additional fiscal measures to battle the slowdown. But will the new government have any room for fiscal manoeuvre? New measures are likely to put additional pressure on the finances of the states and the Central government. What is needed is a fast turnaround from the slowdown; and even here, there could be some surprise developments. A return to growth could also be a return to inflation if it is timed wrong, nullifying the gains from the growth impetus. But a slow, prolonged downturn could be hard to recover from, and take longer too. The government has taken some prudent non-fiscal measures, such as liberalizing the norms and guidelines for foreign direct investment. Another politically difficult decision the new government may want to consider and may perhaps be forced to  is selling more of its stake in large public sector undertakings. A third step, again fraught with political difficulty, is deeper financial sector reforms along the lines recommended by the Percy Mistry committee and the Raghuram Rajan committee. Taking these steps will need courage, astuteness and the skilful use of political capital.

	Blaming India for its domestic problems is an old ploy routinely used by Nepals politicians. It should, therefore, not worry New Delhi too much that Prachanda, the countrys former prime minister and leader of its Maoist party, is doing the same. But his latest complaint about Indias naked interference in Nepal is both unfair and surprising. Prachanda and his comrades had no problem using New Delhi in order to strike a deal with other political parties in Nepal. The Maoist leader knows all about Indias role in the peace process that ended their 13-year-long insurgency. If he is now singing a different tune, it only shows his desperation to regain control of Nepalese politics. Curiously, while blaming India for Nepals domestic problems, the Maoist leader also wants to talk to India, rather than to the puppet government in Kathmandu. He seems to have no problem doing business with New Delhi only if he can benefit from it. But New Delhi cannot be interested in helping only the Maoists in Nepal. Indias strategic interest is to ensure peace and stability in Nepal and not allow it to become the frontier of another great game. The Maoists, on the other hand, have no use for peace or democracy if it does not help them take power. This strategy threatens both the peace process and the future of multi-party democracy in Nepal.        
	Yet, there can be no peace in the Himalayan country unless the Maoists want it. Nobody denies that they are a major political force and that their cooperation is essential for the success of the peace process and the fledgling democracy. The Maoists have the power to stir violence or destabilize the political process. The manner in which they recently announced the formation of a dozen autonomous states suggests that they could undermine the election to the constituent assembly. Democracy in Nepal has no hope if the Maoist game is not defeated. It is primarily the responsibility of the people of Nepal and the countrys two major democratic parties  the Nepali Congress and the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist)  to ensure that the country does not end up with a one-party rule. New Delhi, too, should call the Maoists bluff and do all it can to help multi-party democracy flourish in Nepal. A communist Nepal may be in Chinas interest, but it will add to Indias security concerns in the east.

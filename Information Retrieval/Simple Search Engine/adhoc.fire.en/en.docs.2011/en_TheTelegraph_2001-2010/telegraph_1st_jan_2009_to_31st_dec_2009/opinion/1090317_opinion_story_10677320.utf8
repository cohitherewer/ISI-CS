The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | ROAD SHOW
                                                                                                                 ROAD SHOW                                                    
	The long march in Pakistan has been cut short by the abrupt capitulation of the government to the persistent demand for the reinstatement of the deposed supreme court chief justice, Iftikhar Chaudhry. But the show of defiance has gone on long enough to deal an irreparable blow to the image of the Pakistan Peoples Party-led government and to the credibility of the president, Asif Ali Zardari. The nation has had to watch Nawaz Sharifs unabashed heroism, the armys intervention, revolt within the PPP and, in the end, refusal by some government officials to follow orders (which included firing on the protesters). The PPP government has now not only conceded the original demand of the long march  the restoration of Mr Chaudhry  but has also acceded to the top-ups: the return of a Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) government in Punjab and an appeal to the court for the removal of the embargo on Mr Sharifs, and his brothers, participation in politics. The last two fringe demands had become an invariable part of the movement once Mr Zardaris foolhardiness had forced Mr Sharif to throw in his weight behind the lawyers march. This transformed the march into a political rally, headed by a political leader with a specific political purpose. With the concessions, Mr Sharifs cause has been served, but it is doubtful how much the lawyers have gained. By allowing Mr Sharif to lead their show, they have identified themselves with a political cause which is unlikely to be realized with Mr Chaudhrys return alone. Given the severely compromised standing of the judiciary, it may not be surprising to find Mr Zardaris nightmares about political persecution becoming a reality in the coming days as surely as Mr Sharifs had become only days ago.         
	Unlike Mr Sharif, however, Mr Zardari has no space to manoeuvre. His plans to render the Sharifs powerless have reduced him to a villain in the peoples eyes. His space within his party is even more cramped, given that his favouritism has forced so many to choose sides. He cannot turn against his rebellious prime minister without destroying his partys government, and perhaps the party itself. Neither can he quell the oppositions demand for the curtailment of presidential powers, now that he may find his own party supporting it. Worse, if the camaraderie between the prime minister and the army chief blossoms, he may even find that he is dispensable.

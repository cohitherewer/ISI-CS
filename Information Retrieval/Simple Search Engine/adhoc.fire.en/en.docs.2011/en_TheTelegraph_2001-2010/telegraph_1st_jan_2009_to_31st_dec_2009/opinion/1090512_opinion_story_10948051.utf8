The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | In the heat and dust
                                                                                                                 IN THE HEAT AND DUST                                  Malvika Singh                              
	Only the Indian electronic media and its anchors can present breaking news on something that was never said before, based on unadulterated speculation, having misinterpreted a statement or a comment. Often, the rendering of the information in high octaves comes across as deliberate distortion, much like the sound of the hysterical voice. Viewers have begun to watch just the true images and disregard the spoken fiction that never seems to match the truth. Often, words are taken out of sentences, sentences out of contexts, all in an effort to emphasize the personal views of the anchor. This expensive charade is beginning to irritate. I met a doctor this morning, a fine specialist, who told me categorically that he has refused to appear on television because of misquoting, misrepresenting, and because, in most shows, the anchor wants to answer the question he or she asks! That is the tragedy of the English-language channels.        
	With the end of campaigning for the 2009 elections, India has to now endure the crude visuals and I-knew-it-all pontifications  the real horrors of our democracy. National and regional leaders will be jockeying for lucrative seats at the Centre, regardless of the party or the person that leads the forthcoming coalition. Opportunism will be at its peak, dalali at its active best, and India will watch this larger-than-life game of betrayal, exploitation and greed laced with sub-standard acumen, a profound lacuna of fresh ideas, and uncouth speech and action. In all of this, some will stand out and apart  they, hopefully, will be the future.                
	Only connect        
	As the grand political charade ends, some of the more recent images will dominate the mindscape and create unbelievable pictures on the minds eye  of Jayaprada threatening to commit suicide if she loses; of Varun Gandhi insinuating that he will chop off the hands of people who defy his point of view and ideology; of Lalu Prasad abusing Rahul Gandhi for saying what he did not; of prettily packaged damsels, independent candidates, who have had enough of politics wanting to do good for all those privileged complainers who went off for a long weekend and did not vote; of Mayavati reading from her text; of Sonia Gandhi speaking extempore; of the secular Nitish Kumar in hold-hands-raise-arms salaam with Narendra Modi in a show of strength and comradeship; of the sweltering heat and much dust. Reports from the ground say one thing and the television analyses say something else. Are we being bombarded with middle- class propaganda?        
	The time to leave town and disappear into the wilds without access to television is on May 13, when, after five in the evening, we shall be bombarded with personalized interpretations of exit polls taken from an unusually silent voter. Then on May 16, when the counting begins, losing spokespeople will repeatedly inform us to wait for their victory till the end of the day. Editors and columnists will give us their gyan, some will brazenly switch political sides and comments will get differently nuanced overnight.         
	We shall all recover from the auditory and visual exhaustion of the polls and their results on May 17, and then face the embarrassment of political wheeling and dealing for another week thereafter. However, in all this seeming confusion, a new trajectory is emerging, nudging itself out of the damaged and gashed surface of our nation-state. Will it bring a future that disassociates itself from the exclusive patterns of growth and governance? Will it encourage the haves to create more wealth and opportunities for those who have been neglected for decades? Will forgotten Indians, those far away from the highways that link us, who live beyond the by-passes, be connected?

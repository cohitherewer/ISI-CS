	Diversity cannot flourish, or even survive, in a society that abhors freedom. If communist regimes have a history of destroying ethnic diversity, it is primarily because of the political ideology that leaves little room for individual freedom and pluralism. The riots in Xinjiang in western China and the brutal crackdown on the Uighur community there evoke memories of Josef Stalins answer to the so-called nationalities question in the former Soviet Union. The riots, which saw at least 156 killed and nearly a thousand others injured, are clearly the worst tragedy of its kind since the founding of New China in 1949. Given Chinas record of distorting truth and statistics, the tragedy could well be much worse than these figures suggest. But the enormous political significance of the bloodbath in Urumqi, the capital of the Xinjiang province, is too obvious even for China to deny. It has shaken the Chinese leadership and exposed the chinks in the edifice of the Chinese Communist Partys rule. The panic that has gripped the Chinese leadership is evident from the fact that President Hu Jintao had to cancel his engagements at the G8 summit in Rome and return to Beijing. The regions oil and gas reserves and its proximity to a geo-politically sensitive Central Asia make the uprising there particularly worrying for China.         
	But the Chinese communists have only themselves to blame for this revolt by the Uighurs. As in Tibet, the rule of the Han Chinese is hated and opposed everywhere in the Xinjiang autonomous province. The reasons for this are similar in both regions. The Uighurs, an Islamic people with Turkic origins, have, like the Tibetans, nothing in common with the Han Chinese. The anger of the Uighurs, like that of the Tibetans, is born of both fear and deep despair. The rule of the majority Han community in both Tibet and Xinjiang means loss of freedom and economic opportunities for the ethnic groups native to the regions. Both regions have seen the native populations being swamped by massive infiltrations of the Han Chinese. Both communities face severe restrictions on pursuing their religious and cultural freedoms. The prosperity in both regions has mostly benefited the Han Chinese. This is not the first time that the Uighurs anger has exploded. It may not be the last time either, unless Beijing revisits its policies on ethnic minorities.

	With the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall coming up in a week, Europe might want to remind itself that Angela Merkel grew up on the other side of the wall. She is a Protestant physicist from the communist east, and this is proving to be a very solid muddle. With a mix of doggedness and pragmatism, she has managed to hold on to her chancellorship in Germany for a second term. She was Germanys first female chancellor in 2005, and many in the Chancellery had begun calling her Mutti or Mummy behind her back. But will Mummy morph into some sort of a Germanic Iron Lady, now that she has got rid of her former coalition partners, the Social Democrats, and taken on the Free Democrats? The Social Democrats have had their worst drubbing since World War II, but Ms Merkels party, the Christian Democrats, have suffered too. But the German two-vote electoral system allows for contradictory bedfellowships to form at different levels of the political system. The voters can vote somebody in while voting his or her party out, through a split between the local and national levels of representation. Ms Merkels strength is her ability to adapt her centre-right position to whoever she finds herself in power with. So many hope that Merkel II is going to be more liberal with the economy than Merkel I, after being unshackled from the Left. But left, right and centre are not that clear-cut in the way she governs. Pulling Germany out of its worst economic crisis since the War would mean being cautious with the tax-cutting promises being pushed by her new partners.        
	So which is the real Angela Merkel? At the recent G20 meeting, she had stolen the Lefts thunder by leading the demand for capped bonuses and for closer regulation. Although tax-cuts have been the campaigning feather for both the Christian and the Free Democrats, fighting high unemployment and curbing public spending will have to be high on the Merkel II agenda, however free from the Left she may have made herself now. In her eclectic new style of centrism, Ms Merkel now forms a natural triumvirate with Nicolas Sarkozy and David Cameron, looming over what now appears to be the pan-European demise of the Left. For New Labour and Gordon Brown, this might be the space to watch, with Ms Merkel a redemptive role model in the kind of trust she (more than her party) continues to inspire in the Germans.

Commentarao - S.L. Rao                                                            
	China suggested (before the G-20 meeting) that the dollar need not be the worlds reserve currency. It could be the Special Drawing Rights of the International Monetary Fund.The implications for India could be profound. The unipolar world since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 may now be succeeded by a multi-polar global economic regime with less globalization.         
	World currencies were expressed in terms of gold until 1914. The stock of gold was limited and countries had to exercise restraint in issuing currency beyond their gold holdings. The principal power was Britain, which went off the gold standard in 1914 to have freedom in funding its military operations in World War I. In 1925, Churchill took Britain back to the gold standard. After World War II, the dominant economic power was the United States of America. Between 1946 and 1971, exchange rates were fixed in relation to the US dollar, with gold price pegged at $35 per ounce. France used this peg to exchange dollars for gold, thus depleting American gold holdings. The US also had to fund huge expenses on account of Lyndon Johnsons Great Society programme. Finally in 1971, in order to fund the Vietnam War, Nixon removed the fixed price for gold at which the US would exchange dollars. This enabled a massive expansion of dollars in circulation.         
	Most international trade and financial transactions have, since then, been expressed in dollars. The overwhelming size and power of the US economy and its continuous improvements in productivity gave confidence to the world in parking surplus funds in US treasury bonds and other US investments. This continuing inflow of foreign funds enabled the USA, especially under George W. Bush, to spend in excess of revenues. This added massively to liquidity. The low interest rates decided by the Federal Reserve used to keep the American economy on a path of growth of economy and employment, led to a housing bubble, huge credit-card purchases, and speculation by banks, financial institutions and insurance companies in novel financial products.               
	The almost uncontrolled expansion of credit made the American economy a dissaving economy. In truth, foreign funds paid for much of government, business and individual expenditures. The credit bubble burst in 2008 and the speculative loan packages by financiers were worth less than what was shown in their books. As the American economy went into free fall with layoffs and closures, the lesson was that the economy had to live within its means and increase savings. The confidence of the rest of the world in the dollar as a reserve currency in which to park their savings was disturbed. Even the American treasury secretary, Tim Geithner, has said that the dollar is no longer king, but will remain a dominant currency.         
	There is no other currency that approaches the dollar, backed by a large economy and common usage. The euro could become one, but it is not accepted as currency even in some European Union countries.         
	An alternative is the mechanism of the SDR created by the IMF in 1969. They are potential claims on the freely usable currencies of members of the IMF. SDRs are not currency; the IMF is not a bank. Some countries peg their currencies against SDRs or use SDRs to denominate some private international financial instruments. SDRs, or paper gold, are credits that nations with balance of payment surpluses can draw upon nations with balance of payments deficits. They are accounting transactions within a ledger of accounts. The total amount of SDRs can not be expanded at will.         
	The exchange value of the SDR is announced every day by the IMF, reflecting the values of the four currencies of the world on which it is based. They are the US dollar with 44 per cent weight, the euro with 34 per cent, the Japanese yen with 11 per cent, and the pound sterling with 11 per cent. The basket is reviewed every five years. It is out of date, with no representation for the Chinese renminbi, although China has the largest foreign exchange reserves in the world, almost double that of Japan .        
	The SDR, even if it becomes a currency and the IMF a bank with deposits, cannot be a suitable replacement for the dollar. SDRs cap the number of SDRs relative to their total balance of payments or further borrowings from other countries. If the dollar is not replaced by another reserve currency, some commodities like oil will take its place. Without a reserve currency, countries might accumulate stocks of important commodities as hard assets. This could push up their prices and the countries will play the market. Oil is a good candidate for this purpose. Opec would like it to be so.         
	In the last decade, there has been a vast expansion on the amount of dollars in the market as US government expenditures rose and Americans consumed to excess. Excess supply of dollars had pushed the dollar value down in past months, reducing the value of savings parked in the US in dollars by countries like China. It also lowered the value of dollar-designated commodities like oil. It is believed that one reason for the rise last year in oil prices to $140 was that the price delivered less value to the oil producers because of the dollar-value decline. More recently, the dollar has recovered despite the vast spending on stimulus packages in the US. This perhaps reflects the desire of countries holding dollar assets to protect the dollar value, in their own interests.         
	Until their dollar holdings come down, a switch from the dollar to any other reserve currency will not be easy. It will take careful planning over a period by the countries withdrawing from the dollar. A more likely scenario is that countries might, over time, reduce their dollar holdings.               
	Can the dollar be replaced by SDR as reserve currency? This is not possible because SDR is not a currency; the IMF is not a bank and does not accept deposits. The dollar as reserve currency offers flexibility to countries. The continuous addition to dollars in circulation meant that more could be borrowed. The expansion of dollars has enabled the volume of financial transactions to be many times a multiple of actual trade in goods and services. It enabled considerable currency speculation with an array of complicated financial products. The SDR is not available to individuals or businesses, but only to governments (unlike the dollar) and will not permit such speculation.         
	Without the dollar as reserve currency, India might experience greater currency stability and less currency speculation. But India must continue to reduce dollar holdings and diversify into other strong currencies. Prices of some key commodities like oil, uranium, gold, diamonds and food grains, might rise, in times of shortage, as they replace the dollar as reserve currency. Global interest-rates may actually rise since the US may not pump in as much dollar liquidity. The American savings rate will rise as individuals and companies manage their finances more rationally. As the US learns to live on its earnings and not on the savings of other countries, there might be a decline in living standards in the US and in the dollars exchange value. As an export destination, the US will be big but not of the same relative magnitude as it has been.         
	India has to be prepared for higher prices of commodities that it mostly imports. This will affect our balance of trade unless we can sharply increase the export of services. These are less likely because of the shrinking of the US market. The globe will turn more inward. India will have to look more towards its own domestic markets and learn to live within its means.

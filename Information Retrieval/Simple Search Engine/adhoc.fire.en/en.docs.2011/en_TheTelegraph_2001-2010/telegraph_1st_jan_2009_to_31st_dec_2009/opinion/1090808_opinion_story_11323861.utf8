	Far from the street fighting years                   
	Sir  Mamata Banerjee has evolved into a shrewd political leader from being just another street fighter. In spite of the Singur fiasco, she had scored a huge victory in the polls. Now she is asking for 600 of the 1,000 acres  that were allotted to the Tatas  for a railway factory (Mamata factory plan on Nano site, Aug 4). The rest are to be returned to the farmers. If her demand is met, it will prove doubly advantageous. Not only will it take care of unemployment, the farmers will also get some of their land back.          
	Yours faithfully,         Pijush Kanti Mukherjee, Thane
        
	Clean game          
	Sir  The sports minister, M.S. Gill, while trying to convince Indian cricketers to fall in line with the World Anti-Doping Agency guidelines, has said that several other sporting federations and individual players are also following them (Minister opposes BCCI stand, Aug 8). It seems that Gill is not aware that many sporting figures from various disciplines have opposed the proposal. Among tennis players, Rafael Nadal, Andy Murray and Serena Williams have expressed their reservations. The Manchester United coach, Alex Ferguson, is of the opinion that the Wada rules are a real nuisance. The Professional Players Association of Britain has termed this system obsolete and ineffective, while the European Union has called it cruel and intrusive. The Wada also faces a legal challenge from about 65 sporting personalities of Belgium across different fields against the controversial whereabouts clause. The sports minister should have kept these details in mind before making his statement.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Varun Purty, Jamshedpur

      
	Sir  The Wadas rules have been formulated to weed out people in sports in the habit of using drugs. So the controversy over the issue is silly. Several countries and sporting associations abide by the Wada guidelines.           
	The anxiety over the whereabouts clause is unfounded. This clause, which requires sports persons to declare their whereabouts, is meant to help Wada officials locate them to carry out the tests. Indian cricketers should not feel that their privacy would be threatened by this clause. Many eminent sportspersons have already signed up for the tests. It is time Indian cricketers also gave up their apprehensions and co-operated with the rules. That would be a small price to pay to keep sports free from substance abuse.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Ashok Kumar Ghosh, Calcutta

                          
	Bad idea          
	Sir  It surprises me how an educated individual like Abhishek Bachchan agreed to be associated with a television campaign that encourages people to walk while they talk on their cell phones. The advertisement is absolutely unthinking. People have been known to die crossing roads or railway tracks while talking on their cell phones.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Kishore Chatterjee, Calcutta

                
	Sir  I am glad that Idea Cellular Limited, reacting to the criticism against its latest advertisement, has been forced to add a disclaimer. The advertisement now comes with a cautionary note that it is inadvisable to talk while crossing roads.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

                          
	Parting shot          
	Sir  In response to the Auto Bachao Committee, a Nagarik Bachao Committee should be set up. After all, people are at the receiving end of pollution. It appears that all political parties support the wrong people to seek votes. If the Opposition backs the Auto Bachao Committee, who is going to lobby for the common man?          
	Yours faithfully,       
U. Sharma, Calcutta

	State of helplessness                  
	Sir  Does the law of the land prevail in West Bengal? Here autorickshaws block major roads to press their illegal demands. Students harass college principals in the name of justice. Members of the legislative assembly assault policemen for questioning their violation of traffic rules. Any political party can block off the administration from parts of the state. The elections are being held under their dictates. These are all punishable offences, yet no offender will be brought to book. Is the administration really so helpless?           
	Yours faithfully,       
Samindra Mohan Roy, Calcutta 

      
	Under a shadow          
	Sir  I smell a political conspiracy behind the decision of the Central Bureau of Investigation to allow Interpol to withdraw the red corner notice in Ottavio Quattrocchis name (Quattrocchi off Interpol list, April 29). What is the purpose of seeking the detention of a man if there is no political resolve to extradite him, or if no crime is thought to have been committed in the first place?           
	The attorney-general, the Union minister of law and justice, a puppet CBI and the prime minister, family friends of the Quattrocchis and the Congress leadership have all ensured that the Indian criminal justice system is completely undermined. Arun Jaitley has rightly commented that this is the Congresss farewell gift to the nation.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
K.S. Jayatheertha, Bangalore 

                
	Sir  The latest move in the Bofors scandal initiated by the attorney-general, Milon Banerjee, so that Interpol withdraws the red corner notice against Ottavio Quattrocchi, takes the cake.           
	But why is it that after two decades of inquiry that proved nothing against Quattrocchi, he remains under suspicion? Suspicion alone is not sufficient for punishment. So Banerjees move seems to be an attempt to clear the image of the CBI, which has failed to resolve legal cases abroad independently. Had the CBI been more efficient, it would have been able to execute the warrant issued in 1992 against Warren Anderson, the former chairman of the Union Carbide Corporation and a prime accused in the Bhopal gas tragedy.           
	People always clamour for a CBI investigation when something major happens. But they should remember that the CBI inquiry into the Babri Masjid demolition failed to nail L.K. Advani and that the CBI failed to prosecute Jagdish Tytler and Sajjan Kumar for the Delhi riots of 1984.           
	The CBI fails because it wants to. The political control over the bureau is too strong to be resisted. The only way to ensure impartial inquiry is to free the CBI from government control and let it run professionally. Bofors is still an emotional issue. So the CBI and the government should have acted with a little finesse.           
	Yours faithfully,         B.K. Chatterjee,Faridabad                         
	Parting shot           
	Sir  The ugliest reality today is the way children treat their parents, especially those children who are well off and are enjoying their parents property. It is indeed a pity that this is the way children repay their parents for their selflessness (Space for 88-year-old dad, April 28).           
	Parents often deprive themselves of luxuries so that their little ones can have a better future. Yet many of them spend their last years in hovels. If this is not a sign of social decay, what is? Should parents then have no expectation from their children? Can they not hope for anything but deprivation, disregard and inhumanity? It is good that the judiciary has come forward to defend parents from the greed of their children. But more needs to be done.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Pranab Hazra, Asansol

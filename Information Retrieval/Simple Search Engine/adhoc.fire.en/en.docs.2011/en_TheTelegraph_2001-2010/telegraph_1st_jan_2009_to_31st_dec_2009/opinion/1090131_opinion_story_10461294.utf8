The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Letters to Editor
                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	The odd rise and fall                  
	Sir  In spite of its rapid fluctuations, inflation has now been moving around a low index at five to six per cent, compared to the double digit inflation index in the recent past. The prices of petrol and diesel have also been decreasing consistently (Kitchen gas, oil cheaper, Jan 29). But citizens do not see any effect of the fall while purchasing everyday commodities. From where do economists and statisticians get the indices of Indian finance? Are the indices correct at all? Although fuel prices are down, why is the transport fare not coming down?          
	Yours faithfully,        Raj Begwani, Calcutta
        
	Hidden face          
	Sir  Some people may have savoured the media report on the legendary actress, Suchitra Sen (Veil lifts on grandma Suchitra, Jan 18). Her blurred images, evidently taken with hidden cameras, may have satisfied peoples curiosity. But the media violated professional ethics by exposing the pictures of a lady who, of her own volition, had chosen seclusion and had even renounced the Dadasaheb Phalke award in 2006.           
	A regional news channel telecast the actresss present-day images throughout the day. As a token of respect to her, I did not watch the programme. But it was difficult to ignore the front-page news coverage in The Telegraph. That put the daily on an equal footing with any other tabloid. It is unfortunate that the media would go to any length to increase sales or to pull up the TRP. This lack of ethical discretion reduces journalists to mere salesmen of news.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Manojendra Gupta, Calcutta

      
	Sir  Suchitra Sens fans have not appreciated the medias distasteful exposure of the actresss present images. Sen has chosen a life of seclusion and spiritual practice. While some of her contemporary actors are still working in films, commercials and soaps, even if in minor roles, Sen has maintained a distance from the limelight. The picture of a grey-haired Sen has satisfied the inquisitive. But it will not erase the actresss youthful smile and evergreen beauty etched in our memories.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Tania Moulik, New Delhi

      
	Sir  What did the media achieve by breaching the privacy of Suchitra Sen? Did the correspondent seek permission from the actress regarding the publication of her blurred image on the front page?           
	A news channel kept showing her images all through the day. The media have transgressed their boundaries. This has outraged many people. Many of us regard her as the epitome of grace and the greatest actress of Bengali films. I hope, not optimistically though, that the newspaper and the news channel will apologize to Sen and to all offended viewers. I am sure that this sentiment echoes the feelings of most educated and civilized Bengalis.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Arya K. Sengupta, New Delhi

                
	Sir  The article on Suchitra Sen was very touching. The image accompanying the report on the elderly actress, although blurred, has at last satiated the curiosity of her fans. She looked almost unidentifiable and absolutely different from what she was like decades ago on screen, although she still seems quite graceful in her appearance.           
	Sens ageing proves the bitter truth of show-business that its glamour is transient. Nothing is permanent here. But the elegant actress will always remain in the hearts of Bengalis.          
	Yours faithfully,      
R. Ranganathan, Jamshedpur

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Poised between mistrust and faith
                                                                                                                 POISED BETWEEN MISTRUST AND FAITH                                  Long queues at booths, images of death, bittersweet memories of a departed car  Calcutta votes in 2009                                            
	Some weeks ago, as I was racing down the stairs of the Chandni Chowk metro station, a burly policeman stopped me to inspect my bag. As I waited for his leisurely rummaging to get over, I heard him holding forth to a colleague in inimitable Benglicized Hindi. People didnt vote in Mumbai this time, he declaimed, because they are fed up with the governments failure to deal with terror. The other man nodded obediently. It turned out, he was from Bihar, and supported Nitish Kumar. This information unleashed yet another torrent of analysis from our wise man from Bengal.        
	I couldnt possibly have lingered any longer without appearing suspicious, so I didnt catch the finer details. But I was stumped by the first mans patronizing tone, charged with an innate sense of entitlement: Look here, Im a clued-in Bong, the smugness on his face gave out, while the hint of a crooked smile added, Of course, on top of being a cop!        
	Standing in queue at my local polling booth this morning (in that faintly disreputable area near the Kalighat temple), I imagined that smug pulish joining a similar queue in another part of the town, with so many others who make up the incredible turnout that gives Calcutta the lead, for a change, over other Indian metros. Whereas about one out of two people stepped out to vote in Mumbai, Delhi and Bangalore, Calcutta flocked to the booths trailing rare clouds of glory.        
	This general election has been, by far, the most technologically sophisticated in the history of Indian democracy. Wherever you are, whoever you are, they have got to you. They have invaded your inbox, bombarded you with SMS, sashayed past your bedroom window in open trucks; their servile smiles have flashed on your internet search engine; their tuneless songs have made you jump from your afternoon siesta. Yes, they have tried all means to make you part of their tamasha.         
	Is that why we are here? I wondered scanning the faces around. Who could tell what Potolbabu, clutching his bagful of potols, was thinking? Why did the generously proportioned mashima, looking rather sorry in the heat, bother to queue up? At ten in the morning, the ladies of the night, some still in their regalia, were giggling over Shatabdi Roys full-sleeved blouses. When only 43 per cent turned out to vote in South Mumbai, an SMS joke blamed it on the lack of valet parking; wondered if the rich folks had gone off for the long weekend; or perhaps they were horrified to discover their servants queuing up with them? Does this mean that Calcuttans voted in great numbers precisely because there is no South Mumbai in their city?        
	Suranjan Gupta, a senior economic analyst with a leading export promotion council, has lived and worked outside Calcutta. He agrees that the limited affluence of Calcutta works in favour of the electoral turnout. Low income implies an existential dependence on state-sponsored health care, education and security. So the economic factor, along with a tradition of public interest in politics going back to the time of the undivided Communist Party, probably keeps a political consciousness alive in the public domain.         
	But there is scepticism, indifference and apathy as well. Amit Sen, a doctor from Calcutta now based in London, admits, Im not sure if politically conscious is synonymous with politically prudent or even with politically honest. Had Calcuttans belonged to either of the last two categories, the CPI(M) would not have reigned over them for three decades. Then there is the educated elite who refuse to choose between the devil and the deep blue sea; but this is a global, not a regional, phenomenon. The only common ground among Indian voters and those over the world, Sen says, is that nobody trusts the politicians anymore. Incidentally, two countries with an unenviable history of governance also went to polls during the first phases of the Indian election. Indonesia had its third free and fair polls since Suharto resigned in 1998, while South Africa elected their new president, Jacob Zuma. In both places, people turned out in huge numbers. Democracy triumphed over the peoples mistrust of politicians.        
	The fallout of such mistrust is festering anger: so much of the electionspeak, both in the media and in the campaigns this time, has been about extracting vendetta and venting fury (Give them the finger, exhorted one public-awareness campaign). Yet, the young had to be cajoled to wake up (Jaago re) by a tea company, or lured to the booths with generous promises of discounts by Delhi shops. The sniggering urbanites had to be spoilt silly to keep the democratic machine well-oiled.         
	Yet faith endures in mysteriously unpredictable ways. In the previous phase of polling, two college students had walked into their booths in Chinsurah, signed their names, got their fingers inked, then refused to cast their votes by invoking Section 49-0 of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961. In the presence of baffled presiding officers and belligerent political workers threatening dire consequences, they pronounced their decision loud and clear. Is it just by chance that this had happened in Bengal  and not in any other part of the country?                    SOMAK GHOSHAL

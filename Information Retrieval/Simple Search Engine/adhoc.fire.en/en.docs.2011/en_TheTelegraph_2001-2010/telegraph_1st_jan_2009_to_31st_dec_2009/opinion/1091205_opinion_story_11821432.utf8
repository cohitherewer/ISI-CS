	Anantara presented Malavika Sarukkai (picture), an excellent Bharatnatyam dancer, who performed Dviprabaha Ganga and Jamuna at Shree Sadan on November 29. Sarukkais mesmerizing performance commenced with Gangavataran, which depicted the confluence of Bhagirathi and Aloknanda. Her strong and fluid movements helped the audience visualize the rhythm of a flowing river.        
	Next was Kaliya Mardana, which was inspired by the legend of Krishna defeating the serpent. Dviprabaha ended with a presentation that symbolized the flight of a majestic bird. The following presentation was a traditional dance number based on Tulsidass bhajan about Kaushalya at play with the infant Ram. This popular number created quite an impact because of Sarukkais interpretation and execution. The songs melody represented the notion of filial love effectively.        
	This was followed by tillana, a traditional number celebrating the rhythm and ecstacy of life. One was captivated by the mysterious charm of the diya lit in the background as well as by the images of the old banyan tree and of the Ganga as Sarukkai ended her spectacular performance. The organizers should be thanked for putting together such a wonderful show.

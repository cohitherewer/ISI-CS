                        Death of a religion      
	Jim Corbett of Kumaon (Penguin, Rs 200) by D.C. Kala is a rather mediocre attempt at documenting the life of one of Indias finest naturalists. Kala, by his own admission, screened six of the seven books written by Corbett while researching for his material. The end-result is fairly predictable: Kala pieces together events in Corbetts life that are well-known to those who are familiar with Corbett and his work. Be it Corbetts days as a railway inspector, his hunting adventures or his final retreat to Africa, most of the books content is already in the domain of public knowledge. This volume was originally published in 1979, and adds very little to what is already known about the man who is greatly loved in Kumaon.  Not Exactly Shangri-la (Rupa,   Rs 295) by Martin Moir is set in the fictional Himalayan kingdom of Kalapur, which bears an uncanny resemblance to Tibet. Timothy, an academic from Britain, and his spirited companion, an Indian woman by the name of Huma, are asked to help preserve and edit an important monastic document in the seemingly peaceful nation. Soon, they discover that the repressive rulers are utilizing a fake version of the chronicle to obliterate a past that threatens the very foundations of their regime. Meanwhile, the fragile peace is shattered by a resistance group, even as Timothy and Huma continue their quest to discover what had happened in the past. They emerge triumphant, after overcoming numerous difficulties. This book has all the ingredients of a thriller, but, in the end, Moir cooks up something that is barely palatable.    
	Post-Hindu India:   A discourse on   Dalit-Bahujan, Socio-Spiritual and Scientific Revolution (Sage, Rs 295) by Kancha Ilaiah works at two different levels. On the one hand, it is a cogent critique of Brahminism and the varna system. Ilaiah argues how the notion of varnadharma mdash; the idea of spiritual justice mdash; actually ends up strengthening Hinduism rsquo;s inherent inequities that have put this belief system on the path of self-destruction. Ilaiah rsquo;s attempts to establish Hinduism rsquo;s faulty interpretation of history, its anti-scientific credentials and its regressive nature are likely to evoke strong responses. At another level, Ilaiah rsquo;s book is also a detailed examination of the productive knowledge systems of the Dalit-Bahujan communities in Andhra Pradesh. There is a possibility that this book will be criticized for being reductive. After all, on some occasions, Ilaiah makes sweeping generalizations. Nonetheless, this is an important work simply because it offers refreshing insights into an old religion that is considered to be a way of life in India.
            
	The Other Woman: 16 tales of love and deception (HarperPerennial, Rs 250) edited by Monica Das does nothing to break the stereotypical image of the ldquo;dark temptress rdquo; who goes about seducing gullible men and bringing untold misery upon their pious wives. There is an attempt to cast a sympathetic look at the Other Woman, who, for all her dangerous charms, is a victim of repression and lust, but it comes across as pretty cosmetic. Save for Sunil Gangopadhayay rsquo;s ldquo;Our Manorama rdquo;, (translated by Sheila Sengupta), the rest of the offerings, including Sa rsquo;adat Hasan Manto rsquo;s ldquo;The Odour rdquo;, disappoints.                
	My Christmas Treasury (Orient, Rs 150) by Norman Vincent Peale seeks to rekindle the Yuletide spirit in these troubled times. Peales book comprises stories as well as hymns and carols that are loved the world over. Peale is apparently a renowned spiritual leader, and one cannot really blame him for hoping that the worlds sufferings will come to an end by recounting Christmas stories and by singing Christmas songs.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | a party in deep peril
                                                                                                                 A PARTY IN DEEP PERIL                                  Malvika singh                              
	It is truly sad to see many prominent leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party so desperately depressed, and in complete denial. Having spent the better part of the last many months abusing and decrying a prime minister and his government without any careful thought or constructive action, having stepped out of line to prop up Narendra Modi as their choice for an alternative prime ministerial candidate to L.K. Advani, having thrown their weight behind Feroze Varun Gandhi, their Gandhi mascot, believing he would be a formidable counter to Rahul Gandhi, having alienated some of the effective younger leaders of the party, and earlier, over the last five years, having actively expended party energies to stall the regular functioning of Parliament  the BJP emerges today as a fractured entity with no sound leadership at the helm. The frightful lack of inner-party democracy is evident to all.        
	Those in the party who are speaking out about errors of judgment and costly political mistakes appear sidelined in the pursuit of power. The elderly, slow and infirm continue to operate in a manner that is archaic and irrelevant in the changed aspirations of a New India, a State that is transforming itself into a regional and international competitive powerhouse at a time when the affluent world is in a downturn and deep crisis. All political dispensations go through such contortions. The BJP loudly claimed it was different, that its members were a disciplined and committed band of cadre-based soldiers, that it carried the flag for the majority who were being exploited to appease the minorities, that it was not a feudal, hierarchical party where family and favour were rewarded, and that it had a groundswell in its favour. The unfortunate truth is that the BJP has an insular, exclusive, intellectually-closed and stagnant ideology at the top where old, failed men continue to rule on their terms and at their pace.                
	Clean face        
	The strident rhetoric that we were afflicted with during the months of electioneering backfired badly because, for the average, normal Indian regardless of caste, creed and economic status, the hysterical and abusive language and aggressive confidence were an anathema. Civility, dignity and compassion are part of the Indian ethos, and to aggravate the crude interventions only pollutes the public domain and compels civilians to turn away from such behaviour that doesnt warrant the annadaata or the king.        
	In contrast, Manmohan Singh exudes quiet dignity and patience; Sonia Gandhi represents sacrifice of high office and a profound commitment to the unfinished agenda of her husband; and Rahul Gandhi is seen by all, supporters and opponents alike, as the real, energetic and clean face of a progressive future.        
	The Congress, too, has its share of scheming oldies, men and women who see their days in power and office numbered. The difference is that in the Congress there is also a band of young elected representatives who are supported by the prime minister and the party president, who are at the forefront and who will assume real power over the next couple of years. This party is seen to be transforming itself into a contemporary and more accessible liberal entity in sharp contrast to the other national party that remains tired and in denial.        
	To retain the headstart, the Congress will have to keep the older lot of politicians at bay, use them where required but keep them out of meddling with the change that is much needed within the party and outside of it. The wheeling and dealing, and the whining and sniping, that have become the hallmark of Congressmen and women, in an attempt to curry favour at the top, will need to be cut out in a determined effort to cleanse the poison out of the system. Both the national parties need an overhaul!

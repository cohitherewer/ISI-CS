	More bad news from abroad                  
	Sir  Muthyala Purushottams death has taken the number of software engineers and students from Andhra Pradesh killed in the last one year in the US to eight (US Andhra curse, again, Jan 23). Indian techies living there will be upset by these incidents. Parents might also get anxious about sending their wards abroad, while students will be confused while choosing international career options. The companies should now take the responsibility of providing security to Indian employees seriously.

	Money matters          
	Sir  Sankar Sen in his well-written piece criticizes politicians for impairing the police force (Time to cure the maladies of the police force, Jan 20). Sen also observes that Sub-inspectors...pay money regularly to members of the legislative assembly to continue in their posts. Let us presume, for arguments sake, that Sen is right. Even then, we need to know why policemen pay ministers, and where from? A sub-inspector with his meagre salary cannot afford to pay a bribe, unless he has additional (and hence illegal) financial resources. Why do policemen continue in their posts even though their profession is difficult and demanding? Moreover, who are the recipients of the bribe? As a former cop, Sen must have been privy to these hidden truths. But he has cleverly dodged the issue of corruption, which is an open secret, in order to exonerate the police. A constable who collected tola from vendors under the Sealdah flyover had commented wryly that hush money defies the law of gravity.           
	If Sen is arguing that the police are innocent and are therefore exploited by politicians, he should remember that policemen hobnob with the latter for their own interests as well. The relationship between the two is, in fact, symbiotic. Politicians may exploit them, but the men in power also pamper the ones in uniform. Isnt it true that the defeat of a top policeman in the Cricket Association of Bengals presidential polls had left the chief minister heart-broken a few years ago?          
	Yours faithfully,      
Tapan Pal, Batanagar

                
	Sir  Sankar Sens suggestion that the police must employ dedicated personnel and should be kept away from politics makes sense. Unfortunately, this is a remote possibility considering the present situation. Successive governments at the Centre and in the states have made use of the police to fulfil their political interests.Given the vicious set-up, even federal agencies like the Central Bureau of Investigation are often rendered toothless.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  As a student of Social Anthropology, I was pleased to read Malavika Karlekars Birding in early times (Jan 18). However, I was also a little disappointed not to find the answers to some important questions. Karlekar states that the bottomline in the colonial enterprise that generated varied visuals was to present Indias natural bounty to the world. This is a clichd view. A true account of India lies in the visuals of nature and natural elements  the so-called natural-social set-up. It is based on positivistic enquiry, rather than on romanticism, which is incapable of representing what is real. Colonial ethnography, while proclaiming positivism, was not devoid of romanticism.           
	Although I have great respect for the early ornithologists as well as for academicians like Karlekar, I want to reiterate a crucial point: we should talk of these seminal works without considering readers ignorant to avoid the common mistake of considering anthropology as exotic.          
	Yours faithfully,

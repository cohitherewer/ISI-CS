The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A festival of joyous rhythm
                                                                                                                 A FESTIVAL OF JOYOUS RHYTHM                              Dance - Sharmila Basu Thakur                                                
	Twenty five years is a long time for an institution to understand and assess the purpose of pursuing an art form. To celebrate the silver jubilee of Saraswat, a premier institution of Bharatnatyam, a three-day dance festival was organized at Rabindra Sadan (June 14-16). Conceived and choreographed by Anita Mullick, a brilliant Bharatnatyam exponent, the festival featured presentations in traditional Bharatnatyam as well as choreographies based on Tagores songs. The second halves of the first and last days saw Mullick present two outstanding productions: Biswa beena rabe and Nahi samanya nari respectively.        
	The festival began with mangalik in which a myriad moods and joyous rhythm were expressed through crisp and nimble footwork that was perfectly synchronized. The inaugural presentation itself set high standards. It was followed by angikam, ananda tandava and tillana, the usual elements incorporated in the genre of Bharatnatyam. The joy of realizing the enchanting beauty of nature was depicted in Biswa beena rabe. Melodious music, lyrical movement and soulful narrations merged together to capture the different hues of nature in a presentation that was at once rich and authentic.         
	Performing classical dance to Tagore songs seems to be a speciality these days. But this often leads to the choreography being too rigid, as a result of which the strict format of classical dance is lost. Mullicks choreography, however, maintained the balance between the classical dance format and the Tagorean tradition. The balance was fairly evident in Oi malatilata dole and in Basanti he bhubano mohini. Akash jure suninu too was deeply expressive.         
	The concluding presentation of the festival was Nohi samanya nari, based on Tagores Chitrangada. To choreograph this piece, Mullick intelligently used portions from Tagores Kavyanatya and Nrityanatya. The songs were sung by Swagatalakshmi Dasgupta, Sraboni Sen, Aloke Roychowdhury, Pijush Ganguly and others. Bratati Bandyopadhyay, Debasish Basu, Urmila Bhowmick and Kaushik Sen were involved in recitation and narration. However, Nohi samanya nari failed to live up to the expectation of being an innovative interpretation of a classic. The colourful costumes were designed by Abhoy Pal, Rajib Mondal and Sanjay Sarkar. Uttiyo Jana was in charge of the lights.         
	It is the responsibility of a teacher to see that young minds are able to visualize the dance form that they are trained in. It is indeed inspiring to see that Mullicks earnest efforts and dedication have succeeded in sustaining the interest of young people in classical dance.

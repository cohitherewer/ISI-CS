	It is sad that classical music has ceased to be a natural part of the education of the young. To learn to play an instrument or two reasonably well, to listen to serious music with pleasure, to connect music with other areas of knowledge, and to make it part of ones inner and sociable lives are enjoyable ways of starting to be an interesting human being.        
	The fourth annual concert by the pupils of Fauzia Marikar (The Calcutta School of Music, May 3) was a way of proving all this eminently possible. There were 24 pupils, from the Montessori age-group to young adults. What united them was a mix of zest and poise that was invariably delightful and, when there was talent too, impressive and invigorating. Nikita Biswas, her little feet dangling way above the floor as she sat on the piano stool, started the evening with her Two Little Songs, followed by Reet Mitra, feet just as high, playing the Ode to Joy with apologies to Beethoven. Then the evening tripped along a wide range of music from Kabalevsky through Schumann and Greig and Mozart (a delicately beautiful rendering of the Sonatina in C by Haeeun Jeong), as the feet reached closer to the pedals.        
	A wonderful moment during the evening was when one of Fauzia Marikars most talented pupils, Gourab Datta, premiered Kedarnath Awatis Invocation: Prayers from Here and There for All of Us. Awati, who was present among the audience, had studied the piano with Fauzia between 1967 and 72, and is now a composer, musician and academic. His Invocation, dedicated to the Dalai Lama, combines the sonorousness of the Vedic chant with the uplift of a more Romantic pianism. It was performed by Gourab with his usual panache, before he went on to play some devilishly difficult dances by Alberto Ginastera. The eponymous arrogant cowboy of the last dance could be an apt image for Gourabs dazzling virtuosity.         
	Another kind of charisma and quicksilver precision characterizes Oishik Gangulys performance (Haydn and Mozart). Oishik has the gift of Mozartian happiness that is peculiarly infectious and exciting to listen to and watch. A lovely surprise at the end was Ashwin Sahay singing two arie antique, in his tuneful and vigorous tenor, from those made famous by Cecilia Bartoli.        
	It was moving to see so many young people brought together by one persons ability to give them a glimpse of what a life in music might be like. One also saw how the seeds of creative brilliance, sensitivity or eccentricity could be sown early in peoples lives by an inspiring teacher. It is another matter, though, whether the world, more disconcerting than in concert, would allow these seeds to grow and bear fruit.

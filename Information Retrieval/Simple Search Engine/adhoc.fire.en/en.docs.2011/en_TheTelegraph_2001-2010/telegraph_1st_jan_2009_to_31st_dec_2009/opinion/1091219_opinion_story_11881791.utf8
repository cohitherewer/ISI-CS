	Inviting three artists from the subcontinent to participate in a show entitled Freedom is Notional is like laying a trap before them. Imagine the same theme being suggested to a contemporary non-Asian artist, say Tracey Emin, and the result would have been quite unpredictable. But the decision to show together the works of Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi artists inevitably raises familiar expectations. One can safely wager that these artists would feel called upon to expound on the political challenges facing their homeland. That they would express their anguish in the form of clever conceptual art, bolstered with witty slogans, colourful images and video footage. And thus they would go on to prove that their work is not just about art; its about politics, power and rebellion.        
	Naeem Mohaiemen (Bangladesh), Bani Abidi (Pakistan) and Shilpa Gupta (India), the three artists showing at Experimenter (till Jan 16), faithfully deliver on all these counts, and yet they manage to rise above the strictures imposed by the concept note to the exhibition quoted above. In the sequence of colour photographs with commentaries, put together by Mohaiemen, we look at an Islamist rally in Dhaka as if through the eyes of a world-weary poet. He notices a T-shirt graffiti (I am going to live true life or die trying) and a boy standing next to it, wearing a fez cap (The prayer cap is sum of fears, nothing else pushes through). As the observer sends this image, uncropped, to a friend, she upbraids him, Sometimes I feel you are selling stereotypes. Quick-witted and unsparing, Mohaiemens self-critical texts are designed as a fascinating soundtrack accompanying the visuals. The images look studiedly unremarkable, and are meant to counter the Euro lefts endless penchant for third-world authenticity. Their blandness triumphs over sensationalism.        
	Bani Abidis video of a group of children fidgeting listlessly on a street is amusing but ultimately a bit sterile. The children get easily distracted as they wait to greet some dignitary who never arrives. Abidis inkjet prints of security intercoms work better through their exquisite finish and minimalist appeal.        
	The most impressive work comes from Shilpa Gupta. Her projection of hand-drawn maps of India, with formless boundaries, is a telling comment on lingering border disputes. The series, Confiscated Objects (picture), is magnificent yet unostentatious. Essentially X-Ray photos of objects forbidden on flights, these images have a gem-like glow. But beyond their finesse, Gupta captures a rare moment when the eye cuts through the film of familiarity and glimpses something precious and ineffable. At one corner of the room, Gupta has kept a stack of A4 paper with the word, Memory, stencilled on them. The idea may be reminiscent of Bruce Nauman, but that doesnt take away from the impact of Guptas work. It endures in your mind, besides staying with you physically, long after you have left the gallery. Lawrence Weiners words come to mind: Once you know about a work of mine, you own it. Theres no way I can climb into someones head and remove it.

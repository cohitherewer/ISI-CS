                                                                                                                 HEART OF THE MATTER                          - The CPI(M)s defeat in the Bishnupur West bypoll is revealing        Cutting Corners - Ashok Mitra                                                      
	Joan Robinson, the economist, was once heard to comment: whatever generalization you make about India, the reverse of it is equally true. Perhaps she got it right. The Election Commission has announced the schedule for the Lok Sabha elections, the poll season is therefore on us. Should not our hearts swell with pride? It is to be the grandest spectacle of democracy in action ever witnessed by the world; more than 710 million adults will march to the booths and exercise their franchise on the basis of their free will. Then comes the flip side: this will also be the season of false declarations, booth captures, doctoring of accounts, unabashed bribing of voters and sometimes of rival candidates, and grisly violence resulting in gory deaths.         
	We can only quote and requote Joan Robinson. Contradictions are the reality, grandeur co-exists with sleaze and worse. Till as long as  so goes the theory  the Indian electorate is unable to extricate itself from the bondages congenital to it, including the bondage of illiteracy and the notions and prejudices bred by it, the picture is unlikely to alter.         
	The purpose of the present column is more parochial though. The Lok Sabha is made up of representatives of 540-odd constituencies, each of which in turn consists of six or seven state assembly constituencies. One such is Bishnupur West in the district of South 24 Parganas in West Bengal. Issues concerning the ensuing national poll are adjourned: let the focus be for a few moments exclusively on Bishnupur West.              
	Bishnupur West emerged as a separate constituency only in 1962. It was then quintessentially rural. A few of the village folk would take the early bus to Calcutta 20 miles away, for daily jobs or to sell in the city vegetables and fruits raised on their land. Roughly nine-tenths of the people made their living from cultivation, one-half of them as landless labourers, the other half as sharecroppers. There was much exploitation and acute hunger, providing opportunity to communist party cadre to preach their faith. The Tebhaga movement, launched in the late 1940s, left a bloody trail in the 24 Parganas; it also created much folklore woven around peasants resistance to police atrocities. Bishnupur was at the hard centre of that movement. Over the decades, the neighbourhood has, bit by bit, got urbanized, but land continues to be the main source of livelihood.        
	When Bishnupur West had its first poll in 1962, the legendary peasant leader, Prabhash Roy, was the communist partys candidate. He lost that election very narrowly. The story from then on was altogether different. The party had divided in 1964, and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) emerged as the dominant element in the area. In the 1967 poll, Prabhash Roy was once more the candidate. This time he won thumpingly, capturing more than 55 per cent of the total votes cast (see table). He kept winning in successive elections with comfortable margins till his death. Even following his death, the CPI(M) retained its hold on the constituency. Its run of success was interrupted only in 2001; it lost the seat for the first time in a quarter of a century. That, however, seemed to be an aberration, for the party bounced back and recaptured the seat in 2006.         
	The party member elected to the Bishnupur West seat in 2006 died, necessitating a by-election which took place last month. An unprecedented thing has happened. Never since the creation of the constituency had the CPI(M) candidate ever secured less than 43 per cent of the votes. In this years by-election, the party has not only tasted defeat, the proportion of votes obtained by its candidate has dropped to as low as 37 per cent. Even in 1972, when the state assembly polls were marred by what was described as semi-fascist terror, with the constabulary and Congress volunteers forming an open concordat to prevent communist supporters from casting their votes, Bishnupur West had stayed loyal to the party; the CPI(M) won the seat with more than 48 per cent of the polled votes going in its favour. Bishnupur West was in fact one of the only 11 seats in the entire state in which the party could  or was allowed to  win that year.         
	There were enough indications that, post-Nandigram and post-Singur, disquiet over the partys strategic line was widespread. Even a moron understands that broad-based economic growth pre-supposes industrial advance, and that land is needed for factory sites. But the choice of land, the modality of its acquisition and the auspices under which industrialization is supposed to proceed are serious issues; decisions abruptly imposed from above can be perilous. Different ways did exist to persuade the agrarian community to go along with the programme of industrial growth. The task should have been easier for the CPI(M) and the Left Front given their organizational base amongst the peasantry and in the panchayat bodies. The state administration nonetheless chose to proceed along what appeared to many as wrong lines, either because of absentmindedness or because of hauteur. The Nandigram firing was a much greater tragedy, with the police, under the command of an administration presided over by a communist party, shooting down in cold blood women and children from cultivating families.        
	The situation could perhaps still have been salvaged with the humble submission of an apology and an equally humble beseeching of forgiveness on behalf of the party. No such gesture was forthcoming; one or two ministers and party bosses uttered a few muted words of regret; the people in general remained sullen and unconvinced.         
	Why not be candid about it? A long tenure in power, howsoever limited its ambit, can have untoward consequences. For one, it fosters a genre of cronyism. Even Left cronyism can be evil enough. Opportunists and fair-weather friends gather round the administration, favourites get picked for strategic positions. Sycophancy rather than competence becomes the criterion for selecting persons for crucial jobs. This kind of development has taken place in West Bengal, one is afraid, in no small measure, contributing to a steady worsening in the quality of governance. To this has been added the post-Nandigram atrophy: the state administration does not dare to take any more one step that could lead to a lapse of tranquillity.              
	The prospect of the Left in the impending Lok Sabha polls seems somewhat dicey, but not on account of the Congress and the famous lady coming together. The determining factor is going to be the degree of erosion of the CPI(M)s mass base in the course of the past two-and-a-half years, which might amount to five per cent or more.         
	There will be a wrench in the heart, and not just among hardcore Left supporters. The alternative to the Left Front is, as of now, demagogy combined with raucous phrase-making, nothing beyond. That apart, a lessening of the parliamentary strength of the Left would hardly contribute to the improvement of the state of affairs at the national level. Why not also admit it, the other part too, that the CPI(M) has still within its fold the most dedicated, self-sacrificing and perceptive band of workers pledged to the dream of a popular democratic revolution? But they have been reduced to dramatis personae of a Greek tragedy: aware how and why the tide was turning against the party, but, with democratic centralism gone awry, their voice failing to carry the least weight.         
	And yet, whatever the immediate outcome of the Lok Sabha polls, the hinterland in the state is bound to remain fertile ground for radical thoughts and praxis. For the objective conditions are what they were.

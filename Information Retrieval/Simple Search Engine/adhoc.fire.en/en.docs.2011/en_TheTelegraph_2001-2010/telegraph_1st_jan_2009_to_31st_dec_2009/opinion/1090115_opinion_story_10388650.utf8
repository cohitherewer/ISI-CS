The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A greener world, between the covers
                                                                                                                 A GREENER WORLD, BETWEEN THE COVERS                                  Across rural and urban Bengal, notions of what is clean and unclean are entangled in such a way as to make environmental education in schools look pointless                                            
	In West Bengal, bravado and boorishness preside over the business of living and learning. It is evident, by this time, that the chief minister and his cohorts would happily ignore the rising vehicular emission than do their duty by the law and ban all two-stroke autorickshaws. Though their attitude, by and large, is of sheer indifference to public good, they prefer to explain away their inaction in a veneer of helplessness. The trick is to use an insidious reversal of the logic of the welfare state: the good of many (the citizens of the state) is compromised for the good of a few (the auto-drivers would lose their livelihood if their vehicles are seized). However specious such a reasoning may be, the government is trying to get some moral leverage out of this argument. This attempt to gain a high ground is also apparent in the decision to introduce compulsory environmental education at the secondary and higher secondary levels.        
	Only in a state like West Bengal, where people are benignly blas about plastic bags, toxic waste and noxious fumes, does the bleak irony of educating young-adults about pollution and health hazards go overlooked. Like much else in the state, environmental science, too, is a paper tiger: more of a formal requirement than a strict necessity. Students are required to obtain just the pass marks in this subject, marks that do not usually contribute to the aggregate. Students who consider preparing for competitive examinations to be a more meaningful activity than worrying about the depletion of the ozone layer would find environmental science to be an eminently dispensable subject. It is a burden that smacks of an inscrutable bureaucratic conspiracy, instead of opening up new horizons. The entire idea, after all, is cosmetic: a feather on the governments cap and a crown of thorns for the students.        
	The higher secondary textbook begins on a tone of Miltonic loftiness: with the preamble to the Constitution, followed by the list of fundamental rights and duties of citizens. This opening itself ought to make teachers pause. In a state that pays little attention to court orders, these earnest avowals of equality, justice and liberty sound ostentatious. Is it possible for a teacher in West Bengal, with the least bit of a conscience, to teach this syllabus without questioning the double standards that underlie mandatory environmental education? Since the environment does not revolve around vehicular emission and air pollution alone, a few related issues are bound to come into focus: the dysfunctional state healthcare system, the absence of clean drinking water, electricity, proper roads and even primary education in the rural areas. The cities offer another set of problems: crumbling civic facilities, the failure of waste management and sound pollution are for all to live with  alongside deadly fumes from rickety buses and ancient autos.        
	Teaching environmental science involves talking about things like natural disasters, deforestation, composting or sustainable development. The book, too, gives a comprehensive account of the fundamental challenges threatening the environment today. Man-made disasters like the Bhopal gas tragedy and the Chernobyl disaster are glossed over. But moving beyond these well-worn modules, the larger challenge for teachers would be to project these scientific theories upon everyday circumstances, thus making students realize how bookish knowledge applies to, or fails to have an impact on, actual life. Until this relationship between concepts and realities is articulated, environmental science remains just another cog in the teaching machine.        
	Individual preferences determine political choice. Can the State rule over the fate of individuals if they resist its workings as a collective force? Sadly, in West Bengal, a generation of young people has been made to think of choice only in terms of career opportunities; the environment does not merit more attention than what is needed to score a mere 30 out of 100 in the finals.                    SOMAK GHOSHAL

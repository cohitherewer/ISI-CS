	Stereotypes are not necessarily untrue. Sometimes they are truer than we like them to be. The problem, however, is that stereotypes offer only an incomplete picture. So there may not be anything inherently false about the clich of maharajas and maharanis ensconced in their resplendent palaces, decked up gorgeously, eating, drinking and making merry all the time. But that is not the whole truth. A monarch, as the scriptures and historical records explain, should embody finer qualities: wisdom, statesmanship, military prowess, alongside judicial and administrative skills. For a king to be recognized and revered as such, it was essential for him to fashion himself as a Renaissance Man: someone who hunted, made love, patronized the arts, and ran his state with equal facility.        
	Edited by Anna Jackson and Amin Jaffer, MAHARAJA: THE SPLENDOUR OF INDIAS ROYAL COURTS (Roli, Rs 2,975), accompanies the eponymous exhibition that opened at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London recently. The title may suggest that the volume focuses exclusively on the glorious lifestyle of the royals, though the scope of the book (for it is much grander than an exhibition catalogue) is more comprehensive. Beginning with an introduction by the editors  tracing the history of monarchy from the Mughals to the British invasion, down to Independence, and till the early Seventies, when Indira Gandhi stripped the royals of their titles  a number of scholarly essays discuss various aspects of courtly life. Barbara N. Ramusack explains the ideas and etiquettes associated with kingship. Joanne Punzo Waghorne writes about the importance of spectacle  how the darshan of the ruler was of aesthetic as well as religious value. Palace life, with its rituals and intrigues, and patronage at court come alive in the essays by Ramya Sreenivasan and Rosemary Crill respectively. It would have been interesting to have here a chapter on music, painting and writing, more so since the contributors make constant references to the arts. Giles Tillotson makes up somewhat for this lack in his analysis of the politics of style, especially of the interaction between Oriental and Occidental modes of architecture. Finally, Amin Jaffer provides a lively account of the adventures of Indian princes in the West.        
	Extreme left on top is an oil by James Wales showing the Peshwa, Madhu Rao Narayan II, with Nana Fadnavis. Next to it come two playfully intimate moments: Maharaja Yeshwant Rao Holkar II and Maharani Sanyogita Devi of Indore caught by Man Rays camera in Cannes, and Raja Bhup Singh of Guler under a quilt with one of his ranis, a sublime reverie in watercolour. Another typical courtly scene unfolds in the albumen print by Shepherd and Robertson, where Maharaja Jaswant Singh of Bharatpur holds durbar. Finally, the exquisite necklace on the right-hand corner is a Joseph Chaumet design, circa 1913, for Maharaja Tukoji Rao Holkar III of Indore.

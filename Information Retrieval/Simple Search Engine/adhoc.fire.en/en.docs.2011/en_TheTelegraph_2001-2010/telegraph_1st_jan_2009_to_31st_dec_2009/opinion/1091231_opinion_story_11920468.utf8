	Moral questions                  
	Sir  The sordid episode involving Narain Dutt Tiwari has shocked everyone (Whiff of scandal takes Tiwari head, Dec 27). There can be no smoke without fire. Past incidents related to this former governor of Andhra Pradesh, such as the paternity suit filed by his allegedly illegitimate son, have also tainted his reputation considerably.          
	However, Tiwaris resignation in the wake of this raging controversy is welcome. He has reacted rightly to the hints dropped by the government of Andhra Pradesh and the Congress. But resignation on health grounds displays a certain lack of sincerity on his part. Had Tiwari resigned declaring that he would not hold office till his name was fully cleared, it would have set the right example and upheld the high moral standards of the Congress to which he belongs.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  The decision taken by the Congress to remove N.D. Tiwari from the post of the governor of Andhra Pradesh is not justified. The Congress has not realized the impact of this decision, and has behaved in an immature way. The decision has sent the wrong signal to the world that sex is seen as a crime in India. The Centre did not even wait for the report regarding this matter that it had sought from the chief secretary of Andhra Pradesh, Ramakanth Reddy, before accepting Tiwaris resignation.          
	The media, the people and the government must realize that Tiwari has not done anything wrong by having sexual interactions in the past. Sex is not a crime under the Indian law. Tiwari was just fulfilling his biological needs, like any other person on earth. The Centre should realize this, and reinstall Tiwari as the governor of Andhra Pradesh. At this point, the government needs to concentrate on eliminating criminals who may threaten the nation and society, instead of worrying about unimportant matters such as the personal histories of politicians.          
	Yours faithfully,      
N.V.S.N. Murthy, Gandhinagar, Gujarat              
	Sir  It is unbelievable that a person of N.D. Tiwaris stature has been accused of being involved in a sex scandal. He is 86, and was holding a post as important as that of a governor. But from his earlier conduct, and from the video footage shown recently by a Telugu news channel, it seems that he was indeed involved in the scandal.          
	Keeping in mind his controversial moral character, Tiwari should not have been allowed to hold such a high post in the first place. While choosing a governor, the personal records of a candidate should be given as much importance as his political career.          
	Yours faithfully,         Sudhir Pattnaik,Kalahandi, Odisha    
	Sir  It is shameful that a person of questionable reputation such as N.D. Tiwari had been holding the post of governor for so long. Tiwaris character had come under the scanner earlier as well, when Rohit Shekhar, the grandson of a former Union minister who claimed that Tiwari was his biological father, had filed a paternity suit in the Delhi High Court against him.          
	Shekhars suit was dismissed on the ground that there was a delay in filing the case. But after the sex scandal involving Tiwari surfaced, Shekhar has revived the paternity suit he had filed earlier (Paternity suit back to haunt Tiwari, Dec 29).          
	Tiwari had so far been misusing the privilege granted to him by his office by hiding behind Article 361 of the Constitution which shields governors and presidents from court scrutiny in criminal cases. Now that he has resigned from the governors post, the law should take its own course to punish Tiwari for his behaviour. The Delhi High Court should not repeat its earlier mistake of dismissing the case on technical grounds. It should take stern action against Tiwari this time.          
	Yours faithfully,      
N. Ramachandran, Durgapur

                
	Lost tunes          
	Sir  The Poush Mela, held annually in Santiniketan, continues to be a valuable platform for baul singers. Although a large number of bauls gather for this event every year, there are very few traditional minstrels among them nowadays.          
	Originally, the bauls were sadhaks. Their life was not just about music but also about living in a specific way, which included traditions like gurumukhi shiksha, daily meditation and living by alms.          
	But most bauls today are professionals. They flock to Poush Mela, which attracts a fair bit of international attention. The new singers add the word, baul, to their surnames, wear the traditional orange robes and project themselves as traditional bauls. But most of them do not stick to authentic baul tunes anymore. The modern bauls lack the expertise to make original music. They use tabla and harmonium along with the traditional ektara, khol, khanjani and dubki. Booming microphones and blaring instruments have taken away the rustic flavour of baul music.                    
	Yours faithfully,         Subhayu Saha,Khagra, Murshidabad

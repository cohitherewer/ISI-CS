	 During elections, reel stories often turn real. It was expected that Sanjay Dutt (now that the star has decided to mingle with the janta) will try out the magic of his Gandhigiri and jadu ki jhappi with the same enthusiasm as his on-screen avatar, Munnabhai. After all, that is the role people identify Sanjubaba with. It is quite another matter that not everyone is willing to fall victim to Dutts charms in real life. Witness how the jhappi for Mayavati backfired on Dutt. But not all have behenjis power of resistance: certainly not Arshad Warsi, Munnabhais faithful sidekick, Circuit, in the films. Warsi had apparently been persuaded by the Congress to campaign against the Samajwadi Partys Munna mania. When Dutt came to know about it, he sent Warsi flowers, Munnabhai-style. Warsi rang up Sanjay to ask the reason, and the rest is history. Gandhigiri won the day and Warsi was dissuaded from queering the SPs pitch.             
	 The winner always takes all. Which is why Sushma Swaraj is a tad disappointed. The senior Bharatiya Janata Party leader from Vidisha was hoping to create some sort of a record with her winning margin. But the low turnout on election day spoilt her chances. With no major opponent against her, given that the nomination papers of the Congress candidate had got rejected on technical grounds, it would have been a cakewalk for Swaraj. Now, as things stand in Vidisha, only 5,67,000 voters seemed to have visited the booths. Swaraj has no hope of beating Anil Basus victory margin of 5,92,502 votes in Arambagh.                            
	 Do leftists always have to be such typical bores? In a country caught in the rough and tumble of elections, an MP from the Communist Party of India (Marxist), reportedly, continues to write long letters to the minister for telecommunications, A Raja. The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam minister neither has the time nor the inclination to go through the contents but the MP insists that matters of governance should not be hindered by electioneering. Bureaucrats in Sanchar Bhawan are still wondering how best to communicate to the parliamentarian the import of the Tamil Nadu elections.                            
	 The BJP cannot understand why Baba Ramdev refuses to come out in open support of its prime ministerial candidate. The yoga guru so far has offered only conditional support. That is, he is willing to support LK Advanis campaigns against Indian black money lying in Swiss banks. He has even agreed to share the dais with Advani, provided the show is organized by an apolitical NGO, and the theme is money laundering. With time running out, partymen, however, want the guru to put his full weight behind Advani. The gurus advisers, however, want him to maintain his apolitical profile, given that the 15th Lok Sabha is still such a hazy picture.                            
	 An eye for an eye. The Congress has had to requisition the services of Yahya Bukhari for the partys electoral campaign in Assam. Son of the Shahi Imam of Delhis Jama Masjid, Yahya Bukhari is not strictly a political leader. But since the appeal of the perfume magnate, Badruddin Ajmal, of the United Democratic Front has been incessantly growing in Assam, the Congress has had to spruce up its campaign. Despite the minority community being loyal voters of the party, the steady incursions made by other parties into its vote bank means that the Congress can no longer take the support for granted. Hence the groundwork.                             
	 Ever since the rift between the SP and the Congress, Jaya Bachchan has not been able to wipe that smile off her face. When Jaya was asked about the Congress recently, she reportedly said, Congress mein rah kar dekh liya, sah kar dekh liya (I have been in the Congress, I have tolerated the Congress). She also pointed out that the Congress will not be able to mend its fences with her party.       
	This was the first time that Jaya had opened her mouth about the Congress since the two parties had come together over the N-deal vote of confidence. She did not oppose the tie-up, but proceeded on a long tour with her family. The grapevine says Jaya is in her true elements now that the bad blood between the Congress and the SP has thickened. Meanwhile, when someone tried drawing Priyanka Vadras attention to the Jaya remark, the young lady is supposed to have laughed. Laughter, we gather, is the best medicine.             
	 If the BJP can borrow snatches from Barack Obamas campaign, there is no reason why the Congress cannot. So, while the Advani brigade adopts Obamas strategy of hotselling their leader through the internet, Congresswallahs have settled for the cosy family picture that had worked wonderfully for the American hero. Hence that now-famous interview of the Manmohan Singh family on television. But the illustrious family of the prime minister of India presents a more complete picture of bliss than Obamas did when the campaign was on. While the Obamas got Bo, a Portuguese water dog, only recently, the Singhs already have their Sandy. Sandy actually belongs to one of Singhs daughters, but these days he has been spending more time at the 7 Race Course Road address. Sandy has either sensed that there is no hurry among the residents of this famous address to shift house or his animal instincts are telling him that he should make full use of the last few days of sunshine.

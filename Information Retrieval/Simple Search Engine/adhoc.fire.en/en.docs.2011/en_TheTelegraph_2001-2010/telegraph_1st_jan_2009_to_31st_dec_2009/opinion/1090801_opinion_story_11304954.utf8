                                                                                                                 THE JOY OF NIMBLE FOOTWORK                              Sharmila Basu Thakur      Dance
                                                
	Pandit Durga Lal Memorial Cultural Society organized a dance festival at Kalamandir on July 10. Bharatnatyam, Odissi and Kathak, the three distinctive styles of Indian classical dance, were presented on the occasion. Arushi Mudgal, daughter of the renowned Odissi danseuse, Madhvi Mudgal, performed brilliantly. Her first presentation, the shiva tandava stotra, which celebrates the union of Shiva and Parvati, was followed by aahlad, which explored the joy of movement and rhythm. The dancer proved her mettle with the help of supple movements, nimble footwork and perfect chauk and tribhangi positions. The music was composed by Madhup Mudgal, and the performance was choreographed by the artist herself. Kedechhanda, an abhinaya based on Oriya songs, expressing the young Krishnas pranks, was enjoyable as well.        
	Malabika Mitra (picture), a senior Kathak exponent, delivered a captivating performance. Her dignified stage presence, verve and vivacity, so critical to this genre of dance, were much appreciated. The performance started with Gangastuti, and was followed by thaat, amad, toda, paran and tatkar  the key components of Kathak.         
	Mitra revealed the intricate nuances of rhythm and speed with the help of her deft footwork. The blending of rhythm and verse was reflected in jhula, which is based on kajri.

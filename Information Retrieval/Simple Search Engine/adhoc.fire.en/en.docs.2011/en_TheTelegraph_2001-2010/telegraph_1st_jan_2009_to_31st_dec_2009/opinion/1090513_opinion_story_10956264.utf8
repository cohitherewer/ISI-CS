The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | No childs play
                                                                                                                 NO CHILDS PLAY                                  The courts have begun to give credence to the evidence of child witnesses. But are their rights being protected, asks Saheli Mitra                          Illustration: Suman Choudhury                                
	nLast month Suparna Mondal was murdered in her Behala home in Calcutta. The only witness to the crime was her nine-year-old son Pratim. The boy told the police that three men and one woman had entered their house and there was an altercation between them and his mother. Then the assailants started beating up Suparna. When the boy protested, they gagged him with a pillow. Pratim fell unconscious and when he came to, he found his mother hanging from the ceiling fan, strangled, and dead.        
	Based on Pratims testimony, the police detained six suspects  one of them is his maternals uncles fiance  in the Suparna Mondal murder case. And when the case comes up for trial, the boys evidence will no doubt be a vital part of the prosecutions case against the accused.              
	nSix-year-old Tanmoy saw his mother and uncle smother his father with a pillow and then strangle him with a wire. It was Tanmoy who stood at the witness box before the judge at Nadias district sessions court on February 17, 2009, and gave his damning evidence against his mother and uncle. They should be hanged, he said. Later, the judge passed a verdict of life sentence on the basis of the childs testimony.              
	Children are often regarded as unreliable witnesses. But of late, there has been a growing number of cases where the courts have based their judgements on the testimony of children who happened to be on the scene of the crime.        
	In yet another case, on March 26, 2008, the Supreme Court sentenced one Golla Yelugu Govindu to life imprisonment after his children testified that he had hacked his wife to death because she had refused to bring money from her parents. Commenting on the case, Justice Arijit Pasayat and Justice P. Sathasivam of the Supreme Court said: Even corroborative evidence is not needed to convict an accused if the evidence of a child witness is found reliable. The judges also did not feel that child witnesses can be tutored to give false evidence against a father, as Govindus counsels had argued.        
	Indeed, in cases where child witnesses are involved, many try to question the authenticity of their evidence in an effort to quash their testimony. Hopefully, there will now be an end to such practices, says Supreme Court lawyer Prabir Chaudhuri.        
	The Indian Evidence Act, 1872, has provisions for accepting a child as a viable witness provided he or she has the intellectual capacity to understand questions and give rational answers. Joy Sengupta, criminal lawyer, Calcutta High Court, reveals that according to Section 118 of the Indian Evidence Act, all persons shall be competent to testify, unless the court feels they lack understanding of the questions put to them or are unable to give rational answers because of tender age, extreme old age, disease, or a mental problem.         
	So the courts have the right to accept competent child witnesses as their prime witness and at times even as the only witness, says Sengupta.        
	Still, most agree that child witnesses can be influenced easily and hence have to be treated with kid gloves. Moreover, their reliability as witnesses also needs to be ascertained carefully. Says Justice Malay Kumar Basu, retired judge of the Calcutta High Court, We judge the reliability of the witness on the basis of the childs answers and body language. If, after careful scrutiny, the court feels that there is an impress of truth in what he or she says, he or she may be accepted as a valuable witness.        
	The Juvenile Justice Care and Protection Act lays down certain guidelines to help child witnesses combat the pressures of a court room scenario. Judges need to see that the court room is not overcrowded so that the child does not feel overwhelmed or intimidated. Proceedings should be held in-camera, where possible, to minimise strain to and exposure of the child witness. In cases where the child has a language problem, a lady who is familiar with the particular language may be allowed to remain in the court room. The presiding officer may also reassure the child and allay his or her fears.         
	We take utmost care to safeguard the interests of child witnesses in court. We dont want them to be victimised a second time, asserts Justice Basu.        
	Experts warn that dealing with child witnesses, especially those who have witnessed a terrible crime, requires utmost care. Calcutta-based psychologist Dr Raj Sethia points out that a child who has witnessed a murder is under phenomenal stress. Child witnesses suffer from post traumatic stress disorder, he explains. A child who has seen an act of violence being committed will be deeply impacted. If the aggressor or the victim is a parent, he is even more traumatised. If the aggressor is a parent, he cannot reconcile that image with the pre-conceived image he has of the parent and hence might not be able to assess the consequence of the act. There can be a lack of understanding, leaving the child deeply disturbed and confused.        
	Dr Sethia feels that child witnesses should be counselled prior to and during the trial to help reduce their trauma.              
	But child witnesses need to be protected not just emotionally. Often, their very security is at risk. Child rights activists insist that our criminal justice system is strangely negligent about protecting the security of child witnesses. Satyagopal Dey, deputy general manager (development and support) of Child Rights and You (CRY), gives the example of a child witness in the September 13, 2008, blasts in Delhi. A 12-year-old balloon seller provided the police with vital information on two men who had planted a bomb in a dustbin near Connaught Place. But he was exposed to the media in such a way that he could easily have been targeted by the terrorists. There are instances where child witnesses even face threats to their lives, says Dey.        
	Thats not all. Anant K. Asthana, a legal activist with Human Rights Law Network, Delhi, says: Lower courts are rarely sensitive to child witnesses. Child witnesses are never told about their rights. No one explains to them or their guardians what they can be asked, or what facilities they should be provided with. They are at the mercy of lawyers. At times judges are too preoccupied to look into the traumatic state of a child witness. While cross examining, some lawyers too try to put pressure on a child witness and confuse him.        
	Clearly, while the move to admit and value the credible testimony of children should be lauded, the courts need to become much more sensitive to the rights of children when they are called to gave evidence in a criminal case.

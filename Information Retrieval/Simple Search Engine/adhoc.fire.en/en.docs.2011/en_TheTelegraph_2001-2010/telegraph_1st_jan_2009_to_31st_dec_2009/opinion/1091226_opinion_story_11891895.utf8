	Unequal treatment                  
	Sir  As of now, the government has spent Rs 31 crore on the upkeep of the dreaded 26/11 terrorist, Ajmal Kasab. By the time his trial is over, the drain on the State exchequer will probably add up to a sum sufficient to commission a medium-sized power plant. Ironically, the families of those who took the terrorists bullets are still running from pillar to post for compensation. While the country remains committed to the cause of protecting the legal rights of criminals, it is not certain how that will benefit those who lost their loved ones.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Arun Malankar, Mumbai

      
	Fresh insight          
	Sir  We are familiar with cases in which women are tortured by their in-laws or husbands. But the report, Protection from 498A for tortured in-laws (Dec 17), shows that men also need immunity from laws such as the one against domestic violence that are biased against them. The incident of Prasanta Saha torturing his parents at the instigation of his wife, who threatened to file a false dowry case against him, provides a vital insight into the increasing number of cases involving the abuse of the elderly, mainly by their sons and daughters-in-law. Although we cannot deny that some greedy sons treat their parents badly for financial gain, a son may also torment his parents at his wifes behest. Women who face domestic violence do need protection from the law, but a law must also be there to prevent them from using the legal shield as an extortion tool.           
	The case in question is an eye-opener in this regard. I am sure that there are several similar cases which go unreported. Unless the present domestic violence law, which is heavily tilted towards women, is amended, assaults on senior citizens by their daughters-in-law will continue.           
	We should strive to free society of gender biases. Under the current system, exploitation is common by anyone who is in a dominant position, irrespective of gender. This tendency must be discouraged. Otherwise, the cracks in our social fabric will widen, causing greater social disharmony.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Soumendra Datta, Calcutta

                          
	In memoriam          
	Sir  Why do we tend to forget the best theatre and film personalities of Bengal? December 11,which marked the death anniversary of the legendary actor, Tulsi Chakraborty, virtually passed unnoticed. Calcuuta seems to have forgotten the man who was more than just an actor. He was also a skilled dancer, singer and pakhwaj player.           
	Chakraborty was equally at home on stage and on screen. Having made his screen debut in Premankur Athorthis film, Punarjanmo, in 1932, he subsequently mesmerized audiences with his brilliant comic acting. Be it in the role of a manager of a bachelors mess in Sare Chuattar or of an aged publisher who falls for a young poetess in Personal Assistant, Chakraborty was always a treat to watch. Although he is best remembered for his roles in Satyajit Rays Parash Pathar and Pather Panchali, old-timers will also fondly recall Chakrabortys sterling performances in films such as Sabar Upare and Manmoyi Girls School.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Subhayu Saha, Khagra, Murshidabad

                          
	Parting shot          
	Sir  Almost a month has passed since the anomalous Part I and Part II results of the undergraduate examinations of Calcutta University have been published, followed by assurances of investigation into the lapses. No action has yet been taken, and the students continue to suffer.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Udayan Banerjee, Calcutta

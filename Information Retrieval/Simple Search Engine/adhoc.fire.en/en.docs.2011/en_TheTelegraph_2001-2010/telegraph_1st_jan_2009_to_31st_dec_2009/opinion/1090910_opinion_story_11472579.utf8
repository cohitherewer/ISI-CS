The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | where to stay
                                                                                                                 WHERE TO STAY                                                    
	In India, it is always more convenient to target individuals than to address issues. Thus popular applause has been won by asking two ministers not to stay in five-star hotels during a period when the government has announced austerity measures. In the applause what gets drowned is the bigger issue. That issue is the scarcity of residences for ministers and government servants in Lutyens Delhi. This is not an absolute scarcity. The problem lies in the unwillingness of the occupants to give up their bungalows even after their tenure in office is finished. This unwillingness often stretches to months, in some cases to years. This means that new and genuine claimants are left without an official residence. There is no mechanism in place to ensure that ministers, bureaucrats and members of parliament vacate their quarters as soon as their terms are over. More importantly, very few public servants have the sense of responsibility to move out of houses that are technically not given to them but to the position they occupy.        
	This shortage of housing has another angle. The spacious bungalows in the tree-lined avenues of Lutyens Delhi are often used to bestow patronage by whoever is in government. This is a peculiarly Indian affliction, since in this country, politics is inextricably linked to patronage. A politician or an important bureaucrat feels bereft of power unless he is seen as a source of patronage. And in the hierarchy of gifts, a residence in Lutyens Delhi perhaps comes second only to a foreign posting. There is thus a covert race to remain in occupation or to regain occupation of houses in that area. S.M. Krishna and Shashi Tharoor  the two ministers who have been asked to move out of five-star hotels  would not have been staying in hotels if both of them had been able to move in to houses that have been allotted to them. (They could have stayed, of course, less ostentatiously than in five-star hotels, but that is not the issue here.) Within the establishment in the capital, there is a studied indifference towards the number of people who refuse to vacate their official houses in time. The words, in time, should be clearly defined and then enforced. The practice of using houses for patronage should also be discouraged. The government and the political parties should come to an agreement on this. This is the only way to avoid a spectacle of ministers living in five-star hotels.

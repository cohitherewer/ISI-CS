                                                                                                                 DEVELOP FAST                                                    
	On the face of it, the elections this time, in West Bengal and in the rest of the country, do not have an overriding issue. But a closer look would present a different picture. For all the discordant campaign notes, elections are increasingly becoming contests over development policies. Even in a state like Bengal, where political rivalries easily turn violent, no party can afford to ignore the agenda for development. What is even more interesting is the fact that the gap between the Left and the anti-Left camps over the development agenda is actually narrowing. This is also a reflection of the growing consensus across the political spectrum at the national level that economic development should be the focus of democratic politics. In the course of the poll campaign, both the Left and the Congress-Trinamul Congress alliance have sought to convince the people that theirs is the right approach to the states development. Underlying the campaign is the realization that no party or political group can hope to earn the popular mandate without an adequate emphasis on development. True, the political rhetoric over what kind of land should be used for industrialization is soaked in partisan spirit. Divergent views on approaches to development are central to democratic discourse. But that only underscores the importance of development as the centre of public debate.        
	That the first phase of polling in Bengal passed off without any major disturbances will probably be seen as the most notable feature of Thursdays vote. Given the Maoist threat and poll boycott calls in some places, mostly inhabited by tribal people, the peaceful poll will bring a sense of relief both to the administration and the people in general. But even the threats have much to do with the lack of development in these areas. For all their pro-poor rhetoric, the leftists have clearly failed to change the dismal economic situation that prevails in the tribal belt of West Midnapore, Bankura and Purulia districts. The people who boycotted the polls in these areas are not necessarily enemies of the State; in staying away from the polling they blamed the government for not doing enough to change things for them. It would be wrong for Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to be complacent about the absence of violence in these areas. On the contrary, the boycott and the lower turnout in these areas should be a wake-up call for the chief minister.

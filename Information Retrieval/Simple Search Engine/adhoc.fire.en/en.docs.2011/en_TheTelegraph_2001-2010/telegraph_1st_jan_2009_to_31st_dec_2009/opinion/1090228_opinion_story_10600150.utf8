The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | mutiny about bounty

	It is bleakly ironic, in view of the February 25 mutiny, that the Bangladesh Rifles troops are hailed as vigilant sentinels by the people of the nation. The irony is double-edged. First, rather than living up to this grand epithet bestowed on it by the citizens it is expected to protect, the BDR has unleashed violence across the country. What started off as a backlash by the rank and file of the paramilitary forces against perceived injustices by the senior officers has left a trail of destruction in its wake. Civilians have been killed, and public property damaged. Without justifying this outburst, one hastens to add that the reasons were no less serious. Although burdened with the onerous task of border security, the BDR has never been suitably recompensed for its troubles. There is a revealing disparity between the pay and perks allotted to the army and those to the BDR. This is at once a logistical and a historical problem. Any hierarchical system fosters discontent among the subordinates envious of the privileges enjoyed by their officers, who are often spared the hardest of duties. In a lesser form, this dissatisfaction exists in India, as evident from the fractured response within the army to the recommendations of the sixth pay commission. The disaffection in the BDR troops was aggravated after they were denied assignments with the United Nations military missions. Such foreign postings help the already underpaid BDR personnel earn up to $1,000 a month  which is close to a fortune in a depleted economy like Bangladesh.        
	Historically, the BDRs service to the nation has scarcely been recognized by the State. Known as the Ramgarh Local Battalion at its inception in 1795, the BDR evolved under several names and participated in some of the formative events of modern history. Apart from its role in the two World Wars, it fought against Pakistan, providing valuable support to the Mukti Bahini and the Indian army in the war of independence in 1971. The BDR was spurred on not only by nationalism but also by a set of familiar grievances. The subalterns (recruited mainly from the Bangla-speaking populace) routinely accused senior officers (mostly from Pakistan) of exploitation.        
	The sense of hurt is now complicated by the growing Islamization of Bangladesh. Allegedly, supporters of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, rallying for khilafat rule, were part of the latest skirmishes. Although the rebels have surrendered, the situation remains volatile, and the crisis may spill over to the other side of the border. Bangladesh may be indebted to India, but terrorism on the northeastern borders, or the clash between the BDR and the Border Security Force in 2001, has led to a waning of trust. Sheikh Hasina Wajeds return to power was seen as the triumph of democracy. But democracy is not just an experiment; it is premised on the idea of the executive working in tandem with the army and the administration. Since the armed forces in Bangladesh do not have a tradition of unshaken loyalty to the State, Ms Wajed should be prepared to deal with a future crisis.

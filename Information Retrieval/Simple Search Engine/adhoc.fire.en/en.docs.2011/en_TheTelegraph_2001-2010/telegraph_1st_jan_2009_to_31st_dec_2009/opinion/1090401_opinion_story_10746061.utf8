                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Too many cooks                  
	Sir  The editorial, Shift skipper (March 27), seems to support John Buchanans idea of multiple captains. The idea, however, seems a bit far-fetched. Cricket can hardly be compared with other games. In football, in the course of a game, communication between the captain and players becomes difficult because the players are dispersed all over the field. More often than not, it is the coach, and not the captain, who decides how to go on with the game. Cricket, on the other hand, is a much slower game, and a man on the field is best suited to keep a watch over changing situations. A cricket captain can draw up plans, make surprise changes in bowling, batting or fielding. However, if there are more captains than one, it would hamper a teams unity due to fractured allegiances. This novel idea, coming from an Australian coach, seems to be an attempt to avenge the ignominy suffered by a fellow Aussie who had tried to sideline Indias most successful captain.          
	Yours faithfully,       
P. K. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

                
	Sir  It is true that there is a need to change the perception about the role of the captain in a cricket team. I am of the opinion that a player should only concentrate on playing, leaving the captain to think out plans and strategies. However, cricket, unlike soccer, is not much of a tactical game. The concept of a non-playing captain can work in soccer but not in cricket. In soccer, the coach or the non-playing captain can put in place a plan which the players can then follow on the field. But in the case of cricket, there are some decisions that can only be taken on the field only. For instance, the captain of a side is the best judge of whether a bowler has the energy to bowl a few extra overs or whether a fielder is best suited for a particular fielding position. A person sitting out of the game will never be able to take these decisions correctly. John Buchanan has reportedly said that there will be different captains for different situations. This, to my mind, is pure drivel. I agree with Sourav Gangulys fans who are alleging that he is being forcefully denied the leading role in the Kolkata Knight Riders.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Pritam Kumar Paul, Hooghly 

                
	Sir  Sourav Gangulys ashen face in the conference where John Buchanan disclosed the plan of having multiple captains proves that Ganguly isnt keen on such experimentations. In the IPL, it is money, and not the standard of the game, that counts. A controversial new idea is always welcome, because it generates more interest. But are such episodes helpful for the game of cricket?          
	Yours faithfully,       
Subhayu Saha, Murshidabad

      
	Sir  The report, Radical shift at Rider helm (March 26), points to the fact that conspiracies against Sourav Ganguly which started way back in 1990-91 simply refuse to die, even though he has now retired from international cricket. That the decision to strip Ganguly of captaincy had been taken much earlier is clear from John Buchanans clever move to announce his novel doctrine immediately after the Board of Control for Cricket in India stated that this years Indian Premier League would be held in South Africa. The apprehension of being greeted by a hostile Eden crowd had stopped the Australian coach from announcing his plans officially. Now that the IPL is to be held away from India, Buchanan will find it easy to defy Gangulys authority.           
	Buchanan has not only stabbed Ganguly in the back but has also talked of having four captains in the team which is a stupid idea. The truth is that Ganguly had displayed excellent all-round capabilities in the last edition of the IPL and bravely led his heavily-depleted side. The captain of a football team does not have much to do, except make himself available for the toss before the game. But in cricket, a number of crucial decisions are taken on the field by the skipper who also leads the team on the basis of certain ideas and philosophies. With four captains in one unit, team discipline will be affected adversely. Moreover, there will also be minimal accountability as no one will be willing to take sole responsibility for the team. Undoubtedly, these will have serious repercussions on the prospects of success of the Calcutta side.           
	Buchanan is aware that his innovative plan will have drastic consequence. But since his primary objective is to undermine Gangulys authority, he is ready to push the teams welfare to the backseat. First, Indias best-ever captain finds himself sharing the captaincy with three other players. Next, he may find that his coach has left him out of the playing eleven altogether. Shah Rukh Khan, the owner of Kolkata Knight Riders, may try his best to act pious, but the fact remains that he too must have had a hand in Gangulys humiliation. However, Khan need not worry as the reverential Bengalis will continue to support him and his team.                     
	Yours faithfully, Kajal Chatterjee, Sodepur

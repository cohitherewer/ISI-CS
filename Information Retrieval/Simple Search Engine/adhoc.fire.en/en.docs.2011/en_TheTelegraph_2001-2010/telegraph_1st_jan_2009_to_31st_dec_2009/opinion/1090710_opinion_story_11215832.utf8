The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | That scream inside
                                                                                                                 THAT SCREAM INSIDE                                                                  
	Speaking for myself: 
  An Anthology of Asian Womens Writing 
  Edited by Sukrita Paul Kumar and Malashri Lal, Penguin, Rs 650        
	For centuries, others have spoken for her. From the epics to the paperbacks, her stories have been translated into the male tongue before being told. Her own words were left unheard, thanks to the social practices that have taught her to be quiet, that see passivity as a virtue to be appreciated in a woman. Today, even when the Asian woman picks up the pen for herself, it often ends up echoing the male voice, owing to the century-old patriarchal thought-processes that dominate her psyche. Sometimes, when she does speak for herself, her accounts are typically labelled feminist, and often dismissed for being so.        
	Speaking for Myself, therefore, is a laudable effort. The editors have diligently collected works of fiction by women across Asia, a continent that is not only gigantic, but also extremely diverse in terms of social, cultural, religious and literary practices and traditions. Bi Shu-min of China, Mahasweta Devi of India, Taslima Nasreen of Bangladesh, Nazik al-Malika of Iraq, Lam Thi My Da of Vietnam and many others come close to one another within the covers of this book. Their stories often mirror or blend into one another; sometimes they challenge one another, and sometimes they seem to be in a dialogue.        
	The style, approach and content of these stories differ in most exceptional ways. Yet what is interesting is that these narratives also seem to have a shared thread that weaves them together. It may be nave to typify this shared emotion as feminism. Rather, what makes these stories unique is an unmistakable feminine quality, not only in their style or content, but also in their inherent perspectives.         
	This collection was originally aimed at exploring the way knowledge is transmitted across boundaries. It had sought to discover the origins of this process through the nature of interaction between two generations  between the mother and the child. What has emerged is a saga of inheritance through the weaving of words. But it is often not just knowledge that has been passed on. The many centuries-old tradition of the needle and the thread  the weaving of the kantha  that forms the quintessence of womanhood in the East has borne along with it another timeless tradition. That is the tradition of storytelling, of passing on memories and dreams from one generation to another. Irinas Picture by Rizia Rahman of Bangladesh is one such story of the inheritance of dreams. To escape the harshness of mainstream societys power structures, the protagonist seeks refuge in his mothers memories that bring him dreams of peace and white roses.        
	The relationship between the mother and the child quite often comes up as a subject in many of these stories. The most interesting is perhaps One Centimetre by Bi Shu-min of China. It is a story of a mothers desperate efforts to justify herself to her son, to stay honest and good in his eyes. It almost seems as if she is justifying herself to society rather than to her own child.        
	Countless images and startling ideas crowd the pages of this book, that of a womens club formed with a desire to share its members sorrows and happiness, as in Umbrella on a Moonlit Night by Tsuboi Sakae of Japan, for example, or the painful yet resonant cry  I scream inside in My Silence by Nazik al-Malaika of Iraq. The collage of these impressions creates the sense of voices that have much to share, voices waiting for a listener.                          ADHEESHA SARKAR

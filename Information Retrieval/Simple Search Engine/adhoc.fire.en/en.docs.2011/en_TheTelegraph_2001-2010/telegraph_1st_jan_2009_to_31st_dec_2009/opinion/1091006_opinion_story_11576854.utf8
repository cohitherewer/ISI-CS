The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Lessons to be Learnt
                                                                                                                 LESSONS TO BE LEARNT                                  Malvika Singh                              
	In London last week, India was celebrated with much energy, generating connectivity with the world and a great deal of goodwill. Contemporary art exhibitions merged seamlessly with expositions of a classical past. Subodh Guptas Aam Aadmi show, spread across two galleries on Piccadilly and Old Bond Street, and Anish Kapoors exhibition at the Royal Academy on Piccadilly had the street rocking with extraordinary energy that has put these two sculptors at the high table of international art. Juxtaposed with these is the exhibition at the British Museum of paintings from Marwar, and the about-to-open Maharaja extravaganza at the V amp;A. In addition, Ismail Merchants private collection of paintings, textiles and other artefacts are open for viewing before the hammer goes down on them tomorrow.        
	The response of ordinary people to all these shows has been unusual and extremely positive. Unlike in India, museums in London beckon the curious passer-by and the scholar alike, and have made the city a Mecca of art of all genres, of experimentation and of expositions where curators are able to conceive the out-of-the-box without the constraints of babudom. We have many lessons to learn from all this. We have to make our museums into spaces that people want to visit regularly and cherish.        
	It was most refreshing to see the mayor of London, Boris Johnson, a young conservative party MP, cycle down Piccadilly, chain his bike at the kerbside, wander into the Subodh show with his wife, and walk through the exhibition. There was no nonsense of guards or officious babus clearing the path. True austerity has made him a hugely popular leader who is besieged by people on the streets using their cell phones to have themselves photographed with Boris. They all refer to him as Boris and have no hang-ups at all when engaging with their mayor.                 
	Standing apart        
	The pomposity of the Indian mayors can only be described as farcical posturing when compared to the Boris show. Virtually number three in the leadership hierarchy of the Tory party, Johnson has his red light flashing at the rear of his cycle helmet instead on the roof of his car. Lets hope that sooner or later Indian politicians will feel secure and comfortable enough in their own skin to behave like normal human beings working on the job at hand.        
	Sunday morning shows on the box in London are intellectually appetizing and a real treat. Hard hitting, probing interviews  with political leaders such as Gordon Brown, the prime minister who got miffed and walked out of the show with the microphone attached to his collar, and then one with the prime minister-in-waiting, who was grilled about how he could rectify the mess if elected  gave one a good sense of what British politics is going through as the country gears up for the not-so-far off general election. For someone visiting, the programmes were riveting. The style of interviewing gave the person who was being interviewed enough rope and time to answer with the necessary substance. We, in India, have a long way to go in this sphere.         
	Civilized behaviour in the public domain is another attribute of the British people that makes them stand apart. When you compare London to Delhi, the stark difference in road manners, for one, hits you hard in the face. We are all over the place, breaking every rule, blowing horns relentlessly and unable to pause at pedestrian crossings. The home minister, P. Chidambaram, was right when he recently said that Indians should use this opportunity as hosts of the Commonwealth Games to learn and absorb the simple manners of civil society. Till we respect one another and learn to live as part of society, we shall never come out of the shackles of a messy and careless nation of the third world .

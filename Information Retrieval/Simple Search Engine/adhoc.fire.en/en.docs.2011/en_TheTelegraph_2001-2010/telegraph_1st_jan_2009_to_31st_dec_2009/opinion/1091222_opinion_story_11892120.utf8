                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        RIGHT TO SAY NO                                                    
	Appearances are often deceptive. Narendra Modis decision to make voting compulsory in civic polls might appear, on the face of it, a welcome and radical move. It forces people to participate in the democratic process. The word forces in the previous sentence is used advisedly. Embedded in the idea of democracy is the notion of freedom. Indeed, freedom is the driving force of democracy. One implication of the association of freedom with democracy is the empowerment of individuals through choice. Individuals, when they decide to vote, choose one candidate over the many others who are contesting the polls. Choice also means the freedom not to take part in the polls by not voting. There could be any number of reasons for not choosing to vote, including the absence of belief in democracy itself. Democracy has within it space enough to include people who do not believe in democracy. Mr Modis new law is thus undemocratic for two reasons. First and foremost, by introducing an element of coercion it takes away the freedom that is central to democracy. Following from the above, the new law reduces room for dissent within democracy.        
	There is another ancillary point that needs to be made in this context. Elections in India no longer give voters the option of not supporting any of the candidates contesting the polls. Before the introduction of the electronic voting machine, it was possible for a voter to cancel his vote by stamping on two places or not stamping on any of the symbols. The electronic voting machine has taken away this option. It does not permit a voter to cancel his vote and thereby express his refusal to choose from the candidates who have stood for elections. Thus there is already an element of the reduction of choice built into the prevailing voting system. Mr Modi is reducing this further by saying that it will be compulsory for everyone to vote in the civic polls. His intentions might be noble: he probably wants all adults to participate in the election of the person who will represent a given ward in the civic body. Such noble intentions, however, run counter to one of the basic principles of democracy. It is clear that for reasons best known to Mr Modi, he has not thought this matter through and has sought to curtail the choice that is available to citizens. This is an ominous development. What Indians need is an expansion of choice and freedom, not their reduction.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | with a blazing tail
                                                                                                                 WITH A BLAZING TAIL                                                                  
	You have to do what you have to do. Isnt that what the Gita says? No one needs to read the Gita to know this, no one needs to read anything at all. A strange spectre called Indian Culture has a magic way of taking possession of brains emptied to receive it and do its bidding. Those shameless, liquor-loving females and the bal-kattis who think they can hog the limelight by supporting them have been asking ignorant questions like, Is it Indian culture to beat up women? Why ask? Dont they know? Cant they see? You have to beat them up at home, you have to beat them up outside. Those women are lucky they still have their noses. Didnt Lakshman cut off Surpanakhas nose because she was forward?         
	This Indian Culture is a very precious thing. Because its precious, only a few are initiated into its mysteries. Mysteriously initiated, needing neither texts nor ancient monuments to learn their mantras. They are the elect. They set the style of Indian Culture. They like a riot  of colours. Red and orange especially, whether in clothes, or in splashes of vermilion on receding foreheads, or in flags and banners, or in flames devouring books and paintings, or in the blood of anyone at hand who doesnt think as they do. Their knowledge is special: they know that only men can hold hands and hug and walk about with their arms around one another in public; a woman who tries to do this with a man should be either beaten up or taken violently by many, just to teach her a lesson. They know that widows are treated as they should be, since they havent had the wifely dedication to commit sati; any bal-katti filmmaker who can be even suspected of thinking different must be stopped from making her film. The elect has a huge army of foot-soldiers, who need not even know about Lakshman and Surpanakha. All they have to focus on is Hanuman with his blazing tail in Lanka  whats the point of remembering the rest of the story of Rams devotee? I dont think these style gurus like pink.                    BHASWATI CHAKRAVORTY

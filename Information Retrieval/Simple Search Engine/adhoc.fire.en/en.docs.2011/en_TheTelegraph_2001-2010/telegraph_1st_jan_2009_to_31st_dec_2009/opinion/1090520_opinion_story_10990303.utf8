The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | lost party
                                                                                                                 LOST PARTY                                                    
	The Bharatiya Janata Party is mired in a contradiction. Blazoned on its flag is the ideology of Hindutva. Yet it wants to rule India with its diverse population and pluralist culture. It is unlikely that the BJP will address this contradiction when it undertakes its ritual introspection of its electoral defeat. Till it does so, its mission statement will haunt the BJP as it pursues its political ambition. It cannot be denied that at a certain time when the Congress party, because of its own internal problems, was in decline, the BJP, driven by its core ideology of Hindutva, successfully mobilized sections of the people in north India. This mobilization even brought to the BJP the sweet taste of political power. But the BJP could not further expand its base since it could do so only at the cost of diluting its own ideology. The ambitions of Delhi and the aspirations of Nagpur came into conflict. The BJP could not decide if it wanted to rule India as a party that appealed to all Indians or it wanted to remain a puppet tied to strings held by the leaders of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. India divided Delhi and Nagpur, and created for the BJP an identity crisis that follows it like a shadow.        
	The leader who walked the tightrope of this identity crisis was Atal Bihari Vajpayee. The party probably misses his presence now. The contradiction referred to in the previous paragraph is most clearly manifested in the personality of L.K.Advani, who seems unable to make up his own mind. And this confusion is reflected in the leadership vacuum within the party in the next generation. There is no leader of any standing after the octogenarians retire or are forced to retire. In many ways, the plight of the BJP today is its own making. Its leadership has shown no foresight and it committed the cardinal error of believing that catchy slogans were more important than substantial achievements. It had no issues to put forward and thus fell back on abusing the prime minister personally. But all these are symptoms of a deeper malaise identified here as an identity crisis growing out of a fundamental contradiction between the BJPs ideology and its ambition. The BJP perhaps needs a messiah to deliver it from its own past. But the fact that Bharat, and not India, is integral to the very name of the BJP is proof that as a party, the BJP is embedded in the past. Irretrievably so.

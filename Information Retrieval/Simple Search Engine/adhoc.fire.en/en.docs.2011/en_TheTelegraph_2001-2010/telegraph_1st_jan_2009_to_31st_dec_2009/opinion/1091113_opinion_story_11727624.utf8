	Firozabad in Uttar Pradesh: November 10, 2009. Reportedly, 30 electronic voting machines were removed from polling booths and later found in the possession of an extremely prominent national leader of the Opposition in Uttar Pradesh. It is believed that the polling stations from where the machines were removed were primarily non-Yadav and non-Lodh areas and would be the places from where Raj Babbar would have gained an edge over the bahu of Mulayam Singh Yadav. This illegality that was being played out in Firozabad was blanked out by the national English language media, both print and electronic.        
	Channels and newspapers were, at that time, busying themselves with sordid city stories about paroles to convicts, and were also belting out hysterical repeats of the Koda and Bellary Brothers episodes, with no substantial changes or additions of news or editorial positions. The evening story that same day, one that titillated them, was that of the shameful goonda gardi in the Maharashtra assembly. Not one presenter stated emphatically that the Indian Constitution endorses and protects plurality. Anything outside that must be damned, and those indulging in this form of separatism must be severely punished under a law that does not need to be interpreted but instead, enforced. Sometimes, when the law is broken in full public view, the media must take a position.        
	Back to the Firozabad story. The same media, mandated to be the watchdog of our democracy, managed to skirt the EVM story, which was symbolic of the criminality that has entered our democratic processes and mechanisms. There was no mention of it anywhere. Why did the glass-fronted, comfortable, smart and swanky offices of the press in Delhi not expose this happening in Firozabad? Surely, it had its reporters there following Raj Babbar. Why this orchestrated silence? It was a silly, rather stupid, silence because Raj Babbar defeated Yadavs bahu with a resounding lead of 85,000 votes.                 
	Next time        
	The Samajwadi Party has been roundly routed by the Bahujan Samaj Party in the assembly elections. The Congress, from third and fourth positions, has moved up the scale to number two, but it should be disappointing for the party to find itself losing two seats that are in the constituencies of sitting ministers of state at the Centre  Jitin Prasada and R.P.N. Singh. The Jhansi ticket went to a clear non-winner, on the whim of a senior leader, and the seat was lost. Here is yet another opportunity for the Congress to revamp its decision-making vis--vis ticket distribution and other such managerial issues in UP. The old guard has failed to take the changing trajectory that unfolded in the last general election further up the scale of victories. Such political operators must be put to pasture and a fresh, new dispensation, which does not carry the baggage of unsavoury politicking and old, failed tactics, must be given the mandate to deliver. The Congress, pitted against the BSP, could swing UP in its favour next time round with the right strategy.         
	The political muck is finally rising to the surface and choking the nation. Its stench is overpowering. A new beginning is inevitable because things around us cannot get much worse. Once the protectors of the commercial mafia, who are operating outside the law to dislodge people from their legitimate homesteads, are exposed and denied the loot, the correctives will resume.        
	Illegal activities must be stopped for the cleansing of a hugely corrupt but privileged conglomerate of the state administration, business tycoons and the political class. With growing tension on all its borders, India has one priority cleaning up the internal mess and governing with equality and transparency.

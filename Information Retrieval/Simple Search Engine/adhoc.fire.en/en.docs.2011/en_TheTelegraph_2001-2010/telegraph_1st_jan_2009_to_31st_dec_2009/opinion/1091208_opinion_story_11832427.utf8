                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        LIVING IN HOPE                                  Malvika Singh                              
	The three wheeler phatphat, unchanged in model over the years and with no technical upgradation whatsoever except for the switchover to CNG, continues to pollute India with unnecessary noise, smoky emissions and the consistent breaking of traffic rules. It was once the cheap vehicle that transported you from one point to another, but today it is symbolic of all that is unhealthy and wrong in terms of pollution. This little menace that makes us all cough and choke needs to be urgently considered and its negative impact on our towns and cities requires early and definite redressal. For decades, there have been no rules for this vehicle, and it has managed to run amok. The time has come to phase these vehicles out and replace them with a more modern, non-polluting, silent machine.        
	We cannot talk about the imperatives of climate change on one platform and then permit the worst polluting entities to carry on and poison us all and our children. The scandal that never seems to be tackled with firm and determined resolve is the conscious destruction of the once-mighty river Ganga. A barrage of positive activism by NGOs and many well-argued interventions by the powers-that-be have resulted in neither any good nor in an immediate stalling of the wrongdoing. Rapacious businessmen, aided by greedy, unthinking bureaucrats who have defied their mandate to conserve and protect by doing just the opposite in the name of development, and politicians and planners in a hurry to show short-term results by clearing anti-environment projects fast, have dealt a severe blow to the future lives of their children and grandchildren, all for some quick bucks.                
	Poisoned space        
	Rajiv Gandhi had an acute concern for the rapid degradation he witnessed. The cleaning of the Ganga, in its broadest sense, was a project he was serious about. But the bureaucratic octopus saw to it that all his demands and policies were thwarted and then diluted. He passed away prematurely and thereafter, conservation and protection of environment were given the short shrift, allowing corruption to enter and take root. Illegal mining, the felling of prime and pristine forests for the timber trade, rampant poaching of our extraordinary wildlife, the poisoning of our rivers by dumping industrial waste into them, the accumulation of wastes in our towns and cities because our municipalities are not accountable, in short, the breaking of all laws by law makers themselves for personal gain, have made India a playground of disease.        
	The government watches in silence and is unable to act with force. The Ganga, in its higher reaches, is becoming a trickle. The Yamuna, which once flowed along the walls of the capital of Emperor Shah Jahan, has been reduced to a filthy, polluted sliver of a river. We should be ashamed of ourselves. Every great world capital that has a river within its boundaries has nurtured, sanctified and respected that lifeline. We seem paralysed. We seem unable to grab the essence of the problem and ensure that various mechanisms are put in place and made to work. We use the excuse of committees and suchlike to delay processes that would ensure reform. Corruption seems to have overwhelmed all those mandated to govern India.        
	Our bureaucrats and politicians cry hoarse on national and international fora about not wanting to be dictated by Western powers on the issues of control and other such rules. But that is a separate call. Surely they believe that they need to cleanse their nation of the poison they have injected into the public space? Will they be irresponsible and fight international protocols, make a lot of nationalistic noise, only to detract from the truth of their great failure? Will Jairam Ramesh change the course? Yes, he can.

	Epic Actors Workshops Bipanna Bismay reminds us a lot of Molires classic satire, The Imaginary Invalid, but suffers in comparison. We also remember that Epic debuted way back in 1971 with a Molire adaptation. Here, the hypochondriac hero overhears his general physician speaking on the phone about another patient who has only a month to live, and jumps to the conclusion that the doctor is referring to him. As a result, he starts woefully making preparations for his own death. Meanwhile, his wifes male friend from their college days visits them after a long interval, throwing our hero into suspicion and jealousy, and he breaks down. But he begins to rationalize that without him they should be happy, after all, so he should allow their affair. Many complications later, a resolution takes place. The acting by the principals passes muster, but the play itself, written and directed by Debesh Chakravarty, is derivative. In fact, even the title has been used before, by Mohit Chattopadhyay, for a superior drama staged by Playmakers in 2000. Chakravarty shows some of his easy-going old skills in the walk-on part of an ambulance-chasing salesman, but we have seen him perform much better elsewhere.

	In harmony        
	Bhava Records amp; Cassettes in association with Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture arranged a programme around the release of an audio CD, Uttoron, based on the lives of Swami Vivekananda and Rabindranath Tagore. It featured a solo recital of Tagore songs by Abhirup Guhathakurata, with commentary by Swayambhu Mukhopadhyay at the Vivekananda Hall on October 13. Guhathakuratas voice is bold and naturally expressive, which is a rare combination. His style is marked by simplicity and devoid of any mannerism. He sang ten songs from Puja, Prem and Bichitra parjay, and they came in a wide variety of taals like teora, ektaal, dadra and choutaal. Songs like Hridoy aamar prokash holo, Aamar praner pare chole galo ke, Biswa jakhon nidramogon, Aami chanchalo he, Jadi prem dilena prane, Ogo kangal aamare kangal korechho, Jatobar aalo jalate chai and Chirosakha he chherona more were perfectly illustrated by a harmonic co-existence of music and rhythm, and attachment with devotion. The accompanists brightened up the programme wholeheartedly, and their contribution deserves applause.

                                                                                                                 OUTSIDE VISION                                                              
	Alive and disturbing, Rabindranath Tagores eyes look directly at the viewer out of the almost casually arranged formal group (top, left). It is Shambhu Shahas unerring perception that captures the coiled energy in the ageing poet even when Tagore is placed within an apparently conventional formation. From 1935 to 1941, when Tagore died, Shaha constantly visited Santiniketan and Tagore, and the result is a magnificent collection of photographs. Eighty-one of these have been presented in FACES AND PLACES OF VISVA-BHARATI: A COLLECTION OF PHOTOGRAPHS (Visva-Bharati, Rs 750). Tagore presides over this collection, in his many moods and moments, alone, or with famous visitors, with close friends, or on ceremonial occasions, benign, large, yet almost ethereal in his presence (bottom, right). The camera that paints the shades of white, as if in an attempt to body forth an inner, absorbed spirituality, also captures in light and shade the beauty of Santiniketan, its freedom of learning among nature (bottom, left), its moments of earnest, friendly intimacy (bottom second from left). The peculiar peace and quietness imaged in these photographs seem to emanate, in Shahas construction, as much from the landscape on which Tagore chose to build his university as from the poet himself.        
	Around him in Santiniketan coalesced a group of extraordinary personalities, and this volume has a series of unforgettable portraits, including one of the young Satyajit Ray. One of the most striking is that of Abanindranath Tagore (bottom, third from left) in which Shaha has captured the spirit of the sunlit, poetic, eccentric magician of words and pictures. Among the many famous visitors to Santiniketan, there is Jawaharlal Nehru, as well as a striking young Indira Gandhi, smiling as she signs an autograph book. There are many photographs of Mahatma Gandhi visiting, of which some are well-known. But to find Gandhi smiling widely with Kshitimohan Sen (top, right) is not so usual; it can only be caught by the lens of a patient, wily photographer. The delicately nuanced black-and-white of Shahas photographs releases the inner spirit of apparently formal occasions, captures almost imperceptible movements, engendering them with a vividness and motion that seem to lie just outside the bounds of immediate vision.         
	Shahas drama is seldom obvious, often nothing more than the light on the plane of a face, a turn of the head, or a stillness of stance. Out of these grow enigmatic moments, such as the photograph of Ramkinkar at work on Tagores statue at Kala-Bhavana (top, centre). What is it that the sculptor is giving his sculptured poet? The two hands almost mirror each other, one giving and one asking to be given. One creator creating another, caught in a wordless, mysterious exchange, in an impenetrable dynamic that lies at the heart of all creativity.                    BHASWATI CHAKRAVORTY

	Fake tribute                  
	Sir  Needless controversy is being created over Shashi Tharoors remark that Gandhi Jayanti ought to be a working day (Bogus homage, Oct 5). Under the guise of being secular and democratic, political leaders have ruined Indias work culture by declaring innumerable public holidays to appease their voters. These holidays end up jeopardizing productivity in government offices. The government employees hardly do any work at all. It is in the best interest of the nation that the number of holidays be reduced. However, it seems to be a rather far-fetched dream that such a step would be taken for the greater good of the nation.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  What is the point of celebrating Mahatma Gandhis birthday when we have almost forgotten the path he had shown us? It is an insult to him that we remember him only on a single day instead of throughout the year. On Gandhi Jayanti, his statues are cleaned and decorated with garlands. But isnt just practising non-violence sufficient to honour him? Gandhi recognized the value of ahimsa, which alone can bring peace  in the political as well as personal spheres. If we had properly remembered him, corruption and violence would have disappeared from India. Instead, violence is ever on the rise. It takes a film like Lage Raho Munna Bhai to remind people of the benefits of Gandhigiri. Either the show-off in the celebration of Gandhis birthday should stop or the day should be celebrated in the true spirit. We should not insult the man without whom Independence would have been impossible.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Shashi Tharoor has rightly stated that October 2 should be a working day rather than a holiday. Lately, the offering of homage to departed leaders has become a farce. One hopes that the government and politicians see reason and stop such charades.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Child abuse          
	Sir  This is not the first time in the history of Indian reality television that the abuse of child rights has come under focus (Kid abuse glare on Rakhi show, Oct 3). The latest attention-grabber, Pati Patni Aur Woh, which is being aired on NDTV Imagine, has been slapped with a notice from the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights, asking for the show to be pulled off the air. It is appalling to witness how children, as young as six months old, are being taken away from their familiar environments just for the sake of determining which celebrity handles the kids best.           
	For TRPs, publicity, money and entertainment, producers are leaving no stones unturned and are willing to stoop low. It is shocking how they went on to air such a show even after Baby Borrowers, the original show from which Pati Patni Aur Woh has borrowed the concept, was banned in the United Kingdom. Indians, who are known to be sensitive, are bound to object if kids are ill-treated. Making children below the age of consent act in television soaps amounts to child labour. It is time to take some stern action, not only to stop what is happening but also to ensure that such hideous acts are not repeated. It is our duty to secure a peaceful and sane environment for children.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The reality show, Pati Patni Aur Woh, clearly violates the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act. Parents are making the babies participate in this show in order to gain publicity. But this may have negative consequences, as the babies are being deprived of their parents care at a time when they need it the most. It seems that for some parents, fame is more important than their childrens upbringing. But when children are employed in risky projects, it becomes imperative to invoke the child labour act. It is better to replace such shows as Pati Patni Aur Woh with ones that involve children in a positive and productive manner.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  The editorial, No sex, please (Sept 27), said that although a reference to sex has outraged the cricket team, it is true that every aspect of a cricketers life is now subject to regimentation. This is but natural, since cricketers and film stars are public figures. Successful and rich people are idols for the masses. They do not have any personal life nowadays owing to the medias hunger for news that has been triggered by the emergence of 24/7 news channels.           
	The sexual life of an individual is a personal matter and should not be discussed in public. Sex is a natural urge and a healthy sexual life benefits a couple. However, this urge may lead to immoral practices when a person has to stay away from his or her spouse. To prevent this, a couple must travel together on long tours, and no one should object to this. Additional expenses on this account should also be permitted.          
	Yours faithfully,

                                                                                                                 PLAYING CHECKERS                                                    
	The fears of the Chinese government and traditional American values converge at a point. They are both actively concerned about access to pornography through the Google search engine. The internet is inimical to the spirit of totalitarianism and of puritanism. And the Chinese governments ongoing efforts to control access to the internet epitomize this conflict. Unfortunately, or fortunately, this conflict, whenever it arises, always seems to get resolved in favour of the internet, in spite of token attempts at policing it more vigilantly. On the face of things, the Chinese States concern this time is for under-age users of the internet. But this moral or ethical anxiety is actually inseparable from a more specifically political one: Chinese citizens must be prevented from using the internet subversively, from being freely critical of the authorities. This is how moral and political censorship, Chinese authoritarian control and American family values paranoia end up colluding with each other over policing the internet and reining in the search engines.        
	Keeping in mind the essentially democratic and libertarian character of the internet, governments have to be sensible and clearheaded about where their controlling instincts and powers must confront their inevitable limits. There are other ways of protecting minors from pornography, and of regulating the sex industry itself. But it is not the role of governments to set themselves up as the cyberpolice. Children can be protected by their families, schools and other public or private institutions within which they live their lives. Without being clear about where its powers end, a paranoid or puritanical State could end up cutting a ridiculous figure to the world in trying to govern something that is necessarily ungovernable. And this sensibleness need not lead to the abyss of moral relativism.

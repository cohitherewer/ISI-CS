The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Under the Nano spell
                                                                                                                 UNDER THE NANO SPELL                                                                  
	The ultra-cheap Nano car may make the Communist Party of India (Marxist) pay dearly in the Lok Sabha elections. Or so it seems. The tiny car sits at the hub of huge controversies and brings back bitter memories, even to people geographically remote to Singur or Nandigram. Nothing has been forgotten it seems, especially owing to the electoral campaigns of the Opposition leader, Mamata Banerjee, which focus judiciously on the Nandigram atrocities. It looks like a tough fight this time for the CPI(M). Or is it, actually?         
	There are only two tragedies in life: one is not getting what one wants, and the other is getting it, said Oscar Wilde, and it holds good as far as the Nano project is concerned. Initially, at least the urban population in West Bengal had wanted the project to work. But if it had been successful, it is hard to say what the peoples reactions would have been to a factory erected on farmland acquired by an autocratic exercise of power. It may also be a bit nave to presume that this project by itself could have resolved the issues related to underdevelopment in West Bengal. However, it could have been a starting point, a path towards future investments of a similar kind. But now, situations are different. The urban voter utterly regrets losing the Nano to Gujarat. He feels sympathy for the farmers in Singur and Nandigram, but looks longingly at the model of the car displayed in Camac Street, pondering how Calcutta was only a Nano away from becoming what Bangalore or Mumbai is today. But that will never be, he laments, thanks to Mamata Banerjee, who spearheaded a stiff resistance to the project.        
	Santanu Talukdar, a student and first-time voter from south Calcutta, and Bijoeeta, a software professional from the same area, both agreed that Banerjee has been too much of a spoilsport. They both feel that encouraging industrialization would have been good for the state, as does Amitava Bhattacharya, a doctor from Kestopur. For the first time, the government had thought about urban people. I am utterly disturbed that the project did not happen, he said.        
	The CPI(M), of course, is aware of this urban emotion, and is playing it up in its own campaigns. Harping on the projects departure in every speech and hoarding, it is openly blaming the Trinamul Congress for it. It is a convenient move too, as the people, used to being ruled by the same alliance led by the CPI(M) for 32 years, feel comfortable about blaming the Opposition for such failures. Therefore, Calcutta, having a phenomenally weak memory, appears to have forgotten the incompetence of the Left in handling the project.        
	Nevertheless, a small section of people sees the projects termination as a boon rather than a curse. Debashish Biswas, a professor of economics residing at Patipukur, said he is strictly against production of small cars that would enhance pollution, calling the idea redundant and unscientific. Avisek Ray, a student of Jadavpur University, said he ethically condemns the idea of de-peasantization. He sees the project as a ploy to cater only to the political interests of few, and done with least consideration for ecology. This is basically a paradox that the ruling government wants industry on agricultural land and housing projects and SEZ on land meant for industry, he said.        
	But Ray also said he thinks that the urban voters in Bengal, who are still under the Nano-spell, would incline in favour of the ruling party, and reproach the TMC for the failure of the project. This, in fact, seems to be true.         
	Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had a noble cause indeed. West Bengal will no doubt need to bag more industrial projects if it plans to keep pace with the country as well as with the world. But a noble cause has to be substantiated with a practical plan and sincere effort. This seemed to be missing in the Nano project, which, one hopes, the CPI(M) has realized. And if people are also quick to pick this up, the Nano will create a much-needed space for a dialogue to ensue, after over three decades of a one-sided monologue.                     ADHEESHA SARKAR

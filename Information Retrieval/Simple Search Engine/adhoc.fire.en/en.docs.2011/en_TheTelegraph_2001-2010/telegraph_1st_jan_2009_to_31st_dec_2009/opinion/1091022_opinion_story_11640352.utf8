                                                                                                               Aimed solely at the world                                                              
	On September 24, 2009, the 15-member United Nations Security Council, during an unprecedented summit chaired by Barack Obama, unanimously adopted Resolution 1887 calling on states that have not signed the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to comply fully with all their obligations. The NPT, in place since July 1, 1968, has 189 countries that are party to the treaty. Of these, only five are recognized as nuclear weapon states. Only four recognized sovereign states  India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel  are not party to the treaty. The first three have openly tested and declared they possess nuclear weapons. Israel has a policy of opacity regarding its nuclear programme.        
	The Federation of American Scientists, arguably the most respected association of scientists in the world, recently released a report stating that Pakistan had 70-90 nuclear weapons and was adding fast to its arsenal. It also confirmed that the Chinese have provided the knowhow of not only the highly effective plutonium reactors  the instruction manuals provided by the infamous A.Q. Khan to the Libyans were in Mandarin  but of the Shaheen II missile as well, capable of striking all major Indian cities. Khalid Kidwai, the head of Pakistans strategic forces command, has declared that the countrys entire nuclear arsenal is aimed solely at India, though he is quick to add that such an eventuality will arise only if Indian attacks either make deep inroads into Pakistans urban centres or significantly degrade its army or air force.         
	To the vast majority of Pakistanis, the rationale for acquiring nuclear arms was provided very tellingly by Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto shortly after the Bangladesh debacle in December 1971. He argued it was imperative that Pakistan acquire nuclear weapons to counter the larger conventional weapons capability of India. He declared that while Christian, Jewish and Hindu civilizations could have nuclear weapons, he would like to be remembered as the person who provided these to the Islamic civilization. Shortly after, funding for the Islamic bomb was initiated by Saudi Arabia and Libya, with the latter and Iran the beneficiaries of knowhow and equipment.         
	George W. Bushs final year of presidency witnessed an alarming development, first reported by the US Military Academy at West Point, that Pakistans three nuclear-weapons-related facilities at Kamra air base, Wah ordnance factory and Sargodha arms storage site were targeted by suspected jihadis. The Pakistan governments choice of these sites was questioned by arms experts across the globe as all three were in areas difficult to protect from jihadis or extremists willing to sacrifice their lives for a cause. Earlier, the Bush administration had revealed that Pakistani nuclear scientists, Suleiman Asad and Al Mukhtar, met Mullah Omar and Osama bin Laden, and held discussions in Kandahar on radiological devices. Sultan Bashiruddin Mehmood and Chaudhuri Abdul Majeed, two close associates of Khan, were detained for maintaining close contacts with al Qaida and the Taliban. Earlier Mehmood, echoing Bhutto, had publicly proclaimed Pakistans nuclear arsenal as the property of the whole Muslim world.        
	In spite of his aimed solely at India comment, Kidwai is considered a moderate and was commissioned at a time when the countrys army still had a semblance of civilian control. But subsequent recruits in the countrys armed forces and the influential ISI have clandestinely associated with fundamentalists and refrained from taking action on extremists on the pretext that they too have a cause, pointing a finger at Kashmir and Palestine among others. Khans proliferation could not have been possible without their looking the other way.         
	The Islamic world is not a unified group of nations. To cash-rich, Sunni-dominated Saudi Arabia, Shia-dominated Iran is an arch enemy, and Pakistans Sunnis are gradually turning to the conservative (Sunni) Wahhabi Saudis for material and spiritual inputs. The Wahhabis, in turn, are funding every cause to spread their sects influence globally. The scenario of a cash-strapped, Wahhabi-dominated Pakistan selling its nuclear expertise to other Islamic countries, which but for Iran are Sunni, is not as far-fetched as it seemed ten years back.        
	In response to the UNSC Resolution 1887, India had responded that it will not sign the NPT as a non-nuclear weapon state, emphasizing that nuclear weapons are an integral part of Indias national security and will remain so. It is unlikely that on Manmohan Singhs state visit to the US next month, there will be any change in Indias take on the NPT.

	Harsh measures                  
	Sir  The news that a student of the Andal Girls High School died after her teacher threw a duster at her caused unbearable anguish (Teachers duster hit kills girl, May 16). That the savage practice of corporal punishment is still prevalent is a telling commentary on the state of affairs in education. Such incidents are being reported in the media  both print and electronic  with a chilling regularity. What makes this particular incident doubly tragic is that the victim, Babli Ghosh, a class V student, met her end within days of getting admitted to the school.           
	Babli was hit by her Bengali teacher, Rekha Bhakat, with a duster after she failed to recite a poem from her text book. She fell down unconscious, and started vomiting later. The incident took place around 12.15 pm but the girls grandfather was informed, hours later, that she had been taken to a nursing home after she fell ill because of the heat. She died on her way to a hospital in Durgapur.           
	Bablis father has lodged an FIR against Bhakat, and the police are reported to be on the lookout for her. The education minister, Partha De, has reportedly lamented that such incidents keep on recurring despite the fact that school authorities have been instructed not to take recourse to corporal punishment. But the ministers remark will be little consolation for the victims family. It is imperative that teachers found guilty of killing students in the name of discipline be treated as criminals and meted exemplary punishment. Anything short of that will not be enough to stop this horrible practice.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The death of 11-year-old Babli Ghosh does not come as a surprise. Such incidents have taken place earlier, resulting in the death of many children. One wonders how a teacher can turn into a killer, and a school into a house of torment. There is no law that permits parents or teachers to physically abuse children by way of disciplining them. In fact, it is time to examine the wisdom of the phrase, Spare the rod and spoil the child. The rod should be spared to secure the life of students. A teacher first needs to understand the meaning of discipline before going about disciplining children. A student may be guilty of not doing his homework, or any other lapse, but if a teacher is competent enough, he/she will deal with the child without resorting to violence. Furthermore, why are children being subjected to physical abuse for the sake of discipline? The government should strengthen the law that prohibits corporal punishment in schools. Teachers should be asked to give a pledge, before being recruited, that they would refrain from abusing students in any manner.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  That a teacher, who is supposed to be a mentor to students, can be cruel is beyond imagination. A teacher has the right to punish students, but that does not necessarily mean that he can strike a student on the head with a duster. It is often the case that educated adults, who are teachers by profession, possess neither skill nor a sense of responsibility. The teacher who threw the duster at the girl probably had no idea that the act could have serious consequences. And how grave was Babli Ghoshs fault? Had she done great wrong by failing to memorize a poem? The teacher could have disciplined her without injuring her severely. Asking her not to come to school for a couple of days would have been enough to ensure that she did her homework the next time.           
	A teacher is supposed to guide his or her students. But what lessons will students draw from this heinous conduct of a teacher? Can they expect that teachers will change their behaviour in the future? For that to happen, teachers will have to take lessons from this shocking incident and carefully consider their views regarding discipline, punishment and education in general.           
	The government has banned corporal punishment by law. Teachers must be held accountable for their actions. They should be penalized if they were to punish students in an unacceptable manner.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Original vision          
	Sir  In The Singh factor (May 17), Rudrangshu Mukherjee credits the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, for freeing India from the shackles of Hindu rate of growth. The credit for this momentous economic achievement, however, must go to Rajiv Gandhi.           
	Following his mothers violent death, he became the prime minister in 1984. Apparently inexperienced but young and energetic, Rajiv Gandhi took a few bold steps which, in a way, were the precursors to economic liberalization. Even within the framework of a mixed economy, he took steps to put the notorious license permit raj on hold. The limited economic reforms set forth by him saw the emergence of a resurgent industry and service sector. The long wait for substandard two-wheelers vanished, much to the chagrin of black marketers. Finally, in 1988, the country achieved for the first time since independence an economic growth rate which was higher than the Hindu rate of growth. Despite his many shortcomings, especially in politics and foreign affairs, Rajiv Gandhi envisioned India to be a world leader. Unfortunately, he was killed by extremists who have now been defeated.          
	Yours faithfully,

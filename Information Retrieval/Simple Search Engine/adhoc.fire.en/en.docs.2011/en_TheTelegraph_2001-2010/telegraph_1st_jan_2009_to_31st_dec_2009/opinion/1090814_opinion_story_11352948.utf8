                                                                                                                 TIME TO BELL THE CAT                                  BONA FIDE - Malvika Singh                              
	The war between the Ambani brothers that has been chewing up television time for the last few weeks is the outcome of the unfortunate nexus of politicians, ministers, the administration and the corporate world that became entrenched in our life during the command economy years when restrictions dominated and entrepreneurship suffered. To survive, grow and generate wealth, deep, and often insidious, connections with those in power were required. With the dismantling of the license raj and the gradual opening of the economy, this protected oasis of personalized decision-making  where largesse was dispensed on the basis of who you knew in high places  was not replaced by good business ethics and a transparent corporate governance. The political class, now comfortable in this relationship, seems unwilling to agree to a divorce.        
	Today, in a new and dynamic millennium, Indian business people struggle to conduct their operations with dignity and honesty. Corruption and bad practice continue to rule, and the public comprehends, quite easily, why particular people are placed in certain ministries. Who is whose man is common knowledge in India. It is also known who did what, when and where to put XYZ in the kursi. In any society in transition from being a closed economy to becoming an open and competitive one, contortions are bound to happen and it is the duty of the prime minister and his cabinet to ensure that the change in the operating system of government also takes place simultaneously. Nepotism, favouritism, veiled decision-making, and half-truths presented to the press, public and the government must be stopped decisively. We all know which minister is close to whom. It is the masala of the great oral tradition that has been the knowledge base of the Indian civilization over thousands of years.                
	Fresh start        
	To start a process of cleansing, to show with determination that nepotism will not be tolerated, requires a rejigging of portfolios to prove what is right and what is wrong. The favouritism shown to ministers by powerful corporates, or the placement of these ministers in key positions by chosen political functionaries, who manipulate their leaders with half-truths, must cease. Those playing such politics must be removed from trusted positions and an example clearly established to show that the government is non-partisan and willing ensure an even playing field for all. Party secretaries interfering with critical appointments, favouring one against the other, is unbecoming of political entities entrusted with ministries.        
	Surely, this government, with Manmohan Singh at the helm, can radically overhaul a negatively politicized system that has been insular and exclusive. The time has come to make all commercial matters that have dealings with the government transparent. The prime minister knows better than most how to cleanse the corroded system and establish transparent and inclusive parameters under which ethics and good practice would get priority instead of personal acquaintance. The Congress must back him in all possible ways. For the next generation to create and generate national wealth based on entrepreneurship and idealism, we need a radical and immediate change in attitude, form and norms. Let us not carry forward all living truths that presented India as a difficult place to conduct honest business in. The time is right to discard the old and unacceptable methods that drag India down on the world stage.        
	Imagine an entrepreneurial people being liberated from a closed, corrupt and personalized access system to a comprehensive set of norms and regulations essential for conducting honest business. Much needs to change, starting with the mindset of the political class and the bureaucrats. So who will pledge to bell the cat on August 15 this year?

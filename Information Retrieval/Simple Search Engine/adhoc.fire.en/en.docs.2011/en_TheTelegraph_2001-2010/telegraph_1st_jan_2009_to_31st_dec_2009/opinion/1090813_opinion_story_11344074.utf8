	Deadly virus                  
	Sir  The unfortunate death of Rida Shaikh in a private hospital in Pune has startled the government (First swine flu victims family to sue hospitals, Aug 5). This is not only because Shaikh was the first victim of swine flu in India, but also because the victim neither had any record of foreign travel nor had any contact with people visiting India from other countries affected by the virus. Till now, symptoms of this disease were found only in those who had travelled outside the country. However, Shaikhs death proves that the deadly virus has started affecting others as well. The disease could become pandemic because of its highly contagious nature. That will be disastrous for India. The governments helplessness, in this case, is understandable. It cannot be expected to acquire enough resources overnight to combat the sudden attack of the virus. This must be the reason why the government has now decided to include private hospitals as well in its fight against swine flu.           
	However, most private hospitals do not have the facilities necessary for attending to a large number of swine flu patients. Moreover, the treatment is costly, often beyond the means of ordinary people. The doctors in most hospitals are not equipped to handle a large number of patients. They are also few in number, and most of them shuttle between hospitals to earn some extra income. The irresponsible way in which the two Pune-based hospitals have allegedly handled Shaikhs case, leading to her death, is an example of their negligence and ignorance about the danger posed by swine flu.           
	The government should choose only those private hospitals which have good track records, and ensure that these hospitals have the facilities required for effective diagnosis and proper treatment .                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Srikanta Bhattacharjee, Calcutta              
	Sir  The Maharashtra government has issued show-cause notices to two private hospitals in Pune in connection with the recent death of Rida Shaikh, a teenager affected by swine flu. Reportedly, the family of Shaikh said that it would sue the two hospitals in Pune for alleged wrong diagnosis that led to her death. If this is true, then the health department will be left with only one task in future  to issue show-cause notices to many other hospitals that diagnose cases wrongly, often leading to the death of the patients.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  In India, swine flu is spreading faster than was expected. This is because many people visiting the country from abroad are carrying the flu virus with them . In order to check this, every passenger boarding a plane to India from abroad must carry a mandatory health certificate from a qualified doctor stating that he or she is not infected with swine flu. People who had swine flu should be allowed to visit India only when they have been treated and have recovered from the disease. This rule should also be applicable to non-resident Indians. The media should be careful about the way they report the spread of the virus. Extensive coverage would magnify the issue more than is necessary, and will create panic among people.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  People are trying to take precautions against the infectious disease, swine flu. In this context, one should keep in mind the handling of currency, which often becomes the medium for passing on bacteria from one body to the other. People should take care to wash their hands well after handling currency notes.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The governments speculations about whether schools need to be shut down because of swine flu are spreading panic among people (Stay-home advice to curb flu, Aug 12). The first thing that should have been restricted is the entry of swine flu-infected individuals into the country. Having failed to do that, the government now needs to focus on how to fight the virus that has already affected India. The Indian scientists should concentrate on effectively identifying the virus, and discover a method to prevent its spread. Diagnostic centres across the country should be equipped with the necessary technology required to diagnose the disease promptly, so that private hospitals can quickly identify swine flu patients and start treating them. It is also ridiculous to expect a few government hospitals and test centres across the country to shoulder the burden of swine flu patients in all the heavily populated metros and cities. These hospitals are struggling to cope with the number of swine flu-infected patients, and in the process, are spreading the virus among other patients and visitors. More clinics and diagnostic centres are needed. The electronic media, in this case, can help by running public health campaigns, advising people on what symptoms to look out for, what to do and what not to do once someone is affected.          
	The swine flu is just another virus. Its effect appears to have been blown out of proportion because of neglect and ignorance. Even pneumonia, if not treated properly, can be fatal. So people need to be alert and conscious about the disease. One should not ignore a cold that lingers beyond a week but should also not panic every time someone sneezes. If panic causes schools and businesses to close down, things will only get worse. Instead of getting scared, people should adopt healthy, sanitary and civic habits for the long term.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Subash Chowdhury, Calcutta

                
	Sir  India should be united in its efforts to check the swine flu virus. The exit and entry points of cities severely hit by the flu must be screened to detect new cases. Instead of trying to gauge the problem through individual statements that are often not reliable, a professional committee should be set up to accurately record the spread of the flu. The health ministry should be firm in handling the project. A research may also be conducted in other south-east Asian countries to acquire knowledge about the control measures.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Footloose in a foreign land      
	THE HOUR BEFORE DAWN (Penguin, Rs 350) by Bhabendra Nath Saikia is the English version of the acclaimed Assamese novel, Antoreep. Elegantly translated from the original by Maitreyee S.C., this unusual story maps the journey of self-discovery undertaken by Menoka. An unremarkable village woman living in pre-Independence Assam, Menoka is shattered the day she finds out that her husband has taken a second wife. As her unfailing trust in her husband is jilted, Menoka retaliates by having an affair with an outcast. No doubt a complicated choice of love interest, but even more baffling are Menokas other avatars  of a committed mother, and later, of a caring elder sister-in-law to her rival. To Saikias credit, Menoka is neither turned into a fiery feminist nor an aspiring martyr. In fact, towards the end, the focus shifts to the turbulent relationship between Menoka and her son. Human understanding somewhow prevails over mutual acrimony in the end.                  
	SCOOP-WALLAH: LIFE ON A DELHI DAILY (Jaico, Rs 295) by Justine Hardy created quite a stir when it was first published a decade ago. Not only was the book shortlisted for the Thomas Cook Award, but it was also serialized on Radio 4. Although essentially a travelogue, the author uses a more arresting phrase to describe her endeavour: This book is a photograph of sorts, a verbal image that captures a country and a capital as both began to go through a vast transformation. The analogy is fairly accurate as Hardy does not use a continuous narrative but prefers putting together a series of fascinating, and often tantalizing, episodes. These involve odd people and odder places as seen through the eyes of a seasoned journalist. Hardys bizarre array of characters include an eccentric landlord and a potted plant called Ozymandias.                        
	Yoga panacea: a book of holistic medicine for holistic healing (Indian Publishing House, Rs 450) by P.S. Das aims to introduce readers to hatha yoga or the yogic physical science. To this end, the author provides a comprehensive scientific commentary on how yoga can affect the human body in positive ways. He also illustrates several asanas that can have a palliative effect on the body if practised diligently. This book will be useful to those who do not have the time for regular yoga lessons but would nonetheless like to learn this ancient art.

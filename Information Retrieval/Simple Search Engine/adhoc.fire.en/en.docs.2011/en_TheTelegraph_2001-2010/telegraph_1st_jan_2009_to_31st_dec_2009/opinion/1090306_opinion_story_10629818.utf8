	Try as it may, it is unlikely that the United Progressive Alliance government will get full marks for philanthropy. That the medical-military mission to Sri Lanka follows immediately after the announcement of the poll dates by the Election Commission may be coincidence. The mission has been in the pipeline for a while. But what is impossible to deny is the way the dynamics of the Indian electoral process have got things moving. It was in end-February that the Congress president, Sonia Gandhi, communicated her partys seriousness about the Sri Lankan Tamil cause with the announcement of a relief drive. Among the pious intentions behind the move was an attempt to convince the partys ally at the Centre, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, that its partnership was still valued. This partnership is being threatened not only by news from Sri Lanka, but also by the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam supremo, J. Jayalalithaa, who has been sufficiently emboldened by the situation to send feelers to the Congress for a possible poll alliance. Before equations worsened further, the UPA allies have come together to reaffirm their commitment to both domestic and foreign politics. Perhaps the foreign ministers sudden remark early this month  one which Sri Lanka has denied noticing  that Colombo accept the Tigers offer of a ceasefire (without surrender of arms) also needs to be read in this context.        
	Given the history of its relations with Sri Lanka, its cultural ties with a section of that countrys people and its role in the region, India cannot but play a major part in humanitarian assistance. It has provided unstinting assistance to Sri Lanka recently, especially after the tsunami. Even as the latest crisis unfolded, shiploads of relief landed on Lankan shores. But such aid has had enormous political implications for Indias ties with its neighbours wherever it has been extended, be it in Afghanistan or in Sri Lanka. In the latter, Indias plans to support rail-bus services and to set up export processing units and power plants in the Eastern Province are already being criticized as ways to play one Tamil faction against another and deepen political control. Also, there are fears that Indian assistance in Sri Lanka may prove to be a red rag to extremists of a particular faith. The commitment and efficiency of Indias armed forces may not be sufficient to allay these fears.

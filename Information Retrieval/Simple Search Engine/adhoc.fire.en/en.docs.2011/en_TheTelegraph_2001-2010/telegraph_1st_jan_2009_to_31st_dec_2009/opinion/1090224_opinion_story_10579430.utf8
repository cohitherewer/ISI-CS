                                                                                                                 REAL CULPRITS                                                    
	The government of Manipur is facing a paradox. The explosion of popular anger at the killing of three government employees by suspected militants compelled the police to resort to force and impose an indefinite curfew in Imphal last week that is now being gradually lifted. Part of the peoples anger was directed at the government for failing to protect its own. That finds expression in some of the demands made by the Apunba Lup, a powerful collective of social organizations, which has asked that criminal proceedings be instituted against the deputy commissioner of Ukhrul, from where the sub-divisional officer and his two subordinates had been abducted and killed. Manipurs active and articulate womens organizations too are in the forefront of this expression of widespread anger, although the chief minister, Okram Ibobi Singh, has not yet been able to progress beyond pacific noises. The people are furious because his government has lost men to the militants.        
	The real anger, though, is directed at the suspected militants. So strong is the suspicion against the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah) that the outfit has made a point of denying responsibility for the abduction and the murders. Three more men who had been kidnapped at the same time have been rescued alive, but that has not softened the popular demand to punish the culprits. This is the first time that the people have unanimously come out in protest against militant groups and their killings. Manipur has always been remarkable for the strength of its popular movements. The militant organizations, claiming to represent one or the other interest of the states diverse people, had been losing touch with the very population they were apparently fighting for. The long-term damage wrought on a state by explosions, killings, extortions, and heavy police and military presence is weighing heavily on its men and women. A government that cannot address either terror or popular aspirations, that can be suspected of harbouring leaders and bureaucrats not disinclined to encourage militant activity for their own benefit, is not an institution that Manipurs people can respect. It is as if they enacted the rage that the government should have experienced upon losing its own employees, and felt it necessary to make clear that the peoples support would be won only by a fight against militancy.

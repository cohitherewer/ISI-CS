The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | hard failure
                                                                                                                 HARD FAILURE                                                    
	If the winning theme in the latest assembly elections was development and stability, that trend had been inaugurated much earlier in 2008, in Karnataka. For the Bharatiya Janata Party, which had opened its account in the South with Karnataka in May, reaching absolute majority with byelections within seven months, as it has just done, should be heartening. In May, L.K. Advani had requested the people of Karnataka to give the BJP one chance to show how it could provide steady development and firm governance to a state racked by the repeated failures of successive governments and put under presidents rule. In comparison, the Congress was unfocussed in its campaign, dithering in its promises, and without a firm chief ministerial candidate to counter the BJPs B.S. Yeddyurappa. Both parties had been scalded by their successive partnerships with the fickle Janata Dal (Secular), which was somewhat sidelined on its own ground, although it did help to split the Congress vote.        
	The Congress may have hoped that its base among the Vokkaliga caste, and its inclusion of Dalits, Muslims, Christians and Brahmins would be more than a match for the BJPs hold over the north of the state through the loyalty it commanded from the Lingayat caste. But the people wanted something positive, and their choice said so. That nothing has changed in Karnataka even after the lessons of the assembly elections in five other states recently is evident from the byelections. The BJP won five of the eight seats and the JD(S) won three. The Congress, a sorry second in May, was wiped from the scene. Power, of course, has its unique magnetism. Seven of the eight seats needed byelections because the sitting legislators, four from the JD(S) and three from the Congress, had joined the BJP. This is slightly ridiculous, but it is also a good indicator of the unstable and opportunistic spirit that informs Karnatakas politics. It would need coherence and canniness to keep control, and the BJP is evidently doing that well. In Karnataka, as in Madhya Pradesh, the Congress has tripped on its own infighting, with local leaders striving for dominance and for tickets for their own favourites. Without the will and the planning to win, and without a programme to reassure the people with, the Congresss defeat in Karnataka, a few months short of the Lok Sabha elections, should not have been unexpected.

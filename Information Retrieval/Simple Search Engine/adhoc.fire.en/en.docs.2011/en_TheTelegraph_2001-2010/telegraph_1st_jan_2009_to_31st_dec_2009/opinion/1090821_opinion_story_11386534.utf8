	Albert Einstein once said that the hardest thing in the world to understand was the income tax. The basic principles of a good tax code are simplicity, clarity and ease of implementation, and less hierarchy. The new draft tax code scores a little unevenly on these principles. For the individual, greater reductions in tax rates, fewer exemptions and greater incentives to save and invest for the future are a big plus. Some will have a quibble about the exempt-exempt tax, which will levy taxes on withdrawals from tax-exempt investments like provident fund contributions, when they mature. But the overall restructuring of tax slabs and reduced tax rates combined with incentives will offset future tax liability. For companies, the law is being made simpler on classification and application of rules, besides being made more relevant to the current business environment. The law on tax holidays for exporters, for instance, is over 20 years old, and the new draft code is a serious attempt to correct that. But the new code is stricter, and includes non-bailable offences. At present, tax avoidance is a bailable offence and no one has to go to jail until tax fraud or wrongdoing is actually proved. The new code moves away from profit-based tax incentives to expenditure-lined ones, which is a welcome step; this boosts business investment, which propels growth. The code also shifts the basis for assessing the minimum alternative tax from revenues to assets, but setting a flat 2 per cent rate could inhibit the scale ambitions in capital intensive industries like infrastructure and power, since greater asset base means higher tax, and so lower investment.        
	The question of ease of implementation is a little trickier. There are provisions on general tax avoidance that could affect multinationals, and thus potential foreign direct investment: the new code allows tax authorities to look at the substance rather than the form of transactions that would be tax-exempt under the present code. This also extends to the double tax treaties that the government has signed with various other countries. As per international convention, provisions in double taxation treaties override domestic law; the new code says that the government can assume the right to override those treaties should tax avoidance or fraud be suspected. There is an ongoing global debate about the spirit of these treaties, including in the Group of Twenty (G20).        
	The code also adds a layer of hierarchy. At present, the responsibility for raising the demand and collection rests with tax assessment officers; the role of tax recovery officers is being expanded to allow their intervention in this as well. The new code is a work-in-progress; public comments and responses will address some issues, and correct them.

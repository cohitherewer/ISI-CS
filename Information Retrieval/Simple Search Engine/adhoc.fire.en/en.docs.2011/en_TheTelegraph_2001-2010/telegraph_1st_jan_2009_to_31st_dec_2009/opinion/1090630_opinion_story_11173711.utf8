	If you are looking at something very old and beautiful in a museum, the chances are that it should rightly have been somewhere else. It had probably got into the museum by a route that would now be deemed politically and ethically dodgy (or worse). But if it hadnt got to the museum in the first place, you wouldnt have been the richer for having looked at it. So, to what extent does this implicate you in the dubiousness of the museums acquisition of the object? And given this history, does the museum possess the object at all? These are some of the questions that may be shot at you if you were standing in the British Museum in London and looking at, say, the head of a horse broken off the Parthenon frieze in Athens more than two centuries ago, brought back to Britain by an English lord and then sold to the British Museum. And the questions are being fired at the British Museum by none other than the Greek government itself. Now that Athens has a fine new museum to keep its architectural sculpture in, the Greeks want the Parthenon marbles repatriated. But the British Museum believes that it has looked after the marbles for more than 200 years now, and a far greater number of people would get to see them if the marbles were in London rather than in Athens.        
	Undoing history  its loots and massacres, its petty as well as appalling abuses of power  is too complicated to be accomplished through simply a geographical relocation of objects. Reparation of the wrongs of nations often lies in the possibility of a radically reconstituted relationship between the wronger and the wronged that goes beyond the politics of either pure vengeance or pure forgiveness. With art and culture, and their objects and spaces, territorial notions of proprietorship are often impossible to implement in ways that wouldnt lead to absurdly disruptive, indeed impossible, situations. Perhaps museums and libraries are spaces that call for a different notion of belonging that goes beyond nation-states and their identities, for a different way of keeping, borrowing, lending, sharing, showing and valuing material culture. This is not to say that the new museology should be founded on a vast forgetting. Protecting beautiful and valued objects from nationalistic tugs of war requires a fuller and more mature awareness of the import of history.

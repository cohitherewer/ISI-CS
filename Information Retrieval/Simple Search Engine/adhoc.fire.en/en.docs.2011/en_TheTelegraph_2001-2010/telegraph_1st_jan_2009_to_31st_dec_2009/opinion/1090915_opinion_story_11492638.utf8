                                                                                                                 TIME TO TIGHTEN THE BELT                                  Malvika Singh                              
	When one compares Rahul Gandhis working style, priorities and focus with those of the general secretaries who are handling the ticket-baazi for the forthcoming state elections  using the corrupt techniques of currying favour and of dispensing largesse instead of sensibly consolidating the Congress by rooting out the prevailing nepotism  the future looks far more positive than the present.         
	The only fear is that leaders of my generation, who can see their modus operandi being steadily dismantled, may conspire to derail the plans by insidiously working against every out-of-the-box move. It is the oldest trick in the book, and it stagnates growth, retards the system and gives the ineffectual a little more time under the sun. Someone must crack the whip, and actively support retirement and replacement plans for a few leaders to energize the party.        
	The smart, intelligent trip through Tamil Nadu, the candid meeting with the press and the excitement about wanting to begin again were refreshing. Rahul Gandhi was discreet and honest in his responses. This dignity in public space should become the benchmark for all politicians and activists. It carries far more weight than the back-room wheeling and dealing and the posturings by VIPs that have become nauseating for all Indians outside the realm of leadership and administration.        
	This brings me to the austerity debate that has submerged all other news in the last few days. It is very easy to bring in corrections. The prime ministers office and the All India Congress Committee need to spell out a clear set of rules. The manual needs to make it mandatory for Congressmen and women demitting office to vacate their official premises within one month.                 
	New rule        
	Cabinet ministers must be allocated houses that have been earmarked for that particular ministry, and comprise a small, officially-appointed staff that includes a designer, an engineer and a horticulture expert. This will make it easy for ministers to vacate their premises within 48 hours, and will also allow new incumbents to enter their official residences with the dignity that comes with the office that they represent.         
	Ministers travelling overseas should travel business class. For a journey under three hours, they should travel economy. Anyone who wants to travel first class should personally pay the extra component of the fare. Free upgrading for ministers, bureaucrats and suchlike must be prohibited. All official entertainment should be done at Hyderabad House or the Ashoka Hotel. If the massive hotel is not up to the mark, the government should ensure that it is. The government should compel the inept India Tourism Development Corporation to clean up its act and compete with the Taj, the Maurya and the Oberoi.        
	Pranab Mukherjee should expose and reprimand all those ministers living where they should not be at the cost of the exchequer  in Lutyens Delhi where the square foot price is higher than 5th Avenue and Belgravia. If the Congress party wanted its ministers to stay outside five-star hotels, it should have made this clear on the day of swearing in regardless of who was paying the bill. There should be a rule and mandate in this regard.        
	There are dignified ways of doing what Mukherjee did. Seeing senior ministers indulge in main main tu tu is unwarranted.The finance minister made a huge show about travelling economy himself, and the media kept repeating this inconsequential fact. Will he travel in a similar manner for the entire term of this government? Everyone understands such tokenisms, and it is time to kill the hypocrisy. Lets spell out the rules in a manual, and then enforce the mandate and lead by example. Who will bell the greedy cats?

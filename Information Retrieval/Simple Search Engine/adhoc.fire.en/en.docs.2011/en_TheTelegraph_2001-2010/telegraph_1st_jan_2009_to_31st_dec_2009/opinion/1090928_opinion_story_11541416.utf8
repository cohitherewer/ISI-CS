	Promising the moon                  
	Sir  Indias maiden mission to the moon has turned out well with the discovery of the evidence of water on its surface (Piggyback payload finds moon water, Sept 25). This unexpected and path-breaking discovery has not only overturned the forty-year-old view of the moon as a magnificent desolation but has also given India the pride of place within the international scientific community. The signature of water molecules was found by the National Aeronautics and Space Administrations Moon Mineralogy Mapper aboard the Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft. The findings will throw light on many scientific questions and dispel a lot of speculation.          
	The media had criticized the Indian Space Research Organizations effort when the mission was aborted in August owing to technical problems. The media thus sent out a message to the people that huge outlays on space research are unnecessary. But the Isro team has vindicated its faith in the project.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Chandrayaan-1s achievement in discovering the presence of water on the moon is a major contribution to astronomy by Indian scientists.          
	Water has attracted the human mind from time immemorial. It has been imagined as the elixir of life. A passage in the Rig Veda says: Let the water purify the earth; let the water purify me from the sinful acts [I have committed]. With global warming threatening to diminish water-levels in the not-very- distant future, this discovery comes as a hope, prompting scientists to start working on methods to harvest lunar water.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The discovery of water on the moon holds much promise for mankind. Who knows, there could be unknown, exotic minerals, and even life, over there. The Isro, especially under its present leadership, has made Indians proud by its pioneering achievement in an area where only a few nations have been able to make a mark. Other research organizations in the country should learn from the Isro team how to remain steadfast and not be daunted by failures.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Heal not hate          
	Sir  Yet another unfortunate incident of a mob attacking a doctor following the death of a person has been in the papers recently (Mob fury on doctor for maid death Sept 22). The doctor reportedly found his maids blood-splattered body in the bathroom, upon which he informed her brother. Although this does not appear to be a case of medical negligence, the mob assaulted the doctor anyway and brought the charge of rape and murder against him. Reports of friends and relatives of patients attacking doctors and ransacking a hospital following the death of their loved one from alleged negligence have become a regular feature these days. This practice of dispatching mob justice cannot be condoned even in a case of actual medical negligence. While there can be no doubt that the number of deaths on account of medical malpractice has increased in the recent years, doctor-bashing is not going to change the situation. The government, as well as the medical community, must comprehend the underlying reason as to why generally law-abiding and peace-loving citizens bear such hostility toward their healers and take to violence in cases of injury or loss of life owing to perceived medical negligence.           
	While medical education in India follows norms similar to those in countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States of America, a mob attacking a doctor is an inconceivable act in these countries. Medical negligence occurs in the US too, albeit far less than in India. But the reason why enraged acquaintances of a patient do not attack the treating physician or vandalize the hospital in such cases is that people in the developed countries are aware that they can get justice at the appropriate forum. Wayward doctors in the US are routinely punished by the court of law as well as the medical board.          
	The picture is almost the opposite in India. In spite of frequent incidents of medical negligence, hardly any doctor is found guilty by their colleagues on the medical council. Getting justice in the court against doctors is also a seemingly impossible task for ordinary citizens. The conviction of a doctor is extremely difficult without the supporting evidence of fellow medical men. Unfortunately, doctors in India are reluctant to testify in court against one of their own. Moreover, the Indian judicial system has its own inherent flaws. The chief justice of Delhi High Court recently said that it would take the court another 466 years to clear the backlog in cases.           
	Under pressure from the Indian Medical Association, the West Bengal government recently passed a law under which somebody accused of attacking a doctor or vandalizing a hospital can be punished with imprisonment up to three years. Although doctor-bashing must be strictly condemned, this new law is not the right approach to the problem. Most of such attacks are the result of extreme frustration leading to a momentary loss of control. This does not qualify as crime. Public outrage against doctors cannot be stopped by making laws. A radical change in the medical system is necessary to ensure accountability. Only an impartial medical justice system can restore the patients trust and stop doctor-bashing in India.          
	Yours faithfully,

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Experiments with a difference
                                                                                                                 EXPERIMENTS WITH A DIFFERENCE                              THEATRE
      ANANDA LAL                                                
	From Malayali to Mauritian forms, experiments continue on Tagores oeuvre, flying in the face of objections from the likes of Girish Karnad, who has set Tagore up as his bte noire, considering him neither a great nor a modernist playwright. Two Bengali graduates from Kerala Kalamandalam have started a new Calcutta company, Natyalok, which intends to impart training in classical Indian theatre here. It debuted with Samanya Kshati, dramatized from Tagores poem by Biswajit Das.        
	Das extends Tagores narrative of the callous Rani, (picture) who had her subjects huts burnt down on a whim, by showing her plight after the king banished her as punishment. Besides her (in traditional female impersonation by Kalamandalam Goutam), her train and the villagers, Das depicts four other individuated characters and a velichapad (oracle), but the most striking aspect is the integration in the visualization of four Kerala art forms  Kathakali, Kutiyattam, Teyyam and Kalarippayattu  by the co-directors, Kalamandalam Piyal and Goutam, and by Das himself. While they implement Kathakali and Kutiyattam in the acting, they use Kalari for scenes of conflict, including sword fights (ankatari), and they present two absolutely stunning Teyyams of the goddess Bhagavati, or Shakti, in full regalia with huge and gorgeous headgear. We must applaud Piyals makeup design and score of authentic music from Kerala.        
	The Mauritian Raja aur Rani proved yet again the poor quality, yet wide circulation, of Tagores authorized English versions published by Macmillan, and the general ignorance about later, better, more complete translations. Tagore himself condensed his five-act, blank-verse original into a lifeless two-act paraphrase titled The King and the Queen, which has neither the poetic flourish of Raja o Rani nor the power of his final take on this drama, Tapati. Not knowing the difference, nor the existence of full translations of both plays, Triveni Kala Mandir from Mauritius rendered The King and the Queen into Hindi, a terrible decision. No wonder the predominantly Bengali audience at the Rabindranath Tagore Centre gaped in disbelief. They might have appreciated the production a little more had they, in turn, been informed that the director, Balraj Rampaul, applied the very popular Mauritian form called Natak to the story.         
	Indian labourers from the Hindi heartland who settled on the island from 19th century onwards took with them memories of Ramlila and Nautanki, eventually naturalizing them there. The loud declamations and posturing on stage therefore had a separate pedigree from what our homegrown, hoity-toity Tagoreans expected. Still, it was a bad mismatch between folk style and Readers Digest text. Amid the colourful royal costumes, however, a constable in London bobby helmet, Punjabi kurta and Kolhapuri sandals looked quite an anachronistic treat.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | After the Verdict
                                                                                                                 AFTER THE VERDICT                                  Sumanta Sen                              
	The chief minister of Assam, Tarun Gogoi, recently drew a lot of flak for admitting that he had taken money from businessmen to meet election expenses. As an administrator, Gogoi certainly has a lot to answer for and as a politician also he is not a dream-come-true. But in this case, he deserves praise. He was honest in his admission. Like in the rest of the country, parties in Assam and in most parts of the Northeast depend heavily on donations. Gogoi deserves to be complimented for not seeking to cover up this fact. His principal opponents in Assam, the Asom Gana Parishad and the Bharatiya Janata Party, would have only been ridiculed if they had seriously taken up this issue against Gogoi.         
	Actually, so far as the charges go, the AGP and BJP are on a sticky wicket. The former chief minister and AGP leader, Prafulla Kumar Mahanta, had come under a heavy cloud during his tenure that had caused him to lie low for a period. As for the BJP, its senior leader, Arun Jaitley, had fallen out with the party president over the latters choice of the poll manager for the state. Thus, there are skeletons in every cupboard, and so the Opposition has not been able to make much headway over the donation issue. The parochial, and there are many among the Assamese, may of course still grumble that the chief minister had not met the moneybags on the banks of the Brahmaputra but in Calcutta, which has always been soft towards foreigners in their state.         
	As far as reports from Guwahati go, the money that Gogoi had collected came from the tea industry. Nothing new in that also. The tea plantation labourers have always been controlled by the Congress-dominated Indian National Trade Union Congress, and it will be nothing but hypocrisy for the party to claim that it has never enjoyed a cushy relationship with the employers. At times, of course, the tea industry in Assam has also been forced to buy peace from the United Liberation Force of Asom. Tea being the chief industry in the state, it is perhaps only natural that both politicians and extremists should turn to the same cup to quench their thirst and be cheered.                
	Real issues        
	So donation was a non-issue. What could have become a major issue was the governments apparent lack of concern at the frequent assaults on migrant workers, particularly those from Bihar. But nobody said anything on this. Understandably so. As the ruling party, the Congress likes to keep quiet, the AGP has always eyed all outsiders with suspicion, and the BJP, an ardent supporter of any anti-foreigner agitation, sees no reason why it should queer its pitch by drawing a distinction between outsiders and foreigners.        
	No political activity in Assam can take place without reference to the foreigner issue, or to alleged illegal immigration from Bangladesh. The AGP-BJP combine once again raised the issue and the Congress, as usual, was found wavering. This may cost it dearly if the minorities respond in a big way to the United Democratic Front. The UDF eating into the traditional Congress vote-bank may well mean gains for the AGP-BJP alliance, which, of course, is not what the UDF will like. However, on the whole, it does appear that the issue of foreigners mucking up the demographic pattern has taken a backseat in the popular psyche now.         
	The burning problem is the frequent terrorist attacks in Assam. The Congress, obviously, has no answer to this, and the AGP, despite all its protestations, cannot run away from the fact that the Ulfa was essentially born out of it and the separatist hysteria that had been created in the Eighties. So, when the ballots are counted, winners and losers will be known but the real issue of terror will remain untouched  as all real issues are, at least in India.

	 Knives are once again out in the BJP parivar after Arun Shourie suggested Narendra Modi as the possible successor to LK Advani. Though the idea was sounded out at a rally in Ahmedabad (perhaps just to appease the Gujarati audience), and Modi was projected as the party leader for the 2014 general elections (which is still some way off), quite a few people took great umbrage. Sushma Swaraj tersely commented that the Hindu religion does not approve of any small talk about possible successors while the father is still around. As the word reached the pro-Modi lobby, a former RSS pracharak, now a BJP functionary, hit back saying, Sushmaji should also remember that according to the same Hindu religion, a father is succeeded by his eldest son, not by the daughter. While many were pleased by the impeccable logic behind this argument, there were angry speculations about who the eldest son could be. Rajnath Singh, for instance, lost his cool and walked out on a television interview when the anchor asked him to respond to Shouries views on Modi.                
	 While his ideological offspring may be giving him a tough time, LK Advanis own daughter, Pratibha, turned out to be his pillar of strength. The feisty lady not only campaigned in her fathers constituency but also toured with him extensively. Her motto was simple: I am for my Dad. With my Dad. Always. But simplicity does not always win the day. Even though Pratibha provided a great deal of support to her father, the real show-stealer was the child of quite another dispensation. Priyanka Gandhis visit to Amethi and Rae Bareli had the media in a swirl. From her wardrobe to the shape of her nose, every bit of her presence created a stir  even though the BJP claimed that Pratibha, with her astute political sense, has been the bigger asset for her father and his party.                            
	 With all the in-fighting in the family, LK Advani had been looking quite worn out for some time. He continued to look exhausted until the second phase of the polling, but over the past one week he seems to have regained his former enthusiasm once more. The old war-horse, it is being said, is now confident of pulling off the trick with a little help from a few third-front parties. He is even believed to have offered the deputy prime ministers post to a regional ally if Lady Luck smiles on him. Is this an indication that the gap between the Congress and the BJP is finally closing in?                            
	 Speaking of allies, now that the polls are half-way through, the BJP has suddenly woken up to reassemble its NDA allies. The party knows that it is still on slippery terrain, so it does not want even the slightest opportunity to slip away from its grasp. Recently, the Bihar CM, Nitish Kumar, wanted to campaign in the flood-affected constituencies but could not manage to get hold of a helicopter. When the word reached LK Advanis ears, he immediately arranged for his personal chopper to be sent over to Kumar. This seemed like a fair deal, since Kumar has been reportedly making friendly noises towards the NDA, though his party, the JDU, is yet to pledge support with any certainty. In the meantime, whispered conferences are supposed to be on between Vasundhara Raje Scindia and Naveen Patnaik, while Venkaiah Naidu has been asked to make overtures to the TRS and the TDP. Narendra Modi has been given the toughest job of all. To win over ammas heart.                            
	 As things get hot on the saffron front, the reds are also busy separating their friends from the foes. Quite uncharacteristically, the CPI(M) is a divided house over this matter. While the West Bengal unit of the party, along with Sitaram Yechury, is open to the idea of supporting the Congress, if need be, to keep the BJP out, Prakash Karat is adamant not to sup with the Congress ever again.       
	Oddly, it is not only issues as serious as these that are deepening the rift within the party. Karat and Yechury, as the grapevine tells us, have also fallen out over who is the more rightful prime ministerial candidate. While Karat maintains that only elected members of the Lok Sabha should be considered for the post, Yechury is happy to go by the Constitution, which puts no embargo on Rajya Sabha members from becoming prime minister. Now why would two sensible leaders choose to waste their time on a matter over which they have very little control?                
	 There is a strange feeling of dj vu in Tamil Nadu this election season. The DMK and the AIADMK seem to be mirroring each others campaign strategies that they followed in the 2004 Lok Sabha polls. In the last general elections, M. Karunanidhi, the DMK patriarch, had campaigned in all his constituencies, flying from one place to the other in a chopper. But this time, he is travelling by road and his campaign is limited to only a few of the constituencies. On the other hand, his rival, J. Jayalalithaa, has chosen a helicopter this year (unlike the car she used last time)  so she was able to cover all her ground this time. But whats better, unlike his fiery speech against Amma in the last elections, Karunanidhi only spoke of Tamil sufferings this time. Of course, this gave Jayalalithaa the perfect opportunity to open the floodgates of her virulence against Karunanidhi and his clan. So she gladly turned the corruption in the DMK her main electoral issue.

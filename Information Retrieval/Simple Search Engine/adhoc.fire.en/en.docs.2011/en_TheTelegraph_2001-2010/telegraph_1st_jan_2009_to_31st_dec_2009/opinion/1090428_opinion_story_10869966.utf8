                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Darkness visible                  
	Sir  The massive power breakdown on April 19 resulted in untold suffering for all on one of the hottest afternoons of the month (Superfast fault foxes officials, April 21). To add to our woes, the complaint cell number of the Calcutta Electric Supply Corporation (hotline 1912) was disabled. Till late at night, all our efforts to contact the CESC was answered with, The number you are trying to call is currently busy, please dial 1256 and leave your voice message. Leaving a voice message, as advised, proved to be impossible as well. The consumer was left hopelessly pondering the probable reasons behind the continuing blackout till after 8.15 pm, when power was restored and one of the news channels reported the failure of the CESC power plants.           
	One gets treated in the same way by the CESC every time there is a cable fault or a major disruption. The CESC is exploiting its monopoly in the market to deny consumers not only basic service but also their right to information. Is it not possible for the CESC to leave a recorded message on its helpline citing the reasons for disruption along with the estimated hour of resumption of service?                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Alokesh Ganguly, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  The CESC seems to be following a discriminatory policy with regard to power cuts in certain areas of north Calcutta. Some houses on Dum Dum Road, Northern Avenue, Raja Bagan Lane and South Sinthee Road go without power for several hours a week while other houses in the same localities are spared the ordeal. Is there some politics behind this bias? We are outraged that only some of us are being made to bear the brunt of powercuts, which sometimes occur thrice a day and last for more than an hour on an average. On top of it, we are frequently plunged in darkness when a phase goes off. It is difficult to contact the CESC on its toll-free number during the crises since the line remains either engaged or unresponsive.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Shyamal Roy, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Come summer and power cuts become a common feature of life in West Bengal. The reasons cited every year for the failure remain more or less the same  either shortage of coal or breakdown of one of the power-generation units in Santaldih, Bandel, Kolaghat, Bakreshwar or Sagardighi.           
	The West Bengal government once boasted of surplus power and even contemplated selling it to neighbouring states. Perhaps those were the days when quite a number of industries were closing down and so there was a decrease in the demand for power. In its 32 years of distinguished rule, the state government has never thought of either improving the existing infrastructure of the hydro-electric power project or tapping unconventional and renewable sources of energy like sun, wind and the like. Except the Damodar Valley Corporation multipurpose project, which makes use of one of the cheapest sources of power  water  how many units using alternative energy resources have been set up in the state? Why is the government so reliant on thermal power when the stocks of coal are fast dwindling? The state has plenty of potential as far as wind and solar energy is concerned. In the past few years, the media have reported the launch of many such projects by political leaders, who subsequently seem to have forgotten the ventures for reasons best known to them.           
	However, it is better to be late than never. To keep another blackout at bay, the government should firstly improve the infrastructure of all the power-generation units instead of investing crores on new power plants. Secondly, it should stop pilferage of power by coming down heavily on illegal users. It should also allocate a sizeable portion of its budget for projects using unconventional sources in coastal areas where there is no dearth of wind and solar energy. The government should persuade big industrial houses to adopt at least one village or town where such projects can be housed. The load on conventional energy sources can be thus reduced and the problem of power shortage brought under control.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Prabhakar Bhattacharya, Ichapore, North 24 Parganas 

                
	Sir  The CESC does not have an enviable track record so far as power supply and customer service are concerned. While the technical explanation for the collapse on April 19 may make for interesting reading (it would almost read like a thriller for some, perhaps), the fact remains that all this talk is just that  an explanation, similar to others such as coal shortage, coal dampened by rains, people using more power and so on that the CESC is so adept at giving.           
	The corporation has set up a committee to suggest remedial measures. Are committees ever able to fix responsibility when such snags occur? What is the use of flaunting the isolation system when blackouts similar to the one on April 19 keep recurring? That uninterrupted power supply is something beyond the CESCs capability has been proved by the persistent power cuts on April 20 and 21.           
	The chart in The Telegraph of April 21 makes it clear that an extensive power failure might happen again. The CESCs big notice, We apologize, published in the papers later, thanking people for their patience and forbearance is laughable because people really had no choice but to sweat and suffer. Such apologies would not make much of an impact on Calcuttans if the CESC continues to give lame excuses for its failure to supply uninterrupted power.           
	Yours faithfully,         Amit Banerjee, Calcutta

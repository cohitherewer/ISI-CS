The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Offerings from the margins
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        OFFERINGS FROM THE MARGINS                                  Theatre - Ananda Lal                                                  
	Far-eastern India (Northeast being a geographical misnomer) occupied pride of place at Nandikars National Theatre Festival, to the extent that even Dhaka Theatres Dhaboman had a story that began in the Garo Hills before cascading with the Someswari River down to the plains of Bangladesh. The late Selim Al Deens charming drama presented the unity of pastoral man and nature, in which a farmer loves and educates his buffalo as a son, and the buffalo in turn considers himself human. Unfortunately, human superstition leads to the young bulls tragic end. Dhaboman also expressed the need of empathy for sentient livestock cruelly slaughtered for meat. Shimul Yousuf directed and choreographed the large ensemble of over 20 with vigorous folk songs and dances, while Esha Yousuf caught our eye with a stirring portrayal of the bull, evoking bovine strength, tenderness through gentle movements of the head, and grace of motion by terpsichorean steps.        
	Manipur contributed with two contrasting productions from the new generation of directors in Imphal. L. Kishworjit adapted David Hwangs Sound of a Voice into Acheekpagi Khonjel (picture) for Paradise Theatre. The Chinese-American dramatist, Hwang, wrote this in 1983, before he became a big name, setting it in samurai Japan. A warrior from the city comes to a village womans hut, probably sent to kill her on suspicion of being a witch. Both of them, alone and lonely, find something in each other and grow close, but things do not turn out happily. Kishworjit interpreted the problem as wifely subservience to the husband in a traditional society. Although this deviated from Hwangs poetic ambiguity, the lyrical Manipuri style perfectly matched Hwangs adoption of the symbolism and slow measure of Noh theatre, so the cultural transition did not jar. Brajabidhu Singhs martial artistry and Teleshori Devis all-encompassing skills showed how exceptional training can hold our attention effortlessly. Sad that Calcutta chased celebrities instead.        
	The same multiple abilities applied to the comedians of Panthoibi Natya Mandir, specialists in Phagi clown theatre, who performed the folk farce, Mompak, recast and directed by Rajendra Singh. Their total-theatre technique was remarkable, even extending to actors posing as a kitchen garden. Particularly noteworthy, Ratan Kumar (the father) had us in splits with his mumbo-jumbo, while Anju Devi (his daughter) merrily entertained three suitors when he left her with strict orders to behave herself. Several rustic slapstick episodes featuring other characters occurred in between, including archetypical pie-in-the-face fighting that predates Chaplin  in this case, involving two boys carrying food offerings for the father, and resulting in his complete loss of the eatables. Rajendra could edit some of the digressive improvisatory scenes to make Mompak tighter.        
	Assam stepped in with Miri Ziyori by Baa (The Creative Breeze) from Guwahati. Anup Hazarika dramatized this from the first Assamese novel, written by Rajanikanta Bordoloi, on the tragic romance of lovers opposed by elders in a village on the Subansiri River, captured by Miri tribals from the hills, and killed by them. He told the tale simply, no doubt more so than the greater space a novel allows, but more importantly, he directed the 20-strong group of youths with tremendous brio, colour and vitality, a lot like Dhaboman. Pakija Begum choreographed them in highly energetic and flawlessly fluid dances of the Mising community, reflecting their innocence and joy. Jiten Chutia and Arati Bordoloi played the lead pair with unflagging zest and powerful singing.        
	Compared to these beautiful examples of aesthetic design from the margins, the tacky set brought by our capitals National School of Drama Repertory Company, boasting the biggest theatre budget in the country, was a real downer. Vijay Tendulkars Jat hi Puchho Sadhu ki, commemorating him after his death, is a revival by Rajinder Nath of Vasant Devs Hindi translation for his own group 30 years ago, which he revived once in 1997. This time, he integrated the two halves, on casteism in professional and personal life, with greater cohesion than most directors of the play have done, making it come together as a rollicking satire like the author wanted. It proved that caste still rules in backward India, despite the education earned by the hero who, as the only applicant, lands a job in a remote college, subdues the unruly students and romances the chairmans niece, only to find that caste gets in the way. On stage from start to finish, Ambrish Saxena acted him with huge stamina, good humour and occasional erudition, while the others hammed things up like caricatures should. Rajinder Nath ensured never a dull moment.

	This secret Garden: Oxford revisited By Justin Cartwright, 
  Bloomsbury, Rs 750  
	Oxford is an enchanted place that exists in the imagination of its alumni. Geza Vermes, perhaps the greatest living scholar of the Bible, declared to Justin Cartwright that he thought he had entered heaven when he arrived in Oxford from Hungary. Students leave Oxford, but Oxford never leaves them. The place lingers in their memory, and for those who stay on it envelops their existence.  
	Cartwright came up to Trinity College from South Africa in the Sixties. From his own account, it is clear that he did not do too much academic work there. He came up to study Politics, Philosophy and Economics (PPE or the Modern Greats in Oxford jargon), and switched to doing a B.Litt. His thesis on Oliver Cromwell was referred, even though it was supervised by John Plamenatz, one of the legendary dons of Oxford who came from Montenegro. But he had fun at Oxford, played polo there, and was obviously on the fringes of the Oxford hearties. Oxford lies deep in his heart and he went back there to recapture the magic and even perhaps his youth.        
	This is an evocative book and quite obviously a nostalgic one. Cartwright went back and stayed in his old college, attended the Freshers Dinner, where he heard the President (as the head of Trinity is known; other Oxford colleges variously call their heads Master, Warden, Principal and so on), Max Beloff, speak to the new boys who had come up that year (one always goes up to Oxford and then goes down after taking a degree; sent down has ignominious associations like expulsion) and spoke to other eminent Oxford personalities. The book is woven around these conversations, Cartwrights memories and reflections.        
	At the heart of the Oxford system of education is the tutorial system by which an assigned tutor meets one or two students to hear the essay that had been set for them. Tutorials normally take place once or twice a week, and the student stays with a tutor for the duration of a term. (Oxfords terms are eight weeks long and are called Michaelmas, Hillary and Trinity; with the first beginning in October, the second in January and the third in April.) The efficacy of this system has been the subject of endless controversy that Cartwright surveys. What is clear is that without the weekly tutorial, the teaching of undergraduates in Oxford would lose much of its distinctiveness.        
	One of the most courageous things that Cartwright does during his return to Oxford is to seek out an English don in Trinity and offer to write a tutorial essay. The don assigns him five pieces to read and then write upon. His essay, Cartwright is told, should be based on close reading, which Cartwright construes as the Oxford version of deconstruction with all the highly theoretical French elements removed. When he does present his essay, his tutor points out how many critical aspects of the pieces had been missed; he is told that he must receive more attentively. This leaves Cartwright, with many years of book reviewing behind him, somewhat shaken.        
	Cartwright unforgettably evokes the churches, the gardens, the streets and lanes of Oxford. There is a superb section on the Bodleian and its treasures. He ventures outside Oxford to Binsey, to Boars Hill and Bagley Wood the countryside made memorable by Matthew Arnolds Scholar Gypsy and by Gerard Manley Hopkinss lament on the poplars of Binsey.        
	Homer nods. Cartwright is wrong to identify Eric Hobsbawm as an Oxford historian. Hobsbawm was the star of his generation in the other place called Cambridge. He never got a job in any Oxford college. Oxford will no doubt forgive Cartwright for this crass error.

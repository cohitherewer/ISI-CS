                                                                                                                 HOLDING STEADY                                                    
	Though few central bank watchers were expecting it, the Reserve Bank of India went ahead and cut its policy rates by a quarter of a percentage point anyway. The latest cuts announced in the 2009-10 annual monetary policy are more about managing expectations than a further easing of monetary conditions: bringing the cuts in policy rates  the repo and reverse repo rates, which the RBI uses to inject and remove money from the banking system as part of its liquidity management  to a graduated rather than an abrupt end. It is important to see the current data as the RBI sees it. The annual policy statement identifies several key challenges that the RBI must face in the short to medium term future: managing the governments very large borrowing programme, and reversing the enormous amounts of liquidity that were injected into the financial system in an effort to lower interest rates and restart the economys growth engine. While the statement of the RBI governor, Duvvuri Subbarao, may seem sanguine about inflation now  the RBI anticipates that as measured by the wholesale price index, inflation will be about 4 per cent at end-March 2010  be sure that the central bank has its eye very much on that ball.        
	Current projections about the governments borrowing programme put it at about Rs 3,00,000 crore; the government had forecast an increase in direct tax revenues of about 10 per cent in 2009-10. But the continuing stress on corporate earnings, balance sheets and personal income taxes could lower that estimate considerably. Indirect taxes will be similarly affected: lower gross domestic product growth (at 6 per cent in 2009-10) implies lower excise duties, and a weak exchange rate means lower imports and lower customs duty collections. Overall, tax revenues will be much lower than originally estimated. With the installation of a new government in June, the size of the stimulus package will also be bigger as poll promises translate into State largesse. Some estimates expect the size of the governments borrowing programme to be Rs 4,00,000 crore.         
	The threat of inflation may have clearly abated for now; for that Mr Subbaraos predecessor, Yaga Venugopal Reddy, will have to be thanked. His aggressive increases in policy rates in 2007 and in early 2008 may have done a lot to slow the economy without derailing it, and yet kept it robust enough to sustain positive economic growth when it is contracting almost everywhere else. The RBI must be complimented for having maintained a consistent policy stance. It has avoided uncertainty, the bane of policy.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        OUT OF PLACE                                                    
	Gravitas need not be as dull as it sounds like. Properly done, it can be turned into quite a style, when sprinkled with the right kind of irreverence. Shashi Tharoors career on Twitter had been providing a nice sort of counterpoint to his necessarily more straitlaced profile as minister of state. His holy cows tweet after the Congresss  and his own governments  austerity drive did incur the wrath of the political establishment. However, that said more about the Indian States humourlessness than about Mr Tharoors sense of propriety, and was rightly dismissed by the prime minister as nok jhok or banter. But Mr Tharoor has been tweeting again about matters of State  visa regulations, a liberal State  and this time, it would be specious to invoke the need for humour to make light of what has been regarded as improper behaviour by his senior colleagues in the government. (In a subsequent tweet, Mr Tharoor refers to the reactions as brouhaha.)        
	There is something odd about a junior ministers publicly aired political opinions being contrary to the position taken by his ministry, and this contrariness being expressed in a social networking and micro-blogging site on the internet. There can be internal disagreement and dialogue when an issue is being thrashed out within a ministry. But once the government has declared its position on the matter, it is irregular  in a manner that is not quite entertaining  for a minister of state to be cavalier about how he aligns himself to that position. In his Twitter profile, Mr Tharoor describes himself as author, humanitarian, peacekeeper, columnist, former UN Under-Secretary General, now Minister of State for External Affairs, Govt of India, in ascending order of gravitas. Given such a line-up of positions held, one would expect better sense from Mr Tharoor in matters of how, and where, to counterpoint ministerial decorum with provocative charm.

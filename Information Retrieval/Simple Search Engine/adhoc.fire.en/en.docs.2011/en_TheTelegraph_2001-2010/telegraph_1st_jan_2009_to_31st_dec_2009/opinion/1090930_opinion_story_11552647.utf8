The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | An essay in persuasion
                                                                                                                 AN ESSAY IN PERSUASION                          - What India achieved in Pittsburgh        Diplomacy - K.P. Nayar                                                  
	Around the same time that the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, was addressing a triumphant press conference in Pittsburgh at the end of the Group of Twenty summit, the CNN talk-show host, Larry King, was interviewing the Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, in New York. Ahmadinejad told King in so many words, but on a different subject, that what Mr Obama says does matter although Irans head of state did not care what the French president Nicolas Sarkozy or British prime minister Gordon Brown says about Irans nuclear programme.        
	Singhs tone and body-language in Pittsburgh and Ahmadinejads defiance of what the former American defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, called old Europe brought back memories of the French resort town of vian-les-Bains on the banks of Lac Lman on a June morning six years ago. It was there, in the historic Hotel Royal, that Atal Bihari Vajpayee, then the prime minister, first took a seat, albeit tentatively, at a meeting of eight industrialized countries, collectively known as the Group of Eight.        
	The idea of inviting India to the fringes of this G-8 summit was that of the then French president, Jacques Chirac, who went out of his way to make Vajpayee feel at home at that meeting where India, which was still under a range of sanctions for its nuclear tests, was an odd man out in many ways. The invitation that was extended then to Vajpayee was not a collective G-8 decision: it was a gesture by Chirac, to which Frances G-8 partners did not object. In addition to Vajpayee, Chirac invited Chinas president Hu Jintao, Mexican president Vicente Fox, South Africas Thabo Mbeki, Malaysias Mahathir Mohamad, Brazils Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and leaders of seven other emerging economies. Explaining his decision to have an enlarged dialogue meeting as part of the Evian summit, Chirac told his cabinet, members of Frances legislature and ambassadors of states invited to Evian at Elyse Palace 10 days before the summit that the G8 is not the worlds board of directors. Chirac pointed out that globalization calls for dialogue. That is why I wanted toinvite the leaders of emerging countries and poor countries to Evian on June 1 so that we can discuss the major issues of todays world together.              
	Listening to the speeches in Pittsburgh, Chiracs words six years ago seem prophetic: If we want globalization to benefit everyone and everyone to approach it responsibly, it is critical for everyone to have a seat at the table and take part in the discussions needed to control globalization and make it more human.        
	Soon afterwards, Britains then prime minister, Tony Blair, joined Chirac in calling for an expansion of G-8 to include India and China, among others. Last week, such calls progressed to their logical conclusion and reached a historic agreement to put the G-20 at the centre of efforts to work together to build a durable recovery and reform the international financial system, as the White House described the outcome of the Pittsburgh summit.        
	Like Ahmadinejad, who told CNN that he did not care what Sarkozy or Brown said, Chiracs and Blairs calls for expanding the G-8 to include the emerging economies made a big splash in the Indian media and on news outlets of the countries invited to Evian. But few others took note. It was different, though, the moment the White House announced late at night on Thursday last week that in Pittsburgh, leaders endorsed the G-20 as the premier forum for their international economic cooperation. The news immediately made headlines around the world.        
	Ahmadinejad and Manmohan Singh both realize that notwithstanding any window-dressing that may go into the world economy and global strategy, the United States of America still remains the worlds only super-power and the earths leading economic power. The collective gross domestic product of the dozen countries that will now take their seats at the worlds high table continues to be less than that of a single country: the US. While nobody remembers today that it was Chirac, followed by Blair, who initiated the historic changes that bore fruit in Pittsburgh, most people across the world will attribute the latest changes to the architecture of the global economy to the White House.        
	However, it is debatable whether the changes that were adopted in Pittsburgh would have been acceptable to the rich countries at all, if it were not for the current global economic crisis. Singh said in Pittsburgh that no country, howsoever powerful it may be, can take on the entire burden of economic adjustment and economic decision-making that may be required to manage the global system in an orderly fashion. It is that perception and that reality which has, I think, persuaded many people in Europe and the US that this G-8 is ill-equipped to handle all the global issues. With the rise of Asia, with the growth of India, China and Brazil, economic decision-making has to take into account the views of these countries if it is to have an optimum impact.        
	Yet, the fact is that India, China and Brazil together have a GDP that is well below half of Europes. In such a scenario, nothing much is likely to change overnight in the management of the world economy, even though the Pittsburgh summit has, in principle, anointed the G-20 as the successor to the G-8.         
	Besides, some of the industrialized countries may drag their feet on burying the G-8 for fear of losing the power that comes from membership of an exclusive club of nations. Japans traditional position since Chirac mooted the idea of a bigger G-8, for instance, has been one of opposition to any such proposal. It may change with a new, forward-looking government, which has come into office recently in Tokyo.              
	A lot will depend on perceptions. The White House claims that actions by the G-20, initiated after its London summit in April, pulled the world economy back from the brink of depression. It is true that an earlier meeting of the group in Washington achieved very little, but then the Obama administration may want that to be seen as such, that summit having been held in the dying days of the Bush presidency.        
	The new entrants into the process of making decisions about the global economy, such as India and Brazil, may decide to flaunt any trappings of newly-acquired power for their nations with claims that G-20 prescriptions for the worlds economic ills are working. Such propaganda may work in favour of the new G-20. The prime minister had no hesitation in creating an impression in Pittsburgh that India had taken clear positions in favour of poor countries, asserted Indias right to follow independent policies and that such a line was producing results. Singh also projected a positive picture of the Indian economy a year into the global meltdown. There is no economic crisis in India, he said. It is certainly true that as a sequel to the global economic crisis our exports have suffered. That has affected the rate of growth. Even then our economy is growing at the rate of six to six and a half per cent. Therefore, there is no crisis as such in India. With a colourful description of the G-20 as an essay in persuasion, the prime minister was also cautious: Whether this essay in persuasion really succeeds in achieving its objectives, only time can tell.        
	The biggest achievement of the G-20 process, as yet, has been the creation of a body that will actually determine the groups financial policies: the Financial Stability Board, which has been expanded. The Reserve Bank of India, the finance ministry and the Securities and Exchange Board of India have all taken their places in the FSB as a result of such expansion.
    Enough said, and, I both fear and hope, read. I rsquo;m beginning to see why learning English from the cradle really is different from (or to or than) studying it, as most of the world has to, at school mdash; and why the Esperantists see hope yet.

                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	A different matter                  
	Sir  In the article, Unresolved questions of life and death (Aug 20), Chirosree Basu talks about Nivedita Menons book, Recovering Subversion, where Menon is said to have pointed out that the sanction for aborting abnormal fetuses implicitly means we are accepting a hierarchy of human beings based on certain physical traits and capabilities. The issue of abnormal fetuses is extremely complex, and involves concerns that go beyond those of gender. I think it should be dealt with as a separate subject at the political and socio-legal level instead of being clubbed together with issues of gender.          
	While I have the highest regard for the social activist, Ryan Rapp, whom Basu quotes, may I suggest that we forget political correctness for a moment, and face certain harsh truths related to children born from abnormal fetuses? In India, do we have the infrastructure required to provide them with a life of relative comfort, in terms of both their practical and emotional needs, after the death of their guardians? More importantly, does Indian society have the sensitivity and knowledge necessary for accommodating abnormal humans within the folds of its normal life? Ask the parents of mentally and physically disabled children about the number of deaths they die each day just thinking about the irrevocable situation they find themselves in.          
	I do not know whether activists like Rapp and others, who speak of mothers who abort their abnormal fetuses as becoming an agent of quality control on the reproductive production line, have had the experience of parenting special or disabled children. As the mother of a daughter with Downs Syndrome, I suggest that instead of disparaging these women, these activists give a thought to counselling normal human beings on the ways of welcoming special children into their society. Let private companies accept the mental disabilities of these children as normal and actually start hiring them; let men and women start marrying them without going through the selfless matrimony trip; let people stop staring at them in public places as if they belong to a different planet. Only then can we talk about not accepting a hierarchy of human beings based on certain physical traits and capabilities. Until then, it would be wisest to keep the number of abnormal fetuses to a minimum, and extend the period for abortion from 20 to 26 weeks, as suggested by Dr Nikhil Datar.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Borderlands          
	Sir  Cross-border terrorism is threatening the Bodo heartland, Kokrajhar (SP warns of Bodo clashes Aug 12). The increasing presence of suspected Bangladeshis here is changing the demographic face of Bodoland. If nothing is done about situation, then very soon the BTC  Bodoland Territorial Council  will come to mean Bangladesh Territorial Council. The recovery of explosives from villages such as Howriapet and Sapkata in the Gossaigaon subdivision and from Bangaldoba in Kokrajhar is a matter of grave concern. Certain students organizations are seen to be lending a helping hand to the infiltrators. Local politicians are supporting the anti-nationals financially and morally for their own political gain. It is time the authorities did something to prevent Assam from becoming an extension of Bangladesh.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Goutam Choudhury, Kokrajhar, Assam 

                
	Sir  The attitude of the leaders of the All-Bodo Students Union is jingoistic. Once, when I attended a meeting of the Absu, I was reprimanded by some members of the party for not being able to speak the Bodo language. Being brought up in the cosmopolitan atmosphere of Guwahati, I am not very comfortable with Bodo. But this does not mean I am not a Bodo. Since I can speak, read and write Assamese, one of the chief native languages of north-east India, I indisputably belong to this region and am proud of this fact. In reply to the Absus objections, I can cite the example of the American president, Barack Obama, who belongs to the Luo tribe of Kenya from his fathers side. The language of this tribe is Dholuo. But Obama obviously prefers English to Dholuo as his language of communication. Yet he carries the Luo blood in him, and Luos are proud of his achievement.           
	I would request the Absu to be more flexible in its attitude, as befits modern times. Today, Bodo youths are working in every district of Assam, in the neighbouring north-eastern states, all over India and the world. Members of the Bodo community who use Bodo as their second language should be allowed to attend the Absu meetings alongside those who use Bodo as their first language. Even those who do not know the language of their tribe, but are of Bodo lineage, should be invited to Absu meetings and permitted to hold important positions in the organization. The Absu should not remain caught in a time warp.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Helter-skelter          
	Sir  A serious hazard is posed by the vehicles parked along the pavement on the Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road and Royd Street crossing between 11 am and 12 noon, Monday to Friday, ostensibly for the purpose of picking up children from the Assembly of God Church School nearby. The encroaching vehicles endanger the lives of pedestrians and of the school children.          
	Recently, while I was traversing this stretch, I had to walk along the main road, and was nearly run over by an autorickshaw. As I stepped closer to the kerb, my foot was run over by a fully loaded auto. If I had not been wearing heavy boots, my toes would have been crushed.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
V.K. Tankha, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Ever since the government banned old vehicles, chaos has reigned in Calcutta. When I go to school at 9.20 am everyday, I find unending queues for autos, and buses packed to their full capacities. Taxis also tend to refuse passengers. If I manage to find an auto, it charges more than the regular fare. Will the government think of a solution to this crisis?           
	Yours faithfully,

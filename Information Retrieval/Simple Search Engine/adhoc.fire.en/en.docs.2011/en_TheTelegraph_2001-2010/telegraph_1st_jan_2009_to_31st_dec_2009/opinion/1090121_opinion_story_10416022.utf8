	Career change                  
	Sir  Sanjay Dutts entry into politics through his election nomination from Lucknow for the Samajwadi Party has not been a prudent step (Munna for MP, with Jaya circuit, Jan 18). He should instead concentrate on acting. Unlike Vinod Khanna, Jaya Bachchan and Dharmendra, who came to politics when their film careers had ended, Sanjay is still popular in Bollywood. If he really wants to serve the people, he should help NGOs and join campaigns against terrorism, child labour, illiteracy and so on. The popularity of celebrities can be useful in spreading awareness among the masses. If Sanjay were really interested in politics, he could have helped his sister, Priya Dutt, in her political campaigns. That way, he would not have had to turn against his familys allegiance to the Congress.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  In our country, actors become politicians when they are no longer acceptable in the film industry. Their popularity helps them bag election nominations. But once elected, they forget about their constituencies and make guest appearances in Parliament. We have seen this being enacted earlier, by actors such as Govinda and Dharmendra. Now Sanjay Dutt is getting ready to follow them. He must know that ensuring the safety and convenience of the people is not the same as playing a role in a film. Banking on the popularity of Munnabhai  almost Dutts filmic alter ego  and Gandhigiri shows bad taste. People can distinguish between fiction and reality. Their assessment of the actor-turned-politician cannot be influenced by Dutts scripted dialogues. In order to stop such people from wandering into politics, the government must enforce laws to ensure that only committed people can contest elections.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Ambar Mallick, Calcutta

                
	Sir  As an Indian citizen, Sanjay Dutt has the right to represent a a party of his choice in the polls, although he is out on bail. His decision to enter politics may be a pleasant surprise for his fans. The fans of, for instance, Govinda and Navjot Singh Sidhu, too, must have been happy to see their heroes in new roles when these two icons were elected MPs. But the fans also found that Govinda remained busy with films, and Sidhu spent time hosting comedy shows and giving commentaries. Dutt may not be like this. But cant we have politicians who would be better as role models in nation-building than stars from the worlds of film and cricket?                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad

      
	Sir  Sanjay Dutt should not have breached his familys close ties with the Congress (Dutt forgives sis, stands by brother, Jan 17). He grumbled that the Congress did not stand by him at the time he was alleged to have criminal associations and to possess illegal firearms. But when his actions had humiliated his own family, could he expect a national party to support him? That the Congress did not endorse his actions should have been the reason for Dutt to join it, had he been honest with himself this time.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Tapas Das, Howrah

                
	Sir  Most actors end up as failed politicians. Sanjay Dutts father, Sunil Dutt, was an exception, but Sanjays past association with criminals will make it difficult for him to become a political leader. He will have to seek favours from politicians, as he already has from Amar Singh. Parties will just exploit Dutts popularity to reap electoral dividends.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Mahesh Kapasi, New Delhi

                
	Sir  Sanjay Dutts entry into politics was inevitable. Politics runs in his blood. His parents and sister, Priya Dutt, have been notable names in the Congress. Cynics may feel that the actor is taking refuge in politics because his days are over in Bollywood. But unlike Raj Babbar, Vinod Khanna or Dharmendra, Dutt is joining politics at a time when he is still popular in the film world. His decision to join the Samajwadi Party may not have gone down well with his family and with the Congress, but the strong will and determination that guided him to join a party of his own choice will also take him a long way as a politician.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Arunava De, Siliguri

                
	Parting shot          
	Sir  Krishnan Srinivasan is right in saying that the United States of America needs the support of both India and Pakistan, but for different reasons (Uneasy triangle, Jan 14). The Wests tilt has always been more towards Pakistan. The latest vindication of this came with the remark of the British foreign secretary, David Miliband, in New Delhi that the villain of 26/11 was not Pakistan; the villains were terrorist outfits taking shelter in Pakistans western districts (UK breather for Pak state, heat on Lashkar, Jan 14).           
	Pakistans foreign policy and statecraft have been far superior to Indias since Independence. While New Delhi strained its relationship with everyone, Islamabad developed good links with all who mattered. This strategy has stood it in good stead. The West hardly ever accused Pakistan of terrorist involvement. Much of the credit for this goes to Pervez Musharraf who made Pakistan indispensable to the Wests political interests.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Jayanta Dutt, Calcutta

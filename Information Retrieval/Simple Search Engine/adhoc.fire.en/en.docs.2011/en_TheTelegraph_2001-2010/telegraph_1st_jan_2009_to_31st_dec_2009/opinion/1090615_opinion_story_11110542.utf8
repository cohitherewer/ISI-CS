	It may sound bleakly ironic, but perhaps the only good thing to have come out of the elections in Iran is the anger with which large sections of the electorate have greeted the results. The intensity of their outburst reveals the deep mistrust that has been simmering in the minds of the people for years. These polls were expected to bring the reformist candidate, Mir Hossein Mousavi, to power, ending the reign of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. But even with 85 per cent turnout and a considerable support-base among urban youth and women, Mr Mousavi could not stop his rival from coming back to yet another four-year term. Mr Mousavis supporters have now taken to the streets to protest against alleged irregularities in the voting process. The evidence, so far, suggests foul play. Accusations of rigging, preventing access to Mr Mousavis website, and the blocking of text-message campaigning have been raised. But what seems to have hit the agitators hardest is the beating that the global image of Iran has taken.        
	By hoping to elect a moderate candidate, Iranians not only wanted to step out of the axis of evil that George W. Bush had put their country on, but also to prove to the world that as a people they were ready to embrace change. Whatever Mr Ahmadinejad has done for the nation has not exactly been salutary. His taciturnity has deepened suspicions of Irans nuclear programme, although nothing conclusive has been found so far. This, in turn, has heightened Israels paranoia (or perhaps just concern for its own safety), which has led to the ire of the United States of America. Even after Barack Obamas overtures of friendship based on a new understanding, Mr Ahmadinejad has not seemed terribly enthusiastic to discuss the nuclear status of his country, or even to tone down its response to the festering crisis in the Middle East. In his campaigns, Mr Mousavi had promised a green revolution for his country. Since democracy failed to usher it in, the iron hand of quasi-dictatorship is now being tried in another kind of bloody uprising.

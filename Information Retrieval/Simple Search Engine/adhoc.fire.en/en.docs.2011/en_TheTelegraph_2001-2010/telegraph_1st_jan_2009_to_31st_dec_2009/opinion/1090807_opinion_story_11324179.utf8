	Anthologies, which have become the favoured genre of publishers, fall into two main categories: first, a collection of the main writings of a well-known author, usually brought together by the writer, if he or she is alive, or by literary agents to whom the publication rights have been bequeathed; second, a selection of writings, usually brought together under a broad subject by a general editor with an introduction which provides an overview of the anthology.        
	Of the two, the second is the more popular because of its variety. It promises something for every reader  you can go backwards and forwards with it, you can put it down, wander around and return to it afresh. In current jargon, they are user-friendly.        
	The second type poses problems for publishers and often leaves the readers unsatisfied. Some extracts that ought to have been included are often left out either because of copyright constraints or because of the fees demanded. So the question  do stringent copyright laws hamper well-rounded anthologies?        
	Lets get to the basics of copyright law. Its a tricky subject, but the rule of thumb is that, with exceptions, anything you write will enjoy copyright protection for your lifetime plus 50 years. Also, copyright protects original works of authorship that are fixed in a tangible form of expression. That is, titles, ideas and facts cannot be copyrighted. But what complicates the application of the copyright law is that lifetime plus 50 years can be easily extended by the inheritors of the authors estate after his death by renewing it for another 50 years. This is done either by revising the text in case of non-fiction, or by getting a new introduction for fictional works that will offer fresh perspectives and so make them more contemporary. Of course, new translations of old classics would extend the copyright to 50 years and beyond.        
	That is not all. It is not enough for the general editor to cull sections of an authors writings and get them printed. Permission would have to be taken to reprint the extracts and an acknowledgement made for them.         
	More importantly, reprint means setting up the text afresh, proofreading it before printing it. Copyright extends to design and layout too; photocopying the text is strictly illegal. For instance, Shakespeare is out of copyright but reprinting the old Oxford or Cambridge editions without permission would be violation of copyright.        
	Copyright fees are another stumbling block, especially when it comes to modern writers, whose inclusion is necessary if the book has to be commercially viable. These fees vary considerably (Eliot and Yeats, for instance, cost 50 and more, depending on how many words of the poems you use) and that has an impact on the price of the book, especially if the primary market is composed of university students. Quite often, poems and extracts from novels have had to be left out because the fees were too high. So a compromise had to be made: truncated versions of the originals were printed. But then, that isnt the same thing as the original.        
	So what should we make of anthologies that can never give us the whole picture? All said and done, they are sophisticated guides that, hopefully, will lead us on to the real thing the originals themselves.

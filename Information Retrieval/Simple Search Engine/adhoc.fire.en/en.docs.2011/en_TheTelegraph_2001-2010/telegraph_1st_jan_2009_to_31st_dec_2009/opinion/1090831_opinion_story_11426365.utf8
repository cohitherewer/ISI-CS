                                                                                                               Debtors in jeans                                                      
	Hard times are pinching peoples pockets  even the spaceless pockets of the slim and the smart. One by one, they are kicking their addiction. From one a week, their jean purchases are falling to one a month, one a quarter, and so on to infinity. It has come to a point where young Bangaloreans are no longer ashamed to be seen wearing last years jeans. After all, some of the expensive jeans have gaping holes in them. Indigent, indigenous jean-wearers have been known to spend weekends tearing up their jeans to make them look upmarket. There is a risk that this marginal handicraft may turn into a flourishing industry. Amateur jean-manglers may turn into professional hole-makers. The closely held technology of making jeans look decrepit may be overtaken by rampant copying; the back streets of Bangalore may come to be lined by artists skilled in making fake worn-looking jeans out of perfectly good cheap jeans. It was a prospect that could not be faced. It brooked no delay; there was no time to think. The time had come for quick and resolute action. Even in such critical times, the heirs to the empire of Levi Strauss showed that they have not lost his touch. Now the techies of Bangalore will be able to buy jeans on credit. They can pay a third of the price and take the jeans away, as long as the third exceeds Rs 533. The remaining two-thirds can be paid in two monthly instalments. This magnanimous offer has postponed the worry of Bangalores geeks about what they would wear to the next party. They can still don the latest model, and worry later about payment.         
	However, it is not for them to worry; if they do not pay their instalments, it will be Levi Strausss worry. True, some of what they default on will be the companys profit. But at whatever cost it gets its jeans manufactured, it seems unlikely that Levi Strausss profit margin is more than 200 per cent; as long as it is less, the company is taking a risk. On the other hand, its gambit may lead to useful information. It may separate honest buyers from dishonest ones. After they have paid off their debts to the company, the honest ones may get letters offering more jeans at a discount. Even better, they may be given dealerships. Giving credit is a good way of establishing relationships, and relationships come to matter in bad times.        
	But there is still a path that Levi Strauss has omitted to explore, and that is to sell jeans in bits and pieces. After all, a pair of jeans is a combination of a belt, a crotch and two legs sewn together; if Levi Strauss sold each of these separately, it could leave the stitching to buyers. Just imagine how much thread it would save.

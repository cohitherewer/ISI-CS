The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Similar challenges, different roadmaps
                                                                                                                 SIMILAR CHALLENGES, DIFFERENT ROADMAPS                              India and China have shown that liberalizing the economy can be married to a strong assertion of national sovereignty, writes Krishnan Srinivasan                        A resident rides a bicycle past a chemical factory in Hubei province, China				                                       
	Major challenges confront both China and India, the emerging economies of this century. Among these, climate change and global warming are a looming menace, which threaten the lifestyles and the future of both countries. According to the Blacksmith Institute of New York, both China and India have two each of the ten most polluted sites in the world, the others being two in Russia and one each in Peru, Azerbaijan, Ukraine and Zambia.         
	China has accounted for as much as 58 per cent in the increase in carbon emissions in the past seven years. Using thermal energy and automotive traffic in their attempts to catch up rapidly with the West, China and India will contribute hugely to additional emissions. By using a mathematical model that continues the trends of the past 25 years in a business as usual holding pattern, environmental experts expect global carbon emissions to double by 2050, with a significant risk of serious adverse socio-economic consequences from climate change, such as floods and droughts, to the displacement of millions of people and the destruction of sources of livelihood.         
	In this scenario, by 2050, China alone would account for 25 per cent of world carbon emissions, followed by the United States of America with 15 per cent and then by India with 11 per cent. One of the main reasons for this ranking will be the high coal intensity of the large and fast-growing Chinese and Indian economies. In practice, they will probably shift away from coal over time, though nuclear and renewable energy estimates may be hugely overambitious given the political, financial and economic obstacles to be overcome; and higher gas prices may also limit the conversion to gas.         
	The International Energy Agency has warned that because China and India now constitute 70 per cent of the increase in global demand for energy, and lack of regulation made it difficult to meet targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions, decisions are needed to be taken by Beijing and New Delhi on whether to continue investing in coal-fired power plants or to adopt better policies to tackle global warming. But it is conceded that it is unreasonable to ask the two countries to submit to mandatory emission cuts because the current greenhouse gas concentrations were placed there by the industrialized world. The emerging economies are poorly equipped to deal with predicaments they were not responsible for, and curbing development would stall poverty alleviation.         
	Economic growth in China and India is, therefore, unlikely to be constrained by treaty for environmental reasons alone. Nevertheless, China and India will be prudent, in their own interests, to give leadership to the developing world by volunteering to adopt clean coal technology, low carbon processes and renewable energy options.               
	Otherwise, there could come a time in the not-so-distant future when countries like China and India themselves come under criticism and pressure for restraint from other developing countries affected by global warming whose emissions will be much lower.        
	Another major challenge for both India and China is corruption. Both countries share the problem of abuse of power and pervasive corruption  the corruption of greed as well as the corruption of need; and the unwillingness and inability of the authorities to tackle or suppress it. There is illegal capital flight from both countries. Every case of misappropriation that comes to light in China reveals corruption at all levels, and it is hard to identify any leader whose associates are beyond suspicion, although China officially speaks of only a small number of venal public servants. The Communist Party itself is corrupt, management of many state-owned enterprises is lax, and there are no independent institutions that can resolve citizens grievances fairly.         
	China is said to have more than 1,200 laws, rules and directives against corruption, but implementation is ineffective. Beijing has trouble in supervising local officials who have considerable autonomy, and some localities have become private fiefdoms. Corruption threatens to undermine social stability and public anger sparks thousands of protests at the never-ending manifestations of graft. In 2008, 60 persons were arrested for producing and selling toxic and harmful food products, another 50 for embezzling public money running into several millions of dollars to finance their gambling habits, and the latest of these major scandals is the trial, now taking place in Yunnan, involving one million forged receipts valued at a staggering $147 billion. Corruption has not derailed Chinas economic rise or sparked a social revolution, nor yet deterred Western investors. But it would be unwise to conclude that the Chinese system has an infinite capacity to accommodate the mounting costs of corruption.               
	People will tolerate egregious corruption and accept the fact that the culprits are never brought to book, as in India, if they can have the ability to throw the main offenders out of office in regular free elections, even if the exit is only a revolving door that brings the same breed of rascals back to power. Democracies are able to exist with all the human imperfections and can withstand a lot of misery, whereas China is fragile when it comes to dissent, as Tibet, Tiananmen and the Falun Gong have showed. Both countries were initially highly suspicious of the private sector. Chinas closed period was from 1949 to 1978, and Indias almost parallel, from 1947 to 1980. But the Indian political system did not throw up any leader with the qualities of Deng Xiaoping, and the dozen years after 1980 were wasted in half-hearted and hesitant steps towards reform, while China charged ahead.        
	Chinas savings rate is about 50 per cent, much more than that of Indias. But, in both countries, there is a budget deficit that is out of control. In both countries, state-owned industries and banks hide huge credit risks, with overstaffing, bad loans and non-performing assets. In the case of China, it is conservatively estimated that in 2006, the banking system was carrying a trillion dollars in bad loans. The results of massive government investment in Chinese infrastructure have been dramatic. In 1989, China had just 269 kilometres of expressway; by 2020, its highway system will total 88,000 kilometres, equal to the figure in the US. Shanghai alone has more than 4,000 skyscrapers  more than Chicago and Los Angeles combined. But many of these magnificent structures are financed by bank loans that are never repaid.         
	In 1950, India had a better capitalist and commercial culture than China, and the overseas communities of both countries have always possessed an exceptional degree of commercial enterprise and expertise. The differences in adaptation to an open domestic economy are because of political and institutional forms inside each country. China, even before its entry into the World Trade Organization, had undertaken considerable liberalization in trade and services, and moved swiftly from being one of the most protected economies to one of the most open. India still prefers the debatable comforts of the staging post, the half-way house.              
	China has demonstrated, and so has India, that liberalizing the economy can be married to a strong assertion of national sovereignty. Both China and India feel they have been victims of an international order that has been unjust to them for centuries and denied them their rightful place in world affairs. There have been some recent notable examples where nations with strong economies have not asserted any claim to global influence, but India and China will not be similarly self-denying in the future.

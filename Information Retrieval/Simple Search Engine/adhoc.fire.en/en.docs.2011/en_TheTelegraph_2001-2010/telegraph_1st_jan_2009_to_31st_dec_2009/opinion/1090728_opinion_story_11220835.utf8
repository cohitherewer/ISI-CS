	Wait and watch                  
	Sir  It is disheartening to see the state administration following a wait and watch formula with regard to the indefinite strike called by the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha in the hills (Centre told to tread in hills with caution, July 24). The governments inability to take a firm stand on this issue has inconvenienced everybody. Things have come to such a pass that those compelled to travel to the plains via Kalimpong are being made to obtain permission from somebody authorized by the GJM rather than from the district magistrate. Government officials in the hills are doing nothing when GJM supporters yielding lathis are openly patrolling the national highway to enforce the bandh.          
	If the state government has decided to take a backseat in the hills, and the GJM is able to ensure the safety of the people during the strike, then there is no reason why the former should not accede to the Morchas request for statehood. Giving in to the Morchas claims would solve the problems being faced by the people at regular intervals. But if the state government is serious about retaining the Darjeeling hills, it should come out of its hibernation and take immediate action.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Mahesh Sharma, Gangtok, Sikkim

                
	Sir  While commenting on the Gorkhaland issue, the editorial, Danger drift (July 15), says, After all, the way the Centre and a state government deal with a statehood demand will have its impact in other parts of the country where such demands exist. What is wrong with such an impact? It may cause a few more states like Telengana, Boroland and Vidarbha, apart from Gorkhaland, to be born in the future. If the United States of America with a population of about 300 million people can have 50 states, India, with a population of around 1.17 billion, can run well with, say, 35 states. By denying the Gorkhas a state of their own, we are being unjust towards them.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  It is distressing to hear the voices of dissent that have been raised against the formation of Gorkhaland as a separate state within the union of India. There is no reason why the Gorkhas should not have their own state. Historically, Darjeeling was not a part of West Bengal. It belonged to the Bhagalpur district of Bihar at first and then to the Rajshahi division of present-day Bangladesh. It was joined with West Bengal by the British chiefly for administrative purposes. Hence, those antagonists of Gorkhaland who have voiced the fear of a second partition of Bengal with the creation of a separate state in its north, are being unfair and incorrect.           
	The founding fathers of modern India reorganized the nation on the basis of language. Neither the language nor the culture of the Darjeeling hills has anything in common with the rest of West Bengal. Therefore, if states such as Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand or Uttarakhand can be created, why can the century-old dream of a Gorkhaland not be realized?           
	Yours faithfully,       
Kalyani Lama, Siliguri 

                
	Sir  I think that a separate state is no solution to the ongoing crisis in the hills (Delhi rejects statehood, offers hill autonomy, July 20). It will only worsen the situation in Darjeeling and encourage further divisions among the existing Indian states. The Central governments offer to grant the Sixth Schedule status with extra power to the Darjeeling hills is the ideal way out of the impasse. The representatives of the GJM and the state government should make it a point to attend the meeting called by the Centre on August 11 to sort out their differences.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Ranjit Sinha, Deolali, Maharashtra 

                
	Without power          
	Sir  I am a 72 year-old man living in Garia on the third-floor of a multi-storied building with an elevator. I live alone, served part-time by two domestic helps. Since I am continuously troubled by a pair of arthritic knees, it is impossible for me to survive without the elevator.          
	Of late, power supply by the West Bengal State Electricity Board has been so erratic in this part of the South 24 Parganas that I dread to use the lift lest I get caught midway during a power cut. An irate neighbour of mine thinks that the torture of regular power cuts is being inflicted on us by the authorities as punishment for the election results. I wonder whether the rulers would stoop so low to avenge their defeat, although cutting off supply to hostile media houses has been a well-known tactic used in the past by governments to make the former toe their line. But why has the WBSEB decided to torment the South 24 Parganas with six hours of blackout every day for the last two weeks? If this is a necessity, can the WBSEB at least publish the expected timings of the power cuts in the newspapers so that we can schedule our daily activities accordingly?          
	Yours faithfully,      
B.B. Munshi, Calcutta

                
	Erratum          
	The picture with Malavika Karlekars Palanquins with a view (July 26) was that of a 1790 chaise palanquin and not of a shrouded bullock cart as indicated in the text. The error is regretted.

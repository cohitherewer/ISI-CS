	Back from the dead                  
	Sir  I wonder about the effectiveness of the culling operations conducted by the authorities in Assam after the recent outbreak of bird flu in the state. As soon as the government declared the culling complete on December 19, chicken and eggs were seen in Guwahatis retail markets. If the culling operations in the affected areas had destroyed all the birds and eggs as claimed, how could so many of them reappear overnight? It is to be noted that a truck strike was going on in Assam during the time. Hence, fresh supplies of poultry could not have arrived from other states.           
	Yours faithfully,        Prosenjit Chakravorty, Guwahati 
        
	Bleak future          
	Sir  Sunanda K. Datta-Rays article, No children to devour (Jan 10), brilliantly underscored the ways in which street politics has disrupted life in contemporary India. Politics in India can be best termed a sinecure profession. The only goal of the money-minded politicians is to incite people to throng the streets at the drop of a hat, and to make sure that their party rises to power in the next elections. Nationalist leaders like Jawaharlal Nehru could not have imagined that the unique culture of protests by the mob, symptomatic of a strong democracy, would breed corruption in the long run. Today, it is because of this perverse culture that Indias growth has been arrested in different spheres.           
	In recent times, the city has been witnessing mob violence not only over the proposed ban on two-stroke autorickshaws, but also over such mundane happenings as a policeman beating up a taxi-driver. No solutions to such strife are ever worked out by either the ruling party or the Opposition. The street fights only generate more protests in the form of road blockades and bandhs. Felons always escape unscathed and continue with their misdeeds, thus putting the lives of ordinary people in peril. To solve this problem, we need a constitutional amendment, which would put a stop to unnecessary street violence.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  In the pre-Independence era, breaking the law was considered heroic. The nationalists were fighting against colonial rulers for the cause of freedom and as such, their acts were justified. It is unfortunate that even in independent India, people still flout the law with impunity, although it is meant to protect their interests. In West Bengal, people seem to believe that only cowards respect the law. They would rather ignore the law than sacrifice their comforts for the sake of their own health or of the future generations. And this is almost everyones mentality, right from the head of the state to the man on the street. Sunanda K. Datta-Ray talks about this mindset in his article. As we allow two-stroke autos to ply the city streets and so disregard the high court ban, we hardly realize that by disobeying the court ruling, we are actually destroying ourselves.           
	The stance of the chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, with regard to the court order has been disheartening, if not shocking. Is he the same person who raised our hopes with the slogan, Do it now? We lost Nano but we still had faith in his vision. But for how long will we have to condone his failures as the inabilities of a man who is unable to rise above the interests of his party and its affiliated unions? He has disappointed us by failing to quit smoking, and by his new-year message to the effect that the autos could not be expected to change to liquefied petroleum gas immediately. Such statements are unbecoming of the man who encouraged Bengal to dream of regaining its lost glory. Bengal may ask him, When will change take place, if not now, when there is nothing going against it?          
	Yours faithfully,

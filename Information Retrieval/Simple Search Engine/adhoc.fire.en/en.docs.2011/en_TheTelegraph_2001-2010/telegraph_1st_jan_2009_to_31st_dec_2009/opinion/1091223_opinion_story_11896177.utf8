	The law and order situation in West Bengal has come to such a pass that even the chief minister of the state has been compelled to admit to the Opposition in the assembly that conditions are far from joyous. The admission is a measure of the deteriorating condition since the chief minister, by making such an admission, is passing an adverse comment on his own administration. The fact is obvious enough: violence, very often provoked by political rivalry, has escalated and has spread across the state. It is worth recalling that little over a week ago, the outgoing governor of West Bengal, Gopal Krishna Gandhi, had made an appeal to political parties to eschew the politics of vendetta. That appeal, not unexpectedly, fell on deaf ears. Political parties, as is their wont, will chase their own narrow agenda and will show their utter contempt for any kind of responsibility towards society. They will also continue to play the blame game to their own advantage. What, however, is disheartening are the indifference and incompetence of the administration. This is nothing short of a failure of governance. Events show that parts of the state have become arsenals of political parties, and the administration seems unable or unwilling to identify these stockpiles and to nail the culprits.        
	It is difficult to believe that this is a very difficult task for the police to perform. What this does demand is the police forces freedom from political patronage. For over three decades, the police and other bureaucrats in the state have worked at the behest of the Communist Party of India (Marxist). They are thus reluctant still to move against the ruling dispensation and its armed cadre. They are also not too keen to act against those belonging to the Trinamul Congress since the latter is seen as the ruling party-in-waiting. In other words, political patronage and interference have rendered spineless the law and order machinery of the state. Bureaucrats and policemen have forgotten the elementary lesson that crime has no political colour. The chief minister can continue to lament the collapse of law and order in West Bengal but this will get him nowhere since the prevailing condition is the direct outcome of what his party has done to the administration ever since it came to power. It may well turn out to be too late for the chief minister to realize that he is locked in his own history.

	Science made simple              
	The weave of my life: a Dalit womans memoirs (Stree, Rs 375) by Urmila Pawar has been translated into English from the Marathi original, Aaydan. Unlike many Dalit narratives, Pawars work is a testimony of not only a lived experience, but is also a source of articulating theory. In its unsparingness, it brings to light both the private and public domains of the protagonists life: her marriage in the face of family opposition, the couples journey from the Konkan to Mumbai, a city that was to become the site of unbridled joy and intense pain, her subsequent association with the Dalit and womens movements, as well as her evolution as a gifted writer. Of equal significance is the documentary value of these memoirs, as well as Pawars capacity to critique feminist and Dalit politics objectively. Pawars prose is fluid, as is evident from Maya Pandits able translation.                        
	The marriage bureau for rich people (Abacus, 7.99) by Farahad Zama is an investment bankers light-hearted take on matters of the heart. The setting is a lively coastal town inhabited by equally colourful characters. Mr Ali, with his wealth of common sense, decides to open a marriage bureau even as retirement looms around the corners of his work life. With the help of his wife and Aruna, the able assistant, the venture is a success. But while Mr Alis clients return with a contended smile, a frown begins to gather on Arunas face. Love blooms, bringing with it an impossible dilemma, even as Mr Ali gets busy doling out advice that he himself rarely heeds. There is a feeble attempt on Zamas part to address darker aspects of marriage  there are oblique references to abuse and dowry but they remain frothy and clichd as his novel.                        
	The Canon: A whirligig tour of the beautiful basics of science (Faber, Rs 399) by Natalie Angier simplifies the supposedly complex fundamentals within the various branches of science. The chapters address scientific concepts such as probabilities and calibration, besides providing an outline of disciplines like Physics, Chemistry, Geology, Astronomy and so on in a manner that is comprehensible to and exciting for young minds. Angiers style is charming and her witty anecdotes liberate science writing from what she calls aliterary and journalistic ghetto. There are also intriguing queries that reveal dilemmas confronting science, such as the role of uncertainty in taking forward quality scientific research, which will delight the young and old alike.                                  
	Panic: The story of modern financial insanity (Penguin, Rs 250) is timely and full of wry humour. In his introduction to this anthology of financial writing, Michael Lewis, the editor, notes that the sub-prime mortgage crisis has an egalitarian dimension: it has made fools of both the wise and the nave  the Wall Street executives and the man on the street. But then, the contributors do not analyse the recent debacle only. They begin at the beginning, revisiting among other episodes, the Asian financial crisis and the internet bubble burst, and delve into a world of meteoric rise and crushing fall, avarice, vanity and unimaginable wealth. The collection includes writings by renowned commentators such as Paul Krugman, Joseph Stiglitz and Lewis. Each piece is a chilling account of the mood at the time of a catastrophe, and how, later, when the dust had settled, the world failed to take lessons and moved on to commit the same errors.

                                                                                                                 RICH IN RESOURCES                                                    
	Women in strife-torn regions, such as the Northeast, play a variety of extraordinary roles. That Manipurs women are outstanding in employing their strength, independent thinking and pure physical courage in the interests of peace and normalcy was recently demonstrated again. In Siroy, Ukhrul, Assam Rifles personnel surrounded National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah) cadre for days while women from nearby villages reportedly participated round the clock in a vigil in which they placed themselves between the troops and the cadre to prevent bloodshed. The siege is now over and both sides have gone their different ways, after acknowledging the role of the local women in keeping peace. It is part of the enormous pity of continuing violence that the human resources represented by the women of the region  good sense, firmness, intelligence, courage, constructive energy suited to a stable, healthy society and dynamic growth and development  should be going to waste. But given the unresolved state of affairs in the governments peace talks with the NSCN (I-M), the factionalism among Naga groups, the tensions generated by the presence of Naga-dominated areas in Manipur, there does not seem to be any immediate way of putting such resources to use. So it is the basic step, the scaling down of violence, that the Union home minister focused on in his visit to Manipur and Nagaland.        
	The home minister, P. Chidambaram, placed greatest emphasis on stringent measures against militancy, including extortion for funding insurgent action and abduction. From the point of view of governance, this would be impeccable if it did not sound slightly puerile. The militants must get the message, he said, that violence does not pay. Yet Mr Chidambaram must be aware, just as the chief ministers of the two states he visited are too, that stringent police or military measures alone are not enough to bring peace. Without a political approach to the multi-layered issues in the region, both concession and stringency will be futile, and the ordinary residents of the region will remain vulnerable. Mr Chidambaram has also stressed the need to resolve the Naga problem within the Constitution, while reiterating the governments intolerance of ceasefire violations. His firmness and determination may be heartening, but the way back to peace is still not clearly discernible.

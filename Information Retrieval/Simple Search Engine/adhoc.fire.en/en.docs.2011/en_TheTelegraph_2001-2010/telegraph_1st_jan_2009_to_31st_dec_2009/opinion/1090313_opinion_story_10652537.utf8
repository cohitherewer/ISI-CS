	BIOGRAPHY AS HISTORY: INDIAN PERSPECTIVES

	History speaks in many voices. At times, the voice sounds loud and clear, sometimes it is rather muffled, and at other times it is echoed rather than clearly articulated. There are also remarkably subtle tonal variations within each of these categories. In biographies, as also in autobiographies (albeit in a slightly different manner), these voices intermingle in ways that reflect the dialectic which informs the relationship of the people concerned with their ages.   
	In a biography, the biographers role is extremely crucial historically because it is his personal  to the extent that the personal is the political, and as such historical matrix of value judgments that relates the subject to the biographers age. In an autobiography, however, history is more likely to be distorted or falsified than in a biography simply because very few can afford to be brutally frank while writing about themselves. As a result, their selfhoods remain either over-constructed or under-constructed.         
	Speaking about Rajneeshs memoir, Glimpses of a Golden Childhood: The Rebellious Childhood of a Great Enlightened One, Sudhir Kakar writes in Mad and Divine, An autobiography is a myth we create about ourselves and would like others to believe in. Not that an autobiographer does not struggle to be truthful. It is only that his striving for truth is undermined by the unconscious power of human narcissism. If we are prepared to accept Kakars observation as a widely valid one, we should also automatically acknowledge that the reading of an autobiography (and also of a biography for that matter, even if to a lesser degree) is as much a study in history as in human psychology.        
	Biography as History: Indian Perspectives talks of biographies and autobiographies as cultural theatres in which historical forces play themselves out on the one hand, and on the other, human psychology unfolds its arcane reserves of motives and instincts. In the Introduction, Vijaya Ramaswamy, one of the editors of the book, argues persuasively against the popularly held notion that genres such as the biography and autobiography are Western imports. Ramaswamy talks about Banabhattas Harshacharita, written in the first quarter of the seventh century, as the earliest known Indian biography, and also refers to a reasonably substantial corpus of biographies and autobiographies written during the Mughal period of Indian history.        
	Lamenting the fact that Indian biographies carry unmistakable hagiographic overtones, Ramaswamy mentions some notable exceptions such as Sarvepalli Gopals three volume biography of Jawaharlal Nehru, B.R. Nandas biography of M.K. Gandhi and Suhash Chakravartys three volume biography of V.K. Krishna Menon. Taking the cue from an article by Ramachandra Guha, Ramaswamy makes an interesting observation: the autobiographies/biographies which have provided the best historical insights are those written by and about people in the middle, who are neither famous nor subalterns.         
	The book is divided into four sections entitled Biographical Traditions, Biography from the Margins, European Memoirs in Indian Settings and Writing Biographies: Reminiscences and Reflections. The first section predictably surveys the ways in which Indian biographies play host to myths and histories amalgamated by secret motives or drives entrenched deep in the biographers psyche.         
	Kumkum Roy, for instance, studies Sandhyakaranandins Ramacharitam as an artful biography of Rampal, one of the last Pal rulers, that can well be read as a version of the Ramayan. Roy shows that while aligning Rampal with his mythical namesake, Sandhyakaranandin rather strategically (probably anticipating an imminent shift in power equations in the royal court) takes recourse to an incongruous iconography. Here Mahipal, Rampals incarcerator, and Bhima, his tormentor, are compared respectively with Bharata, Ramas loyal brother in the Ramayan, and with Lakshmi and Saraswati, the puranic goddesses, rather than with Ravana. In another discerning article in this section, Amiya P. Sen demonstrates how Vivekanandas construction of the persona of his guru, Ramakrishna, in his speeches wavers uneasily between history and hagiography as Vivekananda himself was never able to resolve the conflicts between his commitments to agnosticism (which he himself called scientism) and idolatrous-cum-mystic theism.         
	The second section containing three articles may well be represented by the one by Vijaya Ramaswamy on Neelambikai Ammaiyar, the prolific author-cum-biographer of early 20th century Tamil Nadu. The third section, dealing with European (mainly Portuguese and French) memoirs, depicts a lesser known side of the early days of colonial Indian history. The last section delves into the intrinsic nature of the art of writing biographies and memoirs, with B.R. Nanda narrating his experiences as a biographer, and in another interesting article, Aparna Basu discussing how women fare while writing about themselves or other women.         
	Ramaswamy writes in the Introduction that the book does not attempt any tailored closure. This has not been a vain claim. Some of the issues raised not only invite debates, but also put the readers in a fix while they try to choose between two diametrically opposed conclusions on the same subject. This can be understood if someone reads A.R.Venkatachalapathys article in the book, and compares his conclusion that excising the self is a character trait of Indian autobiographies with V.S. Naipauls view that Indian autobiographies, as epitomized by Gandhis, experience the world only through self-absorption (India: A Wounded Civilization). Interestingly, both the authors premise their views on Sudhir Kakars observations on the Indian psyche.

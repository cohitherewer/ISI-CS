	Sharmila Biswas (picture) and Preeti Patel are serious dancers, always trying to conceive new ideas, even within the classical format. Poorvadhara, exploring the progress and continuity of eastern and northeastern dance styles, was one such attempt. Presented by Odissi Vision and Movement Centre, Sanskriti Sagar, and Open doors, the two-day dance festival (Nov 9-10) at G.D. Birla Sabhagar began with chaturanga, a four-part Odissi production. Choreographed by Biswas and Neelay Sengupta, the troupe displayed a highly sophisticated sensibility. Mangalyam, as an invocatory piece, was too elaborate. It was followed by swarabilas based on Raga Charukeshi. The dancers put up a captivating show, visualizing a woman surrendering herself to the melody as though to her beloved. It was astonishing how Sharmila was able to transform her skills into pure art through her imagination.        
	On the second day, choreographed by Preeti Patel, Anjika presented Dancing Drums, based on dhumel, one of the varities of sankeertan. Dancers from Manipur performed with verve and minimal accompaniment. Their energetic yet restrained performance was rivetting. Each dancer displayed an individual style that Preetis direction allowed and expanded.

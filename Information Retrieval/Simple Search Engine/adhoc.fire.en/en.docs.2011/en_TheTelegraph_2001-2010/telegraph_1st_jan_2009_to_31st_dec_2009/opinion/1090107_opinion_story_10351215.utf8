The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | on the bench
                                                                                                                 ON THE BENCH                                                    
	A letter may say more than the text it carries. Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees letter to the Union law ministry is one of those. The chief minister of West Bengal has questioned the fitness of four lawyers shortlisted to be judges in the Calcutta High Court. That was the text. But to concentrate on the merits or demerits of Mr Bhattacharjees doubts would be to miss the larger and, ultimately, far more pertinent, point. Justice is one of the governing principles of any civilized society. Those who are to dispense it must be selected with the greatest of care, for society needs to repose its trust in their incorruptibility, their mastery of judicial knowledge and their neutrality. But the appointment of judges in India has long been a contentious issue, usually reduced to a tussle between the executive and the judiciary as to which side should have the last word. The tussle may be pointless, yet the issue itself is of prime importance. Ever since the Supreme Court ruled in 1993 that the decisions in appointments had to be made in consultation with the chief justice of India, the CJIs word has been final. Consultation has come to mean consent.        
	Although the list of names of prospective judges does touch base with the executive at various levels, the latters role in the final selection is peripheral. Political appointments of judges may be a bad idea, but at the same time, the judiciarys lack of transparency regarding the internal consultation over the candidates suitability frustrates the principle of fairness that should be perceived in all actions of the dispensers of justice. The closed-shop attitude of the higher judiciary sits oddly in a democratic polity; even discussions about transparent methods and determining principles of judges appointments are discouraged. The national judicial commission bill, which proposed changes in the appointment process  although those were considered insufficient  and procedures to discipline judges whose actions were unbecoming of their high calling, has been hanging fire for five years. Among the many disagreements around it, including that over the role of politicians in judges appointments, one came from a judges panel. No non-judge should be allowed to discipline a judge, it said. Such a consciousness of difference, however, is unlikely to increase the dignity of the calling, or add to the credibility of the institution. The concern for the primacy of the judiciary that a senior judge expressed is surprising in a constitutional structure of which the judiciary is one arm while the executive and the legislature are the two others.         
	Mr Bhattacharjees letter implicitly presses for a space to discuss these issues. The judiciary must be seen as amenable to transparency and the requirements of accountability. Debate should be welcomed, and efforts to evolve a system that satisfies the principles of democracy must continue.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | guns and rice
                                                                                                                 GUNS AND RICE                                                    
	Two images stand out from the latest news from Lalgarh  of guns and rice. Between them, these images say much about what went wrong there. The guns, now mostly those of the police and the paramilitary forces, suggest that Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government is, at long last, seriously trying to take on the Maoists. Action has finally replaced months of inaction and indecision. Given the confusing signals that still come from statements by leaders of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), it is doubtful if the West Bengal government would have ventured to act even now without New Delhis resolve and assistance. Some results of the belated action are already showing, with the Maoists on a seemingly tactical retreat and the State beginning to re-establish its authority in some parts of the affected areas that had long been out of bounds for it. But the battle is clearly going to be long. The state needs to keep the pressure on the rebels and hold on to regained territory. That would be difficult, though, if the states resolve slackens or, worse still, woolly-headed politics is allowed to meddle in the administrations task. That danger is always there, given the CPI(M)s foggy ideas of a political fight against the Maoists. It may be necessary to fight the rebels politically, but that can happen only if the Marxists can regain the trust of the local people.        
	Distributing rice free to the poor people in Lalgarh is obviously an attempt by the government to regain their trust. But it is impossible not to see the duplicity of the exercise. The rice that is now being distributed actually symbolizes the deprivation and the deception that the government and the ruling Marxists handed to Lalgarhs poor for years. And this deprivation stood out in sharp focus against the prosperity of the leading party cadre in the area. This yawning gap between the lifestyles of the party cadre and that of the people has been one of the salient features of communist regimes across the world. At the last cabinet meeting earlier this week, the chief minister talked of a task force to develop regions inhabited by the tribal people. That was news to even some of his cabinet colleagues. While the battle against the Maoists and their insurrection must go on, this charade of development must end. Unless the Marxists act on the lessons from Lalgarh, the Maoist rebellion may strike roots elsewhere in the state.

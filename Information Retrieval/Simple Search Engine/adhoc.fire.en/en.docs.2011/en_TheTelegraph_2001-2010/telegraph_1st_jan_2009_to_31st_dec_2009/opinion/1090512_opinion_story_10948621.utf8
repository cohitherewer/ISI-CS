	It may be easier to lead the horse to the water than to make it drink. The United States of America has managed to woo the presidents of Afghanistan and Pakistan to Washington and make them pledge to fight the Taliban and al Qaida, but it may be less successful in holding them to their word. Both the men, despite their high offices, have very little control over the state of affairs in their countries. Hamid Karzai, for example, seen as a US stooge, is deeply unpopular in Afghanistan as also within the US establishment, which has never made any bones about its feelings. This has prompted Mr Karzai to befriend Afghan warlords and send adequate feelers to Russia. All this may complicate the situation in Afghanistan, where the corruption continues to drive the people into the arms of the militants. The huge civilian casualty following the surge in military operations in Afghanistan will further compromise the regime (even if it were to make a comeback after the August elections) as also the USs show of goodwill. As for Asif Ali Zardari, his acquiescence to the USs insistence that Pakistan forget its deep-seated suspicion of India to access the trebled aid is unlikely to make him any more popular in his country than he already is.        
	So why should the US indulge these two men? Is it to keep up the faade of its commitment to democracy, or is it because it genuinely has no credible option but to deal with Messrs Karzai and Zardari? Both are true. In Afghanistan, where the US is trying to develop the army to take on the responsibility of fighting al Qaida, supporting the civilian leadership is still the only viable option for the US, and Mr Karzai remains the only choice. In Pakistan, it is still too early to trounce the civilian government and shake hands openly with the military, especially when the latter has already decided to play the game from the wings. The reason why it is now possible to dictate terms to the Pakistan government and hope the army will take the cue is the turning of public opinion against the Taliban, who seem to have overplayed their hand. But the escalating civilian crisis may alter the scenario. In any case, the army does not yet seem persistent enough to liquidate the Taliban leadership. Nor has it committed itself to taking the war deeper into the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, where the Talibans presence has been more long-standing.

	As the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, was getting his final briefings in New Delhi last week on the progress in negotiations with the Americans on an agreement for reprocessing spent nuclear fuel, India received support from an unexpected quarter. Yvo de Boer, executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, told reporters in New York that India requires nuclear power to meet its energy needs if it is to effectively tackle climate change. If you look at countries like India  which are highly reliant on coal I really dont see us coming to grips with climate change at a global level without nuclear energy playing a role, he said with unexpected candour.        
	For the prime minister, who was then packing his bags to leave for his first summit meeting with the American president, Barack Obama, de Boers statement was as important for his Washington dialogue as the endorsement of the then International Atomic Energy Agency director-general, Mohamed El-Baradei, of the Indo-US nuclear deal four years ago was for the end of Indias long nuclear winter. The UN climate czars sensitivity towards Indias reasonable demands and the efforts in overdrive of the UN secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon, to seal a deal at the Copenhagen climate conference next month, which provides for a binding treaty as soon as possible in 2010, actually set the stage for progress in the talks between Singh and Obama both on the operationalization of the Indo-US nuclear deal and in finding some meeting ground between the two leaders on climate change.              
	Bans assertion at an informal meeting of the UN general assembly plenary last week that political momentum to avoid a disappointing outcome in Copenhagen was building almost daily and de Boers dismissal of reports that Copenhagen had failed even before it started significantly contributed to Singhs strategy in Washington that linked any Indian commitments in Copenhagen to continued support by the Obama administration on implementing the nuclear deal authored by the Bush administration. The prime minister went into the White House on Tuesday with the realization that Obama was looking to India to be at least as flexible as China on the goals in Copenhagen: Obama and the Chinese president, Hu Jintao, agreed during their recent meeting in Beijing to work towards an agreement in Copenhagen that would immediately go into operation.        
	India decided, in turn, that it would only make concessions if it was assured of energy supply: in other words it wanted the Obama administration to restate its commitment to the nuclear deal not in mere words but by some action such as an agreement on the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel. Ban told the general assembly plenary that in addition to the understanding in Beijing between Obama and Hu that Copenhagen must not be a failure, encouraging news was coming in from everywhere. Indonesia had committed to reduce its emissions by 26 per cent. Russia had doubled its commitment and promised last week to cut emissions by a quarter by 2020 if other countries made similar promises. Brazils target is to curb emissions by 38 to 42 percent by 2020. But last week, Brazil and France together pledged to do more. South Korea similarly pledged to cut emissions by 30 percent by 2020, while Japan and Norway have committed to figures of 25 per cent and 40 per cent respectively. All of this prompted the secretary-general to tell the general assembly plenary that taken together, we have ample reason to be positive about Copenhagen My message to you today is this: stay positive, stay engaged, come to Copenhagen and seal a deal. This is our moment.        
	Obama is understood to have told the prime minister yesterday that, in the next few days, his administration will propose a short-term goal for reducing Americas greenhouse gas emissions. With only 12 days to go in the countdown to Copenhagen, White House officials are privately saying that along with this proposal will also come a formal announcement about whether, and for how long, the American president would attend the upcoming climate talks.        
	An American goal for cutting emissions would be historic. And if Obama decides to travel to Copenhagen, that will electrify the prospects of a success in the climate negotiations there, coming in the wake of promising commitments by China, Indonesia, Brazil, Russia, Korea, Japan and Norway in recent days and weeks.        
	Where does that leave India? The United Progressive Alliance government will lose considerable goodwill internationally if it buries its head in the sand, ostrich-like, unmindful that its recently secured place at the global high table in the form of membership of the Group of Twenty (G-20) implies not just rights, but also responsibilities. Having secured a memorandum of understanding with the United States of America during Singhs visit, which holds out the promise of energy security and clean energy in return for steps on climate change, India will now have to prove in Copenhagen that New Delhi is willing to work towards any solution that does not compromise the right of developing countries to develop and lift their populations out of poverty, as the prime minister told the Council on Foreign Relations on Monday. Indias position may continue to evolve as Singh heads for the Commonwealth summit in the Port of Spain on Thursday. A formidable presence there will be the UN secretary-general, who is travelling to Trinidad and Tobago specifically to listen to small island nations gathered at the summit on their climate concerns. India has championed the cause of small island nations and their strong plea to limit the rise of temperature to 1.5 degrees, which is expected to resonate at the summit, will inevitably have a bearing on Indias evolving position on Copenhagen.              
	Ban Ki-moons has been a constant and consistent voice in the efforts to reach a deal in Copenhagen. In December 2007, it was Ban who saved the climate talks in Bali by flying back to the talks he had left and then persuading the intransigent Bush administration at that time to capitulate on their disagreements on the floor of the conference. With his evangelical zeal on climate change from the day he became secretary-general, he has done for this issue at a multilateral level among heads of state and government what Al Gore, the former US vice president and winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, has done at the popular level. A fortnight ago, Ban headed to the US Capitol to secure support from the American Congress, which has a pending bill that actually limits what Obama can commit in Copenhagen even if he attends the conference there. Behind the scenes, Ban has been talking continuously to the big powers, including China, on the need to work out a consensus in Copenhagen.        
	He is now doing the same with developing countries. Of special interest to the prime minister, whose current mission in Washington is to create conditions for a second Green Revolution, is the secretary-generals statement to the UN general assembly plenary that there can be no food security without climate security. That may be yet another powerful argument for India to be more flexible in Copenhagen. After Singhs talks in Washington, and a realization that the tide is clearly turning towards agreement in Copenhagen, Indias position on climate change will be keenly watched in world capitals in the next fortnight.

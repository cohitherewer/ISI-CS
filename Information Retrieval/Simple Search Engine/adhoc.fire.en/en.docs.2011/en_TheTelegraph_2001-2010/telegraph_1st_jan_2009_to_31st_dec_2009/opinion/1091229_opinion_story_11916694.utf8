The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Clear danger, unclear deals
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        CLEAR DANGER, UNCLEAR DEALS                                  Even with its shortcomings, the Copenhagen Accord is a starting point for future commitments, writes Jayanta Bandyopadhyay                                            
	The spectrum of comments on the unexpected and dramatic end of the Copenhagen climate summit on December 19 is very wide. On a topic that is literally the burning issue facing the world, the countries taking part in the conference went home after taking note of the Copenhagen Accord  not a legally-binding document providing clear and time-bound national targets for reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. From the range of the comments made on this accord, the common people of the world are really unable to decide whether to celebrate the essential beginning of a new global agreement on climate change or to express anguish over an unproductive international jamboree attended by 193 nation-states.        
	Those who had their eyes and ears open in the weeks prior to the Copenhagen summit would not have expected the 12-day Conference of the Parties to deliver a legally-binding deal with clear time-bound steps for reducing global GHG emissions to ensure that the warming of the earths atmosphere does not exceed 1.5C above the pre-industrial level.        
	The world leaders were tied to respective national mandates, guided by related interests. This is a vital gap in the institutional capability of the present system, as a result of which diverse national interests reduced the scope and speed of decision-making in the negotiation in Copenhagen. To address the challenge of climate change, the world needs to take emergency measures for making drastic cuts in GHG emissions in a very short time.        
	Back home, Barack Obama has to accept the limit of 17 per cent GHG emission reduction by 2020 over 2005; Chinas Wen Jiabao, in spite of his country being the largest GHG emitter today, has to keep in mind its future domestic energy ambitions. The outcome of the November 2009 US-China summit was a clear indicator that the worlds two largest emitters have come closer. The non-governmental world wanted world leaders to wish away these real political limitations and make Copenhagen a great success by taking decisions that may be less realistic within the present structure of negotiations.        
	Results of international negotiations are always determined not by the level of urgency of the subject but by the lowest common denominator among the negotiating positions. Further, as in the case of COP15, an agreement had to be adopted by consensus, not by a majority in the house. A single country can raise objection to wordings or a resolution, stopping the entire negotiation process. China did so several times in Copenhagen.        
	The path to global solutions to global warming may not easily be found within a United Nations platform divided in nations. Yet, national sovereignty needs to be protected at international platforms, as the Indian prime minister has stressed repeatedly. The NGOs that have blamed world leaders for failing in Copenhagen need to be realistic, though their sensationalism has always contributed towards keeping the pressure on the leaders to walk in the right direction.        
	The procedure that led to the Copenhagen Accord was initiated by Obama and Jiabao. The United States of America and China together account for about 40 per cent of global GHG emissions. So it is not surprising that the accord is vague on a clear peaking time for GHG emissions or on a time-bound reduction. The accord was subsequently agreed upon by Brazil, India and South Africa to start with. Several other industrialized and developing countries joined in, some grudgingly. Thus, stage by stage, the accord was placed in the plenary, as the curtain came down on COP15. Finally, the president of the conference informed that the parties took note of the accord.        
	Obama should surely get the credit for traversing such an informal and innovative path. Hardly has any US president got so intensely involved in the negotiations in the past. This may be a genuine commitment to protecting the earth or for enlarging his own political image as a green leader, or both. However, China prepared the objective ground for the serious gaps in the Copenhagen Accord by opposing many important quantitative time-bound clauses. Credit should go to the other four countries, including India, which supported the draft accord and saved COP15. Accepting their global responsibility, these nations and China have also agreed to make voluntary cuts in their GHG emission intensity.        
	The process also deviated from the traditional dividing line for UN negotiations between the industrially advanced countries and the rest of the world. While the US was the lone industrialized or Annex-I country in the drafting of the accord, only four non-Annex-I countries were involved initially. While the disappointment of many European countries was expressed openly, the united block of developing countries became non-functional with high emitters like China and India going in favour of the accord. Many African and Latin American countries were upset with it. The European Union, with its commitment to the Kyoto Protocol, was left with little flexibility as opposed to the US. All this brought new alignments and groupings into existence.        
	The criticisms of the accord have focused on several points. Questions have been raised on the science of climate change and complaints publicly made of the misuse of data to fit the position of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. This is now known as the Climategate Scandal. While the accord refers to the science of climate change, it does not address these criticisms. In the interest of stronger scientific support to arrest global warming, this debate needs to be taken up, not set aside. The accord has also been criticized for its veiled promotion of CO2 trading and the possibility of huge volumes of carbon business shifting to the New York Stock Exchange from Europe. The third criticism is an old, but significant, one  that the accord uses the financial power of the industrialized countries through the Copenhagen Green Climate Fund, offering $30 billion between 2010-12 and $100 billion per year by 2020 for adaptation and technology transfer for mitigation in the developing countries. NGO critics describe this, together with CO2 trading, as a getaway mechanism for the US from making deep cuts into its own emission. Together with all its shortcomings and lack of quantitative fixation on several issues, the Copenhagen Accord is the available starting point for further measures.               
	But then, how many times will the world be given a starting point? It had one in Rio in 1992, another in Kyoto in 1997. The citizens of the world need to mount pressure on all countries to stop shifting the starting line and to get moving to arrive at a legally binding agreement in Mexico next year. The nations are many but humanity has only one earth to live in.

                                                                                                                 JUST A WORD                                                    
	Letting go is easier said than done. In the Centres troubled relationship with the premier institutes of technology and management, what autonomy really means is yet to be properly resolved. Teachers at the IITs, with growing support from the IIMs, have brought their protest against the governments new pay regime to the point of disruptiveness. The situation urgently needs to be thought through  not only for the sake of classes being conducted without interruption, but also as a matter of principle. Ever since the Union human resource development ministry got a new minister, there has been change in the air. That sense of movement and progress  with autonomy once again its buzzword  will turn out to be largely rhetorical if the issue of payments and funding is not settled once and for all. Kapil Sibal will have to confront the fact that a prestigious institution of higher education will never enjoy a real sense of being autonomous if its purse strings are controlled by the State  that is, if academics are made to feel that the valuation of their labour and quality are ultimately made by politicians and bureaucrats.        
	The sense of exciting new things about to happen in Mr Sibals ministry can become credible and real only if, together with the freedom to set and realize their own standards, the IITs and IIMs are also allowed to determine their own salaries and perquisites for the teachers. When it comes to money, the government can, at most, fix the floor, but the ceiling should only be determined by the market. And that is the only way in which these institutions could be made to trust the appearance of freedom that the Centre seems to be conjuring up for them. The teachers at the IITs are protesting against what they perceive and experience as a kind of disrespect. This feeling of being not properly valued can never be entirely dissociated from the question of pay and perks  the question of how the teachers are compensated for giving their best to these institutions. The IITs are plagued not only by vacancies but also by a constant exodus of teachers to better-paid jobs. Besides, these institutes also have to attract younger teachers before they opt for more lucrative opportunities abroad. On all these counts, and also for the sake of making these places truly autonomous, the Centre must extend its will to relinquish control to the monetary sphere as well.

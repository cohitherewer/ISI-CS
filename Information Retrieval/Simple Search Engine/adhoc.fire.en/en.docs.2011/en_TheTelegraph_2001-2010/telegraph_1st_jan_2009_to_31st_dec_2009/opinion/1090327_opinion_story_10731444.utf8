                                                                                                                 THIS LIVING HAND                                                               
	Mi Fu, the Chinese poet and calligrapher from the Sung dynasty, had written on silk in his exquisite brushwork, I desire neither honours nor wealth, but only the handwriting of the masters. Pedro Corra do Lago, president of the National Library of Brazil, presents 350 out of the 30,000 items in his personal collection of remarkable correspondence, documents and autographs spanning 800 years in TRUE TO THE LETTER (Thames amp; Hudson, 32). He quotes Mi Fu in his introduction while trying to convey the seductive power of autographs. Collecting these fragile bits of paper on which variously famous people, from medieval kings to the Beatles, have written in their own hand has about it a certain sweet fetishism, tinged perhaps with an element of indiscretion. Autographs, for do Lago, are much more than signatures of the famous; the items themselves, as well as the compulsion to look for, collect, preserve, study and share them, together make a work of art, erudition and love. And this love is crucial: there is a thrilling or moving intimacy in holding pieces of paper in ones hand that are often letters, densely revised drafts of novels, or even pages of personal accounts. This is a beautifully lavish book with reproductions of the highest quality, meticulous notes and transcriptions, and a preface by the historian, Carlo Ginzburg, that combines brevity with understated brilliance. Inviting the reader to look, read, think, feel, imagine, learn and connect in many idiosyncratic ways, the book is not for the coffee table. But a different kind of design and editing could easily have placed it there.        
	On the left is an unpublished, signed sketch of c.1980 by Fellini, drawn on the back of a page from a screenplay. The little figure on the right is perhaps a self-portrait, while the Felliniesque creature towering over him recalls the rumba-dancing Saraghina in 8. Top right is an envelope, signed in 1912 by Kafka, that carried a letter to his fiance, Felice Bauer. (Kafka meeting La Saraghina would be an encounter to dream of.) Below Kafka, a printed fragment from the American poet, Walt Whitman, is signed by the poet himself in 1890, beneath which, but in a sort of ascending order of virility from Kafka, Marlon Brando has signed his photograph, made by Bob Penn, in 1965; standing upright in the middle is Mao Zedong in 1960.        
	Reading, and actually holding, the authors or subjects writing alongside the printed word or photograph on material as delicate as paper creates a curious sense of presence-in-absence that Ginzburg calls the shock of the autograph: it reminds us that behind the immateriality of the content, which guarantees its reproducibility, there exists (or existed) the real bodies of men and women.                    AVEEK SEN

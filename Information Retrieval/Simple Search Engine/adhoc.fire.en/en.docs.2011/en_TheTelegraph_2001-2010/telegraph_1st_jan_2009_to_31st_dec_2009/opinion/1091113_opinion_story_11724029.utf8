	Speak not                  
	Sir  November 9, 2009, will be remembered as a black day for the Maharashtra assembly (Language lunacy in Maharashtra Assembly, Nov 10). Four members of the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena slapped and manhandled Abu Asim Azmi of the Samajwadi Party for taking oath in Hindi and not in Marathi. It was a shameful incident, and unconstitutional in every respect. The so-called guardians of Marathi pride, the members of the MNS, were bound to do such a thing sooner or later on being elected to the House.          
	It seems strange that a person cannot exercise the privileges given to him by the Constitution of India and has to comply with the diktats issued by a political leader, in this case Raj Thackeray, the leader of the MNS. Thackeray has learnt the art of divisive politics from his uncle, Bal Thackeray, very well and is hell-bent on creating a linguistic divide in the state as well as in the country. Such a policy of alienating Maharashtrians from the non-Marathis is extremely harmful for the country and its people.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
B. Srinivasan, Jamshedpur 

                
	Sir  The attack on Abu Azmi of the Samajwadi Party by the MNS inside the assembly is a shameful act. It is shocking, and an outrage to the dignity of an individual. The behaviour of the four MNS members has violated the sanctity of the assembly. It shows that our politicians are growing more and more obsessive and intolerant. They must realize that dividing people along linguistic, casteist or religious lines is a recipe for calamity.          
	Sometimes it seems that Raj Thackeray has formed the MNS with the lone purpose of unleashing violence by raising incendiary issues. To force an elected representative to take oath only in Marathi is to deprive him of his rights. Azmi has done nothing wrong by taking oath in Hindi as it is our national language. Diversity is an important feature of our country. If incidents such as this are not dealt with firmly, society will eventually disintegrate. One feels that the Supreme Court should step in and punish all those involved in the despicable incident.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Vinod C. Dixit, Ahmedabad 

                
	Sir  The behaviour of the MNS legislators inside the Maharashtra assembly is appalling. There is no reason to believe that the people of Maharashtra have any sympathy for parties that operate on the principle of violence, hatred and anarchy. The events, if not punished, will set an unpardonable precedent. The national parties should come forward and condemn this episode strongly so that similar incidents do not happen in future.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Mohammed Sadullah Khan,Riyadh, Saudi Arabia               
	Sir  The ignominious display of violence in the Maharashtra assembly yet again highlighted the pitiful state of affairs on the Indian political front. Ruckus in the assembly is an age-old occurrence in India. However, such hostility has been limited to verbal spats, hurling objects at each other, and wrecking furniture until the day when the MNS broke all barriers and ended up slapping and kicking Abu Azmi for no more than a linguistic reason. Azmi had preferred Hindi over Marathi for taking the oath in a bid to exert his right. But freedom, it seems, has taken a backseat in Indian politics, where violence and authoritarianism are beginning to reign supreme.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Abhirup Bhunia, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  The pandemonium that broke out in the Maharashtra assembly calls for stringent disciplinary action against the erring members of legislative assembly. On the very first day of the new session of the assembly, the MNS has played its old card of disruptive and provincial politicking to set a new low in Indian politics. Physical assault on a member for taking oath in Hindi is just ridiculous. How a person can insult the Marathi language by speaking in Hindi is beyond the comprehension of a sane mind. Linguistic chauvinism is a reflection of ideological degeneration, and if it is not curbed at the root, the results could be disastrous for the nation.          
	India has always been more of a cohesion of states rather than a nation. Almost every Indian citizen tends to identify himself or herself with a particular region or language or community. Politicians have made the best of this divide by manipulating the masses to reap petty benefits. The people involved in the scuffle in the Maharashtra assembly, be it the assaulters or the assaulted, have used this controversy to exploit both the Marathi Manoos  and the Rashtra bhasha ka apmaan sentiments.          
	Politicians, cutting across party lines, are now trying to grab the mike one after the other to condemn the act. But this is not likely to achieve any result other than setting the stage for more of such mud-slinging matches. The government and the judiciary should ban such outfits as the MNS which never play a constructive role in nation-building. They should enact a legislation by which those indulging in violence in the Parliament or the assembly will not be admitted inside, or to any political party under any circumstance.                    
	Yours faithfully,

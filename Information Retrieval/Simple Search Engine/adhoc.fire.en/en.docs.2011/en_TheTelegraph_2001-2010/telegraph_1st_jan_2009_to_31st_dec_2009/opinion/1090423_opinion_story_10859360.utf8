                                                                                                                 LAST PUSH                                                    
	The notional ceasefire over, the Sri Lankan government has begun its final push into rebel territory, which is also a no-fire zone and now all of 17 square kilometres. The liberation of several thousand Tamils, made possible by the breach of a bund by government troops, lifts the curtain on this crucial phase that is expected to end in a bloodbath. Notwithstanding the massive exodus, it is unlikely that the area will be completely evacuated before the army closes in on the remaining members of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, who, on their part, will ensure that the civilian toll is high enough to strip their adversary of all moral cover. Apprehension over the impending humanitarian crisis is being reflected worldwide in the diplomatic overdrive among nations and in public protests away from Sri Lankan soil. In Tamil Nadu, the situation has triggered a political turmoil. The willingness to separate the fate of the unarmed civilian population from that of its armed protectors-turned-killers, the Tamil Tigers, is all but gone. The chief minister has dumped his political charade to identify the leader of the terrorist organization as his friend, and expressed his regret for any event that may end his life. His government has called for a 12-hour strike in the state today, and it seems that pressure from his opponents may provoke him to do more than just wail and weep for Sri Lankas Tamil brethren.         
	This confusion of support  the rebels or the people  has allowed Sri Lanka to qualify its rejection of assistance from neighbours and Western countries with its expressed suspicion of intentions. Meanwhile, apprehension about how a show of concern would be perceived has made nations like Canada and Norway dither in their condemnation of events in the country. There can be little doubt that the governments role in the crisis in Sri Lanka has been far from satisfactory. It has no excuse to act with the same disregard for the population that the rebels have shown. Terrorists are not accountable, but governments are. What world opinion, including that in Tamil Nadu, should press for is greater accountability and transparency of the government regarding the Tamils welfare, both those fleeing the crossfire and those in the inscrutable welfare villages, greater involvement of international aid workers, and, of course, greater political commitment.

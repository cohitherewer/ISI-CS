	They still wear the pants                  
	Sir  Womens Day celebrations are a mockery in India. Here the womens reservation bill is still stuck in Parliament, while the number of women contesting the elections is minuscule. Most parties are unwilling to accommodate women in their hierarchy. To disguise their misogyny and their patriarchal attitude, parties take up welfare programmes for women. But gender discrimination cannot be obscured by the induction of a few women in the cabinet, where they are forced to side with their male colleagues in order to survive.

	Different strokes          
	Sir  The views expressed in the editorial, Matching up (March 9), regarding security conditions during the Lok Sabha elections and the Indian Premier League matches are worth considering. The recent hullabaloo over security in India after the attack on Sri Lankan cricketers in Pakistan is a little too much. The IPL matches are a source of entertainment for many thousands of Indians as well as others. Yet they were on the brink of postponement or even cancellation this year because their dates clash with those of the general elections.           
	The various suggestions put forth in the editorial, if implemented, would not only make the election process easier but would also enable more security to be assigned to overseas as well as Indian players in the IPL. So our Election Commission should consider some changes in the election process instead of asking for security.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Pritam Kumar Paul, Calcutta

                
	Sir  From cricketers to politicians, everyone is thinking about the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections. The government does not want IPL matches during election time because it has two problems. One, people would be more interested in watching cricket than going to vote; two, the government does not have enough security personnel to cover both the elections as well as the IPL matches if they fall on the same days.          
	The Election Commission should advocate the use of advanced technologies for voting in order to to solve such problems. But there are many hurdles on the way. The biggest hurdle to the use of advanced technologies is that a large number of people in our country are illiterate and they may not be able to use such technology.           
	Another problem is that the EC cannot always ensure the use of advanced technology in remote villages or in areas where there is no electricity and no strong communication link. The EC should evolve a plan by which both urban and rural voters can use their franchise according to their opinion and to their own benefit, and without any fear.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Md. Maksud Alam, Burdwan

                
	Sir  The Union home minister has requested that the IPL matches be postponed since the government cannot provide the players with security because of the Lok Sabha elections. And Lalit Modi seemed to be doing everyone a favour when he conceded that there would be no matches on polling and counting days.          
	Central and state governments should withdraw security for all matches to be played in April and May as voters security is more important. The IPL teams are owned by industrial magnates and film stars who earn huge profits from these matches. They can afford private security for the players. Only the owners of, and players in, the IPL teams are gainers while the people are actually losers, paying hefty amounts to watch 40-over matches. Let us get our priorities straight and act tough with the Board of Control for Cricket in India.          
	Yours faithfully,

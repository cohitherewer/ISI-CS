The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | three surprises
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        THREE SURPRISES                                                    
	When it comes to statistics, it is often easy to confuse numbers with facts. The Central Statistical Organization sprang a surprise on most people with the July-September quarterly GDP figures that showed the economy grew by an annualized 7.9 per cent. But before jumping for joy at reversing the economic slowdown, the numbers demand a closer look. There were, in fact, three surprises: one, agriculture, which was expected to show negative growth, actually grew by 11 per cent; two, the extent of government spending  GDP estimates are based on expenditure  which grew at nearly 27 per cent (compared to 10.2 per cent in the April-June quarter), raised many eyebrows; and three, services grew by 9.3 per cent against expectations of less than 7 per cent growth. Many analysts are cheered by the growth in personal consumption expenditure, which grew by 5.6 per cent against 1.6 per cent in the previous quarter. Investment was also up; gross capital formation grew by 7.3 per cent. The numbers also have some sobering reality checks; if not for the growth in government expenditure, growth in this second quarter at 4.9 per cent would have been lower than that in the first quarter (5.5 per cent). Despite the pick-up in investment demand, bank credit growth  which should be financing this growth  remains muted.         
	The CSO reports that there has been a decline in inventories or destocking. Yet, the Reserve Bank of Indias Business Conditions Survey as well as Dun amp; Bradstreets Business Expectations Index, and even the Purchase Managers Index, all indicate inventory restocking. The other area to be watched is statistical discrepancies: quarterly GDP estimates are based on expenditure or consumption, and they will vary with the income side. The difference between the two is included as discrepancies, which, for this quarter, was a very high negative 5.4 per cent, compared to 1.5 per cent on average. The discrepancies are sorted out when revisions are made later, and the amounts redistributed under the correct accounting heads. The bigger the discrepancy, the more uncertain the policy response.         
	In this instance, government officials have indicated that the stimulus will continue for the next two quarters. Many worry whether the RBI will begin to tighten liquidity  which is correcting already  through an increase in reserve requirements, leading to higher interest rates. Others worry that the return to fiscal prudence means the stimulus could be withdrawn before its objectives and benefits have been fully realized. It has been said that surprises are pleasant when they are expected. The latest GDP numbers are an unexpected surprise, and it is not clear that it is a pleasant one.

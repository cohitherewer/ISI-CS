	Fire in the haven                  
	Sir  That something was wrong with the land dealings of the Vedic Village had been suspected for a long time (Haul of guns and goons in resort, Aug 25). Still, it is surprising that so many shady details came out only a few hours after part of the resort was burnt down. Investigative journalism could have unearthed the stash of arms as well as the involvement of Gaffar Mollah  part of a land mafia that had connections with the Vedic Village  earlier, and so could have prevented the arson and vandalism which came as a backlash to Mollahs men killing a young man in a shootout.          
	The home secretarys response that people did not like the takeover of land at gunpoint leaves one stunned. Did he unearth this fact on the very day of the mishap? If it is true that the local people had complained to the authorities earlier about Mollahs strong-arm tactics to wrench land off unwilling sellers, then the government, by sitting idle on the matter, has neglected its duty. This is one of the reasons why the administrators of West Bengal are not trusted or respected any more.           
	One cannot avoid the suspicion that some members of the administration were in cahoots with the resort owners and with Mollahs gang. Arms have been found inside a guarded area. If the owners and the manager cannot explain how these came to be there, they must be duly prosecuted. If, however, the law decides to side with the rich and well-connected, the common people can only resort to violence to defend themselves.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The Gaffar Mollahs of society are ultimately the products of those at the helm of the administrative system. While the police unearthing a cache of arms from within the compound of the Vedic Village is a matter of great concern for the people of the state, it would not be wrong to suspect that such illegal hoarding of arms is common throughout West Bengal. A growing number of promoters run their illegal businesses with the help of criminals such as Gaffar Mollah. Nobody can dare touch them because they have always enjoyed the tacit support of the local political leaders of almost all parties across the state, especially that of the ruling one.          
	When the state home secretary, Ardhendu Sen, states unhesitatingly that land was being purchased at gunpoint for the project and local people didnt like that, it makes one infer that the state authorities were well aware that many other ruffians such as Mollah have been operating unlawfully in various parts of the state. The likelihood of illegal arsenals being present throughout the state is disquieting. Considering the increasing use of bombs and firearms by miscreants reported in recent times, the state authorities should take special initiatives to dig out the arsenals and the source of their supply. Perhaps the political stalwarts cannot implement the law because they know that they cannot call the shots without the help of the disreputable elements. Politicians may deny their association with, and patronage of, criminals, but they cannot deny that the police have failed in their job.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Wheeling and dealing with hooligans inevitably boomerangs. The Vedic Village authorities must have acquired the land and set up the resort with Gaffar Mollahs help. They have claimed that they had good relations with the local people. However, allegations of these same people against Mollahs extortionist methods to buy land at less than the going rate for the project point to the contrary. The Vedic Village promoters have paid dearly for doing business with a criminal.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Should we be surprised at the vandalism in Vedic Village? We hear of such incidents all too often in West Bengal. Bengalis, in general, seem to enjoy going on burning sprees, their favourite targets being vehicles. Although usually amiable, Bengalis turn violent when they come together as a mob. The state is turning anarchic, with no sign of change in sight.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  It is a common practice of Indian manufacturers and retailers to advertise free gifts to consumers as part of their promotional campaigns. Most of the time, the consumers are taken for a ride by dishonest business houses. A clever interpretation of rules results in the promised gifts not reaching their rightful claimants.The government should set up a watchdog under the ministry of commerce to protect the public from such dishonest trade practices.                    
	Yours faithfully,

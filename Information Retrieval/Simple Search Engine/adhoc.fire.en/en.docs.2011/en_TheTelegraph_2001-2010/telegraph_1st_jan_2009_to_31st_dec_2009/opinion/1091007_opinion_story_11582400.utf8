                                                                                                                 RAW NERVE                                                    
	The suggestion of the Tamil Nadu chief minister, M. Karunanidhi, that Sri Lankan Tamil refugees in India be granted citizenship has touched a raw nerve. Mr Karunanidhi has not only been accused of borrowing ideas, but also charged with undermining the Sri Lankan Tamil cause. Any move towards a permanent settlement of Sri Lankan Tamils in India, it is being argued, would weaken the cause for Tamil nationalism and encourage Sri Lanka to push more Tamils out of its territory. The political party arguing this idea most forcefully is the Bharatiya Janata Party. Given its troubled engagement with the subject of refugees, the BJPs reaction is expected. Less so that of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, whose leader, J. Jayalalithaa, had stridently espoused the cause of the Sri Lankan Tamils in the last elections. Ms Jayalalithaa writes off Mr Karunanidhis suggestion as another of his diabolical plans. She also raises the question of the status of the other refugees in India  the Tibetans, the Myanmarese and the Bangladeshis. The AIADMK leader fears that these peoples too may claim citizenship if Sri Lankan Tamils are granted such rights in India.         
	It is typical of the nature of politics that such a large humanitarian issue as the welfare and wellbeing of displaced populations should be reduced to a narrow contest between rival politicians. It is impossible to dismiss entirely Ms Jayalalithaas fears of the refugee issue being manipulated by the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam to suit its purpose. In West Bengal, the ruling Left has successfully combined refugee welfare with a vote-enhancing gambit. It is perhaps this, and not so much the aggrandizing of the Tibetans, Myanmarese and Bangladeshis, that bothers Ms Jayalalithaa. But like her, many others refuse to see that it is not the helplessly uprooted people, but electoral politics that complicates the Indian demography. The settlement, or lack of it, of Sri Lankan Tamils in India should be treated as an issue different from the resettlement of the internally displaced people within Sri Lanka. In any case, the delay in Sri Lanka over IDPs should not be regarded as sufficient reason for India to confine people in tin shacks. Mr Karunanidhis suggestion, however impractical, should be treated as a way of returning to the difficult and much-reviled question of how to define and treat refugees on Indian soil.

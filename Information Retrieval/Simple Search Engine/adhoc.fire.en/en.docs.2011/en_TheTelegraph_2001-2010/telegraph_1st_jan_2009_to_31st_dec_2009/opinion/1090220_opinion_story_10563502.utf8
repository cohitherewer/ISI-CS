The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Waiting for the uncommon publisher
                                                                                                                 WAITING FOR THE UNCOMMON PUBLISHER                              Bookwise                         Call the shots				                           
	For educational and non-fictional books, publishers want authors to write what people want to read rather than what the writers believe in. You could say this too for mass-market fiction, which thrives on the formula mix of sex, violence and glitz. What this means is that serious studies for the uncommon reader have a low priority in publishing programmes and that the potential market determines what gets published at all.        
	Thats not all. It also means that hack writers who are prepared to follow what the publishers want have a much greater chance of acceptance than the serious writers. So the latter have little option except to do it alone, that is, to put in their money to get published, or to post their works on the internet.         
	But this isnt the same thing as a printed book that is published on its merits. It doesnt do much credit to the publishers, who end up publishing works of turgid scholarship for the sake of a quick buck; or to the authors who dont get the professional mileage they deserve to for all the work they have done.         
	Hence the question: to what extent should an author acquiesce to the dictates of a publisher that come as guidelines, which is really a euphemism for you do what we want you to do, or go some place else? These guidelines are spelt out in great detail  the subject matter, for whom the book is meant, the word count and in many cases, the vocabulary range, usually within 10,000 words of the most frequently used words. Authors are put into a virtual straitjacket and any deviation from the prescribed norms means revision or even rejection. Should the author acquiesce?        
	Look at the problem from the point of view of the author and publisher before you decide on the pros and cons.         
	First, the author. All authors are passionately involved with their works and want them to get published. It isnt a question of money alone because each honestly believes that his is the only work of its kind and its dissemination would do his small world some good. Therefore, he acts in either of these two ways: pays for the publication of the book or makes marginal concessions, either by cutting down the size of the manuscript or adding a chapter or two to enlarge the scope of readership. But whichever way, the author foots the bill.         
	But while this is true for many first-time authors, it need not be so for well-established writers who can always call the shots. Indeed, the reverse could be true: publishers would go to any length to get such authors on their list: their fame alone would bring in increased profits.         
	For publishers, the logic is simple: they must make money, and quick money at that. Well-known authors would be preferred, but the not so well-known would do, provided they follow the brief and promise to deliver on time.         
	Since publishers wont change their spots, what should the author do to ensure that his best work doesnt get compromised by the demands of the market? He can continue to publish smaller pieces in scholarly journals and wait for the publisher to turn up at his doorstep. He will come, because publishers too are desperate for a good copy.

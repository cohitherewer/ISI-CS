	The Oxford Illustrated Companion to South Indian Classical Music By Ludwig Pesch, Oxford, Rs 1,950        
	At the core of the Carnatic music tradition, lies the repertory, a dense web of compositions, primarily in Telugu and Sanskrit, but also in Tamil, by composers great and small, often driven by the religious impulse. Several kinds of composition are identified and valued  varnam, kriti, padam, javali and tillana, for instance. The best-known are the kritis of the Trinity  Syama Sastri, Tyagaraja and Muthuswami Dikshitar, formidable poet-musicians who lived in the Kaveri region at the turn of the 18th/19th centuries.        
	As the tradition grew, several musical techniques were refined, including alapana, tanam, swaraprasthara and neraval. The tradition encouraged, indeed needed, several categories of skills. There were composers and performers, vocalists, instrumentalists and percussionists, teachers and patrons. Since the beginning of the 20th century, there has been considerable diversity in the development of the form, but for many reasons, mainly to do with the perceived wordiness of a Carnatic performance, there has been an inadequate understanding of the tradition outside the south of India. Ludwig Peschs The Oxford Illustrated Companion to South Indian Classical Music is a welcome effort at addressing this lack.        
	This is not indeed the first such attempt. Pesch himself published The Illustrated Companion to South Indian Classical Music in 1999, and the present work is a substantially enlarged version of what was itself a fine introduction. Other authors come to mind. R. Rangaramanuja Ayyangars History of South Indian (Carnatic) Music (1972) was ambitious in scope but highly opinionated. More recently, we have had Visions, a lavish coffee-table book by the vocalists, T.M. Krishna and Bombay Jayashri; but the book only demonstrates that vast musical gifts do not necessarily make for meaningful writing. The Chennai-based magazine, Sruti, has, over the last 25 years and more, built up a bank of information but much of it is still inaccessible to the uninitiated. Lakshmi Subramaniams writings, careful and well-researched, are for the expert reader. In this situation, Peschs sumptuous Illustrated Companion is a delight.        
	This volume follows the same outline as the 1999 edition, and most of the chapters bear the same titles. However, there is enormously more detail. The description of musical forms is well done, as is a very fine discussion of concert patterns. Likewise, the discussion on the major instruments used in a Carnatic concert. There is an extended discussion of the system of 72 scales and of derived ragas. However, this discussion would be most useful for readers familiar with staff notation. The alphabetical list of ragas would have been enhanced by the inclusion of arohanas and avarohanas, a task done exceedingly well by Pesch himself in the first version of his Ragadhana, published in the early 1980s. There is also an excellent bibliography as well as a detailed index.        
	As is necessary in a companion to South Indian music, there are detailed lists of musicians and composers. The notes on composers are particularly well written, as the one on the Trinity, where all the relevant details are succinctly and intelligently given. The first edition listed Music Scholars; this useful category has been subsumed in the present edition in the index of names. Among musicians, there are separate lists for male and female singers and performers of the vina, violin, flute, mridanga, ghata, chitravina, mandolin and nagaswaram, as well as less-known instruments. This is useful but, as in any attempt to list and describe, there are problems.         
	Pesch is careful not to express personal opinions or indicate favourites. Even so, it should have been possible for the entry against any name to indicate the relative importance of that personality in the wider context. A reference to honours received, such as Sangitha Kalanidhi or Padma Vibhushan and Bharat Ratna, would have helped. The list of women vocalists includes several who are totally unknown. At the same time, great musicians are given short shrift. For K.R. Syama to get more space than D.K. Pattammal (picture) is unacceptable. More scandalous is the one line entry for the vainika, E. Gaayathri (not E. Gayatri, as published), describing her as a disciple of T.M. Thyagarajan. This is not accurate, as the artist always describes herself as her fathers student. More to the point, Gaayathri is one of the greatest artists of her generation.        
	There are other minor errors. Srirangam Gopalaratnam, who was a very well-known Andhra female vocalist, is listed as a male composer. Justice T.L. Venkatarama Iyer was not primarily a vocalist. The chronological list of male vocalists begins with a singer born in 1815, but does not include the legendary Madurai Pushpavanam Iyer. And it is odd, and not a little sad, that though there is a category of women singing together, there is no reference at all to Radha and Jayalakshmi, a hugely popular duo in the 1960s and 1970s.        
	One instance where Pesch does indeed express an opinion is in the discussion on women singers. He observes that a fundamental change in the conditions under which women sang in public was not achieved until the family of Vina Dhanammal and her descendants began to assert its proper place in Carnatic music. As Pesch is doubtless aware, there is a lively debate on the nature and importance of the Dhanammal bani, with aggressive proponents of the belief that a hereditary tradition of musical learning is the only true tradition. He would have done well not to enter into this debate for, apart from anything else, he is not quite correct. Dhanammal has had enormous influence, more since her death than in her lifetime, and she is remembered for her insistence on preserving the sanctity of tradition. But she did not really pave the way for women artists. That distinction belongs, as Pesch himself notes, to Subbulakshmi, Pattammal and Vasanthakumari, all of them singers of great presence and awesome ability. This is a book to be owned and cherished. One regrets that it is so steeply priced.                          KESHAV DESIRAJU

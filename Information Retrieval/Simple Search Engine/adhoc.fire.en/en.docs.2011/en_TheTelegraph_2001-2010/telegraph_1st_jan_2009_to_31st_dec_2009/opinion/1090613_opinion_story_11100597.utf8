The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | The discovery of an unknown genius
                                                                                                                 THE DISCOVERY OF AN UNKNOWN GENIUS                                  MUSIC: Nilaksha Gupta                                                  
	Vijay Kichlu has an illustrious record of locating and presenting relatively unknown singers who floor you the moment they hit the first note. This is what he did at A Bandish Bhaithak presented by his Sangeet Ashram at the G.D. Birla Sabhagar on April 17. The singer in question was the elderly Ustad Amir Mohammed Khan of Jaipur (picture). He sang compositions of both the Agra and the Patiala gharanas: something rather rare in itself. On top of this, he even at times succeeded in presenting a blend of Agra and Patiala styles which, at least theoretically, has always seemed impossible. On the lighter side, at a time when many self-declared ustads or pandits try to look like rock stars, the khan sahab looked every inch the ustad of the old as well.        
	He started off with a slow teental khayal in a rare raga called Dhanashri (not to be confused with Puria Dhanashri) and that too of the Khammaj thhaat (S R G M P D n) variety. His phrase elaboration was full of old-world melodic fun arising out of a blend of Agra and Patiala styles: a thing rather impossible even in hypothesis. The raga loosely resembled raga Gaoti, popularized by Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan. But it contained phrases like Sa Re Ga not used in Gaoti and the shuddh nishad (natural 7th) in the movement to the high tonic (Pa ni `Sa). The fast medium teental khayal in Dhanashri was also charming, and so were the jhaptal and ada chautal compositions in Sughrai, the Patiala-style Jaijawanti with a minimal use of the komal gandhar (flat 3rd), and the rupak tala composition in Nand Kalyan that omitted the Nand tivra madhyam (sharp 4th) and added the Ga Ma Pa Ga Ma Re and Pa Dha Ni Pa Dha Ma Pa Ga phrases to the more familiar raga.        
	As if this was not enough to keep people like me crouched forward like slip fielders, the ustad went on to reel out multiple compositions in the tough old raga Kshat, raga Shukla Bilawal, Kaunsi Kanada (Agra), Khambavati Kanada, Patdeep, Patdeepki and Pradeepki. Unusual compositions like one using all the 12 notes, another mixing solfa and words, and one in Mishra Jhinhoti were sung with dexterity towards the end. The final item, a thumri in Manjh Khammaj, threw up masterly bol-banao of a class no longer heard nowadays. Zafar Mohammed Khans tabla accompaniment fitted the ustads music like a glove.        
	The artist of the first half was Mohammed Syed Khan, a member of the fabulous khayal duo called Khan Bandhu, who relocated to Canada long ago. Sons of the great Kesarbai Kerkars sarangi accompanist, the Khan Bandhu used to be the most exciting khayal duo in recent times. Syed Khan, however, merely sang a selection of the 238 asthayis and antaras that are in a CD which comes with his book Sungon, and explained the meaning of the lyrics.        
	He did not condescend to present any of them as brief khayals. As a result, his performance never assumed the nature of a khayal recital. Mere compositions, however good they may be, when reeled off in the bare asthayi-antara format, are merely informative and not really enjoyable. Had I known it would be like this, I would have skipped the first half. And I find no point in buying the book for the CD since it is unlikely to be any better than the live recital. For the record, here is a list of the compositions that were sung:         
	I. Sawani Kalyan: vilambit teental, E daiya badi baat mae na janu. Jait Kalyan vilambit teental. Jait Shree, vilambit teental, Jabase piu sapaname ai. Lalita Gauri, vilambit teental, Preetam saiya. II. Kanada-ke Prakar: Ahir Kanada, Nayaki Kanada, Kafi Kanada. III. Drut khayals by Komal Shyam: Adana, Gaud Malhar. IV. Drut khayals and taranas by several composers: Gaud Malhar khayal by Bahadur Shah Zafar (pen-name Aeshokaram), Piharaba aja nahi aye. Gaud Malhar Khayal by Mian Achpal, Jo jo bijari chamakay, Brindabani Sarang tarana in madhya drut teental deploying three measures: 4, 3 and 8 by Bahadur Hussain, sursringar maestro, who was described as the guru of Ustad Wazir Khan, beenkar. Hussain was the guru of the Rampur Nawab Hamid Ali Khans brother, Hyder Hussain, who taught Wazir Khan. V. Rarities like a Kafi Khayal in addha tala and one in pancham sawari tala.        
	After this, Ustad Amir Mohammed Khans superb recital was like a welcome shower on parched land.

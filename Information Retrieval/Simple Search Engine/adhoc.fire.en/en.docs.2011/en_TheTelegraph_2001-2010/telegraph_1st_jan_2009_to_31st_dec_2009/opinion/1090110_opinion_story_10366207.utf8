The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | No children to devour
                                                                                                                 NO CHILDREN TO DEVOUR                          - The auto is safe as long as mobs reign instead of the law        Sunanda K. Datta-Ray                                                          
	It wont be as easy getting to Kalighat or Jatin Das Park station if autorickshaws disappear or are immobilized. I can take a taxi, but if extra time and cost dont matter, I might as well do so for the entire journey. Besides, I enjoy the adventure of careering recklessly through the streets, perched perilously on the left of a daredevil driver (I draw the line at the right-hand non-seat), clinging to the bar above, an acrid smell in my nostrils. With apologies to Gopal Gandhi, Calcuttas broken pavements, potholes, odorous heaps of garbage, crowded roadside stalls, disorderly traffic, jay-walkers and buses listing heavily as they belch black clouds are probably just as dangerous as toxic katatel. As I waited at the Gariahat-Rashbehari crossing one day, an auto rode over my shod foot. I might as well be in it than under it.        
	There may be no reason for anxiety since, despite Fridays court proceedings, the Communist Party of India (Marxist), the Trinamul Congress and the Congress all want autos to stay. Thats political solidarity. But with Lok Sabha elections looming ahead, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee cannot afford Mamata Banerjees candour. Refusing to be left out of the competition to claim the gratitude of voting wage-earners, Subrata Mukherjee, too, rushed to declare he cannot accept auto drivers being deprived of their livelihood. Judges are green indeed if they imagine they can ride roughshod over these representatives of the sovereign people. There are ways of saying no that are beyond the ken of courts or the usual redundant politicians shunted into raj bhavans. In those years when power cuts lasted a sizzling 12 hours or more, the chief minister decided one fine day to delink the electricity connection to a block of flats, where civil servants lived, from the emergency service that meant immunity from load-shedding. Dont worry, well lose the file! cheerfully promised a bright young bureaucrat who has since gone places at the Centre.               
	Of course, Gandhi isnt the common-or-garden governor. Having been a civil servant himself, he understands the bureaucratese of the home secretarys promise to implement the ban in a low key manner. Speech, as Talleyrand said, was given to man to disguise his thoughts. When Britain invaded Egypt in 1956, Anthony Eden announced that far from being at war, the two countries were only in a state of armed conflict. Hiroshima and Nagasaki did not defeat Japan, according to Hirohitos famous broadcast; they merely meant the war situation has developed not necessarily to Japans advantage. A country that has banished famine (weve had only scarcity for several decades), transformed the poor into the weaker sections and upgraded the lowest castes to children of god and then, when Harijan turned out to be a colossal faux pas, into Dalits, needs no lessons in semantic jugglery.         
	Two-stroke three-wheelers being now in a state of suspended animation, the government will hasten slowly in driving them from the streets. Low-key banishment need not prevent the motor vehicles department continuing to register them. Nor can the MVD be blamed for clandestine additions to the fleet of 30,000 illegal autos. The environment departments notifications  never mind if they are ignored  bear out the governments concern. No one has said yet, as was reported of unlicensed rickshaws, that they are the benami property of policemen.        
	If the argument hots up, theres always the fall-back mob which needs no reason to go on the rampage. As I have written elsewhere, the civil unrest and economic abuses that discourage foreign investors can be traced to World War II. Hoarding, speculation, corruption and black-marketing are part of the legacy. So is anti-authority protest, epitomized by the catchy jingle of my childhood, Sarkar ki mal, pani me dal. No one has told the mobs that the sarkar is now theirs. The indiscipline that was patriotic has become a lifestyle; so have civil disobedience and passive resistance which seldom remains passive.         
	I read recently that Padamji Ginwala, Opposition chief whip in the old central legislative assembly, withdrew from politics because he did not think it wise to encourage people to break a law of which they disapproved as the ultimate result would be lawlessness and disrespect for all laws. Walter Crocker, an Australian who had known India as soldier and diplomat and who wrote a perceptive account of India and Jawaharlal Nehru whom he knew well, was more scathing. In order to sabotage the British government the nationalist agitators ended up by sabotaging government itself. It was they who called in the mob, that terrible monster of modern India; who made it passable for students  students in north India become at times a part of the mob  not to pay railway fares and to commit arson. Crocker warned in 1964, The nationalist agitators sowed the wind; India is now beginning to reap the whirlwind. What that dire harvest portends no man can be sure.         
	Distractions like the Satyam fraud and the Mumbai attack prevent us from coming to grips with the full impact of that dire harvest. Our politicians mobilize mobs at the drop of a hat. Nandigram and Singur are only the latest instances of mobs overriding good sense. Its as if the convulsions of Chinas Cultural Revolution went on and on long after Zhou Enlai and Mao Zedong were dead and the Gang of Four liquidated, so that Deng Xiaoping had no chance of ushering in his socialist modernization. Attitudes and values havent changed in India. When I asked Jack Praeger, the street doctor and founder of Calcutta Rescue, at the beginning of his stay here why he didnt get a long-term visa or work permit instead of running foul of the authorities each time, he reeled off the names of swadeshi heroes to claim Indians didnt take people seriously until they had done a stint inside. What todays legislators go to jail for is another matter. Jail, like rallies, processions, bus burnings, strikes, bandhs and arrests, remains the stuff of political life.               
	So Biman Bose was overlooking a large chunk of our history when he spoke derisively of Mamata Banerjees perverted culture. It may be perverted by any objective standard but is the norm for Indian politics. Jyoti Basu, with his superior knowledge and understanding, reportedly told her she is doing now what the Left Front constituents did in the late Sixties. They did, indeed, and with such drastic effect that despite Bhattacharjees efforts, West Bengal still hasnt recovered.        
	None of this is to deny that autos are a menace. They are a health hazard, as the governor says. They are a traffic hazard. The British journalist who wrote in 1971 that instead of invading East Pakistan, India should send in a fleet of mini-buses to terrorize the Pakistani army would applaud the autos equal, if not greater, power of intimidation. But as with hawkers, no institution that provides an impoverished people with a livelihood and also caters to a public need can summarily be abolished. As noted before in these columns, Singapore did not get rid of its mendicant traders by waving a magic wand. It licensed hawkers; imposed conditions like banning the sale of cooked food without running water and electricity; and provided compulsory alternative outlets in the form of the hawker centres and food courts that are such a popular feature today of the city-state. Even more important, laws are enforced: there is no question of bribing policemen or politicians to get round them.         
	Thats why I dont fear too much for my favourite form of transport. Its Bolshie cheekiness is quintessentially Bengali, which gives autos a certain resilience. They may damage lungs, heart, kidneys, eyes and throat, but they know therell be a Bangla Bandh if they are touched. And Citu will again support Trinamul. Inquilab Zindabad! Even without children to devour, the revolution goes on.

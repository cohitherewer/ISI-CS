The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | killer boys
                                                                                                                 KILLER BOYS                                                    
	They could not have been Maoists or any other kind of political activists for that matter. And it is difficult to imagine such young boys as killers  even in the name of a violent political ideology. But the Maoists use of young boys to kill political opponents in the rebel stronghold of Lalgarh should worry not just the West Bengal government or political activists but all who value freedom and sanity. That Maoists or other political extremists enlist children in their ranks was not unknown. The Tamil Tigers, the Khmer Rouge and several African militias did so in the past. The Maoists in neighbouring Nepal are known to have used young boys and girls in their guerrilla warfare before they settled for peace and democratic politics. The killing of a local leader of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) by a squad of Maoist boys, some of whom looked no older than 14, shows how much bigger the threat has become. But it also underscores the utter failure of the state government to tackle it. It has now been more than three months that paramilitary forces of the Centre and the state police are jointly fighting the Maoists in the Lalgarh area. But the rebels still seem to have a free run of the place, where nine CPI(M) supporters were killed this month alone. Worse still, in more and more areas, it is the rebels, rather than the governments, writ that seems to run.         
	That the State is failing in the fight against the Maoists is not a secret. Run-of-the-mill politicians try either to hide this failure or pass the blame to political opponents. It should be reassuring that the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, has not done any such thing. He admitted the failure, and even said that the Maoist violence was on the rise in several states. At a conference with the police chiefs of state governments on Tuesday, he admitted the failure and called for a holistic approach to tackling the Maoist menace. Two years ago too, he had described left-wing extremism as the greatest threat to the countrys internal security. The fight against the Maoists in India faces complex problems, especially because the rebels enjoy moral, and sometimes even logistical, support from sections of the civil society. Successive governments have, however, said that this is no ordinary law-and-order problem. Political parties need to reach a consensus on dealing with it before the spectre of Maoism haunts more areas.

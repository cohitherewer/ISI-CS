	Not notified        
	 The law provides that whenever there is a vacancy in any post, the employer should advertise the post before selecting a candidate for it. In Orissa the appointment of a Class IV employee was challenged as the post for which he was appointed was not advertised prior to his selection. It was argued that the vacancy was only announced on a notice board. The Orissa High Court held that an advertisement, in common parlance, meant a device that drew the attention of the public to a piece of information. Therefore, announcing the vacancy on a notice board did not amount to advertisement as it did not amount to informing the public at large. The court ruled that the selection was indeed defective and could not be approved. (Jiban Ranjan Ray vs District Judge Kandhamal)                          
	Claim settled        
	 A passenger fell down from a train and had to have her legs amputated. When she claimed compensation under the Railways Act, the Railway Claims Tribunal rejected her plea as she could not produce the ticket, which she had lost during the accident. When the case went up to the Orissa High Court, it pointed out that the object of the provision in the act was to benefit such victims. It added that in deciding a claim for compensation a liberal approach should be taken. Relying on medical evidence and the evidence of eyewitnesses, the court awarded a compensation of Rs 4 lakh to the victim. (Union of India vs Smt Nalini Parida)                     
	Wife vindicated        
	 When a man filed a petition against his newly married wife for desertion, she opposed it. The trial court held that the husband was entitled to a decree of divorce. However, the wife appealed to the Bombay High Court. Setting aside the trial courts decree, the high court held that since the husbands parents and relatives were not happy with the marriage, he never even took her to his place of posting and actually drove her out of the house. The court held that under the circumstances, she could hardly be said to have deserted him. (Sau Varsha Pravin Patil vs Pravin Madhukar Patil)

	Roads to hell                  
	Sir  Accidents on highways have become routine phenomena. The head-on collision between a crowded bus and a truck at Kulgachhia, which claimed 21 lives, was one of the worst mishaps to have taken place in recent times (21 die in crash blamed on divider breach, Dec 14). The ill-fated bus was carrying more than 100 passengers in violation of traffic rules. Buses plying on highways with passengers perched on their rooftops is a common sight in the state. Shockingly, such violations of rules seldom attract penalties from the police or the highway authorities. For instance, vehicles running between Durgapur and Burdwan on the four-lane national highway have travellers sitting on their roofs. Passengers prefer not to complain, as there is an acute shortage in the number of buses on this route. Unfortunately, the state government has never felt the need to address this issue for the sake of passengers safety.          
	Mishaps such as the one in Kulgachhia raise a number of pertinent questions. First, not much is being done to check reckless driving on the roads. The police have expressed their helplessness, citing the shortage of staff. But the men in uniform never appear to be short of hands when it comes to collecting bribes from vehicle-owners.          
	Highways are meant for high- speed vehicles carrying consignments. But nowadays, two-wheelers like cycles are also seen plying on some stretches. In Kulgachhia, the driver of the ten-wheeler truck had crossed over into another flank through a gap in the divider. The move on the drivers part led to his death. Some of the bus passengers also died as a result of this manoeuvre. While travelling on highways, I dont remember ever seeing a highway patrol penalizing drivers for sneaking through openings between dividers.          
	Highways are becoming unsafe because of another reason. Dhabas have come up on them, leading to encroachment. Most of these eateries are unauthorized, and they usually have no arrangement for the parking of visitors vehicles. These dhabas attract quite a few people on weekends, leading to heavier traffic and a greater chance of mishaps.          
	To reduce the number of deaths on highways, it is imperative that the authorities increase the frequency of patrolling to check rash driving. It should be made mandatory for police patrols to file such cases, and they should be rewarded with incentives for filing them in a transparent manner. The Telegraph had once reported that as per the World Health Organizations estimates, India witnesses more fatal road accidents than China. A large number of these accidents take place in Bengal as a result of reckless and drunk driving, inefficient policing and bad road conditions. But this has not goaded the state administration to take action against killer vehicles.                    
	Yours faithfully,         Subhankar Mukherjee,

	Sir The chief minister is reported to have been concerned about Calcuttas security after the Centre alerted the nation to the possibility of a terror strike. However, the chief minister does not seem to be as alarmed about the rise in the number of road accidents. Over 20 people died when a truck rammed into a bus on Mumbai Road only the other day. There is no need for terrorists to harm a city that has already been wrecked from within.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  I travel to Howrah almost every other day and I have found the experience quite unnerving. The chaotic traffic on the Howrah Bridge is particularly frightening, and chances are that a major accident will take place any day. On three occasions in the past, I have seen buses collide on the bridge because of the absence of a divider. There are two police booths nearby, but the cops prefer to turn a blind eye to the speeding vehicles.          
	The concerned authorities should put up dividers on the bridge on a priority basis. Or else, a mishap is likely to occur, especially in winter when visibility is reduced considerably.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  I live in Bandra and attend the morning mass every day. I am truly appalled by the colossal waste of water in the locality each morning. There are plenty of cars, and the car washers use hose pipes to wash the vehicles and even the concrete floors in housing societies. Who should be blamed for this? I have also seen water gushing out on to the main road, making it slippery. This poses a threat not only to motor cyclists but also to young and aged pedestrians.          
	I have lodged several complaints against such wastage but to no avail. Will the authorities wake up to the problem and do something about it?          
	Yours faithfully,      
Jimmy Fernandes, Mumbai

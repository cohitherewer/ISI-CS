	The remains of the self                
	ARDHAKATHANAK: A HALF STORY (Penguin, Rs 350) by Banarasidas is a unique work in the history of Indian literature. Banarasidas was a poet, philosopher, theologian and merchant who was also the first ever Indian to put his life down on paper. Like Marcus Aurelius Meditations, Banarasidass work dwells on lifes little comedies, tragedies and ironies. Although set in 17th-century India and composed in the now arcane Braj Bhasha, the narrative bristles with anxieties  both practical and spiritual  that are in synch with modern times. Banarasidas dispenses nuggets of wisdom that sound like epigrams. Sample this: Greed is the root of all evil./ The root of sorrow is love./ Indigestion is the root of disease,/ And the root of death is this body. Translated elegantly by Rohini Chowdhury and beautifully introduced by Rupert Snell, this is a deeply absorbing volume.                        
	UNDER THE POETREE (Virgin Leaf, Rs 95) by Lakshmi Shankar presents a collection of verse meant for children. The usual platitudes about the smiling sun, bubbling stream and pouring rain are ubiquitous in these lyrics. However, one would hesitate to call these poems nursery rhymes since many of them are presented in flat, unrhymed lines. It is perhaps for this reason that the poems never quite manage to sparkle as traditional nursery rhymes always do. If anything, the relentless emphasis on cheery children and the bountiful Mother Earth makes them somewhat banal.                        
	THE MAGIC OF AWAKENING (Penguin, Rs 199) by Tejguru Sirshree Tejparkhi claims to provide 111 Answers on Life and Living. This is a refreshingly different volume from run-of-the-mill books that make spirituality sound like mumbo-jumbo. Sirshrees advice is always practical, based on his awareness of the ways of the world, and in step with a progressive vision of life. Take, for instance, his advice to a lady who wanted to know whether not being able to have children is supposed to be the sign of an incomplete woman: A woman ...believes herself to be incomplete because she considers herself to be the body. If you are able to transcend the body and know your true self, then the very question of incompleteness would not arise, because you are complete or absolute from the very beginning.                        
	AMBITIONS CURSE (Indialog, Rs 195) by Kishore Pillai tells the story of a gruesome murder, the unravelling of its motive, followed by another violent death. Lorded over by an investigating officer with the unusual name of Ricky Dev, this is a whodunit that deserves to be given a chance. Although the quality of Pillais prose may not be shimmering, this is, nonetheless, a page turner of sorts.                                  
	SENIOR CITIZENS HANDBOOK (Mark-Age, Rs 60) by S.C. Kakar compiles everything that you need to know to get through old age. From the biological process of ageing to retirement, investment planning, physical fitness and legal protection, Kakars is a manual of how the live the good life after turning 60. In the course of this book, one learns a few fascinating facts: Besi Devi, a 90-year-old, apparently got married to Pratap Singh, who is half her age. At 107, Azima Bi is perhaps the oldest person to have had a hysterectomy. And Bajrang Bahadur Singh, an advocate of the Patna Civil Court, continues to practice even at the ripe age of 103.                        
	INSPECTOR SINGH INVESTIGATES: A MOST PECULIAR MALaySIAN MURDER (Piatkus, Rs 295) by Shamini Flint has an illuminating subtitle. It captures the bizarreness of an alleged murderer pleading clemency for a crime she had every motive to commit. In comes the wily Inspector Singh who has to overcome a great many adversities  the unhelpful Malaysian police, in particular  to get the accused woman acquitted so as to reunite her with her children.

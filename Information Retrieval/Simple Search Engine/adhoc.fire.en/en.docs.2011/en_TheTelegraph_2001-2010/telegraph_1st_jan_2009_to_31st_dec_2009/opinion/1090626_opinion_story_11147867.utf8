The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | City In A State Of Ruin
                                                                                                                 CITY IN A STATE OF RUIN                                  BONA FIDE - Malvika Singh                              
	Since the government is taking a fresh look at many areas that have either been neglected and destroyed or overrun with archaic rules and regulations, it is time we looked at the municipal laws and rationalized some of them to ensure greater accessibility to public spaces so that people can enjoy and experience their city, its history and cultures. Delhi is always a good example, and it has a chief minister who is liberal, open-minded and ever willing to experiment with fresh ideas, as well as take lessons from the other international protocols that govern the historic cities in Europe and elsewhere.        
	First, the corroded and corrupt mindset of the major municipality in Delhi, its bureaucratic, staid and hugely stale interventions, its unimaginably out of sync laws, its babudom that is relentless in its pursuit of payoffs for breaking redundant rules, its gaping creative lacunae, everything has come together to make illegal activities the norm in this greatly layered, historic and celebrated city. There are, unfortunately, three reference points and power centres with their individual bureaucracies that are pulling in different directions. This one major flaw in the operating system has aided and abetted the degradation of Delhi and its environs.        
	Corrupt municipalities do not enforce the basic requirements, such as the width of roads and lanes in the endless colonies, thereby impeding even the movement of fire engines. Such provisions should be mandatory for all municipalities. The maintenance of these roads and lanes is abysmal, allowing for filth to accumulate on walkways, making commuting on foot nearly impossible. Garbage dumped is left to rot because no one ever monitors the frequency of clearing the vast piles of waste till some transient VIP decides to visit the area, forcing menials to leap into action. This description sums up the attitude of the municipality. A radical overhaul of the delivery mechanisms is essential if we intend to conserve our habitats and live a clean and productive life.                
	Urban horror        
	Stupidity dominates all dialogue while conversing and arguing with the functionaries responsible for the maintenance of rich slums. The Lutyens Delhi area is an exception because it has its own municipality  the NDMC  and this part of the city is well kept and manicured in comparison to the rest of the metropolis. Corrupt practices are prevalent here as well but the officers ensure that they perform their tasks, at least partially, so as to give the impression that New Delhi is not falling apart.         
	However, the horror is that in Connaught Place, for example, traffic cops will watch motorcyclists drive along the pillared corridors of this great arcade of architectural grace and skill without reprimanding or fining the offender. But another arm of the force will attack news vendors with lathis and remove them from the pavement for a few hours till the hafta is settled, after which the vendor is permitted to return to his spot.         
	The NDMC needs to design, place and rent kiosks in each block from where newspapers and periodicals can be sold. It happens the world over so why not here? There are other contrasting realities. The mandis have been hemmed in by hideous concrete buildings but similar markets in Venice, Paris and Athens are the most vibrant tourist attractions; street food, so intrinsic to our living patterns, is disallowed in modern India but such open public spaces are encouraged across Southeast Asia and Europe as tourist spots that can generate revenue for the unorganized but skilled sector. Why do the authorities persist in destroying our inherent strengths in their desperation to clone the worst of the West? Why this insecurity and lack of cultural sensibility? Why is the babu far removed from the people and culture of India?

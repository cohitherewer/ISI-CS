	Fists raised                  
	Sir  I want to convey my sense of outrage at what happened in a Mangalore pub recently (Pub attack arrests as BJP fights, Jan 28). Many migrants settled in Bangalore had voted the Bharatiya Janata Party to power to escape the tyranny of the Gowda dynasty, which seemed interested in promoting the cause of the sons of the soil only. But the BJP government is turning out to be even more divisive than the Gowda regime. The first shock came by way of the unprovoked and barbaric attacks on churches in many parts of the state. This time, the Sri Ram Sena, a fringe outfit, has been at the centre of the mayhem in Mangalore. In the past, the BJP government had been slow to arrest the miscreants who had vandalized churches. Some token arrests did take place, but only after the intervention of the Centre.           
	Once again, we are noticing a shocking degree of inertia on the part of the law enforcers. They seem hesitant to crack down on outfits, which have taken upon themselves the responsibility of moral policing. Those who assaulted the women in the Amnesia Lounge belong to the periphery of civilized society. Unfortunately, they enjoy the patronage of the chief minister who treats the state like his own fief.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  I find nothing wrong with the Sri Ram Senas conduct in the Mangalore pub incident. However, in my opinion, it would have been better had women cadre, and not the men, beaten up the girls. In the past, boys and girls have been caught in raunchy parties in many cities, especially in Mumbai. Surely, such events are proof of the cultural degradation that has set in? The National Commission for Women has constituted a three-member team to investigate the incident. Instead of meddling in these affairs, the NCW should focus on issues such as womens literacy and health. It is also time to ban the sections of the media that are hell- bent on making India an immoral nation.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Priyanka, Bangalore 

                
	Sir  The assault and the molestation of women in a pub in Mangalore by activists of the Sri Ram Sena need to be criticized wholeheartedly. It is evident that the B.S. Yeddyurappa government is wilfully downplaying the incident, the reason being that the Sri Ram Sena is a pro-Hindu organization. It is a matter of great shame that the government of Karnataka failed to provide safety to women in a developing city like Mangalore. The police seem to be bending over backwards to appease the government, and this is a cause for concern in a democracy such as ours.           
	Women deserve to be treated honourably in any society. By assaulting the girls in the pub, the Sri Ram Sena supporters have not only violated their fundamental rights but have also taken the law into their hands. Such attacks have been on the rise but politicians have used their clout to ensure that no action is taken against the perpetrators. The blame for the incident lies with the state government whose apathy resulted in women getting beaten up in a pub. The chief minister and his colleagues must resign because they have lost the moral right to rule.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  B.S. Yeddyurappa should take stern action against those involved in the Mangalore attack. It is shocking to think that the Sri Ram Sena considers itself the guardian of Hindu culture when it is actually a blot on Hindu religion itself. Every citizen of India should denounce the action of this outfit, which is no less dangerous than a terror group. Mangalore  a progressive, intellectual and peaceful city  is being threatened by a dreaded organization and the chief minister needs to do more than issue statements against the attack.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Manjunath R. Goudar, Dharwad, Karnataka

                
	Sir  The attack on women in Mangalore was orchestrated by a small and little-known group, which has implicit support of the power-that-be in Karnataka. Television cameras were present to capture the incident and a channel reportedly interviewed the ring leader, who was allowed to speak at length. All this points to the complicity of the State and the media in this shocking incident. It is possible that the channel concerned had prior knowledge of the attack. But neither did it do anything to prevent it nor did it inform the police. What happened in Mangalore is not an isolated incident. It is often the case that when small organizations prepare themselves for such attacks, television channels are contacted in advance for coverage. This way, these groups are able to reach out to a wider audience with the help of the media.           
	Perhaps the West Bengal government could issue directives to television channels that they should contact the police whenever they are tipped off about a possible agitation. Else, television channels must accept the responsibility of aiding and abetting unlawful acts.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Jyoti Prakash Singh, Sahagunj, Hooghly 

                
	Sir The shameful act of the Sri Ram Sena on the pretext of saving Hindu tradition must be condemned. The culprits should not be allowed to get away lightly after what they have done. Such incidents will continue unless citizens take every opportunity to drive home the point that these acts will not be tolerated. This is a clash between the civilized and the bigoted and, expectedly, the stakes are quite high.           
	Yours faithfully,

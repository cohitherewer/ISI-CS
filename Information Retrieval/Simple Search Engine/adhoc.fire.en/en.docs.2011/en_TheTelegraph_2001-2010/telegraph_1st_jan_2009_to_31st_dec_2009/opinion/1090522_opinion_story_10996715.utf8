	Feeling left out                  
	Sir  The mandate against the Left in West Bengal is neither surprising nor unexpected (Manmohan wind in sails, Mamata tide engulfs Red fort, May 17). For nearly 32 years, the Left parties in power pretended to stand by the minority community by engineering silent divisions. Across rural Bengal, the seed of division is evident. Going by the statistics, it would not be difficult to establish that among all the sufferers of political conflict, it is the minority community that has to invariably face the music sooner or later. This is perhaps explained by the fact that there are not many job opportunities for members of this community and, as the saying goes, idle minds become the devils workshop.          
	The Sachar Committees report spoke at length about the plight of Muslims in West Bengal, but the ruling Left, with its well-oiled disinformation programme, not only ignored the recommendations of the committee, but also claimed its suggestions to be biased. The death of Rizwanur Rahman opened up two fronts of hatred: one, for the Lefts support of a certain wealthy community, and the other, for the arrogance of the police officers. The forced departure of Taslima Nasreen from Calcutta also seemed like a got-up game. The community watched, with open humiliation, the writers exodus from the city, in spite of the civil society speaking out against the administration.           
	After 30 years of deep slumber and militant trade unionism, the sudden momentum for industrialization appeared farcical. The Left failed to realize the harm caused to its image by the proposed chemical hub in a predominantly minority belt of Midnapore. Leaders like Lakshman Seth failed to assess the implications of acquiring a mosque and properties that include Muslim burial grounds. This resulted in the Left fighting the Left.          
	Figures will prove that the minority community has lost maximum property under Operation Barga, and whenever it came to land acquisition  at Bhangar, Rajarhat or elsewhere  it was the minority community which lost the highest share of land.           
	Alimuddin Street, till date, has not realized that Islamists can be loyal friends of non-believers from any community, but will not allow their beliefs to be berated and interfered with. The community has also been watching the politicization of the Wakf board and the systematic misappropriation of minority properties by Left leaders. The writing is on the wall, and 32 years of a cloak-and-dagger story will surely come to an end in the next couple of years, if not in a few months. The minority community refuses to be represented by just another name  Muzaffar Ahmed Bhawan  at Alimuddin Street in the same way as the latter has refused to include a single member from this community in the politburo.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Somnath Chatterjee, the ex-member of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), has urged the party to sincerely and genuinely introspect on the causes of its poor performance in the Lok Sabha elections (Party is cut off from people, says Somnath, May 20). This statement begs the question if Chatterjee is, however subliminally, concerned that the causes of the defeat will not be sincerely or genuinely examined by the Left.           
	Political analysts, who often like to delve into the psychological make-up of the party bosses, say that denial and the delusion of grandeur usually cause such failures. In case of the Left, it is likely that the electoral data would be statistically purged, and conclusions manipulated to suit a predetermined plan of action instead of measures being formulated, followed by unprejudiced analysis. There is a slim chance of lessons being learnt: this points to the utter failure of the CPI(M)-lead government to deliver good governance to the people of West Bengal. After all, failure to address issues related to governance would call for administrative policies that are in variance with the party ideologies.           
	When a party enters an election process in a democratic set-up, it knows the rules of the game. This means that if, and when, it is able to form a government, it will be a government for all the people though it was definitely not elected by all people. The party enters into a social contract, though not a legal one, with the people that the government, and not the party, would be directly held accountable in all matters of governance. The party may not be allowed to use the government apparatuses to advance the cause of its sympathizers, whom Lenin had derisively called useful idiots. There has hardly been any sign of significant, effective and result-oriented governance save land reform in the last three decades that the Left Front has been in power. The comrades were happy to sit on their past laurels, and to go on opposing the introduction of English and computer education in schools.           
	The government has signally failed, or wilfully neglected, the implementation of issues that are relevant to the present or future generations. Think of land acquisition, pollution control, unlicensed auto-rickshaws, their emission of noxious fumes and use of illegal fuel, pathetic work culture in government offices, and inability to act on the Sachar Committee report. As all these failures of governance were piling up, the party was busy recruiting followers and dispensing largesse to them. Meanwhile, for the long-suffering citizens of West Bengal, bad governance remains a reality.           
	Yours faithfully,

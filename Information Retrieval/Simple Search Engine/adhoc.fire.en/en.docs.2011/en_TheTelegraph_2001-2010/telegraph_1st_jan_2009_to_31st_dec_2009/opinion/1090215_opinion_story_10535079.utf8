                                                                                                                 ARTFULLY DODGED                                                          
	Home science, meant for schoolgirls who did not want to study but liked to cook and sew, has undergone a change. It is all nutrition, dietetics, food services; could policymakers have learnt something from the fact that some of the best chefs in the world are men who did not sit home science tests in school? Probably not. Nowadays, boys and girls are silently being led towards specific areas of learning that are considered fitting, or maybe more productive, for each gender. For the last half-century, Indian society liked to believe that a boy should study science. Or engineering, or medicine, or management. Subjects in the humanities were not only more accessible to the weaker brains of girls, they were also more befitting women, who would end up prettifying the kitchen and helping their children with the homework till Class VI. At most, they would teach. But India still produced a formidable crop of male historians, literary scholars, linguists, social scientists, even internationally famous philosophers. And women have broken every imposed boundary. In the last few years, however, most reputed boys schools are doing away with their Arts stream in the higher classes. Societys old bias has become insitutionalized.        
	This is in tune with a larger shift in priorities among policymakers. The privileging of the applied sciences, technology and management, together with the channelling of funds to specialist institutes away from universities, has meant a gradual waning of interest, excellence and research capacities in what is known as the general stream. That the phrase may also be used to refer to students who do not make it to specialist institutes may be an unintended irony.        
	The gendering of learning is now broader  there is something less virile in being a teacher or a student of the general stream. The inevitable lowering of standards of teaching and the limiting of research in universities cannot bode well for long, either for the nations levels of achievement or for the vitality of technology. It is heartening that the prime minister has announced an incentive for students of the pure sciences in colleges and universities. What is noticeable is the resounding silence about the humanities. Once believed to be fitting only for girls, the liberal arts have been implicitly consigned to oblivion. India, the nation on the move, apparently has no need of them. It is busy welcoming a strange new world shorn of history, of the intense intellectual exercise of philosophy without which science and mathematics would lose their feet, of the wisdom, sense of beauty and proportion, the understanding of languages, cultures and human beings given by literature and art. Yet this is an era of global relationships tragically riven by narrow vision. That discrimination is always foolish, gendered or otherwise, seems to have escaped Indias policymakers.

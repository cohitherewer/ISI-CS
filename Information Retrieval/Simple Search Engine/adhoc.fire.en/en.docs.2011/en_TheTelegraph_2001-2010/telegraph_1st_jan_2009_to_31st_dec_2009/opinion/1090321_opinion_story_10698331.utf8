The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Fronts and friendships
                                                                                                                 FRONTS AND FRIENDSHIPS                          - The Indian political party is just a vehicle on its way to Delhi					 					      Sunanda K. Datta-Ray                                                      
	Despite Disraelis belief that parliamentary government is impossible without parties, the current campaign suggests that the principal  often only  purpose of a party is to further the ambitions of an individual. Parties presuppose ideas if not ideology. A great deal of time, effort, expense and anguish might be avoided if this pretence were dropped.        
	It has in practice. Theres anxious heartburning when Sitaram Yechury calls on Sharad Yadav or any other party leader not because he might convert them to revolution but because he keeps the headcount in the quinquennial Gentlemen vs Politicians race for the prime ministership. As for the other half, Mayavati and Jayalalithaa probably regard themselves as the only men in clusters of old women. But does that make them Gentlemen? When Barbara Castle lamented in the Commons that the English bulldog (Churchill) had become Americas lapdog, a Tory MP yelled, You are not, of course, a dog! He didnt need to spell out the alternative for sedate members even on his own side to express shock.        
	The immediate gain from a partyless democracy would be respite from a bewildering jungle of initials and acronyms. UPA and NDA are familiar codes for L.K. Advani and Sonia Gandhi. But we must also contend with UDF and LDF; BSP and BJD; PDP and TDP; LJP, NCP and IUML. Tamil ingenuity accounts for a formidable clutch  DMK, DMDK, AIADMK and PMK. To the many other letters of the alphabet lurking in the woodwork can be added the NCNBSF or Non-Congress non-BJP Secular Front which boasts more chiefs than Indians, each plotting for a chance not to repeat the historic blunder that Jyoti Basu finds so hard to forget or forgive.              
	The Politicians can be identified from the flamboyant largesse that has all but replaced political programmes, constituency interests and national issues. Houses for journalists in Punjab, wristwatches in Madhya Pradesh, land, water, electricity and an abundance of colour TV sets (flat screen presumably) for voters in Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and elsewhere. Advanis more imaginative Rs 10,000 laptops may be earmarked for students and his smart mobiles for families languishing below the poverty line, but the rule hasnt yet been invented that doesnt also indicate a way round it. Everyone is a student, of life if nothing else, while a profusion of BPL cards issued by the government makes Andhra Pradesh appear truly poverty-stricken. The Marxists are the cleverest: the parliamentarian who reportedly passed off an empty envelope with great public fanfare as a cheque for Rs 25,000 for a bereaved mother deserves the finance portfolio if Karat becomes king instead of kingmaker.         
	This is not the criminalization of politics, as N.N. Vohra might say. Its the politicization of crime, with the Supreme Court staying convictions to accommodate stellar ambition. This other overlapping is confirmed by Amar Singhs role in the appropriately named film, Chargesheet. Ronald Reagans How can a president not be an actor? when asked if it was seemly for an actor to be president could be applied to Indias entire political dramatis personae. Finally, the Gandhi-Nehrus confirm that blood is thicker than water. If Chiranjeevi can produce an actor brother, Naidu dazzles voters with three thespians  two brothers-in-law and a nephew. Atal Bihari Vajpayees nephew is contesting. Thanks to her future daughter-in-law, the Samajwadi Partys Ranjana Bajpai has added another Brahmin face to the BSPs ranks.        
	The future belongs to the Bal Thackerays who understand that Indians dont cast their vote but vote their caste, not to Yechury with his textbook denunciation of corruption, criminalization, communalism and casteism. Without the four Cs, India would not be Indian. Also, families mean feuds. The Dutts can now preen like the royal Scindias since they, too, are divided by politics. Rabri Devis brothers are on the rampage in what Biharis call the sasural party. Varun Gandhis kin must be delighted that he is Thackerays hero.        
	Caste, community and Thackeray shore up Pawars hopes. Worsted in 1991 by P.V. Narasimha Rao (who might never have existed so far as Congress publicity is concerned), he grumbles that since Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Karnataka have had a go at the top job (he doesnt mention Punjab or Uttar Pradeshs long monopoly), its high time for a Maratha manoos. The Shiv Sena supports him, presumably because its Hindu enthusiasm stops short of peripatetic Sindhis. Paswan agrees with Mayavati that the next prime minister should be Dalit but his caste loyalty stops short of females. Maybe the job should rotate like Malaysias kingship among all the states and castes. That would mean smaller elections with fewer than the present 21 lakh security personnel and no need to deprive people of the tamasha Lalit Modi is peddling.        
	Ironically, the party system also highlights the central role that even a fragmented Congress occupies. As Pranab Mukherjee (the permanent PM, he laughs, borrowing Piloo Modis joke) concluded after a spell in the wilderness, there is no future in Indias secular democratic politics save in the Congress. S. Bangarappa, the former Karnataka chief minister, knows that all too well, having trudged to the Congress door no less than five times. Naveen Patnaik may be coming round to the same view. If the Congress hadnt existed, it would have had to be invented to provide the rest with a foil.         
	All the prime ministers-in-waiting are obliged to strike a position vis--vis the Congress. Refused an alliance, Mulayam Singh seeks consolation in a strategic understanding. Lalu Prasad denies that stabbing the nations bahu (his term in happier days) in the back will derail the UPA. Jayalalithaa accuses K. Karunanidhi of lashing out against Indira and Rajiv Gandhi; Karunanidhi says Jayalalithaa thwarted Sonia Gandhis prime ministerial hopes in 2004. Its not where the NCNBSF chiefs stand today that matters. Its where they will stand tomorrow when, according to Karat, the front will become an alliance. Even Mamata Banerjee sets her cap at the Writers Buildings in collusion with the Congress, which obliged her by banishing the mercurial Subrata Mukherjee to the wilds of Bankura. Nitish Kumar can afford to ignore the Congress since the unfolding saga of Barack Obamas questionable Indian friends suggests Bihar might be expanding to America.              
	But Pranab Babu is wrong in crediting Patnaiks former partner with only the agenda of communalism, sectarianism and obscurantism. They also have a one-point agenda and the point is the same. Thats why Narendra Modi feels young Varun has upstaged him. Arun Jaitleys loyal but principled opposition forces him to endure with stony-faced misgiving the progress of a schoolfriend with the knack of getting places. Advani, beaming from Indias largest political website with 800 pages, 400 pictures and 250 videos, detects a worrying parallel in Richard Nixons experience and intelligence losing out to Jack Kennedys handsome profile.        
	The pattern bristles with intrigue-ridden sub-plots. Delimitation has compounded the complexity of canvassing. Voters in Hooghly and Farukhabad cannot be alone in refusing to vote unless electoral promises (like building new roads) are kept. The nitty-gritty of governance matters more than manifestos. As Indira Gandhi realized, parties are a drag on leaders. Fear of the Supreme Court prevented her from going it alone but she took her cue from Arthur Balfour, the British prime minister who said he would sooner consult his valet on politics than the party conference. Far from reflecting a broad consensus of like-minded people committed to a particular programme for the national weal, the party is a vehicle on the road to Delhi . Like Vajpayee, the only leader publicly to admit that no one can go through the electoral mill and still pretend to be Mr Clean, Manmohan Singh and Jaswant Singh are also Gentlemen fallen among Politicians. Vajpayee, alas, has withdrawn from the ring. Jaswant Singh never deigned to enter it. That doesnt leave voters much choice.

                      Second best            
	 Boni Yayi, the president of the Republic of Benin, was all smiles during his visit to India. The huge media turn-out for his meeting with the Indian prime minister pleased Yayi immensely. So much so that he shook the PMs hand for a bit too long, making the officials, who were anxiously watching Manmohan Singh, wince. The jostling mikes and cameras  a sure sign of the medias interest in him and his tiny country, thought Yayi  also made the dignitary wonder at the reason behind the fuss. Was it because Benin, with less than a million people, had an elite corps of female soldiers called the Ahosi in the 19th century? Or were Indians excited about the cordial ties between Benins Muslims and Christians, and among its various ethnic groups? The Indian protocol officers did not wish to ruin his evident enjoyment. They reminded him politely that all the attention had something to do with the PM making his maiden appearance after his heart surgery. Now that must have made Yayis heart sink.                  
	 If you are looking for Kamal Nath these days, you would have to head out for  no, not Delhi or somewhere abroad  the pocket borough of Chhindwara in Madhya Pradesh. The Union commerce and industry minister is hard at work, night and day, to ensure that he wins from this constituency in the coming elections. Ticket seekers making a beeline for Delhi to meet the minister have also learnt that Nath will have no time to attend social engagements like parties, book launches and television shows till the polls are over. But Nath, even though he is away at a remote place, has taken care to ensure that VVIP guests keen to meet him in Chhindwara can avoid a bumpy ride. Is that the reason why his Shikarpur residence has been equipped with an air strip?                            
	 The way to a mans heart, the saying goes, is through his stomach. Or is it? What transpired between the angry old man, Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, and LK Advani at a lunch meeting at the latters residence the other day is not quite known, but we do know that the former vice-president emerged from the meeting a chastened man. Shekhawat has been seething for a while now, and had let go an angry volley in the direction of Vasundhara Raje, the former chief minister of Rajasthan.       
	But what has taken the fight out of Shekhawat? Some think that the tepid reception he got from the parivar rank and file after his anti-Raje comments during his tour of Rajasthan to assess the mood of his followers might have brought about a change in mood. That forced Shekhawat to mend fences with senior party leaders, and his lunch meeting with Advani was a signal to partymen that he had closed the anti-Raje chapter for good. A cold shoulder from the supporters, rather than piping hot food, must have done the trick then.                            
	 The Congress president was reportedly surprised to note the enthusiasm for Lok Sabha tickets among some Rajya Sabha members in the party. But Madams happiness proved to be short-lived. A political aide pointed out that those keen to fight the polls had their Rajya Sabha terms coming to an end, and there was little chance that they would get re-elected. Last heard, all this has left Madam worried over giving the Rajya Sabha-types the tickets they so crave.                            
	 Come elections and political parties depute their best media managers to slug it out on television and in print. This time, however, the Congress has sent the partys media-savvy faces to the polls. The media secretary, Tom Vadakkan, or the chairman of the media department, Veerappa Moily among others, will be testing the turf in different parts of India. This means that the party media department will be run by Abhishek Singhvi and Jayanti Natarajan who, though competent, are not as half as exciting. How boring!                            
	 Here is something more on the Boni Yayi visit. The grapevine tells us that Yayi met some cabinet ministers to sign bilateral agreements. The smart ones among them looked up the Atlas or googled to find out where Benin lay. One unprepared minister, clueless about Benin minutes before meeting Yayi, heard officials mention its ties with Nigeria. That was enough to help him break into a conversation about the political situation in and around Nigeria with his guest.             
	 Someone else is feeling distinctly unlucky these days though. It is none other than the Union railways minister, Lalu Prasad. Along with his kingdom, Lalu Prasad has now lost the perks that came with power. Recently, he went to meet his rival and the chief minister of Bihar, Nitish Kumar, to hand over cheques worth over 40 crore on behalf of the Indian Railways and the Rashtriya Janata Dal towards the Kosi flood relief. Lalu Prasad is supposed to have asked Kumar why his government had provided him with a rickety Innova, and enquired whether that was the best his government could do. Not to be outdone, Kumar replied that the vehicle had been purchased during the RJD regime. Lalu Prasads complaint comes close in the heels of his wife, Rabri Devi, cribbing about the state government providing her with a run-down Ambassador. His supporters are now grumbling that the road to Patna is now full of thorns.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Gettysburg, Cairo and beyond
                                                                                                                 GETTYSBURG, CAIRO AND BEYOND                                  Presidents, bishops and performers all use persuasive speeches to define communities and make history                                            
	What was so special about Barack Obamas speech at Cairo University that it took the world by storm? It is not as though he is the first ever president of the United States of America who has offered friendship to the Muslims. Obama quoted John Adams, the second president of the US, who proclaimed his nations solidarity with the Muslims while signing the Treaty of Tripoli in 1796. Ironically, if you read George W. Bushs address to a joint session of the Congress barely a week after 9/11, youll find sentiments that exactly echo these thoughts.         
	Obama did promise much that can affect the world in truly decisive ways: the withdrawal of troops from Iraq, the closing of the Guantnamo Bay prison camp, the abolition of torture and rendition. But he did not go into the details of how, and at what cost, he was going to achieve all this. He cleverly equivocated on the Israel-Palestine crisis, and was silent on Pakistans role in keeping the crises in Afghanistan and Kashmir alive. Yet, so many across the world found hope in his words, were convinced by the sincerity of his concern and swayed by his oratorical skills, which could compete with the talents of any actor in the Royal Shakespeare Company.         
	This power to grip the imagination comes from Obamas gift of spectacle. As he declaimed, he swept everyone off their feet, and it was only while reading the transcript of his speech that the various loopholes became apparent. It is in the nature of political speeches to enthral through performance. Successful politicians make oratory their destiny. Oration, like good theatre, is able to create a quasi-fictional aura around itself: most listeners are persuaded to suspend disbelief for some time and let credulity wash over their judgment.         
	Even history helps to spin the oddest of myths. Consider the first among the great American orators, Abraham Lincoln, who managed to make constitutional law sound like the King James Bible. It took Lincoln about two minutes to achieve mythical status when he delivered the Gettysburg Address on November 19, 1863. At the Soldiers National Cemetery in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, he spoke some two hundred words which, if apocryphal accounts are to be believed, had been composed on the back of an envelope while he was on the train from Washington to Pennsylvania. Those present at Gettysburg left behind differing records of what happened after the president had uttered the final words. One version claimed that there was no applause, only stunned silence; another said, there was a warm response, though a bit delayed; yet another said that yes, there was applause but it was barely polite. What remained constant in all the testimonies was the mention of that moment of pregnant silence immediately following the conclusion of Lincolns speech. That pause, a sliver of time, is emptied of facts. It is a void into which purely imaginary meanings have been poured by generations of historians.        
	Compare this with Obamas Cairo speech, which, at nearly 6, 000 words, lasted close to an hour. It too had been crafted expertly, one sentence flowing into the next with effortless cogency. Every gesture, facial expression, even hand movement, seemed to have been written into the text itself. John F. Kennedys Inaugural (Ask not what your country can do for you  ask what you can do for your country) or Franklin D. Roosevelts first address when he took office during the Great Depression remains unforgettable because the words were matched by deeds. It is still too early to confer such greatness on Obama. As the first US president of African-American origin, that too with a Muslim middle name (he seems to invoke it only selectively), Obama may be a unique figure in the history of the Western consciousness, although his uniqueness as a statesman is yet to be earned. And rhetoric, no doubt a handy weapon, better not become his sole guarantor against oblivion.                          SOMAK GHOSHAL

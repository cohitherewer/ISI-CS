                                                                                                                 THE DAY IS SAVED                                  Malvika Singh                              
	Hats off to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the Congress president, Sonia Gandhi, for carefully and competently calibrating a team of ministers who will be the chosen men and women entrusted with an agenda for the inclusive growth and development of both Bharat and India. It is difficult to find fault with the allocation of portfolios, and therefore, the systematic delivery of goods and services seems very plausible. Most incumbents appear to be correctly placed, will be accountable to the prime minister, and will have to challenge a degraded, corrupt, diluted, clumsy and lethargic bureaucracy to perform with integrity. Babus in denial, comfortable with the status quo and pending files, need to be injected with the spirit of a fresh idiom. Ministers of state have been purposefully appointed. There is nothing random in the selection. The prime minister and Sonia Gandhi took their time, ignored a baying electronic media and within the tricky realities of coalition politics, crafted the best possible team and carried the day.        
	Cover stories in weekly magazines, written by politically illiterate young men and women looking for a sensational non-story, but being confronted with a boringly serious government-formation, are superficial and suitably flip, with no real comprehension of the tasks at hand or an understanding of the shift that has happened. There is a clear move away from the petty politics and endless bickering of greedy and rapacious political partners, where the lead partner became a victim of malignant, degraded politics, to the clear possibility of reversing the downhill trend and restoring the basic tenets of good governance. The signals are transparent and obvious.                
	New beginning        
	Kapil Sibal, as the minister of human resource development, brings to the table an immediate sense of hope for our academic institutions. M. Veerappa Moily, at the helm of law and justice, has the historic opportunity to rewrite colonial laws and introduce new, accessible ones, ensure quick delivery of justice, particularly in the lower courts that also require to be disinfected in order to weed out the disease of corruption. With his vast experience in constructing recommendations for administrative reforms and with his legal background, Moily is ideal for the post. Kamal Nath, the doer, could go down in history as the person who connected this dynamic nation under the banner of surface transport and highways, thereby bringing together energetic social and economic activities that have lain neglected for decades.        
	C.P. Joshi has a mandate to strengthen the base, the many roots of this civilization, in an effort to bring the rural assets and aspirations into the mainstream of economic growth and change, saving the majority of India from complete dilution in an unthinking, selfish, upwardly-mobile, and disconnected modern world. Rural development has the funds and panchayati raj could be the structural bridge which could be used to take the resources to the people. What has not been given the credence it deserved is the ministry of women and child development. It needs to be upgraded to cabinet level and put on the front-burner since it affects half the electorate. The mandate of this ministry needs to be linked with rural development and panchayati raj for both to add value to each other.        
	If this government unshackles urban, entrepreneurial and corporate India from the constraints that force one step forward and four steps back, much of the ugly social turmoil that has permeated our polity is bound to abate and the ruling dispensation could aspire next time for a full mandate. The Youth Congress cadres could be the foot soldiers of the Grand Old Party that has been resurrected from the abyss it had fallen into by the Congress president.

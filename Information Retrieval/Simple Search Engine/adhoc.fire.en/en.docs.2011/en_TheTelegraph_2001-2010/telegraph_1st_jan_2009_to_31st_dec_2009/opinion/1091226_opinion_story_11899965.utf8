The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Fusion with a difference
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        FUSION WITH A DIFFERENCE                                  Dance - Sharmila Basu Thakur                                                  
	Each classical dance form has a rich technique and a strict format designed by the great maestros. But a possibility to experiment and innovate is always there. The balance between grammar and imagination depends upon proper training, which forms the basis of the creation. Dancing with Shiva, a fusion between Bharatnatyam and Flamenco, presented by Sohini Roychowdhury and her troupe, Sohinimoksha (ICCR, December 22), reminded the audience of this basic truth. The entire production was performed by the students of Sohinimoksha and the girls from Apne Aap Women Worldwide.         
	The programme started with tandava, which showed Shiva as both the creator and the destroyer. Elements of Bharatnatyam and Flamenco were blended aesthetically, with the sargam and the flute as accompaniments. This was followed by Tulsidass bhajan, Ramachandra kripalu, which was an ode to the hero of the epic. Alegria, a traditional Flamenco piece, by Rocio Arce Garcia, reflected on the spirit of joy that laces the sun-kissed beaches and the lively Mediterranean rhythm. The next number, Dancing with Shiva, featured the Apne Aap girls dancing with Shiva as their muse. The presentation brought out the similarities between the two dance forms convincingly. O Krishna chronicled the all-time favourite story of Krishna eluding the gopikas. Liquid Dance, from A.R. Rahmans original soundtrack of Slumdog Millionaire, which was performed by Sohinimoksha at the premiere of the film, was refreshingly different. Buleria presented the richly creative culture of Spain, while Salzburg Sonata was Sohinimokshas tribute to Mozart. Kahe Chhede More was a rhythmic, but experimental, presentation. The adi taal of Tanjore and the frenzied Flamenco beat of Crdoba came together in this performance. Jai Ho, performed by the girls, was truly heart-warming. The evening concluded with Flamenconatyam, which created a divine atmosphere with the aid of Gregorian chants and Vedic mantras.         
	Conceived and choreographed by Sohini Roychowdhury, the entire programme succeeded in presenting the dancers versatile expressions and nimble movements. What is most commendable is that Sohini, living in Spain, has managed to stay in touch with her roots. It was also wonderful to see the young dancers enjoying themselves. The organizers must be thanked for putting together such a brilliant show.

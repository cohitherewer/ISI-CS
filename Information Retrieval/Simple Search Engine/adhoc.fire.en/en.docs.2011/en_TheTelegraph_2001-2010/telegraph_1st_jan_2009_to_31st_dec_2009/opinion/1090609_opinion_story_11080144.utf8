	In a great and resilient civilization such as ours, it seems absurd for any government to give culture a short shrift, relegate it to a forgotten and neglected space. The incumbent government at the Centre has ignored this very critical area, an area of life and living that makes people secure, proud and confident, regardless of the many disparate realities of an unequal, diverse and complex world with sharply polarized economic levels as well as opportunities. Culture is not determined, protected or enhanced by policy judgements. It is an intangible, vibrant and real ethos that varies from region to region, community to community, manifesting itself in a plethora of culturally-specific tangibles which define time, space and the traditions of a plural, multi-lingual, cohesive society in an ancient but modern civilization.        
	India needs neither ministers nor ministers of state to handle a ministry, which becomes an institutional patron dispensing largesse to artistes of all kinds looking for the dole, and most definitely does not need sundry bureaucrats to devise strategies to conserve and protect the idea and ethos of India. We need to set in place a series of mechanisms and laws that empowers the people who are the true repositories of those myriad cultures, to conserve and grow their way of life and living. Acts need to be reassessed  many require to be rewritten  approved and enacted through Parliament, and turned into new laws in keeping with the changed times. Independent India has not bothered to alter the parameters that were set by the British to govern culture, the repositories of our traditions, our conservation and protection policies and so on. That is the sole role of the government in this critical sphere where human resources are the most treasured and valuable ingredient.                
	Save the future         
	Sixty years of State patronage has not met the simplest of requirements for the basic conservation of our national treasures. Culture is embodied in our man-made, material heritage, in our natural environment and in the skills of our artisans. We have managed to ruin all three by exploiting the first two and disregarding the last. Invaders recognized Indias inherent strengths, nurtured them, celebrated them and absorbed them into their own cultures. Over the centuries, India served as the pivot in the planning of the now forgotten cities, in deft skills, in complex philosophies and in the sciences. However, with the institutionalization of culture in the hands of politicians after 1947, we began to lose the potency of our many legacies.        
	We have destroyed our rivers. We have permitted our natural treasures to be filched in exchange of filthy lucre. We have looted our ancient edifices and sold the broken bits and pieces for paltry compensation. We have scribbled on the walls of mosques and temples, forts and palaces, with impunity. We have treated our heritage disgracefully. And all this under the watchful eyes of the ministries and other institutions manned with illiterate individuals pulling rank in museums and libraries with no knowledge whatsoever of the value of the bhandaars, departments where officers worship the failures of the West, and destroy indigenous strengths in their quest for upward mobility.        
	The babu turns away from the traditional skills as he clamours for the inorganic poisons that have overtaken the Western world. False values, unthinking aspirations and faulty governance have dismantled and extinguished a great deal. We now need to restore by restructuring the laws and enforcing them with diligence. The government must think out of the box, absorb new practices and respect the legacy we have inherited, one which we have to hold together in an effort to restore pride in ourselves for the future generations.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | From a faded past to enduring vividness
                                                                                                                 FROM A FADED PAST TO ENDURING VIVIDNESS                              VISUAL ARTS      Bhaswati Chakravorty                                                
	The past ambushes us in unexpected ways. It is as if Charu Guhas photographs had been waiting to be exhibited in the space that was once his studio at the top floor of what was Albert Hall, now the College Street Coffee House, in his 125th year (March 16-April 24). Stepping into Boi-Chitra  the present name of this space  is like entering a high-ceilinged chamber of collective memory, which is occasionally resurrected through the discovery of fraying tissue-paper-layered cardboard-mounted studio portraits or crowded group photographs of our forebears.        
	Yet there was nothing frayed about the faces that look out of the black-and-white photographs, recovered from old negatives and archival prints. Hung among the books that Boi-Chitra displays, on the walls behind the elegant, yet oddly familiar, furniture that Guha used as props in his studio, behind his imposing Trioplan camera, his pioneering 1,000-watt light and spray-painting machine  his pictured men, women and children look straight at the viewer from the future with a vividly conscious possession of their here-and-now that only an artist behind the camera could have created.        
	Guha was trained as an artist at the Government School of Art in Calcutta. He had been born in what is now Bangladesh, and, after his professional interest swerved to photography during a trip to Darjeeling around 1905-06, he set up a photography studio in Dhaka. But his initial foray into photography in natural light died an early death. His destiny lay in Calcutta and a lifelong devotion to experimentation with artificial light in studio photography, in which he acquired excellence and fame. Not only did he experiment with novel light effects and with techniques such as airbrushing, he also crafted surfaces on furniture used as props, and specially designed frames that he carved and spray-painted himself.        
	The photographs on show date approximately between 1920 and 1956, culminating in a group photograph taken in Presidency College on the occasion of the farewell of Sushobhan Sarkar, the great teacher of history. Formal groups such as these have the effect of a strange-familiar world suddenly released from deep-freeze. How many people would be able to identify the incredibly young Alauddin Khan sitting with a violin in a group taken in the All India Radio offices, as Pankaj Mullick and the boy Ali Akbar stand in the last row, or not be cheerfully surprised at the sight of the actor, Jahar Ganguly, among the 1940 Mohun Bagan hockey team?        
	But the studio family groups are even more fascinating, each arranged differently  perhaps a group of seven women dressed in similar, but not identical, saris with zigzag stripes, spread out casually in an uneven line, sitting, leaning and standing with two children among them, or a mysteriously garlanded family of four, tightly arranged around two chairs and a table to prop up the baby of the family. One of Guhas preferred formations is a gentle, slightly broken, pyramid, with each group taken as if from a different plane.         
	Not just the rich or the Westernized, but the prosperous middle-class, too, loved the studio portrait and the studio group. Guha often asked his subjects to use his own chosen clothes and accessories, and would arrange, not just the light and angle but every detail, including the placing of the hands, to capture a mood. The effect of this is striking in his individual portraits: the dreamy or wondering gaze of women and children alternating with mischief, allure and naughtiness, the texture of skin and hair, the feel of garments, all emerging out of slightly blurred studio scenery and betokening the graceful enigma of a lived-in past. Some of that can be disturbing, as is the photograph of Ma Anandamoyee, standing straight with an adult male devotee at her feet hugging her tightly round the knees.         
	The organizers are trying their best to label each photograph, and are still in search of some identities and dates. While that is a flaw in curating, it somehow adds to the sense of traffic between the past and the present, a restlessness and a questioning that may be closest to the photographers spirit.

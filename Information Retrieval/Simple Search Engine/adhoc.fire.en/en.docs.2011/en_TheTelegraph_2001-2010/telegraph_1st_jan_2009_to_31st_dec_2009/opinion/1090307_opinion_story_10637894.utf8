The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Too colourful
                                                                                                               Too colourful
                            
	The exhibition of paintings titled Himalayan Mountains in Colour (Rabindranath Tagore Centre, ICCR, February 12-20) by the Japanese artist, Kouzui Shimoura, lived up to its name. One got to see the Himalayas dyed in the deepest tints of red or green, making them look less like mountains and more like cream cones in macabre shades. Paintings like the Annapurna or the Tawetse had prisms of green, yellow or pink against pitch-black backgrounds. In Invitation to nature, what was supposed to be a mountain peak as viewed from a window looked more like a block of ice cream framed by the red doors of the freezer. Some of the paintings had tacky, lumpy frames in gold for added effect. The titles were as ingenuous as the paintings themselves. For instance, a canvas with layers of green and blue that looked like a mouldy aquarium was titled Eternal shines. Dawn of Mountains showed indigo ranges floating in a crimson sea. Was it trying to depict daybreak (in) the mountains or the creation of the Himalayas?

	One of the first things that one noticed at Karam Puris exhibition at CC amp;FC (Feb 27-Mar 1) was the difference in quality between his colour and black-and-white prints. While some of the colour photographs looked garish, the monochromes were softer, subdued and better-composed. Is there something in the nature of black-and-white photography that makes photographers more careful about aesthetics? Perhaps, for in colour one can depend on an entire palette whereas in monochrome it is only greys  various degrees of it  and so the focus shifts to structure. The photographs of foliage and of a door with a bicycle in front, taken in subdued light, have a poetic quality, which is enhanced by the grainy print consequent to the use of high-speed film. Two of his colour prints  of the temple with rain clouds and the tomb  may raise questions about superimposing various shots of the same subject taken within a span of a few minutes. As a result, the light and the shadows in various sections of the compositions do not look synchronized. The light is in one direction and the shadows in another, and both images look like they were composed in a lab. These tricks were used long before the invention of high-definition range photography.

	As I look back, neither the un-ergonomic seating nor the clichd ill-omens associated with the date (Friday, March 13) had any effect on the opening tutti of the Fledermaus overture by Johann Strauss the younger, as it resounded within the Vidya Mandir auditorium in Calcutta. Conducted by the distinguished Joji Hattori, the Viennese Chamber Orchestra started with this popular overture. The coordination between the brass and the woodwinds was impeccable, the first clarinet performing the solos with poetic lan. The strings played with precision, concluding the overture in a robust staccato.        
	Hattori exchanged the conductors baton for the violin in the next piece, a transcription of the serenade from Haydns String Quartet Op. 3, No. 5, after which the orchestra delivered a delightful performance of Schuberts Symphony No. 3 in D major. It is a work that is imbued with the Austrian spirit, with its fast-paced Lndler and passages full of melancholy. Then came the high point of the evening, a breathtaking performance by the Shillong Chamber Choir under the guidance of Neil Nongkynrih, and accompanied by the Viennese Chamber Orchestra. Two songs from the 1965 film, The Sound of Music (My Favourite Things and Climb Every Mountain), were excellently performed.         
	The three-movement Folk Opera, composed by Nongkynrih, was performed to perfection by the choir and orchestra. The rhythmic first movement (Come to Celebrate) was effectively orchestrated with sparse use of the orchestral resources, with the cellos, double bass and kettle-drums dominating the introduction. It was successful in creating an authentic atmosphere of distant drums issuing out of the misty hills. The second movement (Where will I run to?) was a song of lament, and had a keyboard introduction, with Nongkynrih leading the choir from the keyboard.         
	This section also had some beautiful solos for the cello. The finale (A quarrel scene) was a fast movement with accentuated beats culminating in a triumphant coda. The interval was preceded by an Indian folk dance programme performed by schoolchildren that was unduly prolonged by a technical snag in the music system.         
	Unfortunately, by the time the second half of the programme started, half the auditorium was already empty. Notwithstanding the chatter of unruly children in the front rows, Hattori (as soloist/conductor) succeeded, yet again, in giving an inspired performance of Beethovens Romance in F major. Only the first movement of Beethovens Symphony No. 1 was performed because of time constraints, which deeply disappointed many serious lovers of music.         
	Hattori generously performed three encores. First, the spirited Thunder and Lightning polka by the younger Johann Strauss, and then the Blue Danube waltz with its unforgettable opening horns. The evening ended on a merry note with the Radetzky March by the Johann Strauss, Senior.

	Yosef Sheinin, the chief rabbi of Ashdod, was understandably distraught at the funeral of Irit Shetreet, one of four Israelis to be killed by Palestinian rockets since Israel launched its bombing campaign against the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip on Sunday. However, he was wrong to say that her death was the latest manifestation of 3,000 years of anti-Jewish hatred. The hatred is real, but its sources are a good deal closer, both in time and in space.        
	Western media coverage of current affairs rarely goes into their origins: even what happened last year or 10 years ago is treated as ancient history. So the fury and despair of the million and a half residents of the Gaza Strip can easily seem incomprehensible. Why do these Palestinians fire murderous rockets at innocent civilians in Sderot, Ashkelon, Ashdod, and even Beersheva?        
	Because thats where they come from. Only about a fifth of the Gaza Strips population is descended from people who lived in that barren stretch of land before 1948. The rest are people, or the children, grandchildren or great-grandchildren of people, who were driven out of what is now Israel, during the 1948 war; or they simply fled in fear and were not allowed to go home afterwards. Their homes were mostly in the south of former Palestine, in places like Sderot, Ashkelon, Ashdod and Beersheva.        
	This does not give them the right to launch rockets at the people who now live in those towns, of course, any more than Israel has the right to use its massive air power to pound the crowded Gaza Strip. But it does provide some context for what is happening now  and indeed, happens every year or so. This struggle is still about what it has always been about: the land. And the fact that Israel is killing a hundred Palestinians for every dead Israeli does not mean that the Israelis are winning.        
	Ehud Olmert, Israels interim prime minister, and Tzipi Livni, his successor as head of the Kadima party, and Binyamin Netanyahu, head of the Likud party and her principal rival for the prime ministership in next months election, all know that. They are all old enough to have watched Israel try to bash the Palestinians into submission half a dozen times before, and they know it does not work. But that is strategy, and this is politics.                
	No end in sight        
	For Israels political leaders, this is mainly about looking tough in front of an electorate that just wants someone to do something about the Palestinians and their rockets. Nothing much can be done, short of a peace settlement generous enough to reconcile them with the loss of their land, but Israeli politicians have to look like they are trying. Hundreds of people are dying in the Gaza Strip to provide that show. The Hamas leaders are equally cynical, since they know that every civilian death, and even every militants death, helps to build popular support for their organization.         
	There is a more profound issue behind all this, which is Israels right to exist versus the right of the Palestinians to their homeland, but we shouldnt get carried away with the unique moral dimension of all that. Its just one more conquerors-versus-previous-inhabitants conflict, like the European settlers versus the Indians in the Americas in the 18th century, or, for that matter, the Israelites versus the Canaanites 3,000 years ago. Those earlier conflicts were all settled by force, but the world has changed and force doesnt work so well any more. Israel has the power to hammer the Palestinians endlessly, but they dont give up and go away. Neither side can eliminate the other, as has been amply and repeatedly demonstrated.        
	That doesnt necessarily mean that this conflict will ultimately be settled by peaceful negotiation and compromise. It may mean that there will be no solution of any sort for the foreseeable future, just an endless series of bloody, indecisive clashes like the present one. Happy New Year.

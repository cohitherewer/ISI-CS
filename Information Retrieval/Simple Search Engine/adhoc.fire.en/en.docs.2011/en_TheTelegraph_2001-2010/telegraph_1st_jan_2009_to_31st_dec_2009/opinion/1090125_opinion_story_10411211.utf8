	Feeling stranded                  
	Sir  A few days ago, I tried to take a taxi to Tollygunge from the Patuli taxi stand. I was refused by all the six taxis standing in a row. I then beckoned a passing taxi, whose driver agreed to go to Tollygunge. The moment I did that, all the drivers from the stand rushed towards this driver and forbade him from picking up any passenger. Other people in the locality have had a similar experience. Drivers at the Patuli stand seem willing to accept only those passengers who are headed either for the airport or the Howrah station. But this imposition is unacceptable.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Berth right          
	Sir  I frequently travel by train and have always preferred the side upper berth. It gives one space to sit stretched all day long without being bothered. But now this luxury is no longer available, thanks to the introduction of the side middle berths  the railway administrations latest experiment in accommodating more passengers. The side upper berths have been refixed several inches above its previous position, thus leaving no head-space. During the day, the occupant of the side middle berth is expected to share sitting space with those on the opposite berths, thereby inconveniencing both himself and the occupants of these seats. Why is the passengers comfort being sacrificed like this?           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  It is necessary to add a few more bogies to the Lalgola passenger train. The train has had eight bogeys since its inception. Now that the load has increased considerably along the stretch, the train is perpetually overcrowded, with only a lucky few managing to get a seat. The elderly and the sick suffer a lot if they happen to travel by this train.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The lady who usually mans the ticket reservation counter at the Kharagpur railway station seems to be endlessly discussing family matters with customers. The useless conversation delays work, resulting in long queues. Others working at the counter also spend a lot of time taking calls on their mobile while passengers wait patiently for them to finish their conversation. There should be an opaque glass separating the railway employee from the ticket-buyers. Rail employees should also be prohibited from using their mobile phones when they are on duty.               
M. Gautam, Kharagpur

                        
	Con job          
	Sir  The finding that most government hospitals and private clinics in India do not have diagnostic or treatment facilities even for simple chronic illnesses like diabetes seems to have surprised Anoop Mishra, the chairman of the advisory board of the Chronic Care Foundation (Survey reveals health test hole, Jan 18). But this is hardly news for most people in the country. Despite boisterous claims by the health minister and the leaders of the medical community, the poor state of healthcare in India is evident from the reports of medical negligence that appear almost daily on the news pages. In the absence of any uniform health insurance system here, patients are often forced to cough up the exorbitant amounts demanded by private hospitals. Countless families are falling into financial ruin everyday because of this.           
	It is shocking that the survey found a dearth of even basic infrastructural facilities like the ambulance, which can be easily purchased by the hospitals that make such enormous profit at the cost of the patients.           
	Yours faithfully,

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | not for all
                                                                                                                 NOT FOR ALL                                                    
	Barack Obama wants to extend his hand if the Muslim world is willing to unclench its fist. But Calcutta prefers to keep its fist closed tight than offer the hand of help. On the day the United States of America, along with the rest of the world, was welcoming its first-ever black president (and one with a distinctly Muslim middle name), a 32-year-old Muslim man told The Telegraph about a strikingly different kind of reception he has received in the so-called cultural capital of India. Mohammed Asif Iqbal, an IT consultant, has proved himself many times over. This visually impaired young man has distinguished himself professionally, worked in the US, and earned the praise of a former Indian president. But clearly, all these were not good enough for him to get an apartment in the city, which prides itself for its hospitality and secularism. In his quest for a place to rent, Mr Iqbal has been repeatedly shown the door for having the wrong name. Investigation has now revealed that religious profiling prevails over many aspects of life in Calcutta. From renting a place to opening a bank account, Muslims are having to work that much harder for the fundamental rights they are entitled to as citizens of a democratic nation.        
	If an educated, successful and self-aware citizen like Mr Iqbal can be summarily denied accommodation for having a Muslim name, the daily trials of the less privileged members of the minority community are only to be imagined. Sectarian violence and hostility are not exactly unexpected elements in the Indian polity, but this discrimination of religious minorities is not taking place in Narendra Modis Gujarat or being engineered by the cadre of the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena. Such harassment would have been inexcusable anywhere, but all this is happening in West Bengal, a state ruled by an avowedly secular party  and this makes the shame of it all the more painful. The government, evidently, has failed to preserve the equality of individuals as enshrined in the Constitution. But in this failure, society, too, has much to answer for. The polity alone cannot change for the better if its people are unwilling to embrace newer, plural visions of life. The only way forward, as Mr Obama told his people yesterday, is based on mutual interest and mutual respect. West Bengal, and more so the Bengalis, would do well to heed his words.

	The museum of innocence 
  By Orhan Pamuk, Faber, Rs 599        
	In Book V of Inferno, as Dante meets the abject Francesca bemoaning her love for Paolo, he is moved to tears of sorrow and pity. When the poet asks her to tell him the source of her distress, Francesca laments that there is no greater sorrow/ than thinking back upon a happy time/ in misery. The memory of lost love, the curse that doomed Francesca to eternal hell, acts like a strange potion for Kemal, the narrator of Orhan Pamuks new novel and the founder of the eponymous, Museum of Innocence. Recalling the pleasures of love gone by, he swings between dizzy rapture and fits of deadening gloom, yielding to the palliative or poisonous force of remembrance.        
	Lovelorn and grief-stricken for most of the novel, Kemal is a study in self-absorption, like Drers Melencolia I. Afraid of suffering like Francesca, he makes a futile attempt to protect himself from the pains of love by resolving that the best way to preserve happiness may be not to recognize it for what it is. However, like Goethes Werther, he cant help luxuriating in that pain, sparked off by an obsession with the remnants of his past. His way of learning to live with loss is to exhume fleeting moments of happiness that may have been interred under layers of regret. In this pursuit, he spends years collecting, or retrieving from other collectors, an endless array of objects  posters, photographs, ticket stubs, cigarette butts, saltshakers, graters, china dogs, hairpins, earrings  preserving each item with scrupulous, even paranoid, care. The utter plainness of these objects is belied by the (often comically) exalted value they hold in Kemals mind. Displayed at the Museum of Innocence in his hometown, Istanbul, the assembled trivia coalesce into a vision of contentment that visitors can take comfort in. After all, Kemal asks, isnt the purpose of... a museum... to relate our memories with such sincerity as to transform individual happiness into a happiness all can share?        
	It takes him six decades to arrive at this wisdom, more than half of which time he spends pining away for the deceptively delicate beauty, Fsun. She is a poor distant relation who had earned disrepute by participating in a beauty contest even before finishing high school. Although Pamuk lavishes attention on the tender yet urgent love between the 30-year-old Kemal and 18-year-old Fsun, there is a hint of the perverse in their dalliance. One recalls Humbert Humbert and Lolita. A shopgirl at the Sanzelise boutique (the faux-Parisian name befitting the fake couture it sells), Fsun is an unlikely rival for the Sorbonne-educated sophisticate, Sibel, who is engaged to Kemal. But desire rushes in where common sense fears to tread. Kemal becomes so infatuated with Fsun that he breaks up with his fiance amid salacious rumours, withdraws from the circle of Istanbuls Bright Young Things, and falls prey to black moods.        
	Even at the cost of social isolation, he waits too long before trying to salvage his relationship with Fsun. She vanishes from Kemals life  as the evanescent Maddalena does from Marcellos in La Dolce Vita  the day after she attends his engagement party. (As Visconti does in the last great sequence of the ball in The Leopard, Pamuk deliciously prolongs the party as it runs into pages of sparkling chatter, whispered confidences and Jane Austenesque dancing).        
	Fsun is married off to a podgy and feckless cineaste called Feridun, whose penury is in striking contrast to Kemals wealth and success. She appears more worldly, even manipulative, and does not hesitate to humiliate the pathetic Kemal, who turns into putty in her hands. When Kemal tries to flirt (Love is the name given to the bond Kemal feels with Fsun whenever they travel along highways or sidewalks), Fsun retaliates piquantly (But isnt love what you feel when you cant see me?). The twin pains of the absence and the presence of the beloved  entering [the] bloodstream like an intravenous drip  become the bane as well as the cure of Kemals lovesickness.        
	The presence of Proust  master of nuance and scruple  is conspicuous in Pamuks tale. But fine as it is, the flow of Pamuks narrative never manages to attain the density or chiselled precision of Proustian elaboration. Kemals trials remain trapped in the honeyed elegance of words. The Proustian themes  jealousy, forbidden desire, frustration, self-destruction, lies, half-truths, intrigue and, of course, memory  are only too apparent. Marcels tea and madeleine become the nut-and-currant rolls that Kemal savours. However, unlike Marcels remembrances of his grandmother linked to that taste, Kemal quivers with barely concealed erotic delight. Possessed by the past, Kemal makes a fetish of his mementos, while Marcel erects intangible memorials to lost time. Fsuns rise in the pecking order  from shopgirl to jilted mistress to cold-hearted virago to society lady  echoes Odettes startling transformation from a grisette to Madame Swann in Proust. Finally, Kemal requests a character called Orhan Pamuk to tell his story. But unlike Prousts narrator, who is also the unofficial biographer of Monsieur Swann, the Orhan within the novel prefers to keep himself away from the limelight.        
	Pamuks unabashed homage to Proust comes from the lingering anxiety informing the world that he comes from. The vivid accounts of the Istanbul bourgeoisie, their eccentricities, gossip and superficiality, recall the teeming salons of the European comedy of manners. Prousts Paris, and its panorama of high life, provide an exquisite template for the Turkish beau monde. We read of luminous banquets at the Hilton, where men and women from an essentially conservative society can dance freely; of a picnic by the Bosphorus that is Manets Dejeuner sur lherbe; of shopping expeditions to the Continent for supplies of perfume; or even of the unanimous, though unspoken, consensus among the wealthy to give their daughters a French education, considered to be the epitome of refinement.        
	At the other end of this Euromania is fervent nationalism, revelling in the indigenous film industry churning out innumerable melodramas every week, and taking pride in the local Meltem soda endorsed by the German model, Inge, who, like Anita Ekberg in La Dolce Vita, takes Istanbul by storm, trailing her exalted foreignness. Always looking aslant at Europe from its margins, Kemals Turkey is a muddle of traditional family values, ancient rituals, archaic customs and an emerging modernity. It is also the land of martial law, coups, civil wars and failed communism  an unholy meeting ground of the worst in Asian and European political history.         
	When Pamuk looks past Kemals solipsism, he affords his readers a glimpse into a world wasted by forces more severe than thwarted love. Towards the end, as Orhan Pamuk takes over from Kemal, he does a quick Dickensian round-up of the major characters 30 years on. By this point, poor Kemal, at 62, has lost much of his coherence, making his monologues long-winded and tedious. One starts struggling with the prose, longing for the end, which comes with something of a whimper. Like Kemals belated epiphanies, Pamuks ending comes a good 50 pages too late.                    SOMAK GHOSHAL

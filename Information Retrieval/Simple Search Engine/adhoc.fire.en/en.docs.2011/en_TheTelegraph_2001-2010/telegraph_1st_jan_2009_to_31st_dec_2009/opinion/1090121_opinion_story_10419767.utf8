The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Great   expectations
                                                                                                                 Great   expectations
          The Unorganised Workers Social Security Act, 2008, promises to provide a safety net to millions of people in the unorganised sector. But its mechanism of implementation appears to be somewhat vague, argues Shabina Akhtar                          Hope at last: Workers such as rickshaw drivers will benefit from the new law                                         
	Noor Islam, a 27-year-old driver from Topsia, Calcutta, diligently drives his auto rickshaw every day to ferry people to their destination. For the sake of a few more rupees, he is ready to flout rules and overload his vehicle with one passenger too many. But in spite of all his efforts, he earns just about Rs 4,500 a month, with which he manages to keep his family afloat. And if he falls sick, or has an accident, he and his family  with no savings to fall back upon  are left high and dry.        
	Like thousands of rickshaw pullers, small farmers, sharecroppers, daily wage earners, rag pickers, beedi rollers and others, Noor Islam belongs to the unorganised sector  a section of society without access to any social security at all.        
	But all that is about to change. The Unorganised Workers Social Security Act, 2008, recently passed by both houses of Parliament, has given workers in the unorganised sector the much-needed and long overdue right to social benefits such as health insurance, pension plans, accident and disability coverage, and so on.        
	Drafted by the ministry of labour and employment, the law aims to provide social security to the roughly 450 million people associated with the unorganised sector  the self-employed and those working in small businesses, farms, construction sites, etc. It promises to do so via 10 basic social security schemes covering health insurance, accident and disability insurance, old age benefits, pension plans, housing schemes, maternity benefits, provident fund and other related benefits.        
	The new law advocates the setting up of advisory boards  at the Centre and at the state levels  to monitor the smooth operation of these schemes. It also stipulates that state governments should set up workers centres, run by the panchayats or the district administrative departments. To avail of social security benefits, a worker will have to register himself or herself with these centres and make a small and regular contribution to the benefit fund. The amount of the contribution is to be decided by the central government, the law states.        
	However, critics point out that despite its lofty goals, the law will falter when it comes to implementation. It took 60 years for a social security bill concerning the unorganised sector to be passed, but sadly, the law fails to deliver sound social security to all. It is probably one of the shallowest bills to be passed, for it fails to address the mechanism of implementation, says Hannan Mollah, member of Parliament, CPI(M).        
	V. K. Malhotra, member secretary, National Commission for Enterprises in the Unorganised Sector (NCEUS), begs to differ. It would be wrong to say that the bill lacks a mechanism of implementation. We plan to implement the bill, asking both the Centre and the states to constitute social security advisory boards to recommend suitable welfare measures for different sections of workers. Based on the proposals, the central government would then notify suitable welfare schemes to the beneficiaries.        
	However, experts are fairly unanimous that the law has left the process of implementation perplexingly vague. Suravaram Sudhakar Reddy, chairman of the standing committee on labour and employment which made several recommendations on the bill, points out that though the advisory boards are supposed to monitor the working of the welfare schemes, the act does not vest them with executive powers. Though the Union minister for labour and employment will be the chairperson of the central advisory board, he cant do much because the act does not give the advisory boards the power to execute the law. It merely says that the boards will give guidelines. The law is silent on exactly how these welfare schemes are to be implemented.        
	There is also concern that the law leaves it to the unorganised worker to take the initiative to go and register himself or herself to avail of the benefits. Calcutta High Court advocate Amjad Ali Sardar says, Why ask the worker to go and register himself? Why doesnt the government conduct a census to decide who are to be benefited? Moreover, the law doesnt talk about stern legal action against those contravening its provisions. It just says that one would have to pay a fine of Rs 5,000. However, it doesnt specify who the fine is to be paid to.        
	Legal experts also point out that the law may be severely hamstrung by the lack of adequate funding. The standing committee report had suggested the creation of a national fund to foot the bill, which the labour ministry ignored. The absence of a funding body has become its biggest drawback, says Reddy. He adds, Though the Planning Commission is to make a general allocation of Rs 15,000 crore annually towards the implementation of the law, one would need the finance ministrys nod to get the funds. In such a scenario, the advisory boards would have to wait for the annual budget to get the sanction for funds, which could well turn out to be much less than the suggested amount.        
	The law might be receiving flak from different quarters, but those associated with the unorganised sector feel that at least it caters to some of their demands. The bill does fall short of our expectations. Still, the government has given us a legislation to take care of those who really need it, says Mirai Chatterjee, director of the Self-employed Womens Associations (SEWA) social security programme in Ahmedabad. But the bill needs to be enriched with a proper budget. The labour department also needs to entrust trade unions like SEWA to enforce the bill in informal sectors, she adds.        
	Another point of the law that activists take issue with is the fact that it suggests that the benefits should be extended only to those who earn less than Rs 6,500 a month. (However, the government may alter the threshold amount as it sees fit). As a trade union member I feel that all workers in the unorganised sector, irrespective of what they earn, should get the benefits, asserts Chatterjee. And all of them should also contribute the minimum amount.        
	But the laws future beneficiaries are not worrying about whether or not it has loopholes. If such a law has been drafted to take care of our pension, insurance and housing, I am more than happy with it, says a delighted Noor. If by paying a small amount I can get insurance, then what more can I ask for?        
	It is now up to the government to deliver on that promise.

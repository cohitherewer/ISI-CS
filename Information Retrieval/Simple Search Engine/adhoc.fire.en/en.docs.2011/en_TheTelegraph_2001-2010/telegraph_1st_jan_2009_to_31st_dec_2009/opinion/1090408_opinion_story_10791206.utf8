	Light years        
	 While travelling with two children, a couple met with an accident. The couple and one of the children were injured. As the childs injury was minor, the insurance company with which the offending vehicle was insured settled the liability. But it resisted the remaining claim on account of the contributory negligence of carrying two additional passengers. The Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal also exonerated the owner of the offending vehicle and the insurance company on the same grounds. The victims approached the Kerala High Court, which held that since the Motor Vehicles Act barred the driver of a motorbike from taking more than one pillion rider, contributory negligence was a valid argument. However, as the children were of a tender age, their weight would not have made the vehicle unstable. The court held that the victims were entitled to 75 per cent of the compensation.

	Without consent        
	 In a rape case, the Allahabad High Court dismissed an appeal made by the state. The court felt that the victim may have been a consenting party as she was above the age of 16. Under the Indian Penal Code, rape is said to be committed even if it is done with the victims consent if she is under 16 years of age. The court also observed that there had been a delay in lodging the FIR after the rape. The state appealed to the Supreme Court, which held that the victims being above the age of 16 should not lead to the presump-tion that she was a consenting party. Directing a fresh hearing in the high court, the court added that while it was the complainants duty to explain a delay in the lodging of an FIR, it was not so in the case of rape.

	Willing wife        
	 After childbirth, a woman who was suffering from depression went to her parents house for treatment. When her husband filed a divorce case against her, the Andhra Pradesh High Court held that a wifes staying away from her husband for a long time did not justify divorce on the grounds of desertion. It did not indicate that the marriage had broken either. The court held that the divorce was not justified, more so since the wife was willing to join her husband.

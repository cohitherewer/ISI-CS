	White lies                  
	Sir  It seems that the railways minister, Mamata Banerjee, sought to embarrass her predecessor, Lalu Prasad, by tabling a white paper in the Lok Sabha (Mamata rips Lalu rail math, Dec 19). The document has apparently exposed the truth behind the myth of a turnaround in the railways during the tenure of Prasad, and has also contradicted Prasads claim that his term was the best period for the railways. Banerjee has asserted that the cash surplus of Rs 89,000 crore shown by Prasad when he was at the helm is inflated, and that the correct figure is Rs 39,500 crore. However, the fact remains that the railways did generate a surplus under Prasad. This has been rarely accomplished during previous regimes.          
	Instead of digging into the past, Banerjee should concentrate on improving the railways infrastructure. Banerjee has done a commendable job by speeding up idle projects. Her recent proposal to set up a coach factory in Singur has also found considerable support, especially among the people of West Bengal.          
	In any case, statistical figures concerning ministerial performance are subject to audit by the comptroller and auditor general of India. In recent times, several anomalies have been reported pertaining to various ministries. White papers are supposed to bring out facts that have been allegedly concealed. However, such documents should not be used to seek vendetta and gain political points. The taxpayers have a right to know the amount the government has earned in the form of revenue. After all, these funds are meant to be utilized to execute welfare projects for the people.                    
	Yours faithfully,        Prabhakar Bhattacharya,

	Sir  There is no reason to raise a hue and cry over the white paper presented by Mamata Banerjee in the Lok Sabha. The white paper does not throw any new light on Lalu Prasads performance as the railways minister. People were aware that Prasad was fudging the account books to show a cash surplus. Nitish Kumar had also described his rivals claims of a turnaround as a hoax much earlier. Questions had also been raised in the media, and by the CAG, over some of the measures that were adopted to make the railways profitable during Prasads reign. What is surprising is that it took the government six years to call Prasads bluff.          
	The railways minister presents a separate budget. But it is the collective responsibility of the council of ministers to examine the budget and point out the discrepancies, if any. The United Progressive Alliance, in its second stint, has refused to have any truck with the perpetrators of falsehood. But there is ample evidence to suggest that the earlier government, headed by the same coalition, was aware of the goings-on. Now that the cat is out of the bag, can the UPA government absolve itself from the charge that it had aided and abated fraudulent practices in its first five years?                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Magic cannot stand up to the scrutiny of reason. Thus, the magical performance of Lalu Prasad as the railways minister and his claims of being a management guru have now been proven to be nothing but a sham by Mamata Banerjee. Her white paper has clearly proved that under Prasad, the railways had made an improbable claim. At the time Prasad was taking credit for a turnaround in the railways fortunes, he was criticized for his inaction in Bihar. Prasad actually did very little to uplift the state during the time he was in power. These criticisms would probably grow stronger, now that the white paper about his performance in the railways has been made public.          
	Yours faithfully,        K.A. Solaman, 
Alappuzha, Kerala             
	Sir  Mamata Banerjee has brought to light the financial jugglery of Lalu Prasad. Will she now also look into the various levies that were imposed by Prasad and set them right? Charging passengers extra money for not booking tickets from the originating station is not fair. Under a computerized reservation system, the place from which a ticket is booked should not matter. The Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Limited also charges Rs 60 per E-ticket. The sum is certainly exorbitant, and the practice unfair. These charges cannot be justified. But they may have generated a lot of funds that need to be accounted for.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  The brave act of Arpita Das Kanungo, who chased down the rogue bus driver who had almost killed her four-year-old son, will, in all probability, go in vain (Mother fights rogue driver, Dec 5). Kanungo ultimately succeeded in getting the driver arrested, but she and her husband suffered serious injuries in the process. The driver surely enjoys the support of a trade union or political party. They may play an instrumental role in getting the errant driver out of trouble. With Kanungo being the sole victim in this particular incident, it is highly unlikely that the police will pursue the case with adequate interest. An early conviction and just punishment for the rogue driver can thus be ruled out simply because there is not much of an incentive in this for the police, financially or otherwise.          
	This is not an isolated case of irresponsible and reckless behaviour by the driver of a commercial vehicle. Drivers of commercial vehicles in West Bengal are responsible for several casualties in Calcutta as well as in the suburbs. Unfortunately, there are very few reports in the media of the perpetrators being meted out adequate punishment.           
	Yours faithfully,

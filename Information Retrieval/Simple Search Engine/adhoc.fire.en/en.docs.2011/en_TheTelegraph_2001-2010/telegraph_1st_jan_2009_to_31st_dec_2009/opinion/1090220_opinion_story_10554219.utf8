	Adventures with a blind frog            
	NOSE UNCLE (Puffin, Rs 200) by Jaspar Utley introduces a brand new detective known by the unlikely name of Uncle Nose. This may not be a name suited to a sleuth, but Uncle Nose is not quite Sherlock Holmes. And he is inordinately proud of his facial feature  the magnificent organ that would have been the envy of Julius Caesar or Chief Sitting Bull. Indeed, he has every reason to feel this way. As a professional archaeologist, it is this precious organ that helps him sniff out hidden treasures, just as it comes in handy when he is on another kind of trail pursuing criminals. When his brothers children, Nisha and Ram, visit Uncle Nose at his farm for their vacations, they feel depressed by the prospect of unmitigated boredom. But what awaits them is beyond their wildest imaginations. First, a chance to help out Uncle Nose on his project of exhuming an ancient Roman port. Then an encounter with a group of mysteriously suspicious characters. Written in a style that brings to mind the stories of Ruskin Bond and R.K. Narayans Malgudi Days, this is a delightful tale bristling with excitement.                               
	Binu and the Great Wall (Penguin, Rs 325) by Su Tong is a retelling of the tale of Binu, who lost her husband, Qiliang, when he was abducted and forced to labour on the grand, but frightening dream of building the Great Wall. Born in Peach village, Binu is prone to shedding tears. This wins her the disapproval of her neighbours, who forbid any form of weeping or wailing. On losing her husband to the whims of the emperor, Binu braves a perilous journey across the Great Swallow Mountain with only a blind frog for company. This passionate story, interlaced with magical dreams and dreadful nightmares, has been translated from the Chinese by Howard Goldblatt and included in The Myths series, which features some of the best writers retelling celebrated myths in a contemporary idiom. In a list dominated largely by myths from the Western world, this oriental tale lends a rich freshness.                        
	An Introduction to the Hindu Faith (Sterling, Rs 125) by John R. de Lingen is a collection of prayers gathered from the Vedas and the Gita by a Russian who led a colourful life as a soldier, scholar and then as minister of a Scottish Kirk in Mauritius. One wonders how these fragments, and the collectors ramblings, could be audaciously called an introduction to something as complicated and esoteric as Hinduism. But the editor, Pahlad Ramsurrun, and Bhavanilal Bharatiya, who provides the foreword, do not seem to be forthcoming with any convincing explanation either.

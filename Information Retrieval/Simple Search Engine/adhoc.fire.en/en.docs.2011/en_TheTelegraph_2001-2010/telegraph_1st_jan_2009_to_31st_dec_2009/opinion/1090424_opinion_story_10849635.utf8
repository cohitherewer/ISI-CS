                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Black or white?                  
	Sir  I found Ashok V. Desais article, Advanis faux pas (April 21) very funny but out of context. Every Indian knows that money is being sent abroad and stashed away in foreign banks. These are mostly bribes, stolen from government funds and untaxed corporate profits. This money, in turn, is enjoyed by politicians, bureaucrats and corporates on their foreign sojourns. So why should there be any confusion at all? Why should we make fun of L.K. Advani because he has talked about the money? As citizens of this country, every right-thinking person should support Advanis plan of bringing back the money.           
	Desai, in a strange turn of analysis, takes the whole issue to technical discussion beyond the comprehension of the common man. At the end of the piece, he takes the fight to Advanis court to challenge him that the trillions are elusive and that he will fail to bring them back. Should we stop trying to fight wrongs just because we cannot put an end to them in the next 30 years, as Desai implies?          
	Yours faithfully,       
Deba Pratim Ghatak, Durgapur 

                
	Sir  Ashok V. Desai, while discussing a serious topic like black money, has needlessly castigated the Bharatiya Janata Party by declaring that The Hindutwit leadership is overwhelmingly male dominated. I dont think that Desai believes that other parties are not. Moreover, outfits like the Bahujan Samaj Party and the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, headed by women, are not paragons of excellence. A political party is judged by its performance, not by its gender composition.           
	However, I agree with Desai that L.K. Advani would not be able to bring back the money kept in Swiss banks by Indians. This is because the government does not have the power to force Indians to repatriate their foreign savings. If the money was accrued and earned in India, at the most the income tax department could have imposed revenues and penalties  but that the money was earned in India would be difficult to prove anyway. In the meantime, the money will find other safe havens elsewhere in the world. Had recovering the money been easy, a Congress or non-Congress government would have done so long back and earned all the laurels.          
	Assuming there is black money in the Swiss banks, the best way of bringing it back is to follow the example of Sweden. After World War II, Sweden decided that those who invested in building houses would not be asked to disclose the source of their money. As a result, black money generated in Sweden was invested in real estate and the acute housing problem was also solved. Once invested, the money became white and the government reaped taxes as well. India, too, following the Swedish model, can give incentives to its citizens holding foreign currency in Swiss banks to invest in certain industries at home  no questions asked about the status of the money. This will enable us to tide over our shortages and retrieve the black money at the same time.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Ashok V. Desai underscores various economic models that evaluate possible illicit outflows of a country. Based on the Global Financial Integrity Project estimates, he justifiably concludes that Indias net illicit capital outflows of close to $22 billion (about 3.5 per cent of the nations gross domestic product) is nowhere close to the trillions Hindutwits dream of bringing back home. But he need not have gone that far in analysing whether L.K. Advani would succeed in his mission of getting back to India the vaunted billions from Swiss banks. Even if Advanis quantitative estimates were true, he is unlikely to do any such thing even if he becomes the prime minister. He will probably altogether retract his claim and humbly apologize. Indian politicians have always released populist manifestos to challenge their opponents. But seldom have their pledges been kept after they have been elected. Had Advani been an efficient leader, he would have kept his vow of building a temple on the Babri Masjid site. That he did not clearly shows he did have Muslims in mind, and was afraid of triggering another riot. Financial advisors like Desai need not waste their time analysing the economic aspects of election manifestos, for all of them are faux pas indeed.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  The Indian hockey team deserves to be lauded for winning the Azlan Shah Cup after 13 years by beating Malaysia in the five-nation tournament. Credit goes to the team-work and the superb performance of the players. Hopefully, the team will also be in top form for the upcoming World Cup and the London Olympics.           
	Yours faithfully,

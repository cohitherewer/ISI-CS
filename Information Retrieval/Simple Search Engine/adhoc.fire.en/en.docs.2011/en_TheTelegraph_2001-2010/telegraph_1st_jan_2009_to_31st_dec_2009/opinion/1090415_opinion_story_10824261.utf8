	Patched up        
	 When the Judicial Magistrate First Class Gwalior convicted a man, along with his parents, for abusing his wife under Section 498A, they appealed against the order. Before the conviction, the civil court had granted them a decree of divorce by mutual consent. But the parties sorted out their differences and arrived at a compromise. However, the first appellate court as well as the Madhya Pradesh High Court rejected the compromise. The husband then appealed to the Supreme Court. The court quashed the criminal proceedings stating that the wife was not pressing the charges against the husband and his parents, who were ailing, carrying on with the proceedings would be an abuse of the process of law.

	Changing roles        
	 When a cheque was dishonoured, the payee sent a notice under the provisions of the Negotiable Instruments Act intimating the payer about it and demanding the payment of the amount due. But he died soon afterwards and his widow filed a criminal complaint. A case was registered against the payer. The accused raised a plea that only the payee and not his legal representative could petition. Referring to the provisions of the Negotiable Instruments Act, the Karnataka High Court held that a complaint could be made by the payee or holder in due course. A holder in due course was the person who possessed the cheque, and hence, the widow was entitled to filing a complaint. (Ashok Kumar vs Dr T.R. Bhagirathi)        
	Too personal              
	 A retired statistical inspector made an application seeking details of the assets and liabilities of a public official. The Karnataka High Court held that a citizen didnt have the right to seek personal information about officials of public authority under Right to Information Act. When his application was rejected, the retired inspector appealed and the appellate authority allowed the application. The public official then approached the high court. The Karnataka High Court held that the intention of the act was to provide information to a citizen pertaining to public affairs and not to provide personal details. (H.E. Rajashekarappa vs State Public Information Officer and Under Secretary to Government)

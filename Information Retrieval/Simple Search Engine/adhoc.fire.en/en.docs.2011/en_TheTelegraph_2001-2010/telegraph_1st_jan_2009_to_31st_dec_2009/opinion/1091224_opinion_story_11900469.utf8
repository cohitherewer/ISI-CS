	The old order in the Bharatiya Janata Party is changing even though it has taken a very long time to change. The BJP, ever since it was formed, has been dominated by Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Lal Krishna Advani  some would argue that it has also been determined by their rivalry. Mr Vajpayee, the abler politician of the two, apparently tried to steer the BJP away from hardline Hindutva and the influence of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. Ill health and age have kept him away from politics for some time. Mr Advani is more difficult to pin down since he once rode the tiger of Hindutva, got off it and tried to don the mantle of moderation. These changes in his position convinced no one, especially those that run the RSS. Mr Advani also showed a singular reluctance to hand over the baton to a younger generation despite the many reversals his party has suffered in the elections. This gave to the BJP a geriatric look. Fortunately, this has now changed with Sushma Swaraj becoming the leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha in place of Mr Advani. This change has gone hand-in-hand with Nitin Gadkari being made president of the BJP. It remains to be seen whether these changes are substantial or only at the level of personnel.        
	For any substantive change to take place within the BJP, it is necessary for the party to cut its umbilical link with the RSS. Since its inception, in spite of the valiant attempts of Mr Vajpayee, the BJP has been a kind of puppet with the puppeteers holding the strings in Nagpur, the headquarters of the RSS. The latter, even when it did not decide all the policies of the BJP, actually held the ultimate veto in all matters. This state of affairs may not have radically altered with the appointments of Ms Swaraj and Mr Gadkari. In fact, there are reasons to suspect that these appointments have been made at the behest of Nagpur. The puppeteers may have chosen a different set of puppets. The challenge before the BJP is to fashion itself into a party that can claim to speak with a degree of credibility for all Indians and not just for a section of Hindus in north India. The vision of the RSS, if it continues to dominate the BJP, will not even allow a recognition of this challenge. The new leadership will have to exorcize, if it at all wants to, its internal demons before it can take on external enemies. Indian politics can be described as the maximization of the impossible but a return of the BJP may be a forlorn hope.

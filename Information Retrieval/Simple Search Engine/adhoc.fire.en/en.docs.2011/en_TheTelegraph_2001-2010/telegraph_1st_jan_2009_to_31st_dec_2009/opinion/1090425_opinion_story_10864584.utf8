	Right to vote                  
	Sir  I feel proud that I voted yesterday. Everybody who is above 18 years of age should vote because it is our constitutional right. Your one vote could change the fate of the country, and if you are not voting then you have no right to criticize our politicians. The other thing I want to convey is that you must not be under any pressure while voting. Give your precious vote to your preferred candidate. Your vote matters because it is through this vote that the future of the country is decided. So please be a responsible citizen and vote.           
	Yours faithfully,         Rupa. R, Jamshedpur 
        
	Culture and the city          
	Sir  I must thank Amit Roy for his kind report on my talk at the London Book Fair, but of course any reader will see that the account of the talk after the first sentence is at variance with that sentence (and with the misleading title given to the report) (Calcutta low crime linked to books: Sen, April 21). What I had said was not that Calcutta has the lowest crime rate in the world because of the civilizing effects of books, but that there is a connection between violent crime and culture that demands certainly some research. As Amit Roy goes on to report (after that unfortunate first sentence), I said: Does the peculiar love of books and culture, and here I would add Calcuttas fondness for theatre too (often produced at very low cost), have a role here? I dont really know, and there is no rigorous work on this that has properly tested any of the possible hypotheses.          
	Behind the need for more research on the connection between culture and violent crime are three remarkable facts: (1) Calcutta has, by a substantial margin, the lowest rate of homicide among all the major cities in the world; (2) Calcutta is also a city with extreme poverty (indeed the global fame of Calcutta seems to lie in this sad feature), and it is abundantly clear that the standard explanation of crime in terms only of economic poverty does not tell us much; and (3) Calcutta has some special cultural features, including a longer and more popular history of urban theatre than in any other Indian city and its book fair being the largest  in terms of attendance  in the world. To want an investigation of the connections, if any, is not the same thing as having a ready-made conclusion. Since the title and the first sentence of Amit Roys report will raise many eyebrows (mine included), may I commend strongly the accuracy of the rest of Amit Roys fine report  barring that one sentence (and the headline the newspaper has used to present the report)? Since some people seem unable to read a news story beyond the headline, I anticipate a storm of protests on my naivety based on headline-reading.          
	What results do I expect would emerge from serious empirical investigations? I dont know, but my guess (and it can be no more than a guess until the empirical data are subjected to proper analysis) is that there are some constituent features of culture in the broadest sense that both influence violent crime (including the incidence of homicide), and the way people live (including the role of literature, the arts, the music, the addas, and other forms of amusement). I have discussed these issues more fully in an earlier essay, Poverty, War and Peace in The Little Magazine, vol. 7, nos. 3 and 4, 2008.          
	The lives we lead are influenced not only by economic prosperity and penury, but also by social and cultural relations. The important thing, right now, is to dispute the often-repeated belief that poor people tend also to be criminals, thereby adding severe insult to manifest injury.                    
	Yours faithfully,

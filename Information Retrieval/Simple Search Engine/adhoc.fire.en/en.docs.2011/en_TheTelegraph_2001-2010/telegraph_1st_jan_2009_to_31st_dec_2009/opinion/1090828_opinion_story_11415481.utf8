The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A tale of two brothers
                                                                                                                 A TALE OF TWO BROTHERS                          - With friends in the right places, monopoly is easy        Cutting corners -   Ashok Mitra                          Joan Robinson                                              
	Maybe it was in her upbringing. Joan Robinsons father was, after all, a general in the British army during World War I. She had always a no-nonsense approach to life and things, and could not suffer fools. She could not suffer foolish ideas either. As a young lecturer in Cambridges economics faculty in the early 1930s, she was bothered by the assumption of the free market, which was the starting point of the economics she had to impart to her students. The free market postulated the existence of an infinite number of sellers and an infinite number of buyers. But, Joan Robinson snorted, in real life one never came across an infinite number of sellers or producers. The number of producers in any line of manufacture might be sizeable, but by no means countless. Very often they were only a handful. Since the empirical foundation of existing economic theory was so weak, the prescriptions based on it could hardly be relied upon to either cure the ills of society or nurture it to growth and prosperity.         
	Joan Robinson made up her mind; she had to do something about it. She sat down to work, and developed an alternative concept of the market structure more truthfully reflecting the realities of life. The result was the Economics of Imperfect Competition, which immediately set the river of economic theory on fire. She showed that even if there were initially a moderately large number of sellers or producers in any branch of production, there was a tendency for this number to reduce. The more efficient and resourceful among the producers gradually weed out the less efficient and less resourceful ones, until a stage arrives when supplies to that particular market come under the grip of a single seller or producer. This single producer, Joan Robinson demonstrated, had a single goal: the maximizing of profit, which is made possible through restricting the output and hiking the price of the product. Her tour de force dealt a lethal blow to the belief fostered by traditional economic analysis that the free market ensures ideal output and a just price for all. The free market, she snorted, ends up in restrictive output and monopolistic price-setting.              
	The market is not free, the market is not perfect; it is dominated by a few, the monopolists. Even so, one fact is incontrovertible: a monopoly does not spring overnight, there is a market process, a certain number of entrepreneurs engage against one another, confrontation takes place between competing bunches of resources, strategies and skills, temporary successes alternating with temporary setbacks. In the final round, though, one of the entrepreneurs leaves the others behind, lagging rivals drop out, the one left in the field establishes a monopoly. It may be a long process, or a short one, but the emergence of a monopoly in a capitalist system entails a course of toil and application.         
	Not so, apparently, in post-1991, economically liberalized India, if the recent goings-on in the nations energy sector are to be taken as criterion. Not that the nation has been privileged to know much of these proceedings; the ministry of petroleum and natural gas, the formal custodian of the sector, jealously guards its secrets. But some facts have now become public knowledge by courtesy of the spat between two brothers belonging to an entrepreneur family. The revealed knowledge poses a challenge to Joan Robinson on one significant point.        
	Natural gas is a crucial source of energy; the Indian peninsula is supposed to have reserves of oil and natural gas amounting to billions and billions of dollars. During the long reign of Jawaharlal Nehru, one of his ministers, Keshav Dev Malviya, bubbling over with enthusiasm, took the pledge to develop this precious source of energy in the public sector. He set up the Oil and Natural Gas Commission and the Indian Oil Corporation: the former was to be solely in charge of upstream activities such as exploration and development; downstream activities, including distribution, would be in the care of the IOC, although private parties too would not be quite left out.         
	Malviya had spun out his logic. Explorations of oil and natural gas call for huge investment of funds. In case State agencies had a major share of the market for their distribution, the net earnings from there could be ploughed back and deployed upstream to hasten the pace of exploration and development. Malviya ceased to be a minister in the mid-Sixties, but the ONGC sprouted roots, so much so that within a couple of decades one-third of the countrys total energy needs came to be met from the fields it had developed. The IOC too enlarged its operations. With the withdrawal of some private, mostly foreign, distributing agents, the public sector in the distribution of oil got further enlarged. Another public undertaking, the Gas Authority of India, soon joined them.        
	Nineteen ninety-one changed all that. The animal spirit of our entrepreneurs, it was officially felt, needed to be given free rein in the energy sector too. A new exploration and licensing policy was announced. Licences for the exploration of development blocks were to be auctioned. Private entities which won the auctions would have exclusive rights to develop the blocks and sell the output. A National Hydro Power Corporation was established to monitor these upstream activities, including such things as determination of production cost and selling price. Similarly, the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board was constituted to oversee arrangements downstream, including issue of franchise to selling agents. But, under the neo-liberal sky, the regulatory arrangements went haywire. Everything was assumed to be fine and excellent with private operators, the animal spirit tucked within their souls must not be interfered with. And if some private parties were particular pets of ruling politicians, all rules were apparently rendered irrelevant. Transparency has been rubbed out. Few details are available on the nature of the auctions of the development blocks, the conditions under which licences were granted to particular parties, the selling price that was settled, or royalty agreed to. In a parallel manner, details regarding the price at which oil or natural gas was to be disposed of downstream and the modalities for choosing agents have been kept under the cloak. It has been a vast area of darkness.               
	It is only on account of the happenstance of a domestic feud that some grisly facts are suddenly out in the open. A family conglomerate was allowed to establish a monopoly in both the production of natural gas in a lush Deccan basin as well as in its distribution and further processing downstream. It was a cosy fraternal arrangement between two brothers, one sibling would handle affairs at the development end, the other one would be sold the bulk of the output at a ludicrously low price; whatever was left would be sold to public entities such as the GAI and the National Thermal Power Corporation at inordinately high prices. The prices the public sector units would be called upon to pay would be determined on the basis of the claim of capital outlay posted by the first brother amounting to as much as Rs 45,000 crore. The comptroller and auditor general of India, ombudsman of the nations public accounts, has not till now been allowed to audit this claim. Both the NHPC and the PNGRB have gone into hibernation.         
	The family, however, broke up. The two brothers turned into sworn enemies; the brother at the production end reneged on the earlier understanding to sell the bulk of the output to his sibling at an absurdly low price, the aggrieved brother has now gone to court. The nation has thereby learned how, in a neo-liberal regime, the countrys assets can be deployed to serve exclusively the interests of a single family.         
	This tale of two brothers illustrates how monopoly can be made easy. Joan Robinsons depiction of a process through which monopoly gets established is not that essential. An entrepreneur need not prove himself superior to his competitors in the battlefield of the market before gaining the monopoly. A different route is possible. If you have friends in the right political quarters, a monopoly will be gifted to you on a platter.

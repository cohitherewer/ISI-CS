The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Smelling trouble
                                                                                                                 SMELLING TROUBLE                          - Without a show of power, India is an easy diplomatic target        BRIJESH D. JAYAL                                                          
	As this piece is read, both the prime minister attending the G-20 conference in Pittsburgh and the external affairs minister attending the United Nations general assembly in New York will have winged their way back to the warm embrace of friendly air. Both would have truly earned the solitude of their entitled class of travel notwithstanding the superficial cattle class debate that consumed hours of prime television time in India  without in any way contributing to the larger issue of national governance.         
	Each in his own way will no doubt be immensely relieved, considering the flood of bad news that battered India from all sides, originating mainly from the very shores belonging to the country whose president was told by the prime minister that the former was loved by India. But that was a year ago. And one year in todays dynamic and complex world, with competing security, environmental, trade and financial challenges, can well be an eternity.        
	Peeved at being denied his Bedouin tent, Colonel Gaddafi fired the first salvo by declaring in his maiden marathon speech to the UN general assembly that Kashmir should be an independent buffer state between India and Pakistan. Coming from a country considered friendly, this just about set the agenda for what was to follow. Our delegation, one must assume, was so taken aback that even the tokenism of walking out missed them.        
	Soon followed the Wall Street Journal interview with the external affairs minister that quoted him as saying, India doesnt believe that war can solve any problem and that applies to Afghanistan also. I think there could be a political settlement. I think we should strive towards that. Since the principal adversary there is the Taliban, this was logically interpreted by many to imply a conciliatory approach towards the Taliban. Before political backlash could gather momentum, the ministry of external affairs was compelled to duck and clarify that the minister did not advocate a political settlement with the Taliban, although what precisely he meant was left to ones imagination.              
	As luck would have it, the external affairs ministers problems were not about to end soon. The unclassified version of the much awaited report by General Stanley McChrystal, the commander of American and North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces in Afghanistan, to the secretary of defence also made it to the press around this time. Under the heading external influences, the report states: Indian political and economic influence is increasing in Afghanistan, including significant development effort and financial investment. In addition, the current Afghan government is perceived by Islamabad to be pro India. While Indian activities largely benefit the Afghan people, increasing Indian influence in Afghanistan is likely to exacerbate regional tension and encourage Pakistani counter measures in Afghanistan or India.         
	Unsaid in the generals eagerly awaited assessment to his commander-in-chief is the thesis that if the United States of America wishes to pull Pakistan back from its suicidal brink in Afghanistan, then reduced Indian contribution in Afghanistan is a way forward. Apologists for Pakistan may term this as incidental, but knowing Pentagons traditional soft corner for the Pakistan military and the latters historic mastery of using the US to further its own strategic goals, one can guess the origin of this conclusion. Whilst the external affairs minister was constrained publicly to differ with these views, many commentators noted that there were differing perceptions even within the Obama administration. One only hopes that the confidential part of the generals report contains no further adverse surprises for India, although we may never know.        
	Even as the foreign minister was ducking these diplomatic missiles, the US president was jointly chairing a meeting of the Friends of Democratic Pakistan, a group of 26 countries. The other co-chairs were the prime minister of the United Kingdom and the president of Pakistan, who, in his address to the UN general assembly, made it a point to display a photograph of Benazir Bhutto on the rostrum. One wonders what champions of democratic Pakistan made of this unusual gesture. Addressing the group, the US president said, We also face a common threat. The violent extremists within Pakistan pose a threat to the region, to the United States, and to the world. Above all, they threaten the security of the Pakistani people. He further added, We know that there are difficult challenges ahead. But that is why we must remain focused, we must be committed and we must stay together. As Pakistan makes progress, the United States will be there as a partner. Buoyed by these lofty sentiments, Asif Ali Zardari claimed, A stable, prosperous Pakistan is the worlds greatest hope against extremism.         
	Had the US president been even remotely sensitive to Indias security concerns and, indeed, concerned about terrorism being used selectively as State policy by Pakistan, some advice or hint of caution on the unacceptability of State-sponsored terrorism would have been in order at the FDP gathering. As it was, the double standards of the international democratic order were there for all to see.         
	It was left to the prime minister to respond indirectly when, at Pittsburgh, in replying to a question, he made it clear that talks with Pakistan could only commence when the latter does away with the policy of using terrorism as an instrument of State policy. This, no doubt, was as much a message to the worthy FDP as it was to his US hosts and our friends across the western frontiers. Not surprisingly, the Pakistan foreign ministry spokesman was quick to respond, saying that world leaders had lauded Pakistans efforts against terrorism in the recent meeting of the FDP, though India was unable to realize this.        
	The brave words spoken at the FDP gathering were in the backdrop of the Senate vote for the Kerry-Lugar bill of aid to Pakistan of about US $1.5 billion per year through to 2014. They were also spoken not long after General Pervez Musharraf, the once US poster-boy, openly boasted in a TV interview that under his stewardship Pakistan had diverted US aid meant to fight terrorists against India. And just to prove his commando credentials, he had added that he did not care what the US thought since he was acting in the interests of Pakistan.         
	In an interview, Bruce Riedel, the official who shaped Barack Obamas Afghanistan strategy, rightly said that there was no foolproof guarantee against Pakistan transferring US military technology to its advantage against India. He said nothing new, since Patton tanks, Star fighters and Stinger missiles have all in the past been used against India with the knowledge of the international community. Indeed, as the saying goes, a gun that fires only in one direction is yet to be invented. So why is it that we in India never tire of making pro forma appeals to the US, as indeed the external affairs minister did in a public statement quoting General Musharrafs so-called disclosure? India needs to get real. In the world of international diplomacy, the only language that speaks louder than words is military power and the perceived will to use it. Perception that India possesses neither makes it an easy diplomatic target.              
	To top all this diplomatic buffeting came the US-sponsored and Obama-driven resolution at the UN security council, which was being presided over for the first time by a US president himself. The resolution on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation, adopted unanimously, asked all countries to sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. Anticipating this move, Indias permanent representative to the UN, Hardeep Puri, had already written to the president of the security council, Susan Rice, indicating that India cannot accept calls for universalization of the NPT and any obligations arising from treaties that India has not signed or ratified, and this position was consistent with the fundamental principles of international law and the Law of Treaties. This fell on deaf ears.        
	In Pittsburgh, the prime minister reiterated Indias well known position on not being a party to a discriminatory NPT. The secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, was quick to smoothen ruffled feathers by saying that the UNSC resolution was not aimed at India. While this is clearly diplomatic waffle, it is a multi-warhead missile still in flight, and India will need all its diplomatic and political capital to come out unscathed. Indeed, unfolding events may adversely impact the much hailed Indo-US civil nuclear cooperation agreement.        
	Earlier in the year, Clinton had paid a five-day visit to India, spending more time with NGOs and in TV studios than in the South Block. Soon thereafter it was announced that the prime minister would be the first head to be the State guest of President Obama. Indian ego was amply massaged. Could it be that all this is a prelude to what in military parlance is called softening the target? Time will tell.

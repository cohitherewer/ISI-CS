	What cares these roarers for the name of king? a Shakespearean sailor asks in the middle of a great storm, his grammar deserting him and his ship full of kings, princes and courtiers about to go down. Democracy, like tempests and death, is supposed to be a leveller. (It is usually less dramatically so than the other two.) So the Congress has issued a stern ban on the official use of honorific titles by members of royal families of whatever pedigree. So no more Maharajas, Maharanis, Rajkumars and the like  and this, nearly forty years after Indira Gandhi had rendered them economically toothless. The latest move makes perfect sense, especially since it bars parliamentarians and legislators from using their titles in office, a practice that was more common than one would imagine in the 21st century. But royalty is one thing and feudalism another. The party might have to do a lot more cleaning up  and in the highest places  before the culture of the Congress is purged of the attitudes behind the titles.        
	Now that the matter has come to the fore again, what cannot be ignored is how many Indian politicians and leaders, many of them in the Congress, still do happen to be royalty of some sort. The historical relationship between Indias democratic modernity and its feudal past has been more continuous than its right-minded leaders would like to admit. Besides, there is a kind of residual and archaic conservatism in retaining titles like Kumari and Madam while banning the rest. The former identifies maidenhood with virginity  an assumption that the Congress might be forced to give up under pressure from reality. And the latter, at least in the country that taught India to use the word, is only used to address the queen and to refer to personages altogether less respectable than the Congress would like to imagine. So these should be roared down too. Shri and Shrimati should suffice.

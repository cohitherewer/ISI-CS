                                                                                                                 WAIT AND WATCH                                  With elections round the corner, how do photographers, patuas and graffiti artists depict the leaders and the led?                                            
	The leader comes to your door. Democracy breeds its own peculiar rituals, its own tokens of self-belief, of which this is one. With the leader come the partys colours, its promises, and a frank plea for votes. There is a shamelessness in the exercise that cannot quite be compensated for by a transient glimpse of the candidates apparent humility. Yet, the ritual is seen as indispensable: every five years, it reminds people that it is their vote that creates the power structure, that they are the basis of power. In India today, that reminder is likely to be invested with a sense of unreality. The connections have long ceased to be simple. That is particularly so when the election is not local, when those to come to power will sit in Delhi, a distant, even frightening, place for thousands of Indias voters.         
	The witty perspective of the picture above (by Goutam Pramanik, Ananda Bazar Patrika, March 30) makes visible the ironies of the ritual encounter. An outsider, who knows neither leader nor party colours, would have no difficulty in recognizing the nature of the ritual  the urgency of the leaders plea to the voter caught in a fleeting moment of contact, the paraphernalia of the governing class and the earthy sparseness of the governed brought face to face in a mutual need for survival, the dramatic impact of suddenly looking upon a leaders face in the midst of dusty routine.         
	The picture is built on contrasts. The white of Pranab Mukherjees jeep and apparel, and the pristine brightness of the party colours round his neck, set off the sunburnt skin, dull blue and khaki shirt and faded gamchha of the villager squatting by the roadside, a theme that is repeated in a minor key by the white cap of the leader and the worn toka of the sitting man. The minister has not come literally to his door, but only metaphorically. The convoy is speeding past him on an unpaved road, raising a cloud of dust that masks the white car arrayed with foglights following the jeep. As if in counterpoint, the man sits, silent and still, his dust-whitened bare feet strikingly present in the right foreground. He holds a slender stick cut from a twig or from bamboo, which he holds steady before him like a badge of identity.        
	We do not see the mans face; he is looking upwards and away from us towards the passing leader. He is right before us, on the ground, a position from close to which the camera too looks upwards at an angle. So the unknown man is bigger, more sensuously present, than the minister; he and his stick fill more than one-third of the visible space. With his slightly bent back and thin, graceful limbs, his earthbound, comfortable posture, his facelessness, his toka and his stick, he is transformed by the composition from an individual villager to the enduring, resilient soul of a deprived rural India, apparently unmoving, but potentially powerful. The distribution of power in the photograph thus becomes complex, puzzling. The leader leans sideways and forward, his hands together in a combined gesture of greeting and pleading. Yet his need to balance himself in the moving car gives to his folded hands the suggestion of stiffness, almost as if he is taking precise aim. The strain is palpable, even in his face and neck  the gesture becomes an unintended mingling of humility and force.         
	Their sights are apparently locked into each others. But are they? The leader is looking at a villager, is the villager looking only at him? And what do we see? At the point the shutter clicks, the minister wants a vote. What does the unknown man want? It is possible to draw a straight line across the space between the dark glasses of the minister at the far left top and the unseen eyes of the villager in the right middle foreground. But what is it that each is seeing? The villagers stick cuts at a right angle through the imagined line of vision, as if to suggest that neither can really see the other. Beyond the mutual gaze, and beyond the stick, the road unfolds through dry trees below which appears the other car. There may be more, although we cannot see them. They will keep passing the watching villager on the roadside as Indias democracy rolls on.                    BHASWATI CHAKRAVORTY

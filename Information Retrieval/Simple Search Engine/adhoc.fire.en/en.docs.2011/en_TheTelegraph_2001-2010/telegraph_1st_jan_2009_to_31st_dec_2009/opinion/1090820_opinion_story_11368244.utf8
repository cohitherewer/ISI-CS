                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Change is in the air                  
	Sir  As the editorial, First steps (Aug 11), rightly points out, Indian politics and politicians have mostly been in the news for the wrong reasons. Bihar is indeed the best example of this. Corruption, lawlessness and narrow politics have always been the hallmarks of that state. Poverty is the root of all evils, and Bihar is one of the poorest states of India.          
	But since Nitish Kumar has taken up the post of the chief minister of Bihar, things have started improving. Kumar, during the four years of his tenure, has brought in some positive changes in almost every aspect of the state. He has been able to reduce corruption and lawlessness to a large extent. Instead of making high-sounding promises, he took practical steps and focused on the development of the state. A vital feature of Kumars government is that it has done a lot for the improvement of the minority communities. Kumar introduced special scholarship schemes for minority students. He also took stern action against atrocities towards Dalits. One may conclude that Kumar is doing a commendable job.           
	Yours faithfully,

	True picture          
	Sir  India celebrated the 62nd year of its independence on August 15. Should this celebration merely consist of parades and flag-hoisting? If every citizen of the nation is not able to enjoy freedom and his or her fundamental rights, then there is no point in an ostentatious celebration of independence. India is a country that has many different states and territories. But most of them are far from being developed  which is why the country continues to be labelled as a developing nation. Sadly, politicians of India are too busy with their personal agenda to focus on the nations development.          
	We need to think seriously why most Indian students prefer going to foreign universities for higher studies. There are a number of issues that continue to hinder Indias development. As a country, we should be ashamed that these problems still persist.          
	Independence has meaning only when all sections of society enjoy equal rights. This can only be achieved through the abolition of the quota system. Educated people scorn the caste system prevalent in many parts of India since it is biased in favour of certain sections of the society. Then why do many of the former support the quota system, which is discriminatory?          
	India is a land of diversity. We should respect this diversity, and retain our individuality. It is the duty of every Indian citizen to ensure that the grandeur of this country is not lost. Certain simple things can be achieved even without a lot of effort, like keeping the surroundings clean or volunteering to help the poor. After all, a country reflects the values and aspirations of its people.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Amrita Mallik, Calcutta

                
	Sir  There are several factors that continue to plague India, such as the abnormal rise in the prices of essential goods, the breakdown of law and order throughout the country, and the alarming level of corruption crippling Indias democratic identity.           
	Despite all this, Indians were proud to celebrate the 62nd year of Indian independence on August 15. No amount of terrorist threat, internal or external, have been able to dampen the democratic spirit of the peace-loving Indians. Our leaders should act unitedly against terrorism irrespective of their political inclinations. They should make sure that there is no compromise in dealing with this danger, which may threaten the very existence of the nation.          
	Terrorism resulting from economic depravity in the rural and backward areas is deadlier than that resulting from religious fundamentalism. The former thrives on poverty and on the apathetic attitude of government officials in rural India. If it is not checked, the country will face consequences more serious than external attacks. Our political leaders and government officials, who ritually salute the tricolour on every Independence Day, should realize this potential threat and save innocent villagers from falling prey to terrorist activities.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Amitabh Banerjee, Ranchi

                
	Sir  Since India is a secular country, all religious communities of our nation should enjoy equal rights. Yet, communalism has become a menace in India.          
	Certain minority communities, such as the Christians, suffer from extreme poverty and the lack of basic amenities. They are often the soft targets of threats from extremist groups. The Christian missionary organizations fail to focus on the woes of their community members. It is also regrettable that the Catholic clergy, which talks of serving the poor with cash and kind, is itself often involved in the misuse of church properties for selfish gain.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir I would like to express my support to the Hindu Janajagruti Samiti for protesting against the exhibition of M.F. Husains paintings in Goa. Husain has painted many Hindu deities in the nude  this indicates his disrespect towards the Hindu religion. Freedom and responsibility go hand in hand. While Husain has freedom of expression as an artist, he also has the responsibility of not hurting the feelings of members of certain religious communities.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Dharmadev Mishra, Mumbai

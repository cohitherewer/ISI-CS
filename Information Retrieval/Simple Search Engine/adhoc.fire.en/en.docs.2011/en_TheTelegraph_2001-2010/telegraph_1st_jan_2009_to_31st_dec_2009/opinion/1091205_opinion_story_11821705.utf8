	Not many Indians, it would appear, are as resistant to industrial toxic waste as their Union environment and forests minister is. On a recent visit to Bhopal, Jairam Ramesh picked up a clump of earth from the Union Carbide factory premises and said, I held the toxic waste in my hand. Im still alive and not coughing. Twenty-five years ago, more than 8,000 people had not been as lucky. Tonnes of methyl isocyanate, stored in the factory in utter disregard of safety norms, had leaked out on the night of December 2-3, 1984, killing or maiming thousands in a few hours. Since then, the death toll has reached 20,000, and the number is rising. Survivors continue to suffer from severe health problems, babies are born deformed or develop life-threatening conditions. Few have received adequate compensation, if at all, and the guilty  Dow Chemicals, which bought out Union Carbide, and the State, which has shown little more than apathy  have not been brought to book.        
	Tragedies of this scale are not unusual in India. In fact, they are so common that they fade away in no time from public memory and that of the State. In spite of being recognized as the worlds largest industrial disaster, the Bhopal tragedy has not been an exception. Even after receiving years of sustained attention from activists, toxic waste remains stockpiled inside the factory, causing lingering health hazards to the neighbouring communities. The water and soil in the adjacent areas remain badly polluted, while the victims continue to suffer for want of medical attention. In 2005, the Bharatiya Janata Party government in Madhya Pradesh had announced a grand plan to beautify Bhopal when its people were dying every day. This year, the former chief minister, Babulal Gaur, now demoted to heading the Bhopal gas tragedy relief and rehabilitation ministry, proposed opening the factory to the public. He wanted to prove that there was no contamination. Mr Gaurs view  no surprise  is supported by the Defence Research and Development Establishments report. But the Centre for Science and Environment, an independent body, has discovered a shockingly different story  toxicity not only affects areas far off from the site but has also percolated into the groundwater.        
	These conflicting empirical facts reveal a familiar plot: the State can, by the sheer force of denial, emerge as the most powerful player, even in a free and fair democracy like India. For instance, in spite of massive protests, the government has ceased all epidemiological studies in Bhopal since 1994. When the Prime Ministers Office tried to revive the project in 2006, it was rebuffed by the Indian Council of Medical Research, citing inadequate funding. So, while aspiring young architects dream up a Rs 100-crore memorial project for the victims, ministers crack poor jokes and activists cry themselves hoarse, people are going to die quietly in Bhopal. At least until the next big anniversary.

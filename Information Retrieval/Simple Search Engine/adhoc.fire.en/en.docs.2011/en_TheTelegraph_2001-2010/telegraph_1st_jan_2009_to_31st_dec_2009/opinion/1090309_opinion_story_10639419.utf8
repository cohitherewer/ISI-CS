                                                                                                                 PRESS THE RESET BUTTON                                  GWYNNE DYER                              
	Over the past year, the United States of America and Russia have been drifting into a hostile relationship, driven by the USs decision to install anti-missile defences in eastern Europe, the war in Georgia last August, and the recent fiasco over Russian natural gas supplies to Europe. There was nervous chatter about a new Cold War, but last month the US vice-president, Joe Biden, said that the Obama administration was going to press the reset button in its relations with Russia. Now it has done it.        
	At the Nato summit on March 5, the alliance agreed to resume high-level contacts with Moscow in the Nato-Russia Council, which were suspended after the Georgian war. The following day, the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, met the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, in Brussels and gave him a mock reset button. There was a rather confrontational approach towards Russia in the prior administration, she explained.        
	None of the disputes and misunderstandings between Washington and Moscow came from a hostile intent on either side. Take the anti-ballistic missile defences being built in Poland and in the Czech Republic. The Bush administration said that the interceptor missiles and radars of the system were there to intercept nuclear-tipped long-range missiles fired by Iran, and expected the Russians to believe it.        
	Unsurprisingly, the Russians didnt believe it, because Iran has neither missiles capable of reaching the US nor any nuclear warheads to put on them. So Moscow thought the ABM system was really intended to shoot down Russian missiles and thus undermine the countrys ability to deter the US. Russia worked itself into such a lather about the ABM missiles that the president, Dmitry Medvedev, announced on the day after Barack Obamas election victory that short-range Russian missiles would be installed in Kaliningrad, a Russian enclave on the Polish border, to destroy those American bases on short notice. But the ABM missiles are in the wrong place to intercept Russian inter-continental anti-ballistic missiles, and they dont really work anyway.                
	The tide has turned        
	They have never worked properly, despite billions of dollars poured into the ABM project. The sole practical result of the programme has been to pour money into the pockets of American defence contractors. But the Russians are too paranoid to accept that, and the programme has such strong support in the Congress that the Obama administration is merely reviewing it, rather than cancelling it outright.        
	As for the war in Georgia last August, it was the Georgian president, Mikheil Saakashvili, who started it, not the Russians. Its the same with the quarrel between Russia and Ukraine over the price of gas that left half of eastern Europe freezing last December. There was incompetence and bloody-mindedness aplenty on both sides, but it wasnt part of some Russian masterplan for world domination. So it is high time to reset the relationship.        
	There are belligerent minor players on both sides, but the Obama administration seems to have sent out orders to squelch them. Last week, for example, a couple of Russian bombers flew to within a couple of hundred miles of Canadas Arctic coast. Canada scrambled fighters to send a strong signal that they should back off and stay out of our airspace, according to the defence minister, Peter McKay. But the Russians were not in Canadas airspace.        
	That is probably just what the Obama administration wants from Russia: a professional relationship between two grown-up countries which know and respect the rules. For a start, Clinton and Lavrov committed the two countries to negotiate a new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty by the end of the year, but more will follow. The tide has turned.

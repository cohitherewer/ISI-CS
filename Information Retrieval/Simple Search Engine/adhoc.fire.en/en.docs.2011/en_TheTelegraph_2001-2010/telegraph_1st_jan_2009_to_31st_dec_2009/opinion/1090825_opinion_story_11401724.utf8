The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Theatre of the absurd 
                                                                                                                 THEATRE OF THE ABSURD                                   Malvika Singh                                    
	There was also the unpleasant and wholly unnecessary sting: the cash-for-vote scandal, which attempted to point fingers at Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the Congress on the nuclear deal that was being opposed by the Left and by some other parties. Other minor incidents were addenda to this larger narrative, which was being played out.        
	Intelligent, unbiased watchers of the unfolding political reality have been puzzled as to why the BJP leadership was committing errors with every move. The saga reached its most silly point when Advani kept referring to the prime minister of India as a nikamma. It showed him as a vulnerable puppet, unsure of his tread as well as of his immediate future, knowing well that the moment then, at election time, was possibly his last hope to make it to the top job. The negative rhetoric, the tacit support to Varun Gandhi and his campaign and other inappropriate actions all came together and worked against the party. The Indian electorate called the shots, took almost everyone by surprise, and the Congress dominated the result.                 
	Final return        
	However, the BJP continues to have a constituency that has diluted somewhat. The Congress, without allies, had an 80-seat lead over the next largest party. This put it in a win-win situation, and the party formed the government. Advani had lost his chance, and five years from now there is bound to be a change in the leadership.        
	Witnessing the internal fight for power, the free-for-all strategy without subtle nuances, it is clear that the BJP has made a spectacle of itself, giving viewers a glimpse of an ongoing theatre of the absurd. The characters seem to be in search of a leader, and are all waiting for Godot. As the end game advances, who-did-what-to-whom is becoming more vivid and the players, who may have sung in the chorus till now, are about to walk in from the wings on to centre stage.         
	A careful analysis of each act is beginning to show up the conniving protagonists, their allies and the vociferous lead players who are fast moving to the rear of the stage to replace the missing members of the chorus. The pied piper is determining the dance, and hopefully, the true manifesto will be unveiled. This will allow the amorphous position and, therefore, the weak disposition, to rectify and strengthen itself and help renew a party that disintegrated because it tried to be something it was not.        
	Contrastingly, the Congress has an opportunity, yet again, to regroup, rid itself of those who carry the past on their shoulders and falter every now and then, and move forward so that it can take an enormous lead over all the other dispensations. Unfortunately, there are too many of those in the grand old party who do not want to pass the baton, change the status quo and retire to their constituencies to do shram daan and kar seva. With their enormous fund of experience, they will be able to transform the neglected, exploited hinterland. As the Youth Congress begins to bud, the Aged Congress can return to the roots.

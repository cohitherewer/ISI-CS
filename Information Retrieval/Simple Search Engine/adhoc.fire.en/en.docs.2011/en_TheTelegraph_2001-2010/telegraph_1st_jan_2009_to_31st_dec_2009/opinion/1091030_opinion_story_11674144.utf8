                                                                                                                 PAINED WONDER                                                    
	Pakistan must be looking at the face of terror with unceasing wonder and disbelief. Peshawar has been attacked twice within days, and with even greater impunity the second time, resulting in a staggering death toll. What the ghastly bombing of the Meena Bazar establishes beyond doubt is that terrorists not only continue to escape the dragnet of security in Pakistan but are also privy to the best-kept State secrets. The Peshawar bombing coincided with the first visit of Hillary Clinton as secretary of state of the United States of America, a fact zealously kept away from the public owing to security reasons. The re-targeting of Peshawar seems aimed at both making a mess of a meticulously orchestrated public relations exercise between the US and Pakistan governments and, perhaps more importantly, reiterating a simple point that the Pakistan Taliban have been harping on: Pakistans friendship with the US is doing it more harm than good. Given that a majority of Pakistanis who have to risk journeys to marketplaces already believes that, the idea, it is being expected, may soon prove to be too overwhelming for the civilian government to sidestep. The drone attacks before, and now the South Waziristan operation, which continues to displace and imperil the lives of increasing numbers of people, could be trusted to add force to the reshaping of public opinion in Pakistan. In Afghanistan, similar scare tactics are at work.         
	It is unlikely that the Taliban strategy will work in as simple a way as it looks. In Afghanistan, the US has re-stated its commitment to stay put and even to increase troops. In Pakistan, greater damage wrought by the Taliban has brought about greater cooperation between the two governments and more civilian aid (Ms Clinton only just announced an aid bonanza). But it is precisely because of these developments that the Taliban may be getting closer to their goal. The rapport between the US and its allies in the war against terror might not have been greater, but never before has it been made to appear more unholy. Hamid Karzai, steadily losing his grip on power despite all the help from his Western allies, is keenly aware of this. So is perhaps Pakistans civilian government, in the line of fire from both the army and the Taliban for betraying the nation and the faith. The pressure is showing. Unable to take responsibility for either the army or the Taliban, it now blames India for its difficulties.

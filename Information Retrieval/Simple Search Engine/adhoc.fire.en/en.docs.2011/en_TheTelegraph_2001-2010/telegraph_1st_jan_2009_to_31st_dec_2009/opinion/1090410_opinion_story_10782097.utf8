The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Letters to Editor
                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Culture shock                  
	Sir  As the editorial, Coconut milk (April 3), points out, Hindu rituals observed during inaugural ceremonies tend to dilute the secular credentials of the Indian republic. By the same logic, a multi-lingual, democratic nation should also not be identified with any particular language. But the bitter reality is that New Delhi, irrespective of the government at the Centre, has been striving to transform India into a Hindi-speaking nation. This has not stopped with making Hindi the national language; rather employees of the Central government, whatever their mother tongue and place of posting, are increasingly compelled to work in Hindi. The privileged status of the Hindi language also gives its speakers an additional advantage in the job market. One sees billboards at railway stations and post offices exhorting people to learn Hindi in order to know India better, implying that non-Hindi speakers are ignorant of their country.           
	Using language and religion to gain socio-cultural dominance exposes a crudely primitive mindset. Hinduism, in spite of being the majority religion, is not Indias State religion. Similarly, a language spoken by a section of the population must not be allowed to reign over other languages. Either a foreign language like English should be deemed the national language, so that people of no particular state can be privileged, or else the linguistic apartheid pursued by Hindi-fanatics should be brought to an immediate end.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Kajal Chatterjee, Sodepur

                
	Sir  I fully concur with the views expressed in the editorial, Coconut milk. The chief of the Indian air force, along with the supreme commander of the armed forces, should never have indulged in such a spectacle as they did when they anointed the new Boeing Business Jet with a tika and broke a coconut before its maiden flight. Such rituals were wholly unwarranted and have put a blot on Indias secular credentials. I wonder if this act had something to do with the forthcoming elections. Earlier, India had procured several Embraer aircraft for the VIPs at a huge cost, but the Boeing Business Jet must have cost the earth. So, can we really believe our netas any longer when they claim India to be a poor country, and ask us to tighten our purse-strings to meet the ongoing recession?           
	Yours faithfully,       
Jayanta Kumar Dutt, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  The editorial, Coconut milk, expresses concern that the ceremonial flagging off of the Boeing Business jet will send out the wrong message to the entire nation. I completely disagree with this line, and strongly believe that there is no harm in preaching those religious rites that are believed to be auspicious for all. It is not as if Hindu rituals have been performed to protect only the Hindu travellers on the aircraft. After all, texts like the Upanishad and the Gita put the stress on humanity and not just on observing religious rites.          
	Indonesia, the country with the worlds largest Muslim population, maintains its ancient culture by naming roads, airports and other landmarks after Hindu mythological figures. Indonesia sets a fine example by separating culture from religion. Secularism draws a demarcating line between State and religion. The State must not give priority to any religion but, at the same time, cannot do away with its cultural values. Breaking a coconut or anointing the plane with a tika should not be interpreted from a narrow, communal perspective. The president has broken just a coconut and has not destroyed the basic tenets of secularism.                     
	Yours faithfully,         Subrata Pal, Karimpur, Nadia                 Sir  I totally disagree with the views expressed by the editorial, Coconut milk. Putting a tilak or breaking a coconut cannot be regarded as only religious rituals. These are traditions that have been followed in India since ages and, at best, can be regarded as part of the culture of the country. If such practices are as reprehensible as the editorial makes them out to be, it may be claimed that garlanding, putting tilak and performing aarti on foreign delegates or sportspersons on important occasions are equally unethical. It is needless to ascribe controversial motives to innocuous practices by linking them with religion.  
	Yours faithfully,      
Raj Bagri, Calcutta

                
	Another brick in the wall          
	Sir  In Tale of two worlds (April 2), Mukul Kesavan brilliantly exposes the Chinese wall that stands between English-speaking metropolitan India and its Hindi-speaking provincial counterpart. Kesavan attributes such divisive thinking to leaders like Feroze Varun Gandhi and Maneka Gandhi, to the way they conceive their electoral strategies to suit these two sections of the Indian society. However, I would like to point out that a Chinese wall does exist in reality. This has created a huge gulf between urban India and rural Bharat. Nehruvian policies have always favoured secularism but lack of typical anglophone privileges like English education in villages has cast a dark spell of ignorance in the rural areas. In contrast to the educated, liberal tone of newspapers and journals in English, aimed at an urban elite readership, there are vernacular dailies laced with political venom which are circulated among villagers. Spreading informed opinion is not feasible until rural India gets a hold on the English language. However, politicians, in a bid to remain in power, have made sure that education does not open the eyes of ignorant villagers to their misdeeds.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Abhirup Sen, Calcutta

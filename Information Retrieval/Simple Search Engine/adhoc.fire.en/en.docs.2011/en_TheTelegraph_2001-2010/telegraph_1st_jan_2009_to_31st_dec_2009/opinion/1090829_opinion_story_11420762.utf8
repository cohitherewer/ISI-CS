                                                                                                                 IDEAS WITHOUT SUBSTANCE                              Ananda Lal      THEATRE                                                
	The dramatic component of the fourth annual Rabindra Utsav consisted of only one full-length production and a play reading. Commissioned by the organizers, Happenings  as all shows at the festival are  Chetanas Arun Mukhopadhyay contemplated dovetailing two novels, then began rehearsing Goray Galad, and finally Chirakumar Sabha. He says, I cannot explain the reason. Maybe, Chirakumar Sabha is theatrically more interesting. It is just a comedy, and that is why I liked it.        
	This bit of history and the directors note prove that two false starts and palpable uncertainty do not augur well when a deadline hangs over ones head. A group can afford to explore possibilities when no date for a premiere has been fixed, but with the opening night known well in advance, it cannot waste time.  I cannot explain the reason? But a director must have a rationale for his choice; he must have convinced himself at least. Maybe Chirakumar is theatrically more interesting? It either is for him or it isnt; any equivocation spells trouble. It is just a comedy? But so is Goray Galad, leaving no logical explanation for Mukhopadhyays decision. In fact, with time running out, he should have stuck to Goray Galad, as it is half the length of Chirakumar, so Chetana could have done justice to it.        
	The inevitable happened. This warm-blooded, five-act lovers carousal, probably the most popular Tagore play besides the dance-dramas (another reason to avoid it, whereas Goray Galad has had no revival in the recent past), resembled a tattered quilt barely held together by stitches that luckily didnt give way. Mukhopadhyay had shorn the first half so badly that sometimes we could hardly recognize the storyline. No doubt it needs editing for todays audiences, but not so much that the holes appear bigger than the fabric. In contrast, we recalled its sparkling renditions by Kalapi (1993), and by Calcutta Performers (1996).        
	Mukhopadhyay forgets that Tagores humour lies in his wit, less in his plot. If one omits large chunks of dialogue, one risks losing the hasya rasa. By also deleting nearly all the songs, Mukhopadhyay sacrifices other rasas too. However, one still cannot suppress Tagores spirit that easily. By keeping intact most of the climactic, multiple-conversation Act 4 Scene 1, Mukhopadhyay salvages the second half somewhat, and Tagores comedy ends on a high, as it should.        
	Another half-baked idea was Ensembles reading of the late-period failed-love story, Rabibar, as Sunday in English translation. I have often questioned the concept of dramatic readings. They form the very first stage of rehearsals in the normal course of which actors gradually memorize their lines and dispense with the book. It seems peculiarly regressive, therefore, to present the preliminary phase of a process for public viewing, and a betrayal of the art of theatre for the cast to hold the scripts in front of them as part of a regular production.        
	Look at it from another angle. Why should we want to go to an auditorium to hear four readers, who never move from their seats, elocute the lines of a short story, unless we are illiterate? We may as well read the same work lying on our comfortable beds. We make the concession to attend such a live performance only because we expect the voices to interpret, to give us something more than what our reading does. So storytelling depends on theatricalization. And the best narrators (like our folk storytellers who, by the way, memorize their entire narrative) are actually superb performers, theatrically, often musically, and are sometimes even dancers to boot.        
	Instead, we had two narrators (why not just one?) presenting the descriptive passages as if we were schoolkids, with Dhritiman Chaterji and Anasua Majumder reading the parts of Abhik and Bibha respectively (picture). I could sense all four seasoned stage-actors sitting tight here, wanting to move but constrained from doing so. It made little sense, for they should have logically taken it to the next level and enacted it as drama. Fortunately, the enormous experience of Chaterji and Majumder made them use their voices to partially overcome the straitjacket: Abhiks sardonic irony and Bibhas intelligent parrying came through alright. Another positive is the fluid, faithful translation by the late Sujit Mukherjee, one of Tagores most neglected translators of fiction; yet still neglected for nobody saw fit to credit him either in the souvenir or announcements.        
	Nonetheless, let us not lose all hope. If director Sohag Sen really wants to do listeners a service, she can get Sunday broadcast over radio or released on audio CD. We can be spared the visual agony of a static stage completely.

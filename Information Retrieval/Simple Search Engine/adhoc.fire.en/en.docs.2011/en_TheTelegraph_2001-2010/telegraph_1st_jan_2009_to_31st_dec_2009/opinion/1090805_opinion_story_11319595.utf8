	Of all the instances of the trial of the Jamaat-ud-Dawa chief, Hafiz Saeed, making news, the present one is the least controversial. It is a purely technical reason that has stalled the trial this time. The Punjab advocate-general, Raza Farooq, who was to argue the governments case against the release of the JuD chief, had to step down because the Pakistan supreme court struck down the provisional constitutional order of 2007 under which he had been appointed. The trial is expected to resume as and when Mr Farooqs replacement is found. Indias hackles have been raised not because of this unavoidable interlude, but because of the Pakistan governments contradictory stand on Mr Saeeds culpability. The Pakistan government obviously thinks nothing of persisting with its case against the release of a terror suspect while maintaining that there is no case against him. Days before the current adjournment, Pakistans interior minister, Rehman Malik, observed that there is no evidence against the JuD leader. Yet, on the eve of the Sharm el-Sheikh meeting, the Punjab government had sought to withdraw its appeal in the supreme court against Mr Saeeds release on the grounds that the federal government had not shared secret evidence against the JuD chief with it. This flies in the face of Mr Maliks claims. Pakistan has ignored the evidence provided by India against Mr Saeed, and the fifth dossier from India, which followed Mr Maliks statements, is unlikely to bring on a change of mind.        
	The Pakistan government is certainly dragging its feet on the trial of the Mumbai terror suspects, particularly that of Mr Saeeds. It may have its own reasons for doing so. The instability in Punjab, where Mr Saeed has grass roots support, may also prevent it from taking any drastic steps against a popular figure like him. But Pakistans refusal to dig into the roots of terror will negate all the advantages it has been congratulating itself on gaining at Sharm el-Sheikh. Yes, India has walked halfway to the table, but to keep India there, Pakistan will have to be more sincere. Indias trust in its neighbour, as the Indian prime minister pointed out, depends on its verification of Pakistans commitment to prevent its own territory from being used in attacks against India. The terror factor may have been delinked from the dialogue, but it has not disappeared into thin air.

                                                                                                                 FLIGHTS OF FANCY                                  FIFTH COLUMN - Gwynne Dyer                              
	Why are Koreans so much braver than Israelis when faced with the threat of nuclear weapons? North Koreas second underground nuclear test, much bigger than its first in October 2006, did not cause panic in South Korea. Even when North Korea conducted a short-range missile test only hours after the explosion to underline that all of South Korea lies open to nuclear attack, South Koreans went about their business as usual.         
	How different from Israel, where a recent opinion poll conducted by the Centre for Iranian Studies at the Tel Aviv University revealed that almost a quarter of Israels seven million citizens would consider leaving the country if Iran gets nuclear weapons.         
	There are major differences between the North Korea-South Korea relationship and the Israel-Iran one, but they just deepen the puzzle. The two Koreas have actually fought a war in which millions died, and their troops still face each other across a massively fortified ceasefire line. Almost every year, there are violent incidents along the border or on the seas around the Korean peninsula. Israel and Iran, by contrast, have never fought a war, and do not even have a common border. Iran has no nuclear weapons, and denies the intention of making any. Nor has it ever threatened war with Israel.        
	It gets even weirder. Both Israel and South Korea have a security guarantee from the United States of America that includes the backing of the US nuclear deterrent. But South Korea has no nuclear weapons of its own, and no ambitions of acquiring them, whereas Israel has hundreds. In fact, it has enough nuclear weapons and delivery systems to destroy every Iranian city at the same time in a first strike.        
	Israelis are just as intelligent as Koreans, so there must be more going on here than what meets the eye. Indeed, Israeli leaders know that Muslim leaders are not homicidal and suicidal maniacs, even if the public is encouraged to believe in the myth of mad mullahs. There has to be some genuine strategic distinction that explains the difference between the Israeli and the South Korean responses.                
	Crucial difference        
	There is. It lies precisely in the fact that Israel possesses nuclear weapons, while South Korea does not. South Koreans trust in the US nuclear deterrent, having no alternative. Israelis trust in their own deterrent, and enjoy the luxury of having the US deterrent as a back-up  but they also have other fish to fry. Israels nuclear weapons are not meant only to deter a nuclear attack on Israel. They are also configured to give Israel extended deterrence; that is, the ability to stop a variety of other things from happening by threatening to use nuclear weapons.        
	Those things would include a conventional military attack on Israel, but they might extend to political or technological developments in the Arab world as well. All Israeli military and political leaders see the regional monopoly of nuclear weapons that their country has had for the past 40 years as a huge strategic asset. It would evaporate overnight if any Arab State could deliver even a single nuclear weapon onto Israeli soil. Israel would then be equally deterred from launching a first strike because of the certainty of a retaliation. Would an Iranian nuclear weapon, if such a thing existed, also negate Israels extended deterrence? Only if Iranians were willing to risk the virtual annihilation of Iran for the sake of the Arabs  which most Arabs would doubt.         
	So the South Koreans stay cool about North Korean nuclear weapons, while the Israel security establishment worries about Iranian nuclear weapons for reasons quite different from those it mentions in public. As Israelis are a people haunted by the Holocaust, the governments rhetoric about an existential threat is taken literally, and some Israelis respond with fantasies of flight. They are only fantasies.

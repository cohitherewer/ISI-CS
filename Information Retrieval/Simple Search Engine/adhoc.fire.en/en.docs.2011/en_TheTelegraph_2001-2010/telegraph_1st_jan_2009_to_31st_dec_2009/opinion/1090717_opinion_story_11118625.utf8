	Welcome to the Urban Revolution: How Cities are Changing the World (Harper Litmus, Rs 399) by Jeb Brugmann is based on two years of field work by the author in various cities of the world. The experience thus gathered helps Brugmann conclude that We are organizing the planet itself into a City: into a single, complex, connected, and still very unstable urban system. Large-scale migration from rural to urban areas in recent years has resulted in cities becoming the hub of change. They influence and control everything from ecology to economics. This is what Brugmann calls the Urban Revolution. According to him, successful cities such as Barcelona or Chicago have developed their own practices of urbanism that entails, among other things, vigorous planning.The cities of developing countries like India need to follow in their footsteps if they are to be part of the excitement of the forthcoming urban centuries, says Brugmann.

	The Hidden Oracle of India: The Mystery of Indias Naadi Palm Leaf Readers (Orient, Rs 195) by Andrew and Angela Donovan tells a story that might seem either fascinating or a load of hocus-pocus, depending on how you choose to interpret it. When the husband-wife duo of the authors visit India to attend a wedding, they stumble upon the Naadi palm leaf readers, who accurately narrate the details of their lives as recorded on palm leaves thousands of years ago. According to tradition, Lord Shiva had documented in Sanskrit the lives of every living being on the palm leaves, which had been stored in ancient royal libraries to be found by those who seek them. The authors claim that their lives were transformed once they had the leaves read. This book is an invitation to the readers to undertake the same journey of self discovery.

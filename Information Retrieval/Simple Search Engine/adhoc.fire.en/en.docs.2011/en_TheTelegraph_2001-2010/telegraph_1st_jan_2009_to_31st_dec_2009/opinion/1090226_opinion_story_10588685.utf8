	India does change, although slowly. The transfer of innovation from research and academic centres to industry by allowing university faculty and research students to participate in knowledge-driven companies or begin start-up companies of their own has long been part of the economics of Western universities. Yet India has always discouraged contact between university scientists and industry. Scientists have so far had to leave academics to build their own companies. But times have changed too radically to isolate one from the other. University departments and public-funded research institutions need not just highly motivated faculty and students but also a sustained flow of funds to maintain projects and continue research. A direct interaction between the innovative brains in academic faculties and industry would help achieve both, particularly if professors are allowed to hold equity stakes in knowledge-driven companies through their research. So this time the government has approved the proposals of the department of scientific and industrial research to change the rules binding researchers. The change in policy is expected to make the transfer of technology both practical and smooth.        
	This is a welcome change, although there may be a number of problems before the system can work without glitches. The most famous universities and research institutions in the West, especially in the United States of America, that have made the system work, have clear regulations and sharp definitions in place. Ethical and legal conflicts of interest are inevitable in this situation unless certain premises of sharing research and revenue are firmly laid out. This should be one of the first tasks of academic and research institutions before the change of policy can be made effective. The rewards could be innumerable. The best brains would no longer want to leave research and academic institutions given the option of intellectually and economically fruitful interaction with industry, industry would have access to these best brains, and researchers and companies would gain mutual understanding of processes and needs, all to the benefit of the product.

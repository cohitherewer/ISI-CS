The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | the hurt of the matter
                                                                                                                 THE HURT OF THE MATTER                                  BONA FIDE - MALVIKA SINGH                              
	Omar Abdullah was right when he spoke in the assembly after a member of the Peoples Democratic Party accused him of being involved in a sex scandal. There was nothing emotional about his decision. The time has come to step away from illegitimate slander and character assassination indulged in by Opposition members in assemblies across India and in the Parliament. The proceedings in our democratic institutions leave much to be desired and show up Indian leaders as immature and lacking intellectual depth and ability. This embarrassing truth is now for all to see, thanks to the small screen. The public shenanigans and sub-standard debate must warm the cockles of the hearts of our counterparts in Pakistan and elsewhere, putting us on a par with the fourth world and with failed states, where similar charades often take place.        
	New-generation leaders must be persuaded not to behave like the older generation in power. The latter are responsible for having encouraged and allowed political discourse to descend to lowly depths and their modus operandi ought to be discarded. India needs to resurrect itself from this terrible reality and reach out to a new ethos where dignity and integrity rule. Whenever one watches the deliberate disruptions in the House led by disgruntled leaders, one feels ashamed. Hope is restored when the Omar Abdullahs react differently, and despair returns when rather stupidly, the reporters on television call his response emotional.        
	We have much growing up to do as a nation and our public space needs to be cleansed of abuse, character assassination and lies if we want our children to lead clean and prosperous lives, and abide by the laws of the land and an appropriate code of conduct intrinsic to civil society. Someone has to begin to bell the cat and expose the chronic ailment that has overwhelmed and suffocated us all. Omar stood his ground with a correct and dignified response. He put in his resignation and waited for the Central Bureau of Investigation to counter the false allegation. However, the electronic media, desperate to sensationalize a serious matter, made a mockery of what had happened and missed the point by a long shot.                 
	Costly intrigue        
	Back to Parliament in New Delhi. The leaders of the Opposition, shouting in the House hysterically, created an awful din, and forced the Speaker to adjourn the proceedings on more than two occasions. An expensive farce is being enacted on Lok Sabha TV. It amazes me that all these men and women carry on, unaffected by the hugely negative, fast-growing national reaction to their unacceptable and grossly hideous behaviour in Parliament. The grand building itself deserves better, as do the democratic values it symbolizes. A rule needs to be put in place that disqualifies members who disrupt discussion and debate on ideological, socio-economic and political differences. It made one squirm to hear Yashwant Sinha saying that Manmohan Singh had joined the Pakistani camp! This is not intelligent, serious politics or debate, and India can see why the election went the way it did.        
	In this context, it is clear that the prime minister needs a highly-experienced media adviser, someone who is well-versed in international affairs, sharp witted, with a creative intellect, and embraces diverse people at all levels. The lacuna is evident. Sadly, much of the negatives are due to disgruntled Congress leaders who are manipulating the many strings and tying the government into deeper knots. The men who are indulging in this from within the party have ruled the roost for long and seem to be sensing change and their redundancy in the near future.        
	This intrigue is palpable and needs to be stopped in its tracks. Otherwise it may prove to be destructive for what the next-generation Congress leaders are working towards.

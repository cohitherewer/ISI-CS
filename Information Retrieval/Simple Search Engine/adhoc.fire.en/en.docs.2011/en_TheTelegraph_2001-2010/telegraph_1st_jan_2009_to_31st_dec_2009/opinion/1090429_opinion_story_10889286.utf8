The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | promises to keep
                                                                                                                 PROMISES TO KEEP                                                    
	In a field in which seven days are considered a long time, one hundred days may be construed as eternity. That is, of course, an illusion. The first hundred days of the presidency of Barack Obama have only laid down the conditions for things to come. It has by no means been an easy presidency to inherit. The economy was spinning into recession, the country was in a mindless and seemingly endless war, unemployment was rising and foreign policy had no bearing. Mr Obama made promises, but he emphasized always that things were not going to be easy. He made it clear that despite his idealism and persuasive rhetoric, his feet were firmly on the ground. The reality continues to be grim: the global economy, and with it the economy of the United States of America, shows no sign of recovery; nobody knows what is happening in Pakistan; there is the hidden fear that the charismatic president is not quite living up to the expectations he himself has engendered. It is too early to articulate such fears. Moreover, such cynicism ignores the far-reaching and radical changes that Mr Obama has already initiated within the US. Witness the removal of the ban on stem cell research; his extension of the US healthcare system; and the steps he has taken to protect and preserve the wilderness of the US. It is clear that Mr Obama aims to build a new America, more caring, more humane and more accountable.        
	Dramatic as this aim is, it might be obstructed by factors entirely external to it and to Mr Obamas agenda. What is alarming is that the economy is yet to respond to the money that has been injected. There is no positive result in Afghanistan, especially with developments in Pakistan completely out of control. Policy-makers in India, a country currently in the midst of a political transition, are beginning to wonder if the worlds superpower, under a new president, will actually act like one in Pakistan. The signs are confusing. His Indian admirers and supporters, and there are many, will all expect Mr Obama to provide some direction on this aspect of his foreign policy. His noble vision of a nuclear weapons- free world will come to nought if mullahs and generals, with not-so-covert support from the US, continue to threaten Indias north-western borders. Mr Obama has promises to keep within the US and elsewhere too. There is no bigger disappointment than promises without delivery.

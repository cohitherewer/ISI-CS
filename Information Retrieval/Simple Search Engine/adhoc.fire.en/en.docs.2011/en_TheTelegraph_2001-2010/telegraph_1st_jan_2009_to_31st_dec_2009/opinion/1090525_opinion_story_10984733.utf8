The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Return of the Pandemic
                                                                                                                 RETURN OF THE PANDEMIC                                  FIFTH COLUMN - Gwynne Dyer                              
	We seem to have got away with it this time. The swine flu turned out not to be a global killer, at least not in this first go-round. But we have had a fright, and we should learn something from it. In 1994, only 10 per cent of American pigs lived out their brief lives in vast factory farms. Seven years later, in 2001, 72 per cent did. The percentage is even higher today - and its now known that the virus that caused the outbreak in Mexico is a direct descendant of one that was first identified on an industrial-scale pig-raising facility in North Carolina in 1998. Its not just pigs. Fewer than 300 people have died from the bird-flu virus since it emerged in Asia in 2003, but if it became transmissible directly between humans it could cause a pandemic that can kill tens of millions.        
	Did the bird-flu virus also evolve on a factory farm where hundreds of thousands of chickens are crowded together? Nobody knows, but the fact that most chickens everywhere now live in battery farms certainly enhances the chance of a further mutation that makes the virus transmissible between human beings. Industrial-scale livestock raising, a relatively recent development, is making lethal pandemics 10 times more likely than they used to be.        
	There has only been one major pandemic in the last hundred years  in 1918  and we wont have the hard numbers to show that pandemics have become 10 times more likely. But when I was interviewing experts about pandemics five years ago, just after avian flu first emerged, several of them told me off the record that that was precisely what they expected.Human beings were hardly prey to quick-killer epidemic diseases at all until they started domesticating animals. Living in our original hunter-and-gatherer groups of a hundred or less, we were a poor target for diseases that killed their hosts fast, for they would quickly run out of potential hosts and die off themselves.However, almost all the animals that human beings domesticated for food  pigs, sheep, goats, cattle and poultry  live in large herds or flocks. They were targets for epidemic diseases, because they had enough individuals to keep passing the disease on.                
	Profit over health        
	As the number of people in human societies grew larger, they became vulnerable to similar epidemic diseases. But even though the farmers often lived under the same roof with their animals, passing viruses back and forth, it generally took a long time before some minor mutation enabled the virus to cross the species barrier and thrive in human beings.        
	During the past several thousand years, major quick-killer epidemic diseases that affect human beings have emerged, on average, only once every few hundred years. But now that we keep most of our livestock in crowded cages for their entire lives, generally living above a cess-pool of their own excrement and exchanging disease pathogens at blinding speed, the speed of evolution of the pathogens has accelerated dramatically.        
	The giant corporations that drove most small hog-breeders out of business in the United States of America are now active all over the world. In Romania, for example, the number of hog farmers fell from 477,000 to just 5,200 in only four years after the agri-business giants arrived on the scene. The new diseases, and new strains of old diseases to which we have no immunity, will surely come. We have created the ideal environment to maximize new mutations among the diseases that kill large numbers of people, and we will pay a high price unless we get out of factory farming. But then, pork prices in the US dropped by one-fifth between 1970 and 2004. That means that factory farming is saving the average American consumer $29 a year. Whats the risk of a lethal global pandemic compared to savings like that?

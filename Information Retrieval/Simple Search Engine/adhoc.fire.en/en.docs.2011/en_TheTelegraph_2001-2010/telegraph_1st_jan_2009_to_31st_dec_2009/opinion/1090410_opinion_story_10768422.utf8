The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Mistaken identity and other errors
                                                                                                                 MISTAKEN IDENTITY AND OTHER ERRORS                                                      Nehru signing the Constitution                      
	THE ILLUSTRATED HISTORY OF THE FREEDOM STRUGGLE Project editor and photo research: Veena Baswani, Penguin, Rs 1,499              
	When a well-known publisher stoops to folly, things do take a sorry turn. Those who will turn the pages of this book will wonder about the credentials of the project editor since nowhere is there even a brief introduction about who she is. Her credentials to edit a book like this, which is vast in scope, is open to question because on page 127 she provides the following caption to a familiar picture: Lord Mountbatten with Jawaharlal Nehru, Mahatma Gandhi, Mohammad Ali Jinnah and other leaders. If you look at the picture carefully, you will discover that Gandhi is nowhere in the photograph. Baswani probably mistakes Vallabhbhai Patel sitting to the right of Nehru for Gandhi.        
	There are two points of importance here. One is the obvious one about mistaken identity. This is important because of the personalities involved and the roles they played in the freedom struggle, which is the theme of this book. Second, the error, I suspect, is rooted in the ignorance of the fact that Gandhi was not involved in the major negotiations regarding the transfer of power. The concerned picture is of one such parlay.        
	There are other lapses: on page 31, readers are told that the sepoys of Meerut after mutinying on May 10, 1857 marched to Delhi the next morning. Actually, the Meerut sepoys rode towards Delhi on the evening of May 10 and reached Delhi early on the morning of May 11. The same passage says that Bahadur Shah was virtually a pensioner of the British. What is meant by virtually? Bahadur Shahs only income was the pension the British gave him. On page 34 we read: When Lucknow, the beautiful city of gardens and palaces, was conquered by the British, Begum Hazrat Mahal, first wife of the deposed king, formally crowned her minor son as the formal ruler and refused to acknowledge the sovereignty of the British. Lucknow, or Awadh, of which it was the capital, was never conquered by the British; it was annexed by Lord Dalhousie in 1856. The same passage makes out the defence of Lucknow in the summer of 1857 to be the work of sepoys. (On 25 September, Sir Henry Havelock and Sir James Outram, with a small force, made repeated attacks on the sepoys.) Actually, the defence of Lucknow saw the largest mobilization of rebel forces in the history of 1857. Sepoys were joined by taluqdars, their retainers and common peasants. There is no sense of this in the caption. On page 135, there is a reproduction of a print of rebel sepoys being blown from canons. The place is said to be Lucknow. This is highly unlikely, and the hill in the background suggests a different location. On page 36, there is reprint of the massacre scene of Satichaura Ghat in Kanpur. Nowhere (not even in the small entry on revolt in Kanpur on page 37) does it say that the massacre was carried out by the rebels and that not even women and children were spared. The entry on the revolt in Kanpur does not even mention the massacres there, either the one at Satichaura Ghat or the one at the Bibighur. What kind of documentation is this?        
	It is harsh to say this, but regrettably, there is not a single picture or sentence that is in any way enlightening in this book. The only redeeming feature of this book is the introduction by Pavan K. Varma. It is not only lucidly written but it is also a serious and reflective essay. Varma does not rehearse the chronology of the national movement. He invites his readers to think with him about the movement that made India free, but left the country partitioned.        
	Varma does not gloss over the contradictions inherent in the movement, even the differences between eminent personalities. About Gandhi and Nehru he writes, The correspondence between Nehru and Gandhi is remarkable for the candour with which the young acolyte was willing to go on record against his mentor. The left-leaning Nehru was repeatedly flummoxed by Gandhis obscurantist fads and tactical eccentricities; he railed against the latters perplexing propensity to retreat to his ashram when strategically he should have been seizing the ripe political opportunity; and he found Gandhis economics conservative, even though his concern for the poor and the deprived was so apparent. Looking back on the popular participation in the freedom movement, Varma notes, this popular transformation was achieved largely without any change in the entrenched social structure or economic inequities in society.        
	What made the Indian national movement unique? One reason was its dialogic and capacious character. On this subject Varma writes, Dissent rather than conformity, debate rather fiat, dialogue rather than command, principle rather than expediency, co-option rather than exclusion, and ideology engaging with a wide range of issues rather than an obsession only with tactics  is what made the Indian freedom movement unique. This are wise words which could have been penned only by someone who has thought deeply on the events.        
	Since I work for the Ananda Bazar Patrika Group, I cannot resist pointing out that the groups name and the name of its flagship paper is consistently misspelt as Anand Bazaar Patrika. This is funny because the ABP Group is a major shareholder in Penguin India, the publishers of this volume.

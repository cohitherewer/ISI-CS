	Are children unhappier now because they have more freedom or less? They can watch more television and spend more money, but they have far less agency in matters of work and play in an increasingly competitive world, less scope to make mistakes and take responsibility for their actions. This is one example of the debates being generated by the The Good Childhood Inquiry commissioned by the Childrens Society in the United Kingdom. The study has found that children in the country are unhappier than those in other developed countries. India does not make the league, and it would be absurd to ask whether children in India are happy or unhappy when huge numbers of them do not play but have to work. Yet there are features of the report that are relevant to India. One theme of the inquiry deals with childrens mental health, and the findings show excessive TV-viewing as a major source of materialistic longings and of alienation from parents.        
	This is close to the bone. However different the conditions are in India, no one can deny that the coming of television in India has affected childhood and growing up, and not always positively. The spread of television in India has been remarkable. It is not just the urban middle-class child who watches TV, but children and young teenagers from underprivileged homes have happy access to it as well. In rural cultures that still hark back in numerous ways almost to pre-industrial times, the impact of commercial, commodity-driven TV on impressionable, unexposed, often unschooled young minds is incalculable. All the studies on the subject done so far have focused on the material longings induced in children by advertisers, precisely the tendency the British study has emphasized  what you own is what you are. Other studies move in the direction of doomsaying, demonstrating the effect that spectacles of rape, murder and violence, in fiction and reality, have on young offenders.        
	But this is still not the whole story. The effect on juvenile criminals is functional at best; criminality has far more complicated roots than TV-viewing. And consumerism is most discernible in the middle class. What is far more dangerous is the assault on a childs sense of reality. Positive thinking is good, but not at the cost of a dissonance in experience. This phenomenon goes beyond materialistic longing, confuses the understanding, inverts value-systems and creates unreal role models. The enormous gap between the lived lives of children in rural India and the visions projected by TV needs greater attention, if only to factor it into new programmes of education. There is always the inevitable expansion of general knowledge and awareness that TV-viewing also brings. But as long as there is a dearth of attractive, innovative childrens programmes building on this strength, and as long as the TRP for such programmes remains non-existent, the problems will outweigh the benefits.

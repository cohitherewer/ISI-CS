	Its different                  
	Sir  While it is customary in India to write panegyrics on the occasion of a deceased leaders birth or death anniversary, the editorial, Dark lady of India (Oct 31), was a welcome exception. The sudden death of Lal Bahadur Shastri catapulted Indira Gandhi to the premiership of the worlds largest democracy in 1966, at a relatively young age of 49. She ruled the country almost at a stretch up to 1984, barring the period of the Janata Party rule from 1977 to 79. During her initial years at the helm, a few bold steps were taken by her, such as abolition of the privy purse, nationalization of banks and the victory against Pakistan in the war to liberate Bangladesh. Otherwise, her long rule was tainted with sycophancy and misuse of the bureaucracy and the judiciary for personal aggrandizement, the worst side of which was manifested during the Emergency.          
	Although the editorial shows Indira Gandhi in the right perspective, it is a bit too uncharitable towards her pro-Soviet Union stance. Gandhis views in this regard must be judged in the backdrop of a world dominated by two superpowers. The Western powers were up in arms against India, and the Soviet Union was Indias only friend. It exercised its veto power in the United Nations time and again in support of India. Just before the Bangladesh war, when all the Western powers gave India a cold shoulder, the Soviet Union entered into a treaty of friendship and non-aggression with the country, thus providing a solid support against the Western powers led by the United States of America. It was natural for Gandhi, therefore, to take a pro-Soviet stand.          
	It is also unjustified to compare this stance of Gandhi with the foreign policy of P.V. Narasimha Rao or Manmohan Singh in recent years, when there is no socialist block and the world, led by the US, is unipolar.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Although both the good and bad deeds of Indias only lady prime minister were put forward in the editorial on her 25th death anniversary, the portrayal seemed shortsighted. It overlooked her benevolent deeds, and was harsh towards her. By depicting Indira Gandhi as the dark lady of India, the editorial has shown her no sympathy.           
	There have been gaps in the presentation of facts. Indira Gandhi was always against privatization. She was in favour of nationalization of the coal sector, with a vision for the government machinery. She should be lauded for her decision to nationalize banks. Designing the idea of banking under the public sector, prioritizing transparency and nationalism, Gandhi left no room for criticism. We, therefore, can certainly praise the virtues of the lady  at least some of her honest and noteworthy steps that are rarely discussed  before criticizing her.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Young and restless          
	Sir  In his article, Wake up and make the coffee (Oct 27), Somak Ghoshal has brought to light an issue that is a source of trouble for many students in Indian middle class families. It is a pity that in India, young boys and girls aspire towards so-called independence by procuring a job, but are unable to shed their basic habit of depending on others for their daily chores. Nothing but the over-indulgence of Indian parents is responsible for this situation. Belonging to a middle class family myself, I am aware of the fact that the overprotective atmosphere of a middle class home can be severely damaging to the development of the personality of a youngster. Youngsters tend to be attracted towards things that are not easily attainable. So once they are outside the confines of their homes, they have a tendency to choose wrongly.          
	I agree with Ghoshal when he says that Indian society considers the methods adopted by the West in raising children appalling. The problem is that the children in the West are provided with much freedom, which is not available to their Indian counterparts. We still find Indian mothers collecting leftovers from their sons plates, washing their clothes and, at times, even their underwears.          
	Ghoshal has also thoughtfully pointed out the difficulties faced by youngsters in Indian families when they experience the first stirrings of sexuality. Frequently, adult surveillance and lack of privacy at home result in embarrassment, confusion and repression .           
	If the youngsters of India today lack anything, it is a space to grow. Their parents are not ready to provide it. I agree with Ghoshal when he says that girls are better equipped than boys to take care of themselves. This is because they are mentally prepared for eventually leaving their homes.          
	When young boys, who have always been treated with excessive affection and care, decide to move out of their parental homes, they find the world outside too inimical for them to survive on their own. They are either unable to get over their indolent nature and are irritated by the prospect of having to do all the work, or they are so overwhelmed by their newly-attained independence that they cannot decide how to utilize it, and so end up doing all the wrong things.          
	Some others find the world outside completely devoid of friends and well-wishers. It seems tricky and selfish when compared to the secure atmosphere of home. As a result, these men and women often break down, turn into loners or develop anti-social habits. Pushpam Sinha of IIT Delhi, accused of murdering a girl recently, is a good example of this lot (Disorder signs in IIT suspect, Oct 27). It is a pity that parents in India are rendering their children unfit for the outer world in the name of protecting them.          
	Yours faithfully,

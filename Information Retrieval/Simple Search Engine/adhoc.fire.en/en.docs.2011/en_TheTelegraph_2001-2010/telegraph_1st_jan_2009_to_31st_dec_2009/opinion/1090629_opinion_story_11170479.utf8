	Sniffing out changes in the air regarding the reform of Indias archaic laws against homosexuality has become an important activity for those who would like to see the country as a modern democracy. But changing attitudes to sexuality and gender, although reflected in a countrys laws and policies, are part of larger social change happening at the level of the everyday life of ordinary men, women and children. So, it is bizarre that the entire issue of the reading down of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code seems to be tied, in India, to the personal attitudes of a handful of men in power. The matter had earlier reached a dead-end in court because the various Union home, law and health ministers could not come to a unified stand on whether or not the country is ready for the decriminalization of homosexuality. So the prime minister had to intervene and ask these ministers to resolve this impasse among themselves. With every change of minister, the situation becomes uncertain.        
	It is a trivialization of sexual justice to reduce it to the process of a dispute settlement among ministers in disagreement with one another. Why should a matter of such profound existential import for millions of people depend on the whims and attitudes of a few political leaders? Apart from an indigenous tradition of sexual tolerance going to back to the earliest foundations of Indian society, contemporary India has long been showing every readiness to accept the full range of sexual identities and behaviour as part of its modern character and commitment to plurality. HIV/AIDS certainly helped to make this part of the Indian public consciousness, but the question of sexual equality should be seen for what it is and not turned into a public health issue. This is a much larger reality than what a few ministers can, or cannot, imagine as normal behaviour.

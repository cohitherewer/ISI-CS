	Politics and education do not mix. Or perhaps it would be less alarming to say that politics and educational institutions do not mix. The Supreme Court has declared that a college campus is not an appropriate place for satyagrahas or protests. The pronouncement was made in the context of the appeal of a student from Kerala against the high court verdict upholding the decision of St Georges College, Aruvithura, to expel her after an inquiry into her grave indisciplinary behaviour. The judges asked her whether she thought she was Mahatma Gandhi, organizing satyagraha and carrying placards within the college premises. The irony came nicely packaged, since it is the Mahatma Gandhi University rules that do not allow political activity on campus. The student had been protesting against what she saw as unfairness in the college management, specifically her victimization by the principal, which was, she felt, a result of the fact that the principal and her father, a teacher in the college, did not get along. Her expulsion came at the end of a sequence of events that began with her quiet protest with a placard on the college premises.         
	Although the court has said nothing new, the point it has made needs emphasis and repetition, particularly with the violence and irregularities associated with student protests on campus. It would be truly healthy if political and apolitical protests of students did not mar the discipline and peace of an educational institution. There is no doubt that the court would have said the same when faced with the appeals of groups of students expelled from their colleges for protesting against alleged unfairness in the management. The question is whether the colleges would be as quick and as keen to expel groups of students, whether or not under the banner of a political party, as St Georges in Aruvithura has been to expel a single girl. No doubt the court is correct in saying that she should not have adopted a political mode of protest in an educational institution, even if, to take her at her word, she disrupted neither classes nor administrative work. But it would have been helpful if the court had been equally emphatic about the need for all teachers and administrators to abjure politics and the political on all campuses as well.

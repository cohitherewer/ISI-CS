	Calling names                  
	Sir  Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees ire at the renaming of some Metro Railway stations after icons of Bengal is understandable (CM tamasha thunder stirs anger in icon fans, Aug 24). However, the reasons he cited for his angry outburst are quite unacceptable. The replies by some celebrities to Bhattacharjees comments were equally needless. What the politicians and entertainers seem to have overlooked is the peoples wishes in this matter. Years later, when both Bhattacharjee and Mamata Banerjee will cease to have any importance, people may still find it difficult to remember that Tollygunge station and Mahanayak Uttam Kumar are one and the same. Surely, there are better ways to show respect to icons such as Uttam Kumar? Banning polluting vehicles, launching cleanliness drives, relocating slums, enforcing traffic rules and bringing about a sense of order in the city may help pay a fitting tribute to our heroes.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Subhash Mohanti, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The inauguration ceremony of the extension of the Metro Railway to Garia which was attended by numerous film personalities was a show of self-aggrandizement on the part of the railways minister and her over-enthusiastic party. One wonders how many people would use the new names of the stations. Even today, few residents of Southern Avenue know that it has been renamed Meghnad Saha Sarani. While reporting the frequent accidents on V.I.P. Road, the media seldom refer to the place as Kazi Nazrul Islam Sarani.           
	Instead of renaming Metro stations in an impractical manner, Mamata Banerjee should have considered rectifying some of the problems that persist in the Metro services. Senior citizens find it difficult to travel by the Metro as escalators are yet to be provided in every single station. The number of trains is inadequate, and only a few ticket counters are kept open during peak hours. Quite often, the automatic turnstiles do not work, particularly at Kalighat station, forcing the attendants to keep the emergency gates open. Reserved seats for the elderly need to be increased as well. It should also be remembered that the entire project suffered innumerable delays as well as escalation in costs. Enhanced safety measures need to be put in place to prevent mishaps. Names of railway stations and streets are changed to gain political mileage. But such moves should be banned by law. Moreover, old names are a part of the citys heritage, and they must be preserved for posterity.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Asit Kumar Mitra, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The increase in the number of passengers because of the extension of the route has put the Metro Railway under a lot of stress. This prevailing chaos is likely to continue unless some preventive steps are announced. Passengers are unlikely to avail of the Metro during rush hours. Hence, it might be a good idea to introduce some incentives such as concessions in fares to lure them back during this stretch of time. At present, there are no discounts on return tickets. If discounts are introduced on return fares, and the price of multi-ride tickets reduced, Metro Railway will not only reap in sizeable profits but also manage to lessen the crowds at ticket counters.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Hara Lal Chakraborty, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has accused Mamata Banerjee of insulting Bengals icons by naming a few Metro stations after them. This only exposes the chief ministers frustration at Banerjees rising popularity. It was unbecoming of Bhattacharjee to talk in this manner at a time when development work is being prioritized. The absence of the transport minister, Ranjit Kundu, from the inauguration ceremony was disgraceful as well. His predecessor, Subhas Chakraborty, would have attended the ceremony had he been alive. Bhattacharjee needs to give up on his boorish behaviour and act more like a chief minister than a party activist.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Kalyan Ghosh, Singapore

                
	Sir  I would like to thank Mamata Banerjee for renaming Tollygunge as Mahanayak Uttam Kumar. The Left Front regime had not permitted his body to be kept at Rabindra Sadan after he died. Therefore, naming a Metro station after him is a heart-warming tribute to the legend.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Anindya Bhattacharya, Calcutta

                
	Sir  These days, travelling on the Metro has become a nightmarish experience. The other day, I was literally pulled out of the train at Jatin Das Park station by a fellow passenger who was in a hurry to get off the crowded compartment. The extended services seems to be more of a bane than a boon.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Sharmila Nair, Calcutta

                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Religion and the true Indian          
	Chosen one          
	Sir  One of the television advertisements by the Congress shows a man declaring  Na main Hindu hoon, na main Mussalman, na Sikh, na Ishai, main ek Bhartiya hoon (neither am I a Hindu, nor a Muslim, nor a Sikh nor a Christian. I am an Indian). Does this mean a religious Hindu, Muslim, Sikh or Christian cannot be a proud Indian too? Does it also mean that to be a true Indian you have to be an atheist or a man without religion? Why does the Congress think there is a difference between a true Indian and a religious Indian?          
	Yours faithfully,       
S.B. Gupta, Calcutta

      
	Little choice          
	Sir  The editorial, Right not to choose (May 3), has dealt rightly with L.K. Advanis declaration that voting in elections should be made compulsory, by reminding us of the constitutional right of the citizen. However, the editorial does not indicate either support or objection to the inclusion of a none of the above button in the electronic voting machine, except to mention that this argument has some validity. But such an option has to be provided by the Election Commission, and the EC should also have the right to cancel the voters identity card if he or she cannot provide a valid reason for not voting.           
	If a person does not have faith in the democratic system at all, he should not apply for the identity card, as it is primarily given to the holder so that he can exercise his right of franchise. A right without responsibility is neither desirable nor acceptable, considering the expense and effort required by the State to conduct the election process.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Asit Kumar Mitra, 

      
	Calcutta          
	Sir  The so-called prime minister-in-waiting orders the democratic citizens of free India to vote, or else to pay a fine. But we, the people, would like to ask him, what does one do if one feels that no party is worth voting for?           
	We see candidates who can divide the country on communal lines, or people for whom their seat of power is far more important than the development of a state, or rabble-rousers with petty interests regarding their own pockets contesting the elections.           
	In the EVM, no one can waste their vote. So we need one more option on the EVM, which says, None from the list. This is because the people of India know the importance of their votes, and cannot let them go to the wrong person.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Kshama Agarwal, 

      
	Calcutta                              
	Parting shot          
	Sir  The editorial, Clean it up (May 6), has raised issues that touch our daily lives. We are exposed to the worst of industrial pollution against which we can do little, as corporate organizations are rich, and the government departments entrusted with the duty of checking pollution are corrupt to the core.           
	In the Kanpur leather industry, massive amounts of toxic waste are daily poured into the Ganges. This happens in broad daylight but the pollution control department refuses to see it. In my city, Durgapur, the sponge iron and ferro alloy plants have played havoc with the environment in the last five years. The state government undertaking, Durgapur Projects Limited, has joined hands with them. The pollution control department is well looked-after by the industries, and is blind to the pollution.           
	Now that Singur and Nandigram have happened, nobody dares to speak up against industry lest he or she be branded anti-development. With such cosy arrangements, industrialists are reaping huge profits and exposing us to the worst pollution. We are really helpless.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Deba Pratim Ghatak, Durgapur

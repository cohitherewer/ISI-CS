	Is the dollar losing its status as the premier international reserve currency? Since the end of 2008, the US dollar has depreciated by 4 per cent against a broad range of currencies. Against the currencies of the United States of Americas major trading partners, the dollar has depreciated by 6.3 per cent in 2009. (The rupee has appreciated by almost 2 per cent in 2009.) What is different this time, according to many economists, is that the US can no longer rely on the privilege of being the worlds banker, which accepts short-term deposits (central bank reserves in US Treasury bonds at low interest rates) and makes long-term investments at high average rates of return. Combined with other political developments, like China and other emerging markets taking on bigger roles in global economic forums like the Group of Twenty, many see this as the end of Americas economic and political hegemony.         
	The value of the US dollar and perceptions of global market and economic risks are inversely correlated: as risk aversion increases, the value of the dollar appreciates against other currencies as global investors flee to the safety of the US greenback. As risk appetite increases, however, and investors are willing to take bets on other global markets (mainly emerging economies), the dollar depreciates. But recently, this relationship seems to be less clear-cut; investors are now assessing the relative returns on dollar denominated assets against those on foreign assets. But the US dollar has been the primary reserve currency for 60 years, even when the gold standard was in place. Data on the composition of foreign exchange reserves show that for over 30 years, the share of the dollar in central bank reserves has never fallen below 50 per cent. Before the euro came into being in 1998, the German deutschmark and other European legacy currencies accounted for about 18 per cent of central bank reserves, and the Japanese yen for 9 per cent. The dollar, even today, accounts for about 62 per cent of all central bank reserves; the euro amounts to about 28 per cent, and the yen accounts for a paltry 3 per cent.        
	Five or six factors determine a premier global reserve currency: the size of the economy, its importance in global trade, the size, depth and openness of its financial markets, its convertibility and domestic macroeconomic policies. The euro area is as large as the US in terms of gross domestic product and is important in world trade, but the size and depth of the government bond market in euros are woefully short of the US version. It will be another decade before the Chinese yuan becomes a reserve currency; even in Hong Kong, it is used only in about 2 per cent of trade. To paraphrase what Mark Twain said when he saw his obituary in the New York Journal, reports of the dollars demise may be greatly exaggerated.

	 Speed limit        
	The government of Karnataka issued a notification under the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Rules which requires transport vehicles to be fitted with a speed governor (a speed-controlling device). A transport category mentioned in the notification was Maxi Cabs. The Taxi Mens Associations of certain districts of Karnataka challenged the notification, stating that Maxi Cabs should not have been brought under its purview as they were passenger vehicles. Dismissing the petition, the Karnataka High Court held that Section 112 of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules prohibits any person from driving at a speed exceeding the maximum limit or below the minimum limit fixed for the vehicle. As Maxi Cabs are also motor vehicles, there is no logic in the contention that they should be exempted from the rule, it added. (Raghupathy Bhat and others vs State of Karnataka)        
	Familys due                    
	 The Motor Accidents Claim Tribunal awarded Rs 8,48,160 to the family of a man who died in a road accident. An appeal was made on the grounds that in assessing the compensation, the tribunal had not considered that the widow who had been given a job on compassionate grounds was earning around Rs 4,700 per month and had accommodation as well. The high court upheld the order. Upon appeal, the Supreme Court held that the lower courts ought to have assessed the compensation more carefully. However, the incident had occurred 14 years before, and so, instead of remanding the matter to the tribunal, the court directed the family to withdraw the Rs 5 lakh that had already been deposited.

	Filial finance        
	 A woman who had five daughters started living separately after her husband remarried. The court awarded maintenance of Rs 125 per month to the wife and Rs 200 each to her two unmarried daughters. The wife asked for the payment of additional expenses as she had borrowed money to get her three other daughters married. However, since the loans could not be proved the trial court held that she was not entitled to further payment. Upon appeal, the Bombay High Court held that it was the fathers duty to get his daughters married. The court directed the husband to pay Rs 75,000 for the marriage of the three daughters.

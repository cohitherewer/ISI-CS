The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A necessary rite of passage
                                                                                                                 A NECESSARY RITE OF PASSAGE                              THEATRE      Ananda Lal                                                
	In terms of ambition, Ranans decision to stage Peter Shaffers Equus ranks pretty high, and should be applauded rather than considered foolhardy (which the director, Vikram Iyengar, fears). Indian theatre, and English-language theatre within it, should attempt such challenging texts more often, instead of pussyfooting around with safe bets that dont put the artists to severe tests. In this context, one can imagine the bravado of Siddhartha Basus Ninth Facet when it mounted Equus here in 1975, barely two years after John Dexter had wowed London audiences with the premiere for the National Theatre. Ranan is wrong, however, in stating that no Calcutta group has presented it since then. Coincidentally, Drishyapats unacknowledged Bengali adaptation, Aguner Barnamala (2006), even had shows during Ranans run this month.        
	Equus is appropriate because it deals with living dangerously, which our art should be doing, not relaxing complacently. Seventeen-year-old Alan Strang blinding six horses can, at its simplest, become the subject of protests against cruelty to animals, but much more than that, it represents an individuals maladjustment to society. His counsellor, Dr Dysart, recognizes that to cure him means to readjust him, to remove the very passion in him that made him live like a flame, and to make him normal like all of us.        
	What was Alans abnormality? Through indiscriminate exposure to television and contradictory parenting that glorified religion (his mother) and denied it (his father), and that avoided the topic of sex, Alan created a personalized faith that conflated religion, sexuality and the sensual power he felt in horses, sublimated through a desire to unite himself with nature, man with animal. He invented his own rituals, like many impressionable teenagers do, until a girl tried to seduce him in front of his equine gods; the act unconsummated, he blinded the horses in frustration and rage. Since to him, Equus was Christ (references abound in the script), in his confused state of mind Christs viewing of his original sin is wrong, so he does not want Him to either see or impede this necessary rite of passage that he must undergo to leave his adolescent belief system behind. Yet, as the girl seduced him, that too is wrong, for it profaned the sanctity of his temple.        
	Iyengars interpretation of the psychodrama as symptomatic of todays young and violent extremism (quoting Dysarts line, Extremity is the point) leads to an obvious answer: such misguided youths are in effect putting out the eyes of their Lord or, alternatively, their only release from the cult of violence occurs if they reject their Lord by blinding Him. But this theoretical allusion to terrorism does not appear visually in the production, while we could also counter Iyengar by arguing that violence is nothing new to our times alone: mankind has always had a cruel history.        
	The Kathak-based choreography for the horses by Iyengar and Amlan Chaudhuri, superbly performed by Ranans dancers and complemented by their headgear and luxuriant costumes (picture, designed by Katy and Dana Roy), afford the most memorable images. Shadab Kamal conveys the innocence of Alan, though in order to express his directors idea of the information overload upon contemporary youth, he should sing the TV jingles accurately. Opposite him, for Dysart, Iyengar interestingly cast a woman, Daminee Mukherjee, but she acts far too nervously to give a credible portrayal of a reputed psychiatrist. The supporting cast really lets down the acting by their heavy Bengali accent. I have nothing against English spoken in non-British accents, especially after the breakthrough in this area by Peter Brook and disciples like Tim Supple, since their actors compensated more than adequately. Here, the acting inexperience makes the delivery stick out like a sore thumb. Iyengar could just ask these performers to speak in Bengali, a perfectly acceptable solution. Barring the glitzy first track, Neel Adhikari composed fine accompanying music, and Sudip Sanyals pinpoint lighting gave the right contrasts and shadows.        
	An intelligent and informative brochure is a value-added item in theatre, which Ranan understands and budgets for. However, Iyengar contributes both a two-page directors note and a four-page concept note, which seems to me excessive. A director should not have to explain his approach so much, as the work on stage should speak for itself. This is one department where one misses the presence of a dramaturge, who looks after the academic side of a production in Western theatre, but about whose function Indian theatre remains ignorant.

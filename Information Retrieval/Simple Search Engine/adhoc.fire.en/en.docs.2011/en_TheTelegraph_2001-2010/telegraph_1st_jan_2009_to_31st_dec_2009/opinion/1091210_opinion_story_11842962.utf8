	The sole purpose of establishing an educational institution is the imparting of education. In fact, that is its only raison dtre. This sounds simple enough except to some people in West Bengal. To wit, the various college teachers unions which have embarked upon a campaign to stop Presidency College from becoming a university. These bodies do not have any rational argument against the move to make Presidency College a university. But they do have some vested interests. When Presidency College ceases to be a mere college, a number of things will happen automatically. One of these is that those who now work in Presidency College, and are thereby government servants, will cease to be part of the new university since the latter will no longer be a government institution. The existing staff of the college will be deployed by the government wherever it deems fit. This cannot be a welcome prospect for those who are now working in the college, especially for those who have spent more time in the union room than in the classroom. It will also make life difficult for those working in the other government colleges in West Bengal since the number of people seeking transfers to these colleges will go up. Hence, the clamour to stop Presidency College from becoming a university.        
	The government of West Bengal, if it is at all serious about making a last-ditch effort to raise the standard of higher education in the state and about saving West Bengals best college from descending further into decline, cannot afford to listen to the teachers unions, no matter what their political affiliations. Educational institutions do not exist to provide employment to people. They exist  and this is particularly true of a college like Presidency with its history and its library and laboratory resources  to provide access to learning and research at the highest possible level. Presidency College, in its present state, is not in a position to provide this, and therefore its character needs to be changed radically. It has to be freed from the University of Calcutta and from the government of West Bengal. This freedom should be the enabling condition for the new institution to appoint its faculty and staff so that it can perform its only function. Turning Presidency College into a university creates this enabling condition. Teachers unions and other vested interests should not be permitted to scotch the move.

                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	True spirit                  
	Sir  The editorial, No objection (Sept 15), points out the miserable state of affairs prevailing in the administrative departments of Calcutta. The police, fire service department, environment ministry and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation are all required to look after the comfort and convenience of the citizens. It is because they do not act when they ought to that a few enterprising citizens have to approach the court for intervention in such matters as the reduction of noise and air pollution, protection of the Maidan greens and so on.          
	Of late, people have spoken out in favour of public safety and freedom of movement when muscle-flexing Puja organizers showed no concern for citizens rights and built road-hogging pandals. The administration prefers to remain blind to such breaches of road laws, and we all know why. The court issues orders based on the law of the land, and then the government departments and CMC sit on them. They always fail to act on the court directives but will never admit their failure.           
	If the administration wakes up even now to its responsibilities, the citizens of Calcutta will be considerably relieved. It is not only the Puja pandals that restrict our freedom. At many places, roadside stages and stalls are also put up that block footpaths and the entrances to residential buildings. These need to be checked as much as the pandals constructed during Durga and Kali Pujas. Such control needs to be exercised in the entire CMC area and also in the parts under the jurisdiction of the West Bengal Police in the North and South 24-Parganas.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  I am a resident of C.A. Block in Saltlake. The authorities for the blocks puja have hung lights from the barbed wire fence of our house. I asked the electricians to hang them from non-metallic surfaces but they refused to listen. Later, I got in touch with the secretary of the block association, who came and inspected the situation. Upon calling him the next day, I was told he was busy. Then he actually said things like na parle hobe na, tumi laphalaphi korte thako (you cant say no, no matter how much you protest) and tumi to eikhane thakbena sab samaye (you will not always stay here)  this referring to the fact that I am an NRI and so would not be able to follow up on the issue. But the problem is grave since the moment the lights are turned on, there is a very real chance of the entire fence getting electrified. The bulbs do not even have simple safety devices like holders or insulating tapes.            
	Yours faithfully,      
Anirudh Chamria, Calcutta 

      
	Sir  It is that time of the year again  the time when Bengalis celebrate Durga Puja, and life comes to a standstill for all practical purposes. Every year, I feel irked by the barricades created by Puja organizers to help people visiting the pandals maintain a proper queue. The Puja committees use bamboos for the barricades that are jabbed into holes dug on the edges of footpaths and on roadsides. At the end of the festival, these barricades are removed overnight, leaving gaping holes, which can be a potential source of danger for the unwary pedestrian. Days, and sometimes weeks, pass by before any action is taken to rectify the damage done. Even then, the action very often involves dumping a small amount of stone chips and, with luck, a bit of coal tar or cement into the holes, without any attemptto level them with the surrounding surface. The result is that theroad or the footpath remains bumpy.   
	Legend has it that Asaf-ud-Daula, the nawab of Awadh who built the Bara Imambara in Lucknow, had formulated a plan of having the structure built during the day and getting it dismantled through the night. It was a system of food-for-work, meant to tide over the famine that raged in the region at that time. There is hardly any reason for politicians today to emulate the nawab by having roads and pathways constructed only to disfigure themYours faithfully,

	Marching order          
						Sir  After forming the so-called Gorkhaland personnel, which is now running amok brandishing sticks, being the moral police and holding the hill region to ransom in general, the separatist outfit, Gorkha Janmukti Morcha, is about to form its own army(Morcha plans own army, Sept 14). The reason put forward by the Morcha for forming its armed forces  that this would be a guerrilla army trained to prevent Chinese aggression  can, on the face of it, be dismissed as absurd or as a display of patriotism to further the case of Gorkha statehood. But given the increasing clout of the Morcha, it is no longer easy write it off so easily.           
	The Morcha has been steadily gaining in strength over the last few years. From being a supposedly peaceful lobby for statehood, the GJM has gone on to create a parallel administration, enforcing its will through intimidation and violence, and will soon be forming an armed guerrilla force. It does not require a doctorate in political science to guess where this is leading  to a full-fledged secessionist movement, operating on the lines of the many liberation army outfits of the Northeast.          
	The Darjeeling district is rapidly becoming a disturbed area. Terrorist violence would be a natural consequence of the present troubles. Yet both the Central and state governments have remained indifferent to the inherent and growing threats of the Gorkhaland movement. Is the Union home minister aware of the dangers posed by an armed guerrilla group demanding virtual independence? Given the circumstances, immediate measures declaring the GJM a banned outfit is necessary. It is time the administration acted tough with the separatists.          
	Yours faithfully,        Amit Banerjee, Calcutta

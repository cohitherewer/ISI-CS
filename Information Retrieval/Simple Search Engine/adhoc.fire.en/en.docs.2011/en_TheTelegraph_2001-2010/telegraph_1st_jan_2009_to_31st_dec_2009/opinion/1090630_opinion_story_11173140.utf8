                                                                                                                 NOT TA TA                                                    
	The Tatas are not particularly renowned for luck or success; there were decades of socialism when they hung on by their teeth while the government showered its own steel plants with favours and buried the rest under controls. But they have a reputation for sagacity  a reputation that is at risk of being tattered by their impetuous acquisitions of last year. The profits of Tata Steel have declined from Rs 12,350 crore in 2007-08 to Rs 4,951 crore in the year just past. It has not disclosed how much of the fall is due to Corus. But the steel output of Corus has fallen 14 per cent. It has increased its sales by nine per cent by raising prices; but that has not stopped its losses.        
	Corus will be a millstone around Tata Steels neck for some time to come, but is unlikely to sink it. The plight of Tata Motors is direr. The bulk sales of Jaguar Land Rover were down 32 per cent in the 10 months to March 2009. Retail volumes did slightly better; even then, Russia and China were the only markets in which they increased. With its separation from Ford, Jaguar Land Rover lost the support of Fords worldwide sales organization; it is now being rebuilt at enormous cost. As a result, Jaguar Land Rover made a loss of 306 million, and had to be given 686 million by Tata Motors. Its poor performance turned Tata Motorss 2007-08 profit of Rs 2,168 crore into a loss of Rs 2,505 crore in 2008-09. The Tatas reassured their financiers in Europe that the liquidity of Jaguar Land Rover was not in danger. Their Indian investors must be worried about what would happen to Tata Motorss liquidity if its British prodigal son continued in his drunken ways.        
	However, two mistakes do not a disaster make, nor do they exhaust Tatas sagacity. Tata Consultancy Services, the unacknowledged jewel in the Tatas crown, continues to do surprisingly well. It increased its revenues in the last year by 23 per cent, and although its margins shrank, it still raised its profits by five per cent. The current year will not be nearly so good, for both profits and sales shrank in the last quarter. But TCSs strong verticals and its portfolio of first-tier clients make it a good candidate for survival into better times. TCS led the renaissance of the Tatas in the 1990s; maybe it will lead their revival 20 years later. It is remarkable how the Tatas manufacturing companies dominate the investors minds, and perhaps command the Tatas attention. But the future of the Tatas lies elsewhere.

                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Not to state the obvious                  
	Sir  H.D. Deve Gowda has enjoyed the favours of fortune more than any other politician in India. His stint as prime minister  a job he neither deserved nor was qualified for  has not familiarized him with the constitutional proprieties. Gowda has been fighting a losing battle in his home state on the Bangalore-Mysore expressway project. It was amusing to see him, happy with the outcome of the third front, embracing N. Chandrababu Naidu, who made him the PM and then unmade him. To say that politics is business is to state the obvious.          
	Yours faithfully,        J. Akshobhya, Mysore 
        
	Just clarifying          
	Sir  In his article, Siding with the rich (March 16), Chandrashekhar Dasgupta raises some pertinent points with which we fully concur. Emissions from developed countries are the main source of todays global warming, yet developing countries will be its worst victims; developed countries possess much greater financial and technological capacity to contribute to a solution; poor countries need continued rapid economic and social development in their struggle against poverty. Indeed these three points are so important that they form the premise on which the World Development Report, 2010: Development in a Changing Climate is based.          
	The messages coming out of the initial drafts of the report (it will be published in July 2009) are clear and unequivocal. All countries have a stake in solving climate change, but developed countries must take the lead in drastically reducing their emissions to deliver significant mitigation. They will also need to provide substantial additional financial assistance to help developing countries reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the effects of a changing climate. Mitigation, adaptation and the deployment of technologies have to happen in a way that promotes growth and reduces poverty in the developing countries. The voices and interests of the poorer and smaller countries must be heard more clearly and taken into account more concretely.          
	These messages are consistent with feedback from wide-ranging global consultations the World Bank had undertaken last year, and are supported by its many initiatives on climate change. The World Bank is committed to the principles of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Bali Action Plan, which was agreed to by more than 180 countries in December 2007.          
	We hope this letter would provide the discerning readers with a balanced perspective on an issue of global importance.                    
	Yours faithfully,        Sudip Mozumder,
  Advisor,External Affairs (India)The World Bank, New Delhi            
	Parting shot   
	Sir The Calcutta Metro requires an urgent facelift. In many stations, the automatic turnstiles often do not work. This creates hellish queues, especially during rush hours. This happens most frequently at the Esplanade, Central, Chandni Chowk and Girish Park stations.           
	The Calcutta Metro used to be one of the best in the world. A major portion of it runs underground, unlike the Delhi Metro, a good deal of which runs on the surface, looking like the circular railway system here. The trains in Calcutta seem to have a larger number of compartments compared to those in Delhi. The authorities here should chalk out a modernization plan and replace or repair the defective machinery as soon as possible.           
	The citys pride must not be undermined for no fault of its citizens.                    
	Yours faithfully,        Ashok Kumar Ghosh, Calcutta

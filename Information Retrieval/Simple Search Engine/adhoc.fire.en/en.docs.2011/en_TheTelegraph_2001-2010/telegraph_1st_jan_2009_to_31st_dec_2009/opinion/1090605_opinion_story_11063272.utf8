	International opinion does not seem to weigh too heavily on Pakistan. It did not stop to bother about what the world would think before releasing Abdul Qadir Khan, the so-called father of Pakistans nuclear bomb, soon after the Mumbai killings, when world opinion was heavily arrayed against it. It has less reason to bother now when anti-Taliban operations have warmed the cockles of its Western allies hearts. Pakistan has therefore proceeded with the release of Hafeez Saeed, the Jamaat-ud-Dawa chief, a prime suspect in the Mumbai carnage. In following the technicalities of law, Pakistan has shown as much sincerity as it did when the Punjab government was dismissed only months ago on the basis of a court verdict  a ruling which was overturned with little difficulty. Like the vulnerability of the Shahbaz Sharif government in Punjab, the invincibility of Mr Saeed was predictable. There were enough loopholes in the procedure followed during the house arrest to warrant this eventuality. Despite evidence, the arrest was made in keeping with a United Nations resolution, which, as pointed out, is not legally binding on the government. Nor was the resolution implemented in its entirety. The JuD assets remained unfrozen, and no reasons were cited to Mr Saeed, as required by law, for his incarceration. The case, as a result, fell through. There was little to hold back the JuD chief from either his much-advertised charity or his much-vaunted engagement with the Kashmir cause.        
	Not surprisingly, the release coincides with a renewed vigour in the Pakistan establishment to rake up the Kashmir issue. After an enforced lull, Pakistan is back to pointing at Kashmir as the key to durable peace in the region, and the West, suddenly, appears eager to listen. The United States of America, which has announced an additional $200 million aid to compensate for the drone strikes, has stopped harping on Indias virtues to Pakistan, and the United Kingdom, together with China, has shown a heightened sensitivity to Pakistans sentiments by refusing to internationally censure Mr Saeed. The subtle change in international mood is not a very happy precursor to the reopening of dialogue which India is considering. India cannot but be aware that its neighbour now has the advantage. Pakistan has tamed the West, got all the aid it wanted, has manoeuvred Kashmir back into focus and forced India to the table without moving an inch on the Mumbai investigations, which had been a precondition to talks.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A festival uniquely its own
                                                                                                                 A FESTIVAL UNIQUELY ITS OWN                                  To the many communities in the city, the Durga Puja means different things, or may not mean anything at all. Some Calcuttans long to join, others to flee it                          Warm glow                                  
	My friend Daniel has memories strangely similar to mine of Durga Puja in school  of not doing much. While Daniel would spend time with his family, catching a movie or making a short trip, I remember mostly staying at home too and basically doing anything I would have done during the summer or winter vacations. One of the major grievances of my mother used to be the fact that we could not visit our relatives in Bombay. Durga Puja vacations in Calcutta invariably clashed with the mid-term examinations of my cousins, for whom the holidays would not begin till after Diwali.        
	For Marie, a second generation Armenian in Calcutta, Durga Puja is essentially a time relax, to catch up with friends, and stay at home. No one really minds a short period off from work. Christmas is our festival, she says; this ones just a nice break, one that comes without the baggage of having to entertain a host of relatives and acquaintances within a closely-knit community. She has sampled her share of pandals, about once or twice, some couple of decades ago, she recalls. It is the crowd and the noise that keep her off, along with the fact that she does not feel even a part of the enthusiasm that she sees others being carried away by.        
	It is a normal working day for some others. A young businessmen I met at the Calcutta Parsi Club reasoned it was profitable for him to keep his shop open, especially so during the Pujas, when the rest of the market is shut. He gets the entire share of any little activity that takes place in the market, since he is the only one open. Work is light and in the evenings, he goes around the city with friends or family.         
	An elderly member of the club, an ardent pandal-hopper in his younger days, says he wouldnt dare step out now because of the crowd that has increased manifold since his youth. You could take your car right up to a pandal, look around and drive off, he states with incredulity at the situation now. A fellow member sitting beside him, when asked what he does during the Pujas, replied, What I do everyday  that is, spend time at the club. Pandal-hopping is on the cards, but never when the crowds are high. We get back by 9 at the latest. He used to be fascinated at how his friends could tell the difference in the features of the goddesss face  the way the eyes were painted differently  while the main attractions for him were the pandals, their majesty, the intricacies in their architecture, and so on.        
	The lights  an enthusiasm I inherited from my father  were the main incentive for us to go out to the pandals in the evenings. After he shut shop early, we would set off, but not before he had said his namaz at sundown, just in time to see the lights come aglow. Like the gentlemen in the Parsi Club, my father would make it a point to return home as early as possible too. On an evening some six years back, we got caught in bad traffic, after which my father vowed never to stay back that late again.         
	No one I spoke to remembers being particularly inconvenienced by the disruption in city life. But what was missing from these accounts was the single-mindedness in the pursuit of the festivities that everyone around them seemed to have. Having lived in Calcutta all my life, I still do not understand it. I know very little about what exactly happens to the lives of all the people engrossed in celebrating the festival, and how their lives are totally transformed during those few days. I know only of what is very difficult not to notice  the crowds, the pandals, the lights and the sales. Why I do not see anything beyond is perhaps because I never really went the extra mile like Daniel told me he did. He remembers badgering people with questions in order to know of the myths and stories behind the events. He spends the Pujas with a friends family in Chandernagore, participating in their ceremonies at home. He is skipping a family trip to Shankarpur this year just to remain in and around the city. He wouldnt dream of staying away.                                INSIYA POONAWALA

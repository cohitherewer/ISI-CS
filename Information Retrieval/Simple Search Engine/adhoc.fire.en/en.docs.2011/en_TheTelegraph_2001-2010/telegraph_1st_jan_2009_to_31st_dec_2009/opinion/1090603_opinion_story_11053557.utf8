The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | long collapse
                                                                                                                 LONG COLLAPSE                                                    
	A spectre has long haunted West Bengal  the spectre of the collapse of the system. It has now been sighted in the Sunderbans. The plight of thousands of people there is only partly because of Cyclone Aila. It is an utterly incompetent administration that now poses a much bigger threat to their lives. More than a week after the calamity, the administration is struggling to get its act together. It is not the shortage of money or relief material that is the biggest problem. It is not as if there are no honest, hard-working officials. But the rot in the states administration has little to do with the good intentions of officers and men. The collapse of the administration is essentially a result of the political culture that the ruling Marxists nurtured over three decades. That it has bred a lack of work culture is only a small part of the story. The worst damage was caused by the Marxists strategy of putting a premium on incompetence. Almost at all levels and in all sectors of the administration, people at the top were chosen, not because of their proven competence, but because of their loyalty to the satraps of the Communist Party of India (Marxist). The men who reigned at the CPI(M) offices in towns and villages usurped the functions of the administration. At the Calcutta headquarters, the late secretary of the partys state unit, Anil Biswas, presided over this process.         
	Neither the chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, nor his predecessor, Jyoti Basu, did anything to reverse the process. The problem is not with a ruling party prescribing policies for its government. What the CPI(M) did was more damaging: it made the administration entirely subservient to its partisan interests. When Mr Bhattacharjee won a huge mandate in the assembly polls in 2006, The Telegraph reminded him that his party could be the worst enemy of his administration. To be fair to him, he did show some promise of unshackling himself from Alimuddin Street. But he stopped short of banishing the party from the administration, which was packed with people who simply did not have the capacity to deliver. If the Calcutta Municipal Corporation or the district administration in the cyclone-hit areas is incapable of handling a crisis, it is because of the slow death of the system. No half-measures can undo the damage. But can the Marxists ever change their ways?

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A day at the museum
                                                                                                                 A DAY AT THE MUSEUM                                  Bona Fide - Malvika Singh                              
	The time has come to act swiftly and efficiently to overhaul and restructure our museums and archives both at the Centre and in the states. There is no getting away from the clear and disturbing fact that all the institutions that house the tangible objects of our varied culture are in a dreadful condition, being ruled by the most archaic management norms and regulations. The excuse given is that there is not enough money to conserve, restore, protect and display. This is not true at all. The real problem is that people disconnected with and disinterested in the business of museums are at the helm. More often than not, they are frustrated babus marking time, waiting for a better posting. It is tragic and criminal at the same time.        
	The first step is to release all such institutions from the clutches of the government and re-convene them as equal public-private partnerships. This will bring in the first injection of professionalism and upgradation. Working closely with the finance ministry, special tax concessions need to be introduced that will encourage individuals and private institutions to participate in all such ventures. Museum heads must be selected in the way they are they are in all countries across the globe. A fresh act needs to be crafted and tabled in Parliament for a vote that will liberate the functioning and revenue-generation of our museums. The restructuring could be straightforward if backed by a true will to change.        
	It is quite shameful that 62 years after Independence we have a national museum where all the negative aspects of museum management is showcased. As you climb the steps to enter the portico, you are greeted with careless, nose-picking, scratching officers on duty chatting with one another as you wait to have your hand bag examined and your body checked. Disgusting welcome. Then you walk straight ahead to a sales counter where, once again, the babu employed is lazily speaking on the phone to a friend or colleague. You ask to see a reproduction of a painting or a book and you feel as if you have intruded into a private domain where trespassers are prohibited. Everything is always unavailable. The counter could be shut down and the babus on shift sent home. It would save the exchequer.                
	Continuous value        
	The badly lit galleries, where great sculptures and unmatched objects are displayed with zero imagination, insulting the master creators, watched over by bored, sleepy, uncouth, guards in grubby clothes, makes one wonder why there is so much disrespect for India. Desperately trying to move away from complete disillusionment, the natural attraction is for some quick retail therapy. One walks into the Handicrafts and Handlooms Export Corporation managed art shop on the first floor where the minder is having his lunch of dosa and sambhar on the cash counter. The smell of masalas and hing overwhelms ones senses. The products on sale represent the worst of that which is made in India. One shudders with embarrassment and beats a hasty retreat.        
	There can be no adequate explanation for this terrible and shameful reality. All over the world, museums and archives have been restructured to make them user-friendly and resource-generating public spaces. Why does babudom in India insist on destroying the spirit of such places? Why do they not model themselves on The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the British Museum, or the Louvre? And then, to top it all, the same babu and his boss, the politician, gets all hot and bothered if any criticism comes their way. They do nothing to make these institutions user-friendly. But museums and restored areas are of enormous interest to people and they generate large resources that can be ploughed back to add continuous value.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A kiss with the eyes open
                                                                                                                 A KISS WITH THE EYES OPEN                                  News photographs often say far more than is apparent, or even intended. The three here provoke questions about visuality and what it means to be modern                                            
	This Fotocorp image appeared in colour on the Nation page of The Telegraph on January 2 this year, little more than a month after the Mumbai attacks. The caption said, A couple kiss at the Gateway of India in Mumbai on New Years Eve. Around the photograph and sharing the same strapline were reports on banned, but reborn, terrorist groups, mysterious FBI investigations in Pakistan, and about India claiming to have evidence from the US about the Lashkar-e-Toibas role in the attacks. The Fotocorp search results for the image list a telling cluster of Keywords under it: RAF, Celebration, New Year, Enjoy, Bomb.        
	It is an image that continues to fascinate me for two reasons. First, the man is kissing, or is about to kiss, the woman with his eyes open  something that goes against the human reflex of shutting ones eyes during a kiss (birds keep their eyes open when they bill and coo). Second, the dizzying multiplicity of looking and clicking and reproducing that converges in this image as we look at it in the papers. A man is photographing his act of kissing a woman, and both the kiss and his act of photographing it are being photographed by a photojournalist, who then sells this image to an agency from which a newspaper buys it so that we can look at it. So you, reader, are looking at me looking at a photojournalist looking at a pair of kissers looking at themselves, and each link in this chain is using his or her eyes in a different way and for a different set of needs.        
	In this endless regress of frames, not only the human gaze, but also the extension of that gaze into the apparatuses of viewing, recording and reproducing  the camera and the mobile-phone  have complicatedly interconnected roles to play. Moreover, around these frames-within-frames there are other intangible, but no less real, frameworks in place: urban societies in transition and their public codes of behaviour, and the whole question of terror and surveillance and evidence, in both of which the camera, the mobile phone and the mobile-phone camera play a crucial and increasingly ungovernable role. There are also the media, which mediate such images to us, and determine the contexts in which we view them: what is around a photograph on the page of a newspaper, and therefore what is centrally and peripherally in the readers mind when he is looking at it. But in this case, it all began with a kiss, and with two peoples desire and ability to photograph it  two people who needed to have their eyes open for the photograph to happen, and who were looking at what they were not supposed to have been looking at (though for slightly different reasons).        
	Yet, they did look and they did click. And instantly, their wanting to do so, and their being able to do so, begin to mean something that is larger than their individual lives and their specific acts of kissing and looking and photographing. For a man to be able to kiss a woman on the streets of Mumbai, for that man to have a mobile phone with which to record the kiss, and for a photographer to capture the moment and make it part of news, a whole set of changes has to be happening in India simultaneously that compel us to ponder the relationship between visuality and what it means to be modern.        
	What is happening, for instance, to notions of privacy and proprietorship in, and around, this photograph? We dont license pictures for personal use, warns Fotocorp, and behind this copyrighted image lingers the ghost of another one of the same kiss that may or may not exist now in the kissers camera and would perhaps mean a very different set of things for him and his companion. Shahid and Kareena Kapoor, or Suchitra Sen, would all have learnt by now how easily images can move between private and public domains, and how being the subject of a photograph need not necessarily mean owning it or being able to ensure who looks at it and how. The advancement and proliferation of technology could make one powerfully more, as well as pathetically less, in control of ones relationship with the world. And the ubiquity of photography today is perhaps one of the best examples of this double-edgedness.        
	Feeling the thrill of security, even if for a moment, is of the essence of kissing with ones eyes shut. In a city that has repeatedly known bombs as well as bigotry, a kiss on the street is not only like a twofold resumption of normalcy, but also a symbol of a society coming of age. Yet, there is a slight shake in the image, the merest hint of doubled vision  the desire to kiss inseparable from the desire to be in a picture of a kiss.                    AVEEK SEN

                                                                                                                 THE ODD MAN OUT                                  Abhijit Bhattacharyya                              
	The Union defence minister, A.K. Antony, has a reputation for probity. So much so that at times, he is affectionately referred to as Saint Antony. Remaining true to his reputation, Antony recently blacklisted seven arms manufacturers on the grounds of alleged irregularities. While at least three of them are high-profile companies from Poland, Singapore and Israel, four other are Indian firms. It would be interesting to analyse the possible impact of this step on the future of Indias arms bazaar, considering the lack of transparency surrounding certain types of inventory and the growing clamour among commanders to have the best and have it fast.        
	Allegations of irregular conduct had been first heard during the Anglo-French Jaguar deal in the 1970s. India then was a country that was controlled by the State. To make things totally fool-proof, the countrys defence needs were mostly met with the help of government-to-government transactions between South Block and Kremlin. Since the Indian economy was virtually closed till the early 1990s and the erstwhile Soviet Union was a dominant force in the Indian defence market, there was little that Anglo-Saxon nations could do to compete or challenge the former Soviet Unions monopoly.        
	Two unexpected scandals rocked Indias defence establishment in the 1980s when the Airbus-320 and the Bofors artillery guns were selected for the Indian sky and for frontier deployment respectively. Significantly, both were of non-Soviet make and had been selected through open tenders.With the opening of the Indian economy, every major defence deal came under the scanner. The simultaneous break-up of the USSR also paved the way for the entry of numerous foreign companies into India.                 
	Lone battle        
	An unconnected  nevertheless crucial  development played a critical role in the burgeoning of Indias defence market in the 1990s. As the Cold War receded, major arms-manufacturing enterprises suffered losses and the consumer market shifted from the Occident to the Orient. China and India emerged as the two pillars of Russian export and several European companies merged with their competitors. In the United States of America too, the big names went for massive restructuring ,thereby enhancing competition and making it more unethical.        
	Seen in this background, one would realize the gravity of the future scenario. By 2020, only the winner of the Indian deal will likely still be in production was the assessment of the experts in the recent Paris air show. Indias proposed 126 fighter aircraft contract apart, Brazil is the only other country contemplating the purchase of 40 fighters, forcing manufacturers to rush to become the sole vendor. The shrinking number of big buyers and smaller budgets have meant that the future will be a bleak one for arms manufacturers.         
	The situation is the same on ground, in the air or on sea. Expectedly, the BRIC nations  Brazil, Russia, India and China  are attracting the attention of the military merchants. And these merchants will certainly not baulk at paying bribes to keep their rivals at bay.        
	Antonys decision to blacklist companies from Israel, Poland and Singapore is a bold step. But one doesnt quite know whether he will succeed in making the process of arms procurement in India transparent. The defence minister cuts a lonely figure in the top echelons of the defence establishment, which is peopled by numerous foreign stake-holders and by an equal number of Indian lobbyists who are waiting to create wealth for themselves. Indeed, the odds are too heavy against one honest individual who has decided to sit on the judgment of military affairs.

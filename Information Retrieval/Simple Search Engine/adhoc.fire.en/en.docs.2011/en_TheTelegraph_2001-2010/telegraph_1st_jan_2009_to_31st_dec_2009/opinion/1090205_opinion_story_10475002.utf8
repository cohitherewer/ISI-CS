                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Three cheers                  
	Sir  When Sania Mirza arrived on the Indian tennis scene, she raised quite a hue and cry. Everyone expected a great deal from this rising star. But after some years, except for a few triumphs here and there, she failed to live up to the standards set by her fans and critics. Gradually, their attention shifted from her game to her sartorial tastes. As a result, tennis was sacrificed at the altar of glamour.           
	Now, after winning the Australian Open mixed doubles with Mahesh Bhupathi, Mirza has made a glorious comeback. She has proved that if someone has iron determination and robust optimism, then the impossible turns out to be a myth. This being her first Grand Slam title, we hope that she will bring more honours to her country in the future.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Anindya Bhattacharya, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Mahesh Bhupathi and Sania Mirza deserve our heartiest congratulations for their first Grand Slam title together, after defeating Andy Ram and Natalie Dechy in straight sets in the mixed doubles final of the Australian Open (Title for Indians, Feb 2). Bhupathi got his 11th Grand Slam with this win, and his seventh in mixed doubles, while for Mirza this was her maiden victory. With a second mixed doubles title in the Australian Open, after the 2006 triumph with Martina Hingis, Bhupathi has also become a veteran of sorts.           
	This was a particularly propitious week for Indian tennis, since Yuki Bhambri also created history by becoming the first Indian to win the Australian Open junior title. India is proud of the achievements of this trio.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Suman Kukal, Chandigarh 

                
	Sir  Sixteen-year-old Yuki Bhambri has inspired an entire generation of aspiring tennis players by clinching the Australian Open junior singles title (Delhi boy hits Aussie winner, Feb 1). Ramanathan Krishnan and Ramesh Krishnan, the father-son duo, and Leander Paes are the only other Indians to have won junior titles at the Wimbledon, the US Open and the French Open. After this success, Bhambri deserves to be trained well so that he can become a champion in the future. However, a word of caution is necessary here: Indian junior tennis heroes often fail to maintain their standards as they graduate to the senior level. The sports bodies should analyse the causes for this, and take proper measures to check the trend so that India can produce more world-class players.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Ashok Kumar Ghosh,Calcutta              
	Sir  Mahesh Bhupathi and Sania Mirza should be warmly lauded for their success in the Australian Open. While Bhupathi is already an accomplished doubles player, this was a first for Mirza. Before Bhupathis acrimonious break-up with Leander Paes,the two of them had formed one of the most potent doubles combinations in the world. However, mutual clash of egos led to them parting ways.           
	Since then, Indian tennis has not tasted as grand a success as it did at the Australian Open this year. Bhupathi has played the role of a mentor to Sania in their partnership. Let us hope that the tide has finally turned for Indian tennis, and that this would be the first of many more laurels to follow.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Culture wars          
	Sir  It is hard to find the right words to condemn the reprehensible act committed by the self-appointed guardians of Hindu culture, calling themselves Sri Ram Sena, in Mangalore. The attack carried on young girls and boys, who were enjoying themselves in a pub, was recorded by the media for the entire country to witness.           
	It is strange that the police took action only belatedly. Even more baffling is the way the Bharatiya Janata Party had to fight fire, and Lal Krishna Advani had to resist a hooliganism blow, although the Ram Sena is clearly not associated with either of them (Pub attack arrests as BJP fights fire, Jan 28). If the BJP has to defend itself in Karnataka, why did the Congress get away without apologizing for the misdeeds of the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena in its home state?                     
	Yours faithfully,      
S.B. Gupta, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Is it a coincidence that a single pub attack in Karnataka is highlighted to such an extent just because there is a BJP government in the state, while the lawlessness in Maharashtra is pushed under the carpet since the state has a Congress-allied government?A wave of law-breaking seems to be sweeping across Maharashtra recently. For the past two years, the vandalism was confined mostly to the Raigad district. But once it became known that the government was in no mood to rein in any party, be it the Shiv Sena or the communists, the protesters have been on an uninhibited rampage.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  The editorial, One head (Jan 28), rightly points out how factionalism in the ruling party at the Centre affected the office of the prime minister. While Pranab Mukherjee had been asked to sit in on behalf of the ailing prime minister in cabinet meetings, and was given additional portfolios, the defence minister, A.K. Antony, had the privilege of presiding over the Republic Day celebrations. Manmohan Singhs hospitalization exposed the lacuna in the Constitution, which declares the acting prime minister a non-entity. But this does not give any political party the licence to make a mockery of the office. In times of emergency, such a duality or confusion can deepen the crisis. It could give rise to two power centres. The Congress should have full faith in Pranab Mukherjee, who was once considered one of the finest finance ministers ever, and always fulfilled his duties with lan.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Sujit De, Sodepur

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | bad losers
                                                                                                                 BAD LOSERS                                                    
	All politicians squabble, but losers do so more than others. That perhaps explains why Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee cried foul over the programme that marked the extension of the Metro Railway in Calcutta. He could have justifiably complained about the way the state government was ignored at the opening of the extended line. After all, the state government bore 33 per cent of the expenses. But the chief minister was upset about the manner the names of Bengali icons were used at the programme. If this was meant to be a strategy to fight his bte noire, Mamata Banerjee, it is hopelessly flawed. The extension of the Metro has long been awaited, and its role in easing the transportation problem in Calcutta is beyond doubt. Mr Bhattacharjee should actually be happy, like ordinary Calcuttans, that the extended line has finally opened. What he said about it instead gives the impression that he used the event in order to settle political scores with Ms Banerjee. Yet, he had always accused her of sacrificing the states economic interest to tit-for-tat politics. This certainly is no way to win back popular support either for himself or his party, the Communist Party of India (Marxist).        
	Actually, Mr Bhattacharjees offensive could well end up having a very different effect. Given the electoral defeats his party suffered in the last Lok Sabha polls, it could project him as a bad loser. Worse still, such a strategy could add to Ms Banerjees popularity. In a reversal of roles, she could be seen as an achiever and he as a spoiler. The chief ministers barb prompts a comparison with a similar miscalculation by the Bharatiya Janata Partys leader, Lal Krishna Advani. During the Lok Sabha poll campaign, Mr Advani described Manmohan Singh as a weak prime minister and hoped to gain by the scurrilous debate that the remark caused. The poll results proved how wrong Mr Advani had been. The two cases show how a bad loser can queer his own pitch. It may be too much to expect West Bengals politicians to sink their differences over how to improve the states economy. There will always be some election or the other to keep the partisan spirit alive and kicking. It is understandable that the CPI(M) would draw up fresh strategies to boost the sagging morale of its cadre in the run-up to the 2011 polls for the state assembly. But its leaders seem to be losing their way even more.

	Slain honour                  
	Sir  In a shocking incident of honour-killing in Singhwal, Ved Pal, who had refused to abide by a kangaroo courts diktat to divorce his wife, was beaten to death, and his body was displayed in public in the village square (Lynched for not divorcing, July 24). The local caste council in Singhwal had refused to accept Pals marriage since the bride and the groom were from different clans, but when Pal returned with a high court order in his favour, they brutally murdered him in front of a dozen policemen. There are many more instances across India of couples being killed by their families or other villagers, or being ostracized, for having dishonoured their clan by marrying against the norms imposed by the community.           
	It is strange that the Haryana government is doing nothing much to prevent the growing influence of the khap panchayats (caste councils) of Haryana which especially indulge in such acts. Time and again, the khap panchayats have attempted to violate an individuals basic rights and have passed edicts that infringe upon a persons freedom of choice. This time, they openly confronted the policemen deputed to protect Ved Pal and his wife, Sonia. Their actions make it absolutely clear that they have no regard for the laws of the land. This attitude should not be tolerated. By choosing to stay silent so far, the state government has already given the impression that the khap panchayats can get away with challenging the law with impunity. It is not surprising then that these caste councils have played freely with the lives of young couples. Apart from tormenting people who dare to marry outside their castes, these councils also make unreasonable demands of the weaker sections of society, particularly women.           
	The Haryana government cannot be a mute spectator to all this. It must deal firmly with these khap panchayats. Exemplary punishments should be meted out to them. Violence in the name of family and community honour indicates a barbaric mentality, which should be strongly condemned in a democratic, pluralistic and open society. If the government is to be blamed for inaction in this case, we, the people, are also guilty of indifference.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	State in trouble          
	Sir  Ashok Mitras article, Fire and foreboding (July 3), appropriately analyses the current predicament of the Communist Party of India (Marxist). The CPI(M)-led government has landed itself in trouble after committing a series of blunders over the period of its rule in West Bengal. The poor peoples government has neither done any justice to the people nor adhered to the communist philosophy. The entire course of its utter failure has been depicted by a single instance in Lalgarh, when a furious mob burnt down a newly built, dazzlingly white palatial building, standing in unabashed and isolated splendour in the midst of squalor and destitution all around. The fact that the building belonged to the CPI(M)s zonal secretary is not surprising. The party has always allowed its loyal cadre to exploit the assets of the State, with not just absolute immunity from the law and order machinery, but also with its active support.          
	The party largely neglected the welfare of the deprived sections, particularly the tribal people. The present imbroglio in the areas infested with Maoist insurgents, the Central government stepping in to bring certain areas of West Bengal under the purview of the Armed Forces Special Powers Act, the near-impossible task of establishing control over the disturbed regions, and the partys ignominious defeats in the Lok Sabha elections, all point to a single conclusion  it is time the once-invincible party gave up its seat of power. However, it is a pity that the people have to endure a period of murderous anarchy, as Mitra says, till the Left Front exits from the scene.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Asit Kumar Mitra, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Ashok Mitras phobia of the CPI(M) was glaringly evident in his article, Fire and foreboding. It is difficult to subscribe to his view that the CPI(M) itself is responsible for the predicament it is in. The party did fail to address the grievances of the tribal people that caused them to revolt. Even then, is it prudent to blame all that is happening in Lalgarh entirely on the CPI(M)s neglect of the underprivileged? Does the Union government have no responsibility to wake up to the issue and do its bit to improve the condition of the backward classes? The Left Fronts admission of its own lapses and its determination to cleanse itself are being deliberately overlooked. The Marxists in West Bengal are not for a total ban on the Maoists perhaps in acknowledgement of the genuine desire of the rebel group to change the condition of perpetual deprivation in which the tribals live. At the same time, they cannot allow the Maoists to engulf the state in protracted chaos. Tackling a crisis of this magnitude is tough. The state government has done nothing wrong in seeking Central assistance to check the havoc. Mitra cannot be oblivious to the Oppositions plan of instigating the Maoists to nail the Left. What is needed most now is a combined resistance to attempts to prematurely unsettle the elected government.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  I would like to point out the stark contrast between the two articles, Why do you cover your hair? and Safe within nine yards of cloth, both published on July 16. In the former article, the writer, Sahar Romani, defends the hijab, an article of clothing related to a particular religion. But in the latter, the writer, Adheesha Sarkar, quite unreasonably finds faults with the cultural practices associated with another religion. Sarkar bases her argument on the female figures of Khajuraho being dressed in kanchuli. But she has ignored the fact that the sculptures of Khajuraho are pieces of art and as such, they should not be mixed up with the way people dress in real life.                    
	Yours faithfully,

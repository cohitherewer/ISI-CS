                                                                                                                                                   WOMEN OF NO IMPORTANCE                                      
	What is it like to be a woman in West Bengal? The state government was proud of the human development report in 2004, which showed that the sex ratio was no longer below the national average: there are 933 women in West Bengal to 1,000 men. Yet West Bengal keeps popping up in every negative list. That is a good way of assessing what it is like to be a woman  or a girl  hereabouts.         
	In 2003, for example, the International Institute for Population Science found that the school dropout rate for girls between Classes I and XI was 86.14 per cent, second only to Bihar. This obviously leaves out the numerous women in their teens and twenties who have never been to school. Passing over the rates of early marriage and teenage pregnancy, or the unknown numbers of trafficked girls, we might look at how marriage treats West Bengals women. A study in 2006 shows that West Bengal is second only to Andhra Pradesh in the rate of domestic violence; there was an 80 per cent rise in such cases between 2001 and 2005.        
	Meanwhile, there has been a widening of the dowry net in the last 20 years. Segments of the population that did not have the custom, or did not perceive it in terms of cash and expensive gifts to the groom, have now acquired standardized patterns of dowry payment. A teacher or a government employee, a landowner or a driver, each has a different price. But a working woman does not have to be either paid for or looked after. Between 2001 and 2005, the rate of increase in dowry deaths in the state was 68 per cent; West Bengal was fourth in dowry death cases in the country.         
	Women are unimportant in West Bengal. Working women are not necessarily emancipated; their value as human beings does not seem to grow even if they excel in their spheres. Certainly, the spread of awareness and the increase of surveys, together with the media, have done much to expose how a woman lives and dies in West Bengal. But talking just about women gives an unfair impression of the governments indifference towards the delivery of services, such as the ensuring of food, education and healthcare, of drinking water, electricity and passable roads, for villages and for the poor. The state does not discriminate in its apathy and corruption: it merely perpetuates the neglect and oppression of women through its local institutions such as panchayats and police stations, through shalishi courts and local clubs. Inequality, unlawful decisions and customs are not the governments business. Hence it is only natural, going back to married women, that their body mass index is one of the lowest among comparable groups in the country, and that 62.7 per cent of them should suffer from anaemia, a rate the rest of India finds hard to match.        
	Dowry is only one cause of death. Women may be killed as witches, or because they are supposed to be barren. Institutional and social indifference to womens health causes more than 400 deaths per a lakh of deliveries, one of the highest rates of maternal mortality in India. This is a Unicef reading in 2008-9.         
	What is it like to be up against the attitude that all these figures imply? A recent incident may be illuminating. A 35-year-old woman in a South Dinajpur village committed suicide because she was pregnant. The headline said, Pregnant grandmother commits suicide. Both her daughters were married, and one had a one-year-old child. Her neighbours, mostly women, called her shameless and without character, apparently driving her to suicide by their derision. It is unlikely that Chobi Kayal decided to have a child: women here are not known for their control over the use of their bodies. Yet, as also in cases of rape, this was the womans shame, although she could not have stopped her husband if he wanted to try for a son. Her worth as a woman may have depended on that. A grandmother at 35 must have been married young, and got her daughters married early too. That she could not bear her neighbours taunts is just one indication of the fragility of the ground women cling to in West Bengal.                          BHASWATI CHAKRAVORTY

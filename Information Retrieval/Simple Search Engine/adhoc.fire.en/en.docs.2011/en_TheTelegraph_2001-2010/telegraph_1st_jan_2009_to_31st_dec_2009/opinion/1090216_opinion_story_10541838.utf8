	If the objective was to undermine peoples belief in god, then turning the atheist buses loose in Britain was largely a waste of time, because most British people dont believe in god anyway.        
	The atheist buses are all over London and some other big British cities by now, with a large ad running down the sides saying: There is probably no God. Now stop worrying and enjoy your life. But you have to ask if the sponsors of the ad, the British Humanist Society, felt strongly enough about it to spend 35,000 to put the signs on all those buses, why did they only say probably no God? Never mind all that. The real question is this: what did the British Humanist Society think it would achieve with its ad campaign? Its not as though non-believers in Britain were an oppressed minority. In fact, theyre not a minority at all. They are the majority, although you have to read the statistics carefully to realize that.         
	According to the 2001 census, only 7 million people in Britain said they had no religion, while 37 million said they were Christian; 1.5 million were Muslim, half a million were Hindu, 390,000 were Jedi Knights (there was a conspiracy among younger Britons to mock the process by claiming allegiance to the religion of Star Wars), 329,000 were Sikhs, and 260,000 were Jewish.        
	Those numbers suggest that Britain is an overwhelmingly Christian country, with under 20 per cent of the population non-believers. Yet, three-quarters of the people in Britain do not go to church even once a year. Something doesnt add up here.        
	When the International Social Survey Program conducted a more in-depth study of religious belief almost 20 years ago, it asked people if they agreed or disagreed with the statement, I know God exists and I have no doubts about it. In Britain, only 23.8 per cent said they agreed. Thats a normal number for Europe. In that ISSP poll, most European countries only registered between 20 and 30 per cent for confident belief in god, although Italy struggled up to 51 per cent, Ireland reached 58 per cent, and Poland got the prize with 66 per cent believers.              
	Believe in nothing        
	What is happening is that people in Britain and many other countries are answering the census question about religion in terms of their cultural heritage (which is, in most cases, Christian), not of their actual beliefs. It all depends on how you phrase the question, but the official figures are misleading. Actual levels of religious belief in Europe are very low.        
	Moreover, the collapse in belief is continuing, with the youngest least likely to identify with a religion. A poll commissioned by the British Library in 2007 found that nearly half of teenagers in Britain were atheists. This fits in better with what you actually observe from day to day in most European countries. People are no less moral than they ever were, but religion is simply absent in daily life in Europe, at least compared to the United States of America, where it seems omnipresent. Yet heres a strange thing: the very first place those bus ads came out in was the US.        
	The idea started in Britain, but the American Humanists moved faster. Their ads appeared on buses in Washington DC in November, saying, Why believe in a god? Just be good for goodness sake  and there was little public outcry. Maybe the US is not that different after all.        
	When the ISSP asked its much more rigorous question, only 66 per cent of Americans agreed with the statement, I know God exists and I have no doubts about it. That was almost 20 years ago, and its very likely that the level of belief has fallen since.        
	The US is not the same as Europe, but it is not invulnerable to the same trends. Which may be why President Obama, while rhyming off the roll-call of Americas religions in the time-honoured fashion in his election-night acceptance speech, for the first time added and non-believers.

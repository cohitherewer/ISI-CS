The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Imperfect sympathies
                                                                                                                 IMPERFECT SYMPATHIES                                                                  
	I cant take Buggerage seriously, wrote a middle-aged Virginia Woolf to her brother-in-law, Clive. One of the delights of reading her letters is following the twists and turns of her ambivalence towards the numerous homosexual men who made up her brothers Oxbridge set and later her own circle of friends and family. Often addressing intimate friends, like Lytton Strachey, who were homosexual themselves, and interspersed with accounts of her own Sapphic flights and plunges, these letters are pitiless, sharp and brilliantly entertaining. She is amused, for instance, by her husbands boredom at a party of forty young men waltzing with one another to the housemaids gramophone, while three lovely girls sat together flirting in corners: he was then set upon by Eddie Sackville West, who is as appealing as a kitten, a stray, a mangy, unloved kitten; and this poor boy, after pouring forth his woes (all men confide in Leonard  especially such as love their own sex) sat by mistake down on the best tea cups. Being an aristocrat out of his element, he was considerably discomposed. Sweets and jams stuck to his behind, and Leonard had to dust him, pat him, and finally leave him.        
	All kinds of distance separate us today, as much in the West as in the East, from this register of writing, from the eye that informs it, and from the liberties and assumptions it is founded on. A great deal of the play of imperfect sympathies in the distinct, yet shared, gazes of husband and wife (Eddie was the brother of the woman who would soon become Virginias lover) would be ironed out today by how we have learnt to accommodate alternative sexualities or difference in our social and private spaces and in language. The laws have changed (or are changing) and, with that, words, behaviour, attitudes and that elusive thing called identity, which has become so much easier to talk about and play with. And nobody in their right senses would feel wistful about the passing of the injustice and violence nurtured by sexual bigotry.        
	Yet, how uniformly nice and large and characterless our safe new words sound  alternative sexualities, difference, identity  compared to Woolfs Buggerage. This woman  herself of volatile sexuality and surrounded by sodomites and swingers  never thought twice before relishing her right to express a failure of empathy or sensitiveness, her right to be different from the different, or to be bored with the sameness of difference. Bugger and its cognates give her especial delight. My Seventies edition of the OED informs me that only as a legal term is it fit for decent use. Otherwise, it is low language, a course term of abuse and insult, whose etymology straddles xenophobia, homophobia and religious orthodoxy. The word goes back to, of all people, 11th-century Bulgarian heretics and their abominable practices. But among the boys, the word could also mean chap or fellow, as we would often use it in school.         
	When Virginia uses it, she is caricaturing the tone of being one of the boys, a camaraderie that is at once rugged and bleak. Bleak, because it is full of a kind of droll, hard-hearted, self-ironizing wisdom about how odd and solitary people usually end up in life. Observing E.M. Forsters progress, she writes, The middle age of buggers is not to be contemplated without horror. But her distance from the word narrows when she recalls a conversation with Forster about the difficulty of making new friends in ones middle years: One cannot follow up human relations any more he said. Theres Dante to read. Solitude  ones soul. He is half a monk. An elderly bugger is always something of a priest.

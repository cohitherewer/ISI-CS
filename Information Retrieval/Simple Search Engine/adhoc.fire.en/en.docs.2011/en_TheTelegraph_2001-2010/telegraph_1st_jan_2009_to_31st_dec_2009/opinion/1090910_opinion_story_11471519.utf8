	Even in the best of times, a debate on Kashmir is fraught with the risk of a serious difference in opinion. Contrary views are bound to emerge, and it is unlikely that the debate is going to be a cordial affair. It would therefore be better to concentrate on hard facts while dealing with the contentious Kashmir issue.         
	The first set of questions that needs to be addressed is this; why has there been a sudden spurt in violence on the streets of Srinagar and in the villages? That too after an election in which the voter turn-out had been as high as 60 per cent. Is there then a calculated method in this sudden surge of violence? Calculated or not, history shows that India and Pakistan will have to continue living with the Kashmir problem. Independence or self-rule are all good ideas, but can they really be worked out on the ground? Some Kashmiris seem to be suffering from a delusion of grandeur, and are being encouraged by those who stand to gain by the long-drawn bloodshed in India. Indian Kashmiri separatists should analyse Asif Ali Zardaris statement that The militants...were deliberately created and nurtured as a policy to achieve some short-term tactical objectives.         
	One is unlikely to be shocked by Zardaris statement, and will certainly agree with it up to a point. This is not a short-term tactical objective. On the contrary, it is a cold, calculated strategy, which was conceived after the arrival of the military rulers in Pakistan. The people of that country cooperated with the militarys design to maim India and amputate Kashmir through violence.        
	That Pakistan is sponsoring militancy in India has never been in doubt. The whole of India knows it. The Indian armed forces have been fighting it; the diplomats are also demanding the cessation of hostilities. But Kashmiris in the valley are being instigated to continue with the anti-India agitation. Pakistans desire to capture this Indian province continues to be the biggest stumbling block in normalizing relations between the two nations.                
	Unjust demand        
	Any self-respecting, sovereign nation will find this situation unacceptable. If Tibet or Xinjiang were to show even a fraction of the dissidence that is in evidence in Kashmir, Beijing would have come down hard on the dissidents. Today, Pakistan is in trouble because of the violence in Swat, Malakand, Upper Dir, South Waziristan and Baluchistan. So will Pakistan spare the terrorists there, or show mercy to the azaadi-seeking Baluchis?        
	The sloganeering, stone-pelting Kashmiri self-determinists should remember that no sovereign state, including India, will be able to accept or tolerate this situation in these times. When some Bengalis, inspired by the Naxalite ideology, challenged the sovereignty of India by waging war against the State in the 1970s, they were punished for threatening the nations unity.        
	Similarly, when some Sikhs followed a violent route to secession, they too were ruthlessly mowed down by the State. In fact, the Kashmiri separatists need to be reminded that breaking up the Indian nation is not an option, and that a dialogue cannot take place with a gun pointed at Indias head. The violent agitators must learn their lessons from China taking strong action in Tibet and in Xinjiang, Pakistan suppressing its own subjects in Baluchistan, Russia mobilizing its armed forces against Chechnya and the United States of America extending its sovereignty into Iraq and Afghanistan.        
	Today, Kashmir is in flames. Tomorrow it could be Kohima, then Punjab (again), thereafter Bengal. The list can go on, thereby making a mockery of the Indian nation and its garrison. The agitation for an azaad Kashmir must come to an end.

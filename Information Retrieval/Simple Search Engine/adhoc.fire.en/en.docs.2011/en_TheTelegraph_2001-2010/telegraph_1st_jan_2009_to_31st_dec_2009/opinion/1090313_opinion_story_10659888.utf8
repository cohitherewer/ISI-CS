                                                                                                                 SHORTEST ROUTE                                                    
	The lawyers long march, currently underway in Karachi, may prove to be the shortest route yet taken by Pakistan to political chaos. Left to itself, it is unlikely that the march would have turned out to be anything more than a mundane affair involving the men in black and white. It is President Asif Ali Zardaris miscalculation that has given the march its political colour and its dangerous abilities. For one, Mr Zardari was horribly wrong to assume that the denial of political legitimacy to his opponents, the Sharif brothers, through a supreme court verdict, and the usurpation of their political power in Punjab, would be enough to defang them. Mr Zardaris refusal to reinstate the former chief justice of the supreme court (despite relenting on the reappointment of 57 former judges) and his obvious pursuit of the Sharifs have not only enlarged the halo of martyrdom around Nawaz Sharif but have also enabled Mr Sharif to hijack the lawyers planned march to realize his own objective of snatching power from Mr Zardari. It was only after his disqualification and the fall of the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) government did Mr Sharif, hedging till then on his support for the long march, decide to throw in his weight behind the lawyers.         
	The other, more obvious, count on which Mr Zardari has erred is in imposing the draconian clampdown on the march by placing the top leaders under house arrest and outlawing all assembly in Punjab and Sindh. The spiralling effect of these measures may go beyond all calculations and bring down the Pakistan Peoples Party government in much the same way as the marches of the late Seventies had ended in unseating Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.         
	Apart from gifting Mr Sharif the political handle, Mr Zardaris impetuosity has granted another chance to the Pakistan army to reclaim its proprietory hold on the Pakistan polity. Its warning to Mr Zardari and the veiled threats of intervention are designed to convey to the people the idea that a mature leadership is keeping an eye over a haggling, inept civilian leadership. The alternative, it is implied, is always close at hand. For now, however, the army may not be interested in taking direct control, given the attention it has to pay to the battlefronts in the west and northwest. It could either cut Mr Zardari down to size or get him out of the way in order to have a more malleable Yousaf Raza Gilani in control. The messages, to that end, have already been sent and Mr Gilani, now in open revolt against Mr Zardari with his demand for the withdrawal of governors rule in Punjab, is believed to have joyously greeted them. The other option for the army is to follow the Bangladesh model and oversee the return of a democratically-elected, but pliant, prime minister. Mr Sharif, if he promises to behave this time, could well fit the bill.

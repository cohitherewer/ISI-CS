                                                                                                                 HOUSE PARTY                                                    
	It does not require any profound knowledge of dialectical materialism to arrive at the conclusion that a multiplex of factors was involved in the defeat suffered by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in the Lok Sabha polls in West Bengal. Thus, the division being created within the state unit of the party between local factors (like the policy of land acquisition, the violence in Nandigram, and so on) and national factors (the formation of the third front and the withdrawal of support from the United Progressive Alliance government) is largely an irrelevant one. The decisions to exit from the UPA and to form a third front may have been ill-timed and ill-advised, but if they had not converged with the grievances created by indifferent governance and poor party organization, the results may not have been so utterly disastrous. The strategic line to form a non-Congress and non-Bharatiya Janata Party formation had little basis in ideological principles because opposition to the BJP was justified on the grounds of combating communalism, the dismissal of the Congress had no strong ideological basis. This left the mastermind of the third front  no less than the general secretary of the party  in an ideological no mans land. This was grotesquely manifest in his seeking the support of parties that had yesterday been allies of the BJP, and of leaders tainted by the tar of corruption.        
	In the search to find a monocausal explanation of the debacle and in the attempt to fix the blame on an individual, the comrades are perhaps looking only at the symptoms rather than the disease that afflicts the party. The CPI(M), modelled on the party built by Vladimir Ilych Lenin, is one huge bureaucracy spreading from the local committees upwards to the politburo. This sprawling bureaucracy creates the veneer of collective decision-making and collective leadership. The two terms put within inverted commas in the previous sentence are nothing more than signs of the complete absence of accountability and transparency. As a result, the CPI(M)s defeat travels in the various party committees and bodies without an ownership tag. The chief minister of West Bengal, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, had the grace to own up to his responsibility; no such gesture has been forthcoming from the partys high command. Maybe the high command needs to be stormed and changed.

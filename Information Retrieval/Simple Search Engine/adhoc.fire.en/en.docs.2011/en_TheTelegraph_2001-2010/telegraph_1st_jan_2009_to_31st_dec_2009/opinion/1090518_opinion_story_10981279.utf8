The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | THE FLAG DROOPS
                                                                                                                 THE FLAG DROOPS                                                    
	An ineradicable line separates a defeat from a debacle. The latter, a stampede, is often the cause of a rout like the one that visited the Left Front in West Bengal during the elections to the 15th Lok Sabha. That the high noon of the Left was over in the state was evident to most observers even before the first ballot had been cast. A cloud began to hover over the Left Fronts prospects as soon as an understanding was forged between the Congress and the Trinamul Congress. Such an alliance was the necessary condition for the defeat of the Left since it meant that for the first time after many elections, the substantial anti-Left votes in West Bengal would all go into one basket. From the beginning, the comrades had to run against a political arithmetic that was against them.        
	To the irrefutable facts of statistics was added the ineffable chemistry of popular feelings. The policy of acquiring agricultural land for industry touched an emotional chord among the people of West Bengal. The government and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) failed to comprehend this disaffection, and dealt with it in the most ham-handed manner possible. The result was violence in Nandigram and a meaningless impasse in Singur. The Opposition, led by Mamata Banerjee, tapped into this pool of discontent. Arithmetic and chemistry came together. The Left, with its clichd slogans, could do precious little to prevent the brewing of this potent cocktail.        
	Defeat flew into the red fort on the air current from India. The communists, too eager to form a third front or too smug about their position in West Bengal, failed to notice a popular endorsement of the government of Manmohan Singh. They did not reckon with the Indian peoples yearning for stability. West Bengal could not and did not remain isolated from the feelings that moved the electorate in the rest of the country. The ascendancy of the Congress contributed to the fall of the Left in its own bastion. Retrospective wisdom almost suggests that the defeat of the Left was an event foretold. But nobody quite expected the lady to reduce the giant to a dwarf, to bring it down from dizzying heights to the harsh reality on the ground. The difference between 35 seats in the previous parliament and 15 in the present one is more than numerical. It is the measure of a political chasm. The red flag no longer flutters over West Bengal.

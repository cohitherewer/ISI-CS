	Indian cricketers are doing well but the same cannot be said about those who manage and administer cricket in India. The incompetence that is conventionally associated with most things in India has caught up with the Board of Control for Cricket in India. In Delhi, on Sunday, the one-day international between India and Sri Lanka had to be abandoned because the pitch was deemed to be too dangerous for the players. The match officials and the two captains decided to call off the match keeping in mind the safety of the players. Those who know cricket will admit that there is a vast difference between a lively wicket and a dangerous one. The former allows the ball to seam and spin and also for it to move quickly off the surface. Most batsmen who are technically well-equipped deal with such a pitch and bowlers enjoy bowling on them as it gives them a chance to beat the batsmen. A dangerous wicket is unpredictable; deliveries bounce and rear up even when bowlers do not intend them to behave in such a manner. Obviously, batsmen do not like such pitches; neither do bowlers, since they want to get the batsman out and not to injure him. The Ferozeshah Kotla wicket, it was felt by the experts, could cause serious injury.        
	It is clear that sufficient attention was not given to preparing the pitch. The BCCI cannot escape the responsibility for the mess even though the local association is actually responsible for preparing the wicket. The BCCI should have kept an eye on things. It has disbanded its ground and pitch committee after the incident. It should order an enquiry to find out how such a wicket was allowed to pass scrutiny. It needs to be pointed out that this incident comes close on the heels of the lights going out in Eden Gardens, Calcutta, on Christmas Eve. This caused the game to be stopped for an hour. Again, even though the BCCI was not responsible directly, it cannot avoid carrying the can. Both these incidents serve to put India in a very poor light in the cricketing world. This is ironic since there is no dearth of resources in the BCCI. What the incidents show is that the apex body for cricket in India  not to speak of the state-level associations  is run most unprofessionally. Those who are responsible for running the BCCI chase personal agenda. Unless this problem is addressed lights will go on the blink and pitches will prove to be dangerous.

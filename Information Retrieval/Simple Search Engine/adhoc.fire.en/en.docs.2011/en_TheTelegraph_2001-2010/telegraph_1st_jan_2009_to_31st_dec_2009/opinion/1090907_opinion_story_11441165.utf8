	A quarter-century after a million Ethiopians died in the great hunger of 1984-85, the country is heading into another famine. The spring rains failed entirely, and the summer rains were three weeks late. But why is famine stalking Ethiopia again?        
	The Ethiopian government is authoritarian, but it isnt incompetent. It gives fertilizer to farmers and teaches best practices. By the late 1990s, Ethiopia was self-sufficient in food in good years, and the government had created a strategic food reserve for the bad years.        
	At present, infant deaths are already over two per 10,000 per day in Somali, the worst-hit region of Ethiopia. (Four per day counts as full-scale famine.) Country-wide, 20 per cent of the population already depends on the dwindling flow of foreign food aid, and it will get worse for many months yet. So what have the Ethiopians done wrong?        
	The real answer is that they have had too many babies. Ethiopias population at the time of the last famine was 40 million. Twenty-five years later, it is 80 million. You can do everything else right  give your farmers new tools and skills, fight erosion, create food reserves  but if you dont control the population, you are just spitting into the wind.        
	Even if the coming famine in Ethiopia kills a million people, the population will keep growing. So the next famine, 10-15 years from now, will hit a country of a 100 million people trying to make a living from farming on land where only 40 million faced starvation in the 1980s. The whole question of population, instead of being central to the debate about development, food and climate change, has been put on ice. The reason, I think, is that the rich countries are secretly embarrassed, and the poor countries deeply resentful.        
	Suppose Ethiopia had been the first country to industrialize. Suppose some mechanical genius in Tigray invented the worlds first steam engine in 1710. The first railways were spreading across the country by the 1830s, and, at the same time, Ethiopian entrepreneurs and imperialists spread all over Africa. By the end of the 19th century, they controlled half of Europe too.                
	Baby boom        
	Never mind the improbabilities. The point is that an Ethiopia with such a history would easily be rich enough to support 80 million people now. If it could not grow enough food for them all, it would just import it like Britain (where the Industrial Revolution actually started) imports food. Money makes everything easy.        
	The problem is well understood. The population of the rich countries has grown about tenfold since the earliest days of the Industrial Revolution, but for the first half of that period it grew quite slowly. Many babies died, and there were no cures for most epidemic diseases. Later, the death rate dropped, but by then, with people feeling more secure in their lives, the birth rate was dropping too. Whereas in most poor countries, the population hardly grew at all until the start of the 20th century. But once the population did start to grow, thanks to basic public health measures that cut the death rate, it grew faster than it ever did in the rich countries.         
	Sadly, economies dont grow that fast; so these countries never achieved the level of comfort and security where most people will start to reduce their family size spontaneously. At its current rate of growth, Ethiopias population will double again in just 32 years.        
	Youre thinking: that will never happen. Famine will become normal in Ethiopia well before that. No combination of wise domestic policies and no amount of foreign aid can stop it. And you are right.         
	History is unfair. Conversations between those who got lucky and those left holding the other end of the stick are awkward. But we cannot go on ignoring the elephant in the room. We have to start talking about population again.

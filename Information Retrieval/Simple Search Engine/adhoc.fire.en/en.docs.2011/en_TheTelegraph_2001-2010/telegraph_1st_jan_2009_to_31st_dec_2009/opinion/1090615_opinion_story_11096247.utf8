                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Heated debate                  
	Sir  It must be incredibly nave for anyone (in this instance, the home secretary, West Bengal) to expect that air conditioner owners in Calcutta will voluntarily turn off their ACs to conserve power (Love thy neighbour and turn off the AC..., June 10), and that too when it is the failure of the Calcutta Electric Supply Corporation to supply uninterrupted power, which is their job.           
	Discipline, self-control and civic sense are hardly the hallmarks of Calcuttans. People who own AC cars roll down the window to throw out empty snack packets onto the street. There have been recent reports of residents, during power cuts at night, sleeping in their cars with the AC on. It seems that in some apartment blocks without separate electricity meters, those not using ACs have to pay for the extra consumption of AC owners as the total bill for the building is averaged out. Moreover, it would be interesting to know whether all AC owners have taken proper clearance from the CESC for extra load. Can one really expect such people to turn off their ACs in the larger interest of power conservation? Yet the governor, not so long ago, ordered periodic shutdowns of electricity in the Raj Bhavan for conservation and also to share the suffering of others.          
	Having said that, it is surprising that despite buying power from the West Bengal State Electricity Transmission Company Limited, the Northwest Territories Power Corporation and two other sources, the CESC has been unable to bridge the shortfall. The CESCs failures, while not new, have now taken on legendary proportions. The more it fails, the better it gets at giving excuses. The phrase, demand-supply mismatch, is a pompous attempt to appear credible by giving a technical twist to the obvious: that they are unable to cope.           
	As for sheer wastage, street lights blaze during the afternoon in the city. No doubt there are excuses for this as well.          
	It is high time the government invited other companies in the power sector  Indian or foreign  to set up generation units. The CESCs monopoly needs to be dismantled for the public good. Just as in the case of State-owned telephone services, competition would make the CESC scurry around trying to dissuade their customers from changing over to other companies, in addition to bettering their own performance.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  I wonder if the Central government is daydreaming of seven to nine per cent growth while most of the states have at least four to six hours of power cuts every day. Industrial growth will be far slower if the power situation remains poor.           
	Power production must be at least 10 to 20 per cent ahead of the requirement to take care of sudden rises in demand and to avoid outages. Power cuts cause acute water shortages too, and this affects hospitals and schools as well as households. So some states prioritize power supply to schools and hospitals over commercial establishments.          
	Nowadays ACs are no longer a luxury. They are necessary, both for the productivity of employees as well as for the maintenance of computers and other machines. The home secretary, Ardhendu Sen, requests citizens not to use ACs after 6 pm. Would he like to inspect how many VIPs practise this? The demand for power lessens in winter, during which time maintenance and overhauling may be done.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

                
	Quite a plateful          
	Sir  I would like to point out that what Suresh Chandra Bhattacharya said about many valuable plates [being] smuggled away to be sold abroad from the Asiatic Society was misconceived (Lock away the plates, May 31; Cash flows into culture corners , June 11). In 1977 or thereabouts, only one copperplate, the Sahagura inscription, disappeared from the Asiatic Society. This was immediately reported to the local police, the Central Bureau of Investigation, and the Interpol. But their intensive efforts were not successful. Although I was not a member of the council of the Asiatic Society at that time, I came to know that the ministry of culture and the then authorities of the Society did not pursue the matter further. None of the present members of the council was there from 1977 to 1978.           
	The Asiatic Society adopted every possible measure to help Bhattacharya see and read a particular copperplate inscription in the strongroom where it is carefully preserved in a cabinet in the museum of the Society.          
	On June 9 and 10, the other officials of the Asiatic Society and I minutely verified the copperplates. I did not find any copperplate recorded in our register to be missing or pilfered, except the Sahagura inscription already mentioned. With the help of an expert photographer, every copperplate has now been digitally photographed. Henceforth, the enlarged photographs of the inscriptions can be used by scholars.          
	Yours faithfully,        Ramakanta Chakrabarty,
  General Secretary, The Asiatic Society, Calcutta

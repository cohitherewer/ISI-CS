	A long goodbye                  
	Sir  General Stanley McChrystal is right in saying that his troops have no silver bullets to defeat the Taliban. There are no short cuts for Americas exit from Afghanistan. Years of conflict have made the country worse. The presence of foreign troops has not helped the local population. American troops should help Afghans fight corruption and develop infrastructure and education. This will improve the standards of living and reduce terrorist activities in the country.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Mohammed Sadullah Khan, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia 

      
	Difficult questions          
	Sir  Umme Kulsum, a student of Aligarh Muslim University, asked Rahul Gandhi whether a Muslim can become the prime minister of India (Aligarh girl has more questions, Dec 10). Gandhi rightly replied that the competence of a person, and not his religion or community, is the criterion in this case. In fact, India has had illustrious Muslim leaders. People like Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed, Zakir Hussain and A.P.J. Abdul Kalam became presidents because they had the requisite potential.          
	However, it is a matter of concern that divisive, communal politics has invaded the minds of a section of society. Politicians often use religion to influence people for petty gains. It is important to draw the line between religion and politics. Otherwise, the future of the nation will be severely affected by communalism.          
	Yours faithfully,       
S. Ramachandran, Ooty

                
	Sir  Rahul Gandhi should be congratulated for saying that anyone with the suitable qualities can become prime minister, irrespective of his religion. Some people tend to put caste and religion before nationality. India has had Muslim presidents, bureaucrats and ministers, who have made the country proud. Indian classical music owes much to Islamic culture, and we have had cricketers like Mohammad Azharuddin. These people succeeded by hard work and were not pulled down because of their Muslim identity.          
	Yours faithfully,       
D. Chatterjee, Calcutta 

      
	Sir  It does not matter whether the prime minister of India is Muslim, Hindu, Sikh or Christian. The ability to serve the country and its people should be the most important factor behind choosing the prime minister. India is a democratic country, and the Constitution does not restrict a Muslim from becoming the prime minister. Rahul Gandhi has rightly said that the merits and achievements of the candidate, and not his religion, will decide whether the person is fit for the prime ministers office.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Any secular citizen of India could become the prime minister of the country. The prime minister does not even need to have faith in a particular religion as long as the people have faith in him.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  I use a Metro Railway smart card. A major problem with this service is that if the full amount on the card is not used within the time limit, the balance cannot be carried forward. This system should be changed to let customers benefit more from smart cards.          
	Yours faithfully,

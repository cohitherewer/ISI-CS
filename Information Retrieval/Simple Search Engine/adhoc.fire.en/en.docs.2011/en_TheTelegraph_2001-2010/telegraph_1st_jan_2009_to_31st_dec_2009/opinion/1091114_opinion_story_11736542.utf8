The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | For a new world order 
                                                                            Saturday , November 14 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                              FOR A NEW WORLD ORDER                               Ananda Lal      THEATARE                                                
	Aaranjan (Delhi) and Indian Peoples Theatre Association (Mumbai) placed before Hindi audiences in Calcutta the grasping tentacles of the new world order and globalization respectively, the blame falling squarely on America. Since theatre in this city remains predominantly socialist, we have a surfeit of such plays. So neither the agenda nor the target was unfamiliar, but the specific subjects covered were novel.        
	For Aaranjans Baghdad Burning (picture), scriptwriter Supriya Shukla dramatized an Iraqi womans popular blog during the American bombardment in 2003, describing the utter devastation wreaked by the bombs, the suffering of innocent persons, the collapse of civic facilities and their replacement by a reign of repression. We do not doubt the culpability of American expansionism, nor the veracity of the eyewitness account; the destruction of Baghdad, even relics of ancient civilizations in collateral damage, was a heinous crime. Yet niggling questions about authorial bias persist. Can we possibly accept that Saddam Hussein did no wrong, that he did not terrorize minorities? Only one line tentatively raises this issue: Saddam was no saint. That is just not enough, and we tend to see Riverbend, the blogger, as a patriot, but partisan. For objectivitys sake, Shukla should have consulted other voices too.        
	Kirti Jain directs in her usual style  the cast performing multiple roles, no sets, benches and chairs sufficing for everything. Individual scenes stand out, such as kids playing games of counting explosions, guessing where they hit, and identifying warplanes zooming overhead, or a crazed mother (powerfully acted by Nutan Surya) showing passers-by the impressions left on a wall when a blast vapourized her familys bodies. And an ominous warning rings out as fundamentalist mullahs take over, imposing restrictions on women that this can happen nearer home.        
	IPTAs Girija ke Sapne is a musical comedy by B. Suresh, translated by Shailaja, that begins by satirizing the pernicious influence of film and television on common people. The affected heroine in a Karnataka village wants a dream husband with screen panache, but gets a simple peasant. Abruptly, the play changes tack and ends up criticizing the buying and planting of imported seeds by farmers, who eventually lose their harvests and lives savings. For incomprehensible reasons, mythical birds like Jatayu and Garuda cackle and flap their wings into this plot, the former representing greedy globalizers, of all things. The farcical depiction of conforming to media images is justifiable, but to treat serious problems such as crop failures and farmer suicides facetiously seems cheap. We expected maturer stuff from a senior director of the stature of M.S. Sathyu. I wonder if he ever staged this production for villagers and, if so, how they reacted.

	He was arrested more than three decades ago, when he was in his mid-forties, for having sex with a 13-year-old girl, possibly after drugging her. He pleaded guilty and then fled the law to another country. Since then, he has been a fugitive from one countrys laws, and was arrested again a few days ago in a third country under an international warrant. The matter would have ended there, and with the sense of a just ending. But it has not, for the man, before his offence and throughout his fugitive decades, has made several outstanding films. To many, he is one of the great filmmakers, and most of his peers  directors, producers, actors  are outraged that an artist of such calibre and seniority should be arrested in a country where he came to collect a lifetime achievement award.        
	Roman Polanskis recent arrest in Switzerland has had a deeply divided response. His most memorable films  Knife in the Water, Rosemarys Baby, Macbeth  play dark and compelling havoc with conventional moral responses to sexuality, violence, unreason and evil. Those who have been affected by these films over the years, or have been involved in their making, are either unequivocally against his arrest or find it difficult to take up absolute positions for or against it. But most popular polls are on the side of his not being above the law and want to see him in prison. And the president of France  of which Polanski is a citizen and whose extradition agreements with America had protected him from arrest  has now ordered his government to drop its support for Polanski. Clearly, even with something as universally condemned as the rape of a minor, the judgments become far from absolute and unanimous when the offence has been committed by an artist of Polanskis stature. If Polanski had been a businessman or politician, would the question of his arrest been an equally open one? So why is art allowed to weave a magic circle around itself, within which there are no simple answers to questions that shoot off in different, irreconcilable directions towards the moral, the legal and the aesthetic? A few days after Polanski was arrested in Switzerland, Scotland Yard prevented the Tate Modern in London from showing a nude photograph of 10-year-old Brooke Shields as part of its exhibition of Pop Art. No society that fails to protect the vulnerability of children deserves to call itself civilized. But a society that does not allow conflicting opinions and public debate on censorship of the kind faced by the Tate also forfeits the right to call itself civilized.         
	So, why are art and artists let off the worst crimes in the name of civilization? Is it that the best of them exercise a strange sort of power over human beings that goes straight to the deep hearts core, with its wealth of darkness that jails and lawcourts try in vain to regulate, dissipate or contain? This is danger and damage of quite another kind from what policemen are armed to tackle. No wonder that the opium-sodden poets two words of advice against his kind were Beware! Beware!

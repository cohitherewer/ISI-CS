                                                                                                                 FEASTING ON                                                    
	Civilized cities take pride in their well-preserved greens. But the Maidan in Calcutta has come to embody quite another sort of pride  one that is difficult to reconcile with most kinds of civilization. It seems ludicrous to invoke something as quaint as concern for the environment in a city where respect for the law and a basic civic sense have been sacrificed to what is repeatedly celebrated by the citys keepers as the will of the people. Once again, at a massive rally called by the Left Front to inaugurate its Lok Sabha poll campaign, the Brigade Parade Grounds have been vandalized by the party cadre brazenly flouting preservation guidelines set down by the Calcutta high court. The bans on cooking and parking on the Maidan have been triumphantly disobeyed, with the grounds dug into, the grass burnt or littered with the cadres cooking arrangements and several hundreds of vehicles parked on it. There were feeble, token attempts on the part of the police to rein in the carnival and implement the court orders. Some party men went around trying to dissuade a few clusters of people from cooking in the open, but to little avail, since a systematic attempt has never been made by the party to mediate the high court rulings to the people who are brought over from the districts for the rallies.        
	But cooking on the greens (or inside parked buses, one of which caught fire) was only a small part of the disruptions caused by this rally all over the city on Sunday. Thousands of government and private buses and other vehicles had been taken over by the party, depriving ordinary citizens of their usual means of transport and freezing the flow of traffic at crucial points in the city throughout the day. For most of the day, it had become almost impossible to go about the daily business of civic life. None of this is new in Calcutta. But the cumulative effect of such repeated bouts of lawlessness, orchestrated or endorsed by the government and carried out on an increasingly grand scale, is bound to drag down the city, and the legal system trying to hold it together, towards a chaos and anarchy that could well become a permanent condition. With the judiciary rendered ineffectual, and the police entirely identified with the Left Fronts political interests, there seems little hope for the ordinary Calcuttan to be delivered from this failure of civilization.

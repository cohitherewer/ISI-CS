                                                                                                                 RAW DEAL                                                    
	It is not enough for the Congress to cry foul over the deal its partners in Bihar have so unceremoniously handed it. Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan did not even care to consult the Congress in striking the seat-sharing arrangement. That the Congress was left with just three seats  one less than in the 2004 polls  is only a small part of the affront. The larger issue at stake is the regional parties increasingly aggressive assertion of their own power and their dismissive attitude towards the national parties. For the regional parties, the logic behind their action is simple. They matter in national politics only on the strength of their power in the states. Hence, they must try to get as many of the seats as possible in their spheres of influence. With democracy and identity politics increasingly becoming inseparable, regional parties have come to represent peoples aspirations much more than the national parties. In electoral terms, this translates into what is loosely called vote-bank politics. The regional parties positions on alliances, either with the Congress or with the Bharatiya Janata Party, show a new trend  the national parties must bend backwards to win regional friends. Whether it is Mamata Banerjee in West Bengal, Naveen Patnaik in Orissa or Mr Prasad in Bihar, the national parties are at the mercy of the regional satraps.        
	On the face of it, the Congress has few options in dealing with the challenge in Bihar. It can ask Mr Prasad for a review of the deal and claim a victory of sorts if it manages to get one more seat; or it can completely reject the deal and put up its candidates in as many seats as it can. But that would mean an end to the United Progressive Alliance in Bihar. The problem with the second option is that it does not really improve the Congresss prospects in Bihar. A fragmented UPA will also make things easier for the ruling BJP-Janata Dal (United) alliance. Even more important, the Congress cannot afford to break away completely from Messrs Prasad and Paswan, and thereby push them into the nascent third front. Sooner or later, though, the Congress has to take a call on a new strategy for dealing with regional parties. But to do so, the party has to find a new way to represent regional aspirations. One way of doing this is to change the way the party now functions  a central authority, which is often a coterie, lording it over the state units. Party power must flow from below, and not the other way round.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | The land that time forgot
                                                                                                                 THE LAND THAT TIME FORGOT                                  OLD ORDER      A tale of change denied in Gods own country                                                        
	Conversation in the remittance economy is an invitation to voice a hundred insecurities, real and imagined. For a society that once served up Carlos Castaneda in local magazines, its actual behaviour has been scripted by a refusal to embrace insecurity, and dread it instead. De-risking is done by accumulating wealth or submitting to God and to political parties. The option of being free is discounted for ones weightlessness in society.         
	December 30 was an accidental confluence of ghosts from the past. The annual school youth festival, organized by the Kerala government, is one of the biggest youth festivals in Asia, and Thiruvananthapuram was hosting its 49th edition. The second rally of the day, following the one by children, was by the Nair Service Society to press for reservation. For me, a non-resident Malayalee home on holiday, the two rallies reflected Keralas treadmill evolution.        
	The Nairs are a warrior class. The rally had an impressive man walking ahead with the partys flag. Thousands had turned up to support the party but a majority of those walking had already retired or was close to retirement. There were scattered groups of youth under the careful scrutiny of the elderly cadre. There was also an impressive turnout of women, but they appeared submissive and lacked a voice of their own. Despite the outwardly progressive claims, this is a common trait in Keralas communities, which are mostly dominated by old men and resemble a feudal order.         
	The first thing that struck me about the childrens rally was the absence of joy. They laboured on dressed as angels, butterflies, Mahatma Gandhi, farmers, classical dancers and flower girls, perhaps thinking it was all a dreary routine. People stood watching the rally as they would a staid procession.         
	Nearly 30 years ago, I had walked down the same road, doing the same mindless things. It had been passed down to the next generation with no questions raised. A few things disturbed. First, everything seemed to originate in the community vertical. I also saw children dressed as brides and bridegrooms. Glorifying the image as an ideal in a world that sees marriage as a matter of choice betrayed a past that was eager to shape the future.         
	Somehow I can imagine a December 30 rally, years from now, with these children as assertive men and submissive women, nodding in approval towards another generation training to merit unquestioned acceptance.

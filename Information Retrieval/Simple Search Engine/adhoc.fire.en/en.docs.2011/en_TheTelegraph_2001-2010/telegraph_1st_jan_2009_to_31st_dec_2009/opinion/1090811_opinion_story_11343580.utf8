                                                                                                                 FIRST STEPS                                                    
	Indian politicians are known for destroying, rather than rebuilding, systems and institutions. For a long time, Bihar was the worst example of this. The Nobel laureate, Amartya Sen, is not the first to point out that things have changed in that state. But his certificate to that effect is certainly the most precious one that the chief minister, Nitish Kumar, has received so far. Mr Sen did not elaborate on what exactly has changed in Bihar and how. But it is generally agreed that the big change is Mr Kumars sincerity in restoring the administration, which had collapsed during earlier regimes. The small steps he has taken seem to have restored the peoples confidence in the rule of law. If caste riots and murders or kidnappings for ransom are no longer daily occurrences, it is not because caste has ceased to matter in Bihar or politics is now free from crime. The improvements in law and order that Mr Kumar has been able to achieve are due to his governments simple strategies. In essence, these mean that the police and the bureaucracy are allowed to work in accordance with the law and not made to perpetually look the other way or, worse still, aid politicians and their criminal associates.         
	Bihars hope of a return from the brink has a message for other states. It is that real changes come, not from high-sounding policies, but from a political will to let the system work. Both Mr Kumar and his predecessor, Lalu Prasad, were once in the same socialist camp. Mr Prasads long reign reverberated with loud calls for social justice, while the state slowly plunged into an abyss of criminality, corruption and administrative collapse. Mr Kumars Bihar has a long way to go. No one would know that better than Mr Sen, for whom social progress means better opportunities for school education, healthcare, gender equality and freedom from hunger. But all these would be beyond the reach of the majority of the people if there is no rule of law. What Mr Kumar has achieved is still rather tentative and may prove elusive. The recent incident in Patna, in which a woman was molested by a crowd in a public place, shows how much more things have to change in Bihar. The state remains one of the poorest in India, and poverty is always a threat to peace and stability. If Bihars law and order is better than what it has been for a long time, Mr Kumar should use the opportunity to tackle bigger issues.

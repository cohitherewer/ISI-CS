                                                                                                                 ZERO TOLERANCE                                                    
	Things have indeed come to a fine pass when the highest court of the country is compelled to pass a verdict on ragging. The Supreme Court has directed all state governments to constitute committees to look into incidents of ragging and to check the menace. This is a laudable first step, but it raises a number of issues. It is obvious that the apex court has had to speak on the matter because the actual people who should be responsible to eradicate ragging have failed to do so and have in fact dragged their feet on eliminating this feature that exists in some educational institutions. It is pathetic that state governments have to be instructed by the Supreme Court to look into the situation. Actually, ragging can be eliminated by authorities who run the various educational institutions. They should make it clear to all the students that anyone involved in perpetrating ragging that leads to physical abuse will be summarily expelled from the concerned school or college. This may sound excessive but for any punitive measure to be effective, it must be exemplary and serve as deterrence. Once it becomes common knowledge that authorities will pursue a policy of zero tolerance so far ragging is concerned, students will become careful about how they treat freshers.        
	Ragging originally was an innocent rite of passage imposed by seniors on those who were new to the institution. It was also a form of male bonding. The fall from innocence was quick to come. Ragging turned from fun to being physical and abusive. There were many instances when instead of bonding the result was actually traumatic. Sociologists and behavioural scientists will explain one day how and why this transformation took place. What is clear is that the time for passively watching this transformation is over. Stern and strict action needs to be taken before ragging results in more deaths and in more traumatized lives. If punitive measures lead to a lessening of fun between seniors and new-comers in the campuses, this will have to be accepted. Physical violence in the name of fun cannot be tolerated. Those who run educational institutions, especially residential ones, will have to be more aware about the kinds of ragging, and be firm on those who perpetrate physical and even mental torture and abuse. It is precisely because ragging is still an exception rather than the rule in educational institutions that it needs to be completely nipped in the bud.

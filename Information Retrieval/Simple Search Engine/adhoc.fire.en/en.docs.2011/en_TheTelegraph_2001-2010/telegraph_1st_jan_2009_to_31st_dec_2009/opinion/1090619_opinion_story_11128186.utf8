                                                                                                                 A LAND ON FIRE                                  BONA FIDE - Malvika Singh                              
	Iran is exploding, seething with anger as the sharp divide between the conservatives and those looking for freedom of thought, speech and action in a world that needs compassion and dialogue as well as an appreciation of the views of the other increases, and the latter try to find an indigenous democracy that can influence and rule their lives. Live and let live but give us the basic dignities of life and living  this seems to be the call of different cultures and of diverse peoples across the globe. In West Bengal too, another kind of bloody and treacherous implosion has taken place. It gives us  who watch from afar  the sense that decades of failed governance, which put the lid on the expressions of dissatisfaction by the poor and the dependant, have finally caused ordinary people to lose patience. The anger of citizens seems to stem from their abhorrence of dictatorial regimes attempting to control the inherent plurality of humankind.        
	All these eruptions go to prove that humanity in all its many avatars want liberty, fraternity and therefore, democracy to dictate their lives and societies. That is the fundamental belief, often battered by the militant, polarized positions taken up by leaders attempting to grab power by generating fear in the minds of citizens, promising civil society by claiming to destroy elites in favour of the masses. Unfortunately, the mass is exploited by all such rulers  who quickly clone elitist postures and positions, adopt dictatorial personas without the discipline required for good, clean governance  even more ruthlessly. There is no real difference between the erstwhile potentates and the elected fundamentalist, nationalist leaders of today, be they the religious saviours or the radical Left masters of the proletariat! They have all failed to govern inclusively.                
	Blind eye        
	The lack of good governance in India over the last decades has led to many uprisings and militant social movements that have disrupted peace. Governments have been in complete denial about this reality. Bureaucracies have aggravated social degradation by their inept administration and sheer neglect of areas that needed, and continue to need attention and action. When the poor are not heard and relegated to the backyard, they try out all means to reach out to those who are in command and who should be accountable for failure and success, and when there is no response at all, they turn to any form of militancy that will help their voices to be heard. By that time, it is usually too late and situations run out of control. Governments then choose to use a heavy hand to quell the angry protests and invariably make a complete mess of the problem.        
	A large tract of India and the sub-continent is experiencing this rather frightening upheaval. For movements of this nature, defined borders cease to be the lines of control. The monitoring and policing authorities find a space within which such lawless activity is rampant, and make lucrative gains by turning a blind eye to it. The nexus of such nefarious activities, has more often than not, as its pivot a solid partner in the administration who protects the illegal by not enforcing the laws of the land. This is real corruption of the system and till it is addressed and exposed, India will continue to be on the boil.        
	A ten per cent rate of growth is all very well but will do no good in a social and economic structure that is exploding because of failed governance. Laws have to be rewritten. Babus have to be made accountable. The poor must be given the basic dignities of living within the confines of a democratic framework that allows them their creativity of thought, skill and action. Para-military forces and central help cannot correct the failures. It has to change from bottom upwards. The trickle down effect is not an adequate balm.

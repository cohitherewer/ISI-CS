	Politicians are not bonded labour. They can choose the recipient of their services. Kalyan Singh sought to make this point clearer with his second exit from the Bharatiya Janata Party, which he had quit in 1999 and rejoined in 2004. Politicians like Mr Singh who have a substantial following and provide no bonded labour can, naturally, also demand fair remuneration. As the other backward classes leader who brought the BJP a major victory in Uttar Pradesh in 1991 and facilitated the Babri Masjid demolition programme by remaining a silent spectator in the chief ministerial chair, the demand was expected. But past burdens are proving to be so insurmountable for the BJP of late that the party seems to be having a lot of trouble living up to expectations. Mr Singhs wishes to promote his sons political career had apparently got caught up in this loop. The party may have only recently allowed Maneka Gandhi to vacate her long-held Pilibhit constituency for her son for the coming elections and settle for Aonla in UP in order to recreate a family fief on the lines of Rae Bareli-Amethi. But in Mr Singhs case, it found reason to not only disregard his overtures with regard to his son, but also to go ahead with dishonouring his objections to the anointed candidate for the Bulandshahr seat. Mr Singh has promptly found in the Samajwadi Party the provider of the much-needed balm. His son is now a national general- secretary of that party and Mr Singh has chosen it to bestow his services on as an independent candidate during the election campaign.        
	The BJP, like the Congress, has no problems with the promotion of family ties so long as its political objective is met. It had no qualms about its ally, the Shiromani Akali Dal, anointing the son of the Punjab chief minister, Parkash Singh Badal, as the deputy chief minister. The furtherance of familial connections is now such an accepted reality in Indian politics that Margaret Alva, a veteran member of the Congress, found it as unacceptable as Mr Singh that her sons political career should be unfairly stalled while that of the other children promoted. But, in a democracy, it is the peoples interests that leaders like Ms Alva and Mr Singh are supposed to promote, not their own. Will that ever be reflected in the concerns of the vast family preserve that politicians are building up by their combined labour?

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | right not to choose
                                                                                                                 RIGHT NOT TO CHOOSE                                                          
	Political leaders take it upon themselves to give gratuitous advice about ways to reform the political system. Their claim to the right to offer such advice is that they participate in the system and hence they know it. The claim is based on the fallacious logic that proximity is a necessary aid to knowledge. Thus when L.K.Advani, prime minister-in-waiting, veteran parliamentarian and leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party, declares that voting in elections should be made compulsory, he believes that he can say this based on his long experience in politics. It is possible to argue that any advice regarding the reform of the political system should come from those who are well-versed in political theory and not necessarily from those who know only political practice. Mr Advani may be a well-read man, but even his acolytes will not assert that political theory is his strong suit.        
	At the heart of democracy is the idea of freedom to choose. This idea by definition involves the freedom not to choose. It involves, moreover, the freedom not to be part of the democratic process, and even in extremis not to believe in democracy. Thus in the practice of democracy in India  as laid down by the founding fathers of the Constitution  an Indian citizen can decide not to vote. The decision not to vote can be based on any number of reasons, from the politically profound to the frivolous  from scepticism about democracy or indifference towards the existing political parties or candidates to a refusal to brave the weather. To vote or not to vote is an individuals choice. It has been argued that in India the electronic voting machines should have a button that provides the option, none of the above. Those who stay away from election booths because of their indifference to, or even loathing for, the existing parties or candidates could actually then press such a button to register their disapproval. In the days of the paper ballot, many people did this by spoiling their votes. Democracy means the right not to choose. Democracy even allows space to be non-democratic so long as such sentiments do not harm other people or hinder the exercise of other peoples democratic rights. By saying that voting in elections should be made compulsory, Mr Advani is assailing a freedom that is embedded in democracy.        
	Mr Advani may also not be aware of the precedent he is trying to establish. Following him, some other politician with only a fraction of Mr Advanis wisdom will assert that it should be obligatory on the part of citizens to listen to speeches by politicians and to attend political rallies. In a democracy, the political choices of the citizens should be mediated only by their conscience. Politicians have a right to articulate their views but this should not be at the expense of reducing the peoples right to choose or not to choose.

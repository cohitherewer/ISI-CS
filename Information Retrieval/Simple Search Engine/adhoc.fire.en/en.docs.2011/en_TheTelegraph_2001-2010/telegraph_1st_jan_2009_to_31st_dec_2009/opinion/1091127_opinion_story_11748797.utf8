	The Glass Room 
  By Simon Mawer, Little, Brown, Rs 550        
	Books about buildings seem to be the flavour of the season. If the Booker-shortlisted The Little Stranger by Sarah Waters was about the ancient Hundreds Hall in Warwickshire, Simon Mawers The Glass Room, in the same list, is about that epitome of Modernist architecture, the Landauer House. Although the stage of Mawers novel is crowded with characters, The Glass Room is less about human beings than about the house. In Czechoslovakia, where the novel is set, regimes change and peoples lives are transformed beyond recognition. But every alteration, whether at the personal or the political level, gains a stability by being anchored to the Landauer House.         
	Mawer is evidently in love with the house of his creation. It is built for the rich Landauers by Rainer von Abt, who swears by the De Stijl artists, and is fired by Adolf Looss manifesto, Ornament and Crime (1908). Von Abt gifts the newly married Viktor and Liesel Landauer a unique living space, which celebrates the openness of modern living rather than the secretive and stultified life of the previous century, to begin their new life in. When finished, the house, with its white ceiling and floors and its huge windows, exemplifies form without ornament, and its still centre, the Glass Room, marks the apotheosis of rationality.         
	Lines from Bretons Nadja about the experience of living in a glass house that Viktor reads out during the house-warming party, together with von Abts declamations on the novelty of his beliefs, would have left readers in no doubt about the Glass Rooms import. But Mawer, it seems, cannot rest assured, and has to keep repeating the virtues of the Landauer House at regular intervals. It is ironic that the book, which strives, as an artwork, to replicate the architectural qualities of the house, should yet be so full of the excesses that Mawers von Abt seems to despise.         
	The perfection of the Viktor-Liesel relationship makes it obvious that the glass house of their marriage will shatter soon. But Mawer must devote pages to their first flush of love and to Liesels occult pregnancy before he lets the dream crumble. The hand of destiny, when it appears at last, takes the form of Kata, a prostitute who drives the wedge between Viktor and Liesel. The same task on the larger plane is performed by the Germans, who take over Czechoslovakia from 1939 to 1945. As a Jew, Viktor must flee the country with his family, leaving behind the prized house. The feisty Jew, Hana, who had been Liesels closest friend and lover, becomes the spiritual inheritor of the Glass Room. An inner kinship with the house makes her visit the Glass Room again and again, if only to make passionate love on its floors.         
	Von Abt had defended his creation against charges of being cold by comparing the 90-degree angles, which formed the basis of his architectural style, to a woman being penetrated by a man. As if to prove the validity of his thesis, characters engage in vigorous lovemaking in the Glass Room. Like the superfluous tributes to the room, the scenes of lovemaking too suffer from a kind of surfeit.        
	The weakest part of the novel is its ending, which unites all the surviving characters in the hallowed hall. The coincidences required to achieve this feat mar the credibility of the narrative. But at this stage, most readers would be too numbed with the repetitions, and too cowed by Mawers supercilious tone to notice. The only good thing about the conclusion is that it gives back Hana her Liesel, albeit old and blind. They really did deserve each other after enduring a lifetime of dull husbands, priggish lovers and dumb ex- ballerinas.

	Brave hopes and braver words have both failed the Bharatiya Janata Party. The three states that went to the polls on October 13 have all returned the Congress, by itself or in partnership, as the winner. For the Congress, these assembly elections were important as a test at the state level after the victory of the United Progressive Alliance in the Lok Sabha. Perceptions at the state level are dependent on too many different things for victory or defeat to be attributed entirely to the top leadership of a party. Doubtless, Sonia Gandhi is being seen as a more effective leader than L.K. Advani, and some of the UPAs policies seem helpful to ordinary people. But the state administration is needed to implement these policies successfully. Evidently, the BJP has not been able to convince the people that it can do better on this front than the UPA. In both Maharashtra and Haryana, opposition to the Congress was divided, suggesting a confusion about goals in contrast to the Congresss more focused image. In Maharashtra, Raj Thackerays Maharashtra Navnirman Sena again administered a death-blow to the BJP-Shiv Sena combine, for it has hijacked much of the Marathi identity sentiment. But that alone cannot explain why the BJP and its partner could not unseat the incumbents of 10 years. Squabbles among the partys leadership are being denied, the manipulation of electronic voting machines being blamed in passing, but the impression the BJPs defeat leaves is of a party in disarray. The large number of rebel candidates from the Congress shows that not all is sweetness and light in the Congress either. Yet, in spite of its lower percentage of votes, it has put even its partner, the Nationalist Congress Party, in the shade.        
	The BJP has reason to cry louder over the spilt milk in Haryana. It broke off its alliance with the Indian National Lok Dal, which has done unexpectedly well, while there was also the Haryana Janhit Congress to divide the anti-Congress vote further. Besides, the Congress itself has done far worse than it expected, although the party was aware of the dangers of the anti-Jat vote ever since the chief minister, Bhupinder Singh Hooda, made the state party take on a Jat colouring. The BJPs failure here suggests that the loss of direction at the top is affecting the less coherent state units. Only efficient administration at the state level can redeem that, as Gujarat demonstrates.

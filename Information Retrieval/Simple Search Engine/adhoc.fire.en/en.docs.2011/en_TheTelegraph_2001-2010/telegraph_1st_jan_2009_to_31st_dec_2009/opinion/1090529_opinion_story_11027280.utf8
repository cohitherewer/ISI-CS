	The Small Voice of History: Collected Essays By Ranajit Guha, Permanent Black, Rs 895        
	When I was an undergraduate in Presidency College in the early 1970s, two of my mentors, Ashin Das Gupta and Barun De  scholars with very different approaches to history and to pedagogy  told me emphatically that my education would be incomplete if I didnt read a book called A Rule of Property for Bengal by Ranajit Guha. That was the first time I heard the name of the book and of its author. I read the book immediately and was completely overwhelmed by it. It took a second reading to comprehend the argument made in the book and its significance. My own understanding of history and its writing took a quantum jump with my reading of Guhas book. I became an admirer from a distance and began to read all that he wrote or had written. Even when I did not quite follow Guhas trajectory of thought, I was always drawn to his style.        
	By a neat coincidence, in the early 1980s, when a second edition of A Rule of Property for Bengal appeared, I wrote a review of it in Bengali. Taking courage into both hands, I sent Guha a copy of the review. He responded to say that he rather liked the review and then we met, and over the years the relationship has grown.        
	I begin on an autobiographical note to let readers know that this may not meet their expectations of an objective review.        
	Ranajit Guha began his career as a historian of the land system of 18th and 19th century Bengal. Essays on this theme are brought together in this volume under a section called Rules of Property. Here are two pioneering essays on the Burdwan District Records, 1700-1800 and on the Gauripur Raj estate archives. There is the promise that Guha intended to write the economic history not just from the records preserved by the colonial rulers but also from local records wherever they were available. Both these essays were written in 1956, and they, as well as some of the other essays in this section, need to be read within a particular historiographical context. The most important presence in the study of the economic history of Bengal was Professor N.K. Sinha, who opened up the field, but remained confined to the colonial archives and shied away almost deliberately from any kind of conceptualization or method. Guha chose to move away from the way his teacher approached history. The protest is never overt, but it is there.        
	Sometime in the 1960s, Guha abandoned his pursuit of economic history per se. The first indication of this was in an essay written in 1974 that brought together the story of the revolt of the indigo cultivators in Bengal in the 1860s and its representation in the play, Neel Darpan, by Dinabandhu Mitra. This piece announced that Guha had begun work on peasant insurgency; it also reiterated Guhas abiding love for literature  a theme to which he returned later on in life.        
	The essay on the indigo rebellion was followed by Guhas editorship of the six volumes of Subaltern Studies. In the first of these, he wrote what has come to be seen as the manifesto of the project. That piece showed how Indian historiography had a pronounced elitist bias and declared that the series, by concentrating on the underdogs of society, would correct that bias. For the second volume of the series, Guha wrote an essay on the prose of counter insurgency where, before the textual turn in history-writing had become fashionable, he showed how, by reading standard sources against their grain, it was possible to arrive at an understanding of peasant insurgency and the consciousness that informed it. In the fifth volume, Guha wrote Chandras Death, a little gem where he brought together his skills of reading texts and his formidable knowledge of the rural world of Bengal, its kinship relations and its agrarian conditions. Through the analysis of the death of a lower caste peasant woman, Guha lit up the rural world of Bengal and the nature of oppression that prevailed there.        
	From this period comes an essay on Gramsci (from whose writings the term, subaltern, was taken); another reflective piece of Subaltern Studies which has not been published previously.        
	From the Nineties, Guha turned increasingly towards literature. There are essays here on Chekov, Orwell and Conrad. There is a comment on the writings of Edward Said. And of course, there is Bengali literature. In one essay, again not previously published, Guha reads the essays of Bankimchandra to trace the construction of humanism in colonial India. In another, he turns to Hootum Pyanchar Naksha and reads its rich parody and satire as a response of the colonized to the temporal displacement imposed by colonialism on the everyday life of Calcutta.         
	This volume also brings to the reader Guhas political journalism. Writing mostly for Samar Sens Frontier, Guha commented on the Emergency and the fragility of Indian democracy; on torture and culture; on Indias prisons and other related themes.        
	The corpus is large  there are 44 essays and reviews here, edited with an introduction by Partha Chatterjee. The reviews are often trenchant. Here is the concluding lines from a review of a monograph on the career of Muhammad Reza Khan: The author seems to suffer from fetishistic attachment to the detail....As a result the narrative slows down to the pace of Stevensons donkey with nearly as much wit about it. In short this is dissertational history at its best  or worst  an erudite, important and thoroughly unreadable piece of research: a PhD candidates trophy, a supervisors pride, and a reviewers agony. The reference to Stevensons donkey is a typical Guha touch.        
	No historian of India, and very few in the world, has used the English language as elegantly as Guha has in whatever he has written, from the theoretically profound to the analytically penetrating and to the polemically brilliant. Above all, he has never stood still in his intellectual quest. He writes, Caravans seek the shade of camps, markets their custom in garrisons, even religions their flock among war-weary souls. But Guha has not set up home in one intellectual territory. He has sought and taught us to seek.

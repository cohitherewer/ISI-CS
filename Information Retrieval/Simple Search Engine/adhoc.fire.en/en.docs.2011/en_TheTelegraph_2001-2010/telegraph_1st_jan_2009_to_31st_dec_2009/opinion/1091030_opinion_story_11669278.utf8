                                                                                                                 SOMEWHERE TO CALL THEIR OWN                          - A quest for facts enlivened by imagination and experience                            Down memory lane                                  
	The country formerly known as Great Britain By Ian Jack, Jonathan Cape, 18.99        
	Ian Jack is a British journalist who needs no introduction to readers of this newspaper. But not many of those who enjoy his leader page columns may be aware that he first became known in India for a scurrilous comment on Indira Gandhi when it was open season on her. That was about 30 years ago. Jack has grown up since then. This anthology testifies to his insights, writing skills and flashes of humour.        
	What might baffle readers is the title, evoking memories of Peter Hitchenss 1999 work, The Abolition of Britain. Its a coincidence that Jacks collection appeared soon after Stryker McGuires article, Forget The Great In Britain, made waves on both sides of the Atlantic. That doesnt mean he echoes Anthony Edens 1956 promise to put the Great back into Great Britain by invading Egypt. In fact, no overt jingoism mars these very readable pages about Britain before Cool Britannia. The author even pokes gentle fun at the ultra-patriotic British Nationalist Party which is again in the news. Confessing to a partiality for cherries in an eponymous essay, he says he is a nationalist only about fruit. If the BNP became the BFP, the British Fruit Party, Id be a member.        
	The binding thread for him is not so much lost imperialism as nostalgia for all Britains (and his own) yesterdays. It just so happens that those yesterdays also speak of dominion over palm and pine. Colne in Lancashire calls the twin town of Nelson Little Calcutta and J.B. Priestley ruminates on the dire implications of the end of dhootie manufacture. Its not surprising, therefore, that five of the 35 essays deal with some aspect of the raj. The longest piece (55 pages) is titled, Serampur, and is about William Carey, the missionary whose many achievements included founding the progenitor of The Statesman (which is not mentioned) and importing Indias first steam engine (which is). His account of McCluskiegunge, the Anglo-Indian dream that failed, in Somewhere to Call Their Own, is the best I have read. Like Serampur, it has a place in this collection because it, too, illustrates the tenacity with which residual relics of a Britain that once was Great cling to life.        
	Yet, Jack is no balladeer of Empire like James/Jan Morris. He is, above all, a reporter, but a reporter whose quest for facts as in Klever Kaff  a brilliant piece of writing about the Lancashire contralto, Katherine Ferrier, though flawed by too much technical detail  is backed by imagination tempered by personal experience. Whereas Morris dabbles in romance, Jack has his feet (boots? clogs?) firmly planted on the cobblestones and dirt tracks of lower-middle- and working-class Scotland and the North of England. The family moved to Lancashire but I had to wait till page 315 to learn it was to Farnworth. Bolton, suggested on page 256, turned out to be a red herring.        
	Indian readers are likely to be bored by many of the details of the world in which Jack grew up and which echo what George Orwell called the cult of the North. The mythology of working-class North Country British life may not interest too many modern young Britons either. But Jacks relationship with his father and brother (especially his elder brother) is of touching human interest. The legend of Wallace Henry Hartley, band leader on the doomed Titanic, is for everyone everywhere. The amount of personal jewellery Hartley carried is a story in itself. In The 12.10 to Leeds, an account of a train crash, Jack again sets the present in the context of the past. He does so with a delightful felicity of phrase. It doesnt just rain  God gives his wet dishcloth another squeeze. A missionarys grace is more a warning to the bowels than a blessing.        
	Jack tells us early on that his mother read a lot and was something of a critic, describing what she read as quite good, not bad, and an awfy lot of rubbish. Given her education and social background, she might have placed her sons work in the last category. Others will have no doubt that it belongs to the first.                          SUNANDA K.

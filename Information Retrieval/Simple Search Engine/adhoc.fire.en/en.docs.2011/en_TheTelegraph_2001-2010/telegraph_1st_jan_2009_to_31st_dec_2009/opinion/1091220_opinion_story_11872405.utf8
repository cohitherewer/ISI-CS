	False concern                  
	Sir  Lindsay Lohans claim that she helped rescue 40 child labourers in New Delhi seems dubious. According to the charity group that organized the raid, Lohan was not present in New Delhi at the time. It seems that Lohans visit to India was merely a professional trip and not a tour for humanitarian causes, as it is being projected. Instead of making such hue and cry, it would have been better had Lohan made more worthwhile contributions towards improving the grievous condition of children in India.

	Murky affair          
	Sir  Tiger Woods has decided to take indefinite leave from professional golf to save his marriage (Tiger Woods to take indefinite break from the game, Dec 13). He spent two weeks in his Orlando home recovering from a recent car accident he met with. Meanwhile, the global media have been swamped with reports of his marital infidelities, linking him to several women, including a waitress. Woods has requested the media to keep away from his personal life, as the scandals exposed have badly dented the golfers image of a perfectionist sportsman, which had so far been unscathed and had earned him lucrative endorsement offers that made him one of the richest sportsmen in the world. Moreover, his marriage with the Swedish model, Elin Nordegren, is going through a rough patch because of rumours of his unfaithfulness. Woodss fans, who had so far believed in his too good to be true image, may also be feeling let down.          
	Though a golfer of his stature would normally never take an indefinite break from professional golf, it seems that Woods has done so because he is now desperate to prove himself a good husband and father after the infidelities he has committed. In these difficult times, it may be right to show some compassion and concern for him. However, it is also true that Woods is a famous sportsperson, and his fans expect him to be back to the game as early as possible.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The hot story in the media these days is about the worlds No. 1 golfer, Tiger Woods. The media have disclosed that Woods was involved with a number of women, including a nightclub hostess and a waitress (Mistress list grows, Dec 16). Woods has even admitted to some of these affairs. Therefore, his image of an impeccable sportsman has been seriously damaged, and the media are now portraying him as the unfaithful husband, who is making his wife and family suffer. But there is one point to be made in this context. The world knows Woods as an accomplished golf player, and that is his true identity. Just before this controversy surfaced, he won a world championship. Whatever he has done in his personal life does not make any difference to his image as a sportsperson. Then why are the media creating so much fuss around his private life?          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The excitement generated by the media over Tiger Woodss alleged infidelities may well be just a gimmick aimed at securing publicity. It is not entirely impossible that Woods may have paid the women he is being linked to in order to create this brouhaha. It could also be that his alleged affairs with Rachel Uchitel, a Manhattan nightclub hostess, Jaime Grubbs, a waitress, and many others, have been cooked up by these women themselves to grab media attention. Whatever the case may be, it seems that the media is doing a raving business out of this scandal.          
	Yours faithfully,

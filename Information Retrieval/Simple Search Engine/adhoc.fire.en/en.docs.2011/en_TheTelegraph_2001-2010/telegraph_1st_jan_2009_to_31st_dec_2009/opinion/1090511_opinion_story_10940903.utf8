                                                                                                                 BADLY PRICKED                                                    
	After Nigeria and Ghana, it is India. Marc Koska, the inventor of the non-reusable K1 syringe, arrived in India after conducting campaigns to promote the auto-disable syringe in the African countries. Findings in India show that 62 per cent of the five billion medical injections administered annually are unsafe. A forceful campaign conducted by the man from over the seas has ultimately persuaded the government here to make AD syringes mandatory from April 30, 2009, about four years after the staggeringly low level of safety had become known. The mandate now applies to public health service centres across the country, and would greatly raise safety levels if properly implemented. For a country like India, where need is such that livelihoods carved out of illegal trade in recycled objects, such as by refilling empty bottles of mineral water with water from anywhere, are just routine, the mandatory use of the AD syringe is not just necessary, it is essential. Not that people do not know the requirements, or the dangers of reusing syringes. They do not care. Doctors in government hospitals are often asked to break the needle against a hard edge before throwing it away after use. Without protective apparel against HIV contamination, doctors run the risk of pricking themselves as the used needle resists breakage. The whole needle is carefully gathered from hospital waste and resold to illegal dealers at a rupee each. Everyone is aware of this, yet nothing is ever done. The people who gather the discarded needles usually live on the hospital premises and are part of the non-medical staff.        
	A mandate by the government is undoubtedly a good thing; maybe the government will even make it into a law. No doubt it will also provide the wherewithal to its health service to acquire AD syringes, which cost a little more than the ordinary ones. The real questions are different. How far is the government committed to the cause? Does it have plans to address the corruption that will immediately start eroding the new system? Often illegal trades have behind them the support of lower or middle rungs of the local political leadership. Do Indias political leaders, while ceaselessly scrambling to increase their powers, really think that the peoples health is important? Without political will and the determination to fight corruption, no mandate will ever be enough.

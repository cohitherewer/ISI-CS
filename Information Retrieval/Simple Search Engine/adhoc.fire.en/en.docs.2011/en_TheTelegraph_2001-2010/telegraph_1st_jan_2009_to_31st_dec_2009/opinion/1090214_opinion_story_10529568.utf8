The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Caught in the race
                                                                                                                 CAUGHT IN THE RACE                              Ananda Lal      Theatre                                                
	Who says that Bengali theatre does not keep up with the times? Sayaks Daurnama provides yet another instance, not only of topical relevance but also of real-life inspiration propelled by the customary social conscience. Indrashis Laharry bases his drama on the VIP Road bus tragedy last year, and raises the demand for justice again after public memory has forgotten the shameful incident and killer buses continue to race each other at will. The opening sequence of the bus careening off the shoulder of the road, headlights slicing through the auditorium and passengers screaming, jolts us upright, while fleetingly reminding us of Sayaks past success with Daybaddha, about a truck-driver.        
	Early hopes that Daurnama would identify and condemn the primary reasons for such automotive anarchy  the commission system and the workers incorrigibility due to their political clout, especially with that pugilistic minister in the broad white hat feared even by the Hand of God  come to nought as Laharry shifts to a sympathetic treatment of the arrested drivers inner life. To Laharry, Daurnama symbolizes the speed, rat race and competition nowadays that trap everyone, including that poor man. No doubt this is a noble sentiment that we cannot refute, but it also allows us to luxuriatingly pass the buck by blaming everything around us for our woes, without changing things. Rather, we should call a spade a spade, pinpoint this specific menace of licensed murderers, and take available steps to remove it from our ken so that it never recurs.        
	Instead, Laharry gives us the stories of the drivers wife, his former teacher, the passenger who saved a child believing it to be her own daughter, media and police intervention, and a contrived twist in the plot bringing the driver and passenger face to face, with a huge surprise that alters his life. In prison, he rants and raves, constantly waking up the warder who keeps telling him to shut up, in some of the plays lighter moments. Director Meghnad Bhattacharya applies the hologram of a Sayak production, never losing any chance to spotlight emotions and high drama, heightening the ends of key scenes into mini-climaxes (with textual contributions from Chandan Sen). But he also ensures superior performances from even the bit parts, particularly the drivers loyal helper (Pradip Das), his sage mentor (Partha Goswami) and the paan-chewing police inspector (Dhurjjati De). He convincingly chops off decades from his own age in acting the young lead (picture). Kalika Majumdar depicts his wife in a naturalistic manner, before fate gives her a shock. Indrajita Chakrabarti portrays the Urdu-speaking woman passenger with intensity, and near insanity after she realizes what had happened to her own child.

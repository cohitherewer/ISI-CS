	John Lennon: The Life By Philip Norman, 
  Harper, 5.99        
	Philip Normans request to Yoko Ono that he should become her deceased husbands biographer was based on quiet confidence. His Shout was, according to Norman himself, the definitive work on the Beatles of whom John Lennon was the founding member. Normans confidence must have served him well during his three years of rigorous research on a man who was certainly the most gifted, and the most controversial, of the quartet that made up the Beatles. While it is generally agreed that these 817 pages, the fruits of Normans labour, are certainly an improvement on some of the earlier works on Lennon (Ray Colemans and Albert Goldmans biographies in particular), John Lennon: The Life isnt quite flawless. Ironically, Normans voluminous research that throws light on nearly every aspect and episode of Lennons life often threatens to bury the protagonist under the debris of minutiae.        
	Lennons troubled childhood; his impish acts in Woolton and, later, at Quarry Bank High School; the fortuitous meeting with Paul McCartney at a church fte and the formation of the aptly named Quarrymen; the early, nondescript tours and the later global fame of the Beatles; the bands breakup; Lennons years in America and his death  every conceivable segment of Lennons life has been dexterously mapped by Norman. Lennons story, in all its detail, could not have been better told. But then this was only to be expected because Norman had unconstrained access to some of the key people in the singers life. Apart from Yoko Ono and Julian Lennon, the son she had with John, Paul McCartney and the Beatles former producer, George Martin, pitched in to fill in some missing links in Lennons life. Neil Aspinall, a trusted associate, broke a 40-year-old silence to open up to Norman and also correct his manuscript.         
	The best chapters in the book, though, are not about Lennon, but recount the Beatles difficult early years before the release of Love Me Do, the first of the many hits. There are poignant glimpses of a yet-to-be-famous bands struggle to achieve stardom: at the Indra Club in sleazy Reeperbahn in Hamburg, each Beatle was asked to play for six hours on weekends and was paid 2.50 per day for their efforts. Norman is a knowledgeable man when it comes to the genre of popular music and, characteristically, offers the first tantalizing signs of a world making the transition from Western classical, jazz, blues and the harmless, pre-rock-n-roll skiffle to the sound of rock. Norman is at his best documenting this transient phase and uses the medium of music as a prism to reflect on the socio-political changes that helped post-war Europe emerge into a new, vibrant world order. Normans musical knowledge is rich, and his grasp over musical trivia is as impressive. Rock and roll, we are told, were used as synonyms in Black music to describe rhythm-enhanced sex, and the credit for fusing these two words lies with a Cleveland disc jockey. The Beatles, we are reminded, got their name not from John or Paul, its two most creative members, but from the poet, Royston Ellis.         
	Expectedly, a biography of a man as colourful as Lennon has its share of revelations. The most significant of these comes in the form of the confession of his incestuous desire for his mother, Julia, whose death, when Lennon was 17 years old, changed the singers life forever. The other notable disclosure also has a sexual component, but is somewhat anti-climactic. Despite feverish speculation in the media, Norman refutes the claim that Lennon had slept with Brian Epstein, the Beatles manager who was in love with him, once while on holiday in Spain. Norman also scotches rumours that John, Paul, George and Ringo puffed on a joint when they went to Buckingham Palace to receive their MBEs. For the uninitiated, there is also an illuminating analysis of the American States witchhunt against the Lennons in the Nixon era.        
	By his own admission, a part of Normans mission was to correct the worlds perception of Yoko Ono with whom Lennon had his Beatle-busting love affair. Norman is compassionate towards this talented Japanese performance artist, and is convincing in his argument that Yoko, far from being the scheming, selfish woman that she is made out to be in some quarters, actually enriched Lennons life in many ways. Contrastingly, in his treatment of Cynthia, Johns long-suffering former wife, Norman remains faithful to the facts but seems untouched by her misery.         
	But what of Normans portrayal of the man himself, John Lennon, born on a night that saw the Luftwaffe give the skies of Liverpool a brief respite? Norman takes great pains to present the myriad sides of Lennons multi-faceted personality. There is the musical genius who, along with his three friends, dazzled the world by creating magic with words and tunes. There is also another Lennon, an irrepressible, irreverent wit, who had once affectionately patted the head of his spiritual guide, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, and said ,Theres a good little guru.         
	But then, there was also a sinister side to Lennon. His inner darkness, which he couldnt quite conquer with music, love or years of drug abuse, is best revealed by Normans account of Lennons therapy sessions with Arthur Janov, as well as by the Rolling Stone interview with Jann Wenner. These two conversations, especially the second, bring to light a man who is insecure, lonely and resigned to remain haunted by the ghosts of the past. But Norman is never judgmental about his protagonist. Instead, he gallantly offers his readers the freedom to make what they want of his muse. The fact that Yoko Ono was upset after reading Normans book and had accused him of being mean to John therefore comes as a bit of a surprise for this very reason.        
	Apart from the tiresome details, Normans book suffers from another blemish. Inexplicably, he chooses not to expound on the legacy that Lennon left behind after his untimely death. Is there then a possibility that the prolific Norman will undertake yet another lengthy, literary project to plug this gap? Readers certainly wont mind, but will secretly hope that he produces a slimmer volume.

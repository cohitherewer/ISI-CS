                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	King without a crown                  
	Sir  The sacking of Sourav Ganguly from the Kolkata Knight Riders captaincy is disappointing, but it should not have come as a shock to Calcuttas cricket-lovers (Burden off, Sourav lifts weights, April 19). Undoubtedly, Ganguly has been a successful leader and had instilled pride and confidence in Indian cricket. For his contributions, he has received due recognition. However, it will not be wise to judge the present issue on sentimental grounds alone. Ganguly is not getting any younger. Hence, he is not among the fittest players in the team. Thus, from a cricketing point of view, he may have to sit out occasionally because of poor fitness.           
	As captain, Ganguly was often guided by instinct. But in Twenty20 cricket, the captain has to put logic above instinct. John Buchanan and Shah Rukh Khan must have been at great pains to find the right way to relieve Ganguly of the captaincy. Perhaps the idea of multiple captains was floated to reveal their lack of confidence in Gangulys ability to lead the side in this format of the game. Gangulys greatness would have been proved if he had let go of his captaincy quietly. But he chose to fight it out without realizing that in the world of business, money ranks above emotion. Sensing a backlash, Buchanan and Khan chose to announce Gangulys successor in South Africa, and rightly so. Gangulys fans should put the situation in the right perspective and take pride in the fact that Ganguly has retained his place in the side. Ganguly was an icon in his heyday, and will remain one for his state and country in the future. Times have changed, so have the teams needs, but Gangulys worshippers have not.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  John Buchanan came up with the concept of multiple captains to snub Sourav Gangulys authority. Buchanan made his novel plan public immediately after it was declared that this edition of the Indian Premier League would not be held in India. This clearly shows that Buchanan had planned Gangulys execution as the captain much earlier, but was apprehensive to implement it lest the Eden crowd got furious. After flaunting his unique theory for months, and saying that Ganguly too would feature as one of the many captains, Brendon McCullum was appointed as the sole captain before the start of the tournament. This proves yet again that Buchanan had put his theory forward because a more direct attempt to rob Ganguly of the captaincy would have earned him brickbats from the critics. Buchanan has not only discriminated against Ganguly (who displayed excellent all-round capabilities even in the last edition of the IPL), but has also insulted Indias most successful skipper by leaving him out in the cold.           
	The least said about Shah Rukh Khan the better. First, he declared that there was no threat to Gangulys captaincy. Next, he endorsed Buchanans multiple captaincy plan. Finally, he stood by Buchanan as the latter went on to make McCullum captain. However, all this was bound to happen, given the commercialization of cricket. When the ignorant rich decide to call the shots, cricketers like Ganguly are bound to be treated unfairly. Bengalis should protest against the hypocritical conduct of a matinee idol who has stabbed Calcuttas boy in the back.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  New Zealands Brendon McCullum has replaced Sourav Ganguly as the captain of the Calcutta team. This is not the first time that the former Indian captain has been treated unfairly. The decision to strip him of captaincy has come as a shock to his fans all over the world.           
	These fans should know that Ganguly will bounce back and silence his critics, as he has done so often in his long and glorious cricketing career.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Rupa R, Jamshedpur

                
	Sir  After talking ill of Sunil Gavaskar, Shah Rukh Khan has now thrown out Sourav Ganguly from the position of captain. People who think of cricket as a religion and not a business have been disappointed by this.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  I understand that The Telegraph has reported my comments regarding the publication of a volume based on the Hyde papers on which Professor Pradip Sinha has been working for some years (Victoria Memorial sits on edited Hyde papers, April 17). May I clarify my position? The volume was referred to me and I briefly commented that it should be published with adequate notes and a more detailed introduction. For reasons of health, Professor Sinha is in no position to do this now. I think the volume may still be published after some work by some competent scholar along the lines I suggested. I wish to emphasize competent scholar.          
	Yours faithfully,

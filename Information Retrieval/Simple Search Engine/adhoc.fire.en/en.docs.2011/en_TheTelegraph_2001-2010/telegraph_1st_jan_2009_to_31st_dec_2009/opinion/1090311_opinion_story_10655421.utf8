The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | To strike or not to strike
                                                                                                                 TO STRIKE OR NOT TO STRIKE                                  Do lawyers have the right to cease work to make a point, asks Hemchhaya De                          Clashing forces: A lawyer (centre) scuffles with the police during a protest against amendments to the CRPC in Delhi recently                                  
	Advocate Bidyut Kiran Mukherjee seems to be in two minds these days. The Calcutta High Court Bar Association president has often been in the news for raising the issue of the scarcity of judges in West Bengal courts. Despite repeated assurances from the Chief Justice of the Calcutta High Court, little has been done to fill the vacancies.         
	Mukherjee now wants to revive the movement that was on the back burner for a while. But he is undecided about the form the protest should take. Should lawyers cease work or launch a peaceful agitation?         
	During my tenure, we have peacefully agitated against issues without dishonouring judges. But all our members want to boycott the Chief Justices court, and other courts too, in protest, says Mukherjee. But I have asked them to exercise self restraint. Were having a secret ballot to decide on the mode of protest.        
	Mukherjee is against any form of violent protest as witnessed in Chennai recently. The police clashed with lawyers in the Madras High Court premises. Submitting its report a few days ago, a committee appointed by the Supreme Court (SC) apparently blamed the lawyers for the Chennai incident.        
	In recent times, there have been several cases of lawyers ceasing work. Court proceedings were paralysed in many parts of the country after lawyers struck work in protest against the central governments move to amend the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). Prior to the Chennai violence, the Madras High Court Advocates Association had called for a strike to protest Tamil civilian deaths in Sri Lanka.         
	Last month, Bangalore-based advocate R. Muralidharan filed a petition in the Supreme Court seeking a direction to declare the lawyers strike in Chennai illegal. Muralidharan contends that a few lawyers are preventing others from work. Lawyers are self-employed professionals unlike normal employees, says Muralidharan. Advocates are mainly regulated by the Bar Council of India. Then we have the Advocates Act. Nowhere in this act does it say that lawyers can resort to strikes to precipitate decisions.         
	The moot point is whether lawyers have a right to strike. According to a landmark SC judgement, delivered in December 2002, in the ex-Captain Harish Uppal versus Union of India amp; Anr case, ...lawyers have no right to go on strike or give a call for boycott, not even on a token strike. The protest, if any is required, can only be by giving press statements, TV interviews, carrying out of the court premises banners and/or placards, ... peaceful protest marches outside and away from court premises...         
	The Constitutional Bench deciding on the case further observes, ...lawyers holding vakalats on behalf of their clients cannot not attend courts in pursuance to a call for strike or boycott. All lawyers must boldly refuse to abide by any call for strike... No Bar Council or Bar Association can permit calling of a meeting for purposes of considering a call for strike or boycott and requisition, if any, for such meeting must be ignored.         
	It, however, adds a caveat. Only in the rarest of rare cases where the dignity, integrity and independence of the Bar and/or the Bench are at stake, the Bench says, courts may ignore...a protest abstention from work for not more than one day.         
	Says Subrata Talukdar, counsel, Calcutta High Court, Lawyers should not confuse their roles within a court and outside it. They shouldnt use the court as a platform to fight for causes that are not related to their duties as lawyers.         
	Some argue that protest is a fundamental right. If we decide to call for a strike in protest against any issue, we are well within our rights, says Suman Ghosh, writ practitioner, Calcutta high Court. Counters Talukdar, We should also bear in mind that there are reasonable restrictions on the freedom of expression as guaranteed by Article 19 (1) A of the Constitution. In this case, accountability to litigants can be called a reasonable restriction.         
	Lawyers admit that the legal fraternity often calls for strikes on frivolous grounds. The strike (by Chennai advocates) is in demand for a ceasefire in Sri Lanka. As per international laws, India cannot force Sri Lanka to act and vice versa. So whats the point of calling for a strike, asks Muralidharan.         
	However, some rue that the Supreme Court does not recognise the lawyers right to strike. But of course it should not be for an indefinite period, though sometimes situations go beyond control, says Adish C. Aggarwala, chairman, All India Bar Association.         
	Most lawyers connected with bar associations say that ground realities have to be taken into consideration before demonising lawyers. Almost all courts in West Bengal are functioning without enough judges. There are 23 vacancies now in the high court against the required strength of 58. About 400,000 cases are pending, says Bidyut Kiran Mukherjee. Suchit Kumar Banerjee, senior advocate, Calcutta High Court, points out that at least 15,000 cases were to be heard just last week.         
	In addition to the lack of judges, other basic problems delay solving cases. If such grievances are not looked into, we are willing to go on the warpath even if that means violating a SC judgement. We are ready to face the consequences, says Mukherjee.         
	The SC has said in its judgement that grievance redress committees have to be set up at district or sub-divisional levels to look into lawyers complaints. No such committee or cell has been constituted anywhere in India. So where is the proper mechanism to deal with grievances, asks Aggarwala.         
	The judgement also stipulates that it is the duty of bar councils to control any unbecoming behaviour on the part of lawyers. We never advise lawyers to go on strikes. We explore all avenues, says J.R. Beniwal, vice chairman, Bar Council of India.         
	So what should litigants do if a strike hampers their case? An aggrieved person can always lodge a complaint with the state bar council, as per Section 37 of the Advocates Act. If no action is taken at this level, the person can approach the Bar Council of India, says Beniwal.

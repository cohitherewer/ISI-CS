	Q: I am a sales executive, staying in a rented house on the ground floor with my wife. My landlord, who lives on the floor above us, is always trying to harass us. His wife keeps throwing food and waste from the top floor, their dog creates a mess on our entrance and his son plays loud and jarring music. I have protested against all this several times, but my landlord always takes that opportunity to badmouth us and intimidate us. How do I stop this nuisance?        
	K. Mazumdar, Calcutta        
	A: You may institute a criminal case under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure against your landlord, his men and agents, before an executive magistrate and obtain a restraining order on them to stop them from committing such acts. You can also file a civil suit of injunction getting an order to stop your landlord from disturbing you in any manner.              
	Q: I want to buy a property whose owner had purchased it through a registered sale deed. But the present owners vendor said in the recital of the deed that he had purchased it from its previous owner through a registered sale deed on a certain date without mentioning its registration number or place of registration. I want to know if the present owner has purchased the property from the rightful owner of the premises.        
	R.K. Pilania, Hindmotor, W. Bengal        
	A: To put your anxiety to rest you can conduct a search through an advocate in all the registry offices having jurisdiction over the said property. The search should be related to whether or not any sale transaction took place on the said date between the present owners vendor and the previous owner with respect to this particular property. If the search reveals the sale transaction, you will get all the details you are looking for.        
	Q: We reside in a multi-storied building where some flat owners have one or more car parking spaces and servants quarters and some do not have any. But the maintenance that we pay is calculated only on the basis of the area of each flat. Can we legally claim additional maintenance from flat owners who have car parking and servants quarters?         
	Name Withheld        
	A: From the facts stated by you it appears that the maintenance charges have already been fixed for all flat owners by mutual consent. If you want to claim additional maintenance from flat owners with car parks and servants quarters there has to be a meeting among all flat owners to come to an agreement on this. You cannot arbitrarily increase the charges without obtaining the consent of all flat owners.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Linking the past with the present
                                                                                                                 LINKING THE PAST WITH THE PRESENT                              Soumitra Das      Visual Arts                                                
	It is easy to get seduced by the urbanity and precision of the woodcuts of 19th century Calcutta, executed in neighbourhoods such as Bat-tala, Garanhata and Kalighat. It is by no accident that these prints came to be identified with these areas in north and south Calcutta where they were mass produced. These popular prints were marked by a visual exuberance that was contributed in no small measure by the exactitude with which the images were drawn. The blockmakers made optimum use of their imagination when they engraved blocks of wood to create pictures of deities, scenes from daily life, advertisements for consumer products, and illustrations of books, almanacs and rhymes.        
	The latter had much potential for satirical depiction of the life of the man-about-town besotted with his mistress and lavish lifestyle that often led to his ruin in the rakes progress tradition. The young and enlightened Bengali busy aping his British role model was also not presented in the most kindly light. It is the satirical content of these pictures that gives them their present-day relevance.        
	The young artist, Rajesh Deb, originally from Tripura, seems to be so obsessed with these woodcuts that he has for years been creating giant versions of these prints on paper, albeit with a contemporary twist, achieved primarily by adding text to the visual content of his work, mostly derived from the old woodcuts. In his current exhibition, Single Edition Woodcut Prints on Canvas (Aug 30-Sep 23), at Gallery Rasa, Deb, as the title suggests, does just that  take out prints on canvas, instead of paper. But the inspiration of this artist trained at Rabindra Bharati University remains the same.        
	It does not take much to find out the references to present times in his large works, but the images are borrowed in the main from Bat-tala or Kalighat woodcuts, some of which have gained the status of icons. There is, however, a major difference between the originals and the takes on them  the latter are all in colour, although it is doubtful whether this has added to their appeal.        
	Deb makes use of the common enough device of juxtaposing then and now images to connect. In Nilachale Mahaprabhu, a man in modern clothes  shirt and trousers  looks at a helicopter hovering above, while Sri Krishna Chaitanya in a trance visualizes the divinity he worshipped. Andey Planet, Dream Planet, Animal Planet is a spoof of a popular television channel but the birds and beasts and piscine human being depicted here are all borrowed from old prints. However, the war planes hurtle us back to present times.        
	The Royal Indian Collector is dressed like a typical babu but the work he displays on his circular table top is small replica of Ramkinkars iconic sculpture. These are threads that link the past with the present. Even when he quotes a Bengali film song that was a big hit not so long ago, the gyrating woman and her admirers in the forms of butterflies and a peacock hark back to 19th-century practice.        
	But the humour or attempts at satire can at times be strained. In Certificate of Humour, that is obviously picked up straight from Thakurmar Jhuli, Deb has added a text which, with its garbled grammar and spellings, tries hard to be funny.        
	Debs ploy, however, is quite successful in some works, notably Tagore Brain Oil, in which he lifts images from Rabindranaths own paintings to create a composite picture of the systematic and organized exploitation of the name of the Nobel prize-winning poet. In this work, Deb refers to the satirical writings of Sarat Pandit or Dadathakur, as he was known.        
	This, however, does not take away from the fact that Deb is a powerful figurative artist. This is evident in works such as Lover and the Martyr with its flute and its gun-toting men in monochrome and the grotesque heads and torsos of two men. The sea of heads in Janagan  We the People is another fine example of the virility of his draughtsmanship. Che Guevaras body may look warped but Deb has taken liberties with his anatomy quite intentionally. In these works, he uses colour imaginatively. Bright red next to bright blue stands out automatically, and one is bound to notice the blue face of the woman amid a sea of humanity in green. Drawing is this young artists strong suit and it is no mean gift.

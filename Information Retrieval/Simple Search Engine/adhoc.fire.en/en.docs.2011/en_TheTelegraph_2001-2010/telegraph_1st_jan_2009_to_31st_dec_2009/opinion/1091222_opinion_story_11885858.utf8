	For a new earth                  
	Sir  The goings-on at the Copenhagen summit were reminiscent of the talks held by the World Trade Organisation and General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in the previous decades. Even back then, unilaterally imposed conditions stalled the discussions. Greenhouse gas emissions by India or Africa, on a global scale, are not alarming. Yet both these nations were expected to reduce emission more than the industrially advanced nations, which have, over the years, emitted the bulk of the GHG responsible for global warming (Tip of a new climate order, Dec 20).          
	The developed nations have always shifted the burden of emission cuts on to the less prosperous countries, which are at different stages of development. If the latter enter into binding agreements, their future progress will be smothered. It is unreasonable that countries like India, China, Brazil and South Africa, which are aspiring to a better quality of life after years of colonial rule, were expected to give in to this carbon colonialism. The Copenhagen proceedings should have inspired trust, not acrimony. The people of the developed world would have to alter their lifestyle, which is primarily responsible for the rise of the earths temperature.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The minister for environment and forests, Jairam Ramesh, represented India symbolically and formally at the summit on climate change in Copenhagen. Understandably, promises were not to be uttered by him at that international forum (No Promises, Dec 14). However, India should take a leading role in cutting emissions when small countries like Nepal and the Maldives are making a concerted effort at reducing pollution. Indias stand on curbing environmental degradation should be unhesitating, since the whole world is on the verge of a common danger.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Rathin Kumar Chanda, Chinsurah, Hooghly

                
	Sir  The fuss over the Copenhagen summit may not be comprehensible to the public at large. But the man on the street certainly knows how corruption and the lack of accountability in every stage of governance in this country stymies the various efforts launched from time to time to make India a better and a healthier place to live in. The felling of trees, for example, by the timber mafia is often overlooked by the police and forest officials, not only because they are bribed to remain silent but also because of the unhelpful attitude of the bureaucracy and the lack of support from local politicians. Similarly, owners of smoke-belching, landscape-defacing factories are never punished because of judicial tardiness.          
	A few months ago, trees on either side of the arterial road linking the two towns of Kharagpur and Midnapore were chopped off and carted away at a frenzied pace, ostensibly for widening the road, which is yet to begin. But no one knows if it was done lawfully or if timber worth crores was sold to the mafia. What accentuates the problem in this country is the fact that most small and medium businesses are owned by people with scant education and little morality or conscience. These people are in the habit of circumventing the laws, forging documents and bribing officials to reach their goals.          
	India can become a greener and cleaner country for generations to come if more educated people are encouraged to become entrepreneurs. The State must liberally extend credit to them, alongside offering technical help.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Shivaji K. Moitra, Kharagpur

                
	Sir  Climate change is bound to gain much importance, and not just due to the recent Copenhagen summit. After all, it is the global environment that is in jeopardy. Ambivalence still persists in India about emission cuts, since agreeing to legal terms may come in the way of the countrys growth. The poor in India often subsist on professions that pose hazards to nature and to their own lives, but little choice is available to them. Economic insecurity might come in the way of going green. Moreover, the high cost of green engineering is worrying for India. However, people should be encouraged to convert to renewable energy.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Abhirup Bhunia, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Half of December is over, yet Calcuttans have been deprived of even a mild touch of winter. The meteorological department has predicted the onset of winter several times in the past fortnight but each time the prediction has gone haywire due to a depression over the Bay of Bengal or the Arabian Sea. I wonder if there was no depression over the southern coasts a couple of decades back when Calcutta usually had long winters. Or has it all changed due to global warming?          
	Recently, an official said that temperatures would not fall before December 18 (Storm steals city winter, Dec 15). But how can he be so sure? By that time, a depression may form over Honolulu or Timbuktoo and Calcuttans may lose their winter once again. Perhaps it would be prudent for the experts to stop making predictions every day to avoid repeated embarrassments.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
S.B. Gupta, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The powers that be have zeroed in on auto-rickshaws and old buses to put an end to pollution. But they seem to have not noticed that a source of air pollution integral to Calcuttas cold season has almost disappeared. With relatively high temperatures, the little fires that once dotted the city in the evening are hardly visible now. Usually, pavement dwellers warmed themselves by sitting near the flames lit with wood, paper and sometimes tyres. The smoke was highly distressing. A mild winter may have put an end to such pollution. Maybe we need not always bemoan that winter was short and not too cold.                    
	Yours faithfully,         Subhayu Saha,Khagra, Murshidabad

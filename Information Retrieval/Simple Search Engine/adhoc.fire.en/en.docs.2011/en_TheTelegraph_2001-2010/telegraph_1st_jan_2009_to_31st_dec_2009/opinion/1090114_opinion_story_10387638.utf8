	Fatal job  
	The Workmens Compensation Act provides for the payment of compensation to a workman or his heirs in case of injury or death arising out of or in the course of employment. When a workman was told by his super-ior to connect a fuse by climbing a pole, he came in contact with a live wire and died. When his wife claimed compensation, it was denied on the ground that his duty was confined to taking meter readings and not attending to fuse calls. It was even contended that he had climbed the pole to commit suicide. The Bombay High Court held that as the deceased was not mentally disturbed, it could not be said that he had planned to commit suicide. Directing compensation, the court held that since the workman had obeyed his superiors orders in attending to an emergency, his death had occurred in the course of employment.

	Dutiful clerk        
	An upper division clerk was charge-sheeted for misconduct. His offence was that he had not assisted in rescuing some judicial officers whose quarters were inundated during a flood. A punishment was imposed upon him, withholding all future promotion. The clerk filed a writ petition, stating that he had a heart condition and had undergone surgery in the recent past. Setting aside the order of punishment, the Andhra Pradesh High Court held that such an act was not listed in the AP Civil Service Conduct Rules as misconduct. It added that he had done his best, considering his health and other circumstances, and that he could not be held responsible for dereliction of duty. (A. Venkat Reddy vs District amp; Sessions Judge Chittoor and others)                     
	Rival alarm        
	 A bar and restaurant owner applied to the excise authorities for shifting his business to another location. The licensees of some neighbouring liquor shops in the new location filed a writ petition, contending that the new establishment would adversely affect their business. Dismissing the writ petition, the Andhra Pradesh High Court held that in the absence of any anti-competition law, a rival trader could not file a case to scotch competition.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Just grin and bear it
                                                                                                                 JUST GRIN AND BEAR IT                          - Sophisticated politician or Old Labour barbarian?        Westminster Gleanings
   Anabel Loyd                                          
	Gordon Browns image as the Man with the Plan ought to be beginning to slip. He seems to be less the sophisticated politician  and, lets face it, even the most urbane and actorly of those, vide Tony Blair and Bill Clinton, slipped up badly under stress  than an Old Labour barbarian bent on the destruction of this countrys civilization as we know it. Everything, be it green concerns over future housing plans or more focused debate over the highly unpopular building of a third runway at Heathrow Airport, is bulldozed out of the way for the sake of a speedy, if temporary, appearance of financial revival that overrides deep-seated problems and creates new ones for the future.        
	Brown, with an increasingly manic grin on his grey face, is loving it. He is in charge while we all run around like headless chickens, disabled by insecurity at work and at home, with no clear idea as to whether we should save if we have money and, if so, where; spend as a public service, a highly unlikely scenario; invest in time-tested art works; or buy gold and stash it under the bed. Actually very few of us are in a position to do any of these things, particularly as we have no idea any longer where the bottom is except we are pretty sure we havent reached it yet. The one thing we are not getting from our prime minister is the sort of real leadership that involves communicating and empathizing with people, rather than assuming that we are all enjoying joining in with his personal global economic ego trip, to be showcased nationally with more of the highly expensive cabinet road-trips for meetings and walkabouts in cities other than London. The last, to Liverpool a week ago, is believed to have cost taxpayers around 200,000.              
	Last week, shops there may have still looked quite busy with rock-bottom prices creating an illusion of bustle in the ongoing chain-store sales, or at least in those that remain open. Since the New Year, our local countrytown High Street has lost Woolworths, famously cheap, cheerful and useful, and the Marks and Spencer food outlet. Most of the smaller boutiques look as if they are selling off and folding up. It may be that the loss of long-term chains will eventually be a good thing for High Streets that, both here and in much of Europe, have become increasingly homogeneous. But as less-well-funded, small, independent shops disappear too, it is hard to imagine the sort of upswing that will be required to encourage them back into business, or persuade backers to support the young designers and craftspeople of today to chance their arm as independent traders. At the moment, it is impossible to tell whether we will be left only with the biggest and wealthiest chain stores and supermarkets, churning out identikit goods or, contrarily, whether a new desire to spend money only on the best or the unique will encourage a more discerning buyer choosing a little of the best and made to last over a lot of throwaway tat.        
	For the time being, the extent of job losses must encourage thoughts on the viability of spending newly acquired free time becoming self-sufficient by growing your own food. In this country, however, subsistence farming would be a luxury available only to those with the space to grow a vegetable or keep a chicken or two. Possibly corporate man, the casualty of financial collapse in the City of London, might be a candidate for retraining in agriculture and horticulture, and one has to hope that some of the newly unemployed have the gumption to recognize their situation and move on in a new direction.         
	There is something quite tragic about former financiers, so long nurtured by great corporations who owned them body and soul, once they hit the skids. The highest echelons, if their money hasnt disappeared with their company, may take and enjoy a comfortable early retirement albeit one not quite as padded as anticipated. The young and bright may look to other countries, ride out the storm or have the imagination to look at alternative choices and trainings. The worst off are those who have lived comfortably and safely in the mid-level womb of their companies and are completely rudderless when cast out on the waves. They may have been managers and directors, in charge of large workforces and the dealings of gigantic financial machines, but alone they are barely able to tie their own shoelaces. Come to think of it, when Ernest Saunders, former chief executive of Guinness at the time of the Eighties share-trading fraud, had his prison sentence halved on appeal due to the appearance of an early onset of dementia, from which he later miraculously recovered, he was probably just suffering from post-financier stress syndrome aggravated by criminal guilt.        
	These days, the likelihood of a large pension is small and perhaps that is not all bad in spite of school fees unpaid and skiing holidays cancelled. Those who are really up against it may be pushed, however unwillingly, into finding new directions; at best, doing the things they always wanted to do when they had time; more probably, doing something they dont want to do that still keeps the roof over their heads. Those who are just alright, if struggling, may be the worst off. They can try a bit of this, dabble in that and gamble a bit here and there in some financial venture or other that may produce the goods one of these days.        
	They arent working in the way they always have, flat out and with the competition hot on their heels should they let go for a second; they have too much time to spare, but fill it pointlessly so there is not enough left to think about what they would like to do, really need to do, or how to set about it. They are suddenly keen to be helpful to a family that has got by very well until now on their large pay packet and their complete invisibility since they basically lived at work. They are so depressed that they can barely get up in the morning and survive only on memories of the glory days supported by reunion lunches in clubs where they can no longer afford the membership.              
	Not much room for a rash of new famers here, and they wouldnt be able to afford the land anyway. Not much scope for gardeners either, compared with a few years ago when landscape gardening was a highly lucrative business on the back of vastly rich businessmen who wanted instant gardens round their newly acquired country mansions. Plenty of businesses will survive and the youngest or the best may regravitate to an evolving City of London and to a better understanding that theres no such thing as a free lunch. Others may take stock, work out what they really want and go off in other directions including, if they can afford it, into the voluntary sector.        
	Perhaps we may also learn something from the United States of America where academia and business, like academia and politics, are often intertwined. People who have had experience of other lives, and often other countries, may be in a position to inject a new enthusiasm and much needed new ideas into teaching at any and all levels, provided they are prepared to get up in the morning, face their situation head on and look for real alternatives with a different scale of rewards.        
	Our prime minister, meanwhile, continues on his self-perpetuated roll, saving the economy, if not the world, with ghoulish bullishness and the alarmingly rictal smile growing wider as everything that we must suspect he hates crashes to the ground. The power and range of government is growing, fertilized by the toxic certainties of one man in the fruitless soil of economic instability. Gordon clearly doesnt think he is going to be let go for a while yet. As for me, Im just off to buy another lottery ticket.

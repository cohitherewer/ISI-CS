	Too close to US                  
	Sir  The neocolonialism in the Indian backyard is atrocious (In ones own backyard, April 24). The Americans tendency to take everything into their own hands just because they believe they are leading the human race towards progress is casting its long shadow in India. The mingling of half-baked and preconceived notions with intelligence feedbacks from the United States of America is bound to create a socially explosive situation in India. It is a pity that India has compromised its position vis--vis the US. Why should we show solidarity with the US to win its affection? The symbiosis between India and the US might work for some time, but when things go back in favour of the Americans, will the relationship remain the same?           
	Yours faithfully,       
Dwaipayan Adhya, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Ashok Mitra has overlooked some basic facts in In ones own backyard when he asserts that India toes the American line in order to earn rich dividends from a robust relationship wit the US. There might be a lot of criticism against the US invasion of Afghanistan, but it has to be remembered that ever since that event, there has not been a single terrorist attack on any major American city. Terrorists are now too frightened to think of attacking the superpower and are, therefore, venting their wrath on poorer nations like India. The American strategy cannot be said to be completely wrong and may succeed for other nations as well.           
	Mitra decries the US-India alliance just because the US is a capitalist superpower. Had the alliance occurred with a communist country like China or Russia, Mitra would have found it less objectionable. China is more dangerous for India than the US is. The US may have contributed to the creation of the Taliban, but when this faction became a threat to the security of major nations, the US rejected it.           
	Look at China. It continues to supply Pakistan with nuclear material to ensure that India is perpetually under threat. Mitra should drop his anti-US bias and learn to accept reality.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Abhirup Sen, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Ashok Mitra blames the US for global terror. But he fails to elaborate how US involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan is responsible for the terror in India. Terrorism in this country is directly related to the Kashmir issue which extremists from the minority community see as cause for jihad. Afghanistan or not, terror in India would continue as long as the two-nation theory retains its currency among the minority community. There has been no terror attack in the US after 9/11, but extremists go on killing members of their own community in both Iraq and Afghanistan.           
	If the US withdraws from Iraq and Afghanistan, the resultant instability will ruin the countries. Hence, despite its financial constraints, the US continues to be present there. Nowadays, it is no longer possible to occupy a country. Had it been easy, the British, Spanish or Dutch colonialists would not have surrendered their colonies in Asia and Africa. American imperialism is an illusion. How can America conquer Iraq or Afghanistan when it could not conquer Vietnam? Even Indonesia has had to give up East Timor. To paint the US as a villain has been the favourite pastime of armchair Marxists.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Power by land          
	Sir A few questions remain unanswered by the report, In power cut lies the paradox of land versus development (April 27). Only yesterday, we had surplus power and many industrialists had made a beeline to set up their units. Thanks to Mamata Banerjee and her Maoist killer squad, the industrialists have fled, leaving the surplus power for domestic consumption. No new industrial units have been added, there are no reports of a new exodus from Bangladesh. How come the demand for power has skyrocketed overnight? Why did it coincide with the elections?           
	Does anybody remember what egged us on in the last election? I do. Last time, we saw a sudden spate of robberies, and Bengal resembled Bihar in lawlessness. Everywhere residents had to set up their own nightguard teams. After the elections, the brigands vanished. What was the objective? Was it to create a sense of lawlessness, insecurity and resentment against the establishment in order to influence the voting pattern?           
	This years theme seems to be No power to the people. Everything stinks of politics in Bengal; the power sector is not without its share in this unholy mess. Perhaps the old magic can work now as well. Just appeal to the non-attending staff to do their duty and ensure regular repair and maintenance.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Tarun K. Sarkar, Abu Dhabi, UAE

                
	Sir  In the context of power cuts, one wonders how the question  whether some should be coerced to give up their land to address the needs of the rest  can be raised in a functional democracy by the media. Power generation is no philanthropy. It is business where what is spent in the production of goods and services is recovered by selling the product.           
	While the Leftist government never tires of adding surcharges, and making and breaking power ministers, what stops it from buying land in Katwa individually from landowners? Instead of going into the grievances of the landowners  some of which may be quite logical  it is creating an impression that the process is being stalled because of protests by farmers and the Trinamul Congress. The government has never been serious about power supply. Else, it would not have bought Chinese junk for its plants or opposed the nuclear deal.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Chameli Pal, Batanagar 

                
	Hurry up          
	Sir  Ajmal Kasabs trial is becoming a joke. He says he is a minor and the judge has to order that the claim be verified by a team of doctors. Kasab wants the chargesheet in Urdu. He wants books and newspapers. He wants permission to walk around. Let us stop this nonsense and get on with the trial so that judgment can be delivered.          
	We have Afzal Guru happily whiling away his time in jail. Abu Salems case drags on because the Central Bureau of Investigation is in no hurry to speed it up. Maybe, it is waiting to close his file like it did with Ottavio Quattrocchis. In India one can commit any crime and get away with it.           
	Yours faithfully,       
M.M. Kale, Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh

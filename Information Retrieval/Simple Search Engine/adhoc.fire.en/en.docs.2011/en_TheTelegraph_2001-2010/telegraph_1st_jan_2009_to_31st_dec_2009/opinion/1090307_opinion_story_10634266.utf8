The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Trails that retreat into the mind
                                                                                                                 TRAILS THAT RETREAT INTO THE MIND                                  VISUAL ARTS: Somak Ghoshal                                                  
	Although Paramjit Singh is best known for his landscape paintings, it could be misleading to apply this term unqualifiedly to his recently concluded show at CIMA gallery (Shall return again February 6-28). Singh, trained by Sailoz Mookherjea and Biren De at the Delhi Polytechnic, has experimented not only with at least three different techniques in this collection, but also with an equal number of styles. The result is the portrayal of a complex sensibility, each part in continuing dialogue with the others.        
	The most arresting works were made on paper using black charcoal. These depict serpentine paths weaving themselves around dense clusters of trees or brief clear patches in a forest (picture). These are, presumably, landscapes in a purely mimetic sense; but what they end up doing to the eyes of the viewer is quite another matter. Singhs retreating trails look as though awash with moonlight, yet they suggest darkness. Their effect is starkly different, from, say that of the luscious summer days of Constable or even the iconic starry night by van Gogh. Singhs charcoals have a core of mystery in them, and engage the viewer as pure abstractions. The sensation is of looking at inscapes, which have little to convey, except perhaps to spark off a chain of feelings. For just reasons, therefore, these are all untitled works. They are embedded not in the physical world but only in the imagined subconscious of the viewer.        
	The influence of Tagores brooding late style is quite palpable here. Singh has absorbed the poets ability to awaken forms hidden within intense patches of dark. Singh uses the texture of the paper to evoke the eerie co-existence of obscure and distinct forms, not allowing the eye to rest on any point of certainty. This distortion of perspective is also apparent in the more colourful canvases, thickly overlaid with paint to suggest a concentration of energy. Singhs use of impasto and the abandon with which he scatters colours over the canvas reminded me of Jackson Pollock minus the anguish. Singhs oils shimmer with an earthy rawness, with the heat of the sun, the smell of wet earth and of freshly trampled grass. In these works, too, there is a constantly shifting idiom, from clarity to obscurity to mystery. For instance, a canvas brimming with green and lemon yellow has streaks of cerulean blue coursing through it. At first glance, it looks like swampy land, but soon the entire composition seems to be an aerial map of some unidentifiable country.        
	Even the more recognizable scenes, of the gulmohar tree bursting forth with blossom, are shorn of any other visual markers. We do not see the colour of the sky against which the tree sways, or the ground from where it springs. We are left with the visual equivalent of the essence of a gulmohar in full bloom, feeling enlivened by its splendour. Another natural montage, which seems laden with flowers the colour of wild pink, fits Ghulammohammad Sheikhs summary of Singhs works: visual hypnotism. The phrase also recalls the Op Art of Bridget Riley, suggesting a playful curiosity about patterns and an instinctive feel for colours. The magnetism of Singhs work springs from his ability to dissolve the neat boundaries  of colours, shapes, forms  which are sharply distinguished by Riley. The other modernist tradition reflected in Singh is Seurats Pointilism (also an important inspiration for Riley). The major difference between Singhs style from that of Seurats lies, however, in the way each of them approaches the world of forms. Seurat is more interested in the here and now, in live figures  in children crossing footbridges or lovers enjoying riverside picnics. But Singh, deeply influenced by Bhakti and Sufi thought, is temperamentally more spiritual, trying to push the limits of representational art into a mystical terrain.         
	The final set of paintings that Singh showed consisted of works in soft pastel. Although thematically no different from the oils, these were perhaps intended as variations on the use of texture. Unlike the coarseness of charcoal or the density of oil, the mellowness of soft pastel lends a plaintive sadness to the tones. The tremulous colours recall Turner, while the modulation of the waning light that caresses the vast fields deepens the association with van Goghs cornfields. Singh has beautifully incorporated the marriage of Impressionism and Expressionism in his best work.

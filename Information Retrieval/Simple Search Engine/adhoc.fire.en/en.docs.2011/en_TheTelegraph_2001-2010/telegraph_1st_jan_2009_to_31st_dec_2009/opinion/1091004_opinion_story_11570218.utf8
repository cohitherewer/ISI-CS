The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Breaking The Siege within
                                                                                                                 BREAKING THE SIEGE WITHIN                                                          
	A spectre is haunting India  the spectre of Maoism. It is pointless to speculate how far the threat in India today resembles the spectre of communism that, according to the Communist Manifesto, haunted Europe in the mid-19th century. But both the Centre and several state governments know the Maoist threat to be an increasingly lengthening shadow that has darkened the horizon. Of course, Maoism in India is not always distinguishable from outbursts of casteist and other sectarian violence. The latest Maoist outrage in Bihar proves that yet again. Even the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, admitted the other day that the social and economic issues behind the growth of the Maoist threat prompted a section of civil society to lend moral and intellectual support to the rebels. But analysts have done enough to explain the Maoist rebellion; the challenge now is to end it.         
	Successive governments in New Delhi have talked of a two-pronged strategy for the battle. The idea has been to use the States power to crush the rebels and simultaneously tackle the socio-economic deprivations that apparently drive the poor, especially among the tribal and other backward communities, to the rebels fold. It is now generally agreed that the strategy has not worked much. Of late, New Delhi has been debating the option of using the army and even the airforce in the anti-Maoist operations. It is not so much the lack of resources that is to blame for the failure. More important is a lack of political will and consensus on the part of governments and political parties. Petty, partisan interests seem to have overshadowed the larger interests of democracy and the rule of law. It is no secret that different parties have periodically used the Maoists to settle electoral or other scores with their rivals. The rebels, too, took advantage of the deals with the parties to expand their bases. It is useless to expect the police and the administration to succeed in their battle against the Maoists if their political masters are part of the dangerous liaisons. For the Centre and the governments in the states, therefore, it is absolutely crucial to strike at the nexus between the Maoists and the mainstream political parties. Of course, doing that will involve the kind of political will and honesty that neither the governments nor the parties have shown so far.         
	In fact, the parties  and the people they claim to represent  can be an asset in the battle if they realize how the Maoists threaten not just the democratic system but also the very people whose cause they supposedly embrace. It is in the interest of the parties themselves to convince the people that democratic politics is their best hope for getting social and economic justice. The experiences of communist regimes provide incontrovertible evidence of the brutality and insecurity of life under totalitarian systems. Maoism, as a doctrine of violence and regimentation, can only be an enemy of freedom and sanity.

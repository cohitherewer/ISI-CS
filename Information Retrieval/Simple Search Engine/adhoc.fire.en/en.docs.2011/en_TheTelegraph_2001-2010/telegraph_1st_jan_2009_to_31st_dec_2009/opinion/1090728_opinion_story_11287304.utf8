The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | For a few good leaders
                                                                                                                 FOR A FEW GOOD LEADERS                                  MALA FIDE - MALVIKA SINGH                              
	When there isnt a walkout by the Opposition in Parliament, senior leaders waste time demanding that their security be provided by the State. It was truly farcical to hear a debate on this inconsequential issue. The debate was led by Mulayam Singh Yadav, Lalu Prasad and Sharad Yadav. These are men who should, in fact, be arguing against such practices and be more concerned about the protection of citizens from rape, honour killings, dowry deaths, extortion, bribery, corruption, threats and molestations, kidnappings and suchlike that are common occurrences across India. The home minister, P. Chidambaram, who is taking terrorists head on as part of his job, enjoys no special security. These are the symbolic realities that make a sharp distinction between senior Congress leaders with intent and others.        
	The challenge for all leaders is to ensure a safe India for all, and not merely for themselves. That is what Indians want from the men and women they have elected. Times have changed, so have the peoples perceptions about leadership in this country. The last election was a forerunner to what could be in store for the future. People seem to want clean and honest governance without the exclusive trappings that have become part of the elected elite. Rahul Gandhi and the young men and women who opted to stay away from the government to continue working for the party are greatly respected by Indians.        
	Sonia Gandhi set the precedent years ago by stepping aside from prime ministership. She demonstrated that working to change the lives of Indians through the partys programmes was as important as doing similar work through the government. She has single-handedly begun the change within the Congress, and is possibly the most powerful national leader today. You never see or hear her bicker, being abusive, making personal and ridiculous demands, walking out when there is a debate in the House, and so on.                
	Different aura        
	There is an aura of dignity and ethics around her person. She is astute and committed to India. She has embraced the next generation of those who had virulently opposed her leadership  the sons of Jitendra Prasad and Rajesh Pilot and the daughter of P. Sangma. She rises above personal animosity and competitive wrangling, and that is what makes her a national leader.        
	The prime minister, Manmohan Singh, is also a leader of stature who does not stoop to the horrific level of abusive altercations and jockeying for power. He is dignified and upright in his dealings, and firm in his commitments. He never falls prey to the screeching and yelling in Parliament, nor does he respond in a similar shrill tone to the accusations hurled at him. With Lok Sabha TV showing the proceedings, all the senior rabble-rousers stand exposed to the eyes of the public as being self-serving, ineffective representatives. As new faces enter the political fray, India will get a new breed of leaders. This has already begun to take place in the Congress.        
	On this entire Baluchistan affair, the prime minister has faced the crude attacks with a dignified calm. The prime minister may well be thinking and operating out-of-the-box, rather than under the confines of an ineffective bureaucratic framework that has maintained a status quo vis--vis our neighbours for decades. This has created many monsters, which are beginning to overwhelm us. One would imagine that the bureaucrat would work out the modalities to ensure that creative political alternatives are charted out to change the course of history as well as the future. Alas, that is not the case. But, hopefully, fresh approaches and radical ideas emanating from enlightened politicians will force the hand of the intellectually frayed babu.

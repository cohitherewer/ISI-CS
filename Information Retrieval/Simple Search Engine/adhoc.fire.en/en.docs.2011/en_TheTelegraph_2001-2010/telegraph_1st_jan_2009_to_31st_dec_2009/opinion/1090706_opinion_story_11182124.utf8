	Venezuelan president, Hugo Chavez, has declared that any attack on his countrys embassy in Honduras will lead to war between the two nations, and I cant help wishing that the Hondurans would call his bluff.         
	What provoked Chavezs threat was the removal of the president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, who had become Chavezs close ally. Zelaya was arrested by the Honduran military, bundled into a plane and flown to Costa Rica on June 28.        
	Elected for a single term as president in 2006, Zelaya astonished friend and foe alike by turning out to be not the centre-right, business-friendly politician he had seemed. Instead, he began moving steadily to the left in his domestic policies, linking Honduras diplomatically with the other socialist governments in Latin America.        
	There is no doubt that he caused deep annoyance to the conservative elite who have traditionally dominated Honduran affairs, but they made no move to overthrow him. Why bother? The constitution limits Honduran presidents to one four-year term in office, and Zelayas term comes to an end next January.        
	No other leftist candidate was likely to win the presidential election that is due in November: recent opinion polls suggested that Zelayas support nationally is down to around 30 per cent. Even Zelayas own party was unlikely to nominate another leftist as his successor. So all the major political forces were content to wait for the clock to run out on him  until he started trying to change the constitution. Zelayas bright idea was to end the one-term limit so that he could run for president again. Its exactly the same tactic that Chavez has used in Venezuela to prolong his rule indefinitely, and Zelaya believed, rightly or wrongly, that he could make it work for him in Honduras. So he set about organizing a referendum on the subject.                 
	Empty threat        
	Alas, the president of Honduras does not have the right to organize a referendum himself, and the countrys supreme court ordered him to stop. The Congress also condemned the manoeuvre, but Zelaya plowed ahead regardless. When the army, obedient to the courts orders, refused to help Zelaya, he fired the armys commanding general and got his own party activists to distribute the ballot boxes.        
	At that point, the Congress voted to remove Zelaya because of his repeated violations of the constitution and the law and disregard of orders and judgments of the institutions, and the supreme court ordered the army to intervene and arrest the president. It was a mistake to put him on a plane bound for Costa Rica, as that made it look like a traditional Central American coup, but apart from that everything was done within the law. The speaker of the Congress, Roberto Micheletti, who has taken over until the November elections, insists that he has become the interim president as the result of an absolutely legal transition process. Chavez and his Bolivian, Ecuadorian, Nicaraguan and Cuban allies claim its a military coup, and insist that the US is behind it.        
	If Chavez decided to go along too, they would have enough people for a game of celebrity bridge. It might be different if the next Honduran election was years away and there was time for diplomatic and economic pressures to wear the legitimate Honduran authorities down, but its only five months until November 29.        
	So long as the election is conducted properly, other nations will have no grounds to reject its outcome. Zelaya will be constitutionally barred from running again. Unless Chavez actually attacks Honduras. But its a long way from Venezuela and Chavezs forces are not equipped or trained for amphibious assaults or long-range air-drops. You can almost hear the Honduran soldiers muttering Go ahead, make my day.

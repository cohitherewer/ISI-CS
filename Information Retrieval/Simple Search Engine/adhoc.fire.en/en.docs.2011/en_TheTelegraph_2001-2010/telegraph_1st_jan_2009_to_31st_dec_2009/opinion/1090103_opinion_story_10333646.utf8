The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Off the beaten track
                                                                                                               Off the beaten track
          VISUAL ARTS: Soumitra Das                                                  
	What becomes clear in hindsight often remains obscure when viewed in present time. The exhibition titled Beyond Convention (Anant Art Gallery, till January 10) offers a glimpse of contemporary trends in Bengal art. This is a challenging task, given the diversity of practice and media involved. Most of the 20 artists in this exhibition were born in the 1970s, except for Partha Pratim Deb and Janak Jhankar Narzary who were born in 1943. Coming second in terms of seniority are Arunima Choudhury and her husband, Gautam. So the majority of the works is by artists who have not crossed the threshold of 40 yet.        
	Given their relative youth, many of the works look rather fresh, even more so because they are not crowded into a single hall but spread over several rooms, some artists occupying an entire room. This has given the works the breathing space they require, and viewers enough legroom to look at them from a distance. The artists have something else in common  they have all tried to eschew the beaten track in favour of experimentation with various degrees of success. Amritah Sens works in black-and-white are the most striking, relatively small though they are. She has painted and created with crpe paper ambages, literally and metaphorically, for these long-winded roads lead nowhere. Centipede-like men trudge on tirelessly, and there are shades of Duchamps nude descending the staircase. Sen communicates her sense of irony without resorting to far-fetched devices.        
	Images that could have been taken from illustrated dictionaries are arranged to emphasize their disparities in the meticulously painted works of Kazi Nasir. This can be quite exciting visually  in a triptych, the hand in the revolver pose shoots a fighter plane through a terminal screen at a sitting partridge in the third panel. A giraffe passes through a hi-tech security screen (picture). A tiny hot air balloon floats on top, while an antenna, perhaps of a spacecraft, is poised mid-air. Nasirs works are of our time but stand out of time as well.        
	Dorothy Parker had written, Brevity is the soul of lingerie, and the same could be said of the installations of Paula Sengupta and Chhatrapati Dutta. Both have decided to rid their installations of extraneous elements. Narzarys piece too is a terse comment on identity in times of terror. Pankaj Panwars aeroplane is a toy caught in a web of irony. However, Tarun Maity clutters his piece with too many objects. Chandan Bhandaris books and pens and mice are the crudest of all the exhibits.        
	Prabhat Basus William De Kooning-like feral women gobble up crocodiles, or are engrossed in machinations. He is no misogynist, just a man with a sense of humour. The most mature works are those of Arunima Choudhury and Partha Pratim Deb. They can impress without wasting much paint.

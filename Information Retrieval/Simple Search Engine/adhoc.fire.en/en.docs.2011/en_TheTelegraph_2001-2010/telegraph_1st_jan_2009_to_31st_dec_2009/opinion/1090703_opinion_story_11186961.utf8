	The future of the game is here      
	Unruly Times (Rupa, Rs 195) by Prashant Bhawalkar is a delightful book that examines the weighty issue of post-colonial writers crafty utilization of identity politics with a rare, light touch. Unruly Times, in fact, is also an amalgamation of several satirical queries concerning the Indian novel in English. Dushyant, the advertising-copywriter protagonist, is an aspiring novelist. Realizing that he can only attract the interest of publishers if he were to write something Indian, he goes about the task in earnest, only to discover that he has been trapped in some sort of a literary vicious cycle. When he dishes out something that he likes, he is told that the book isnt Indian enough and vice versa. Bhawalkar skilfully explores other ancillary themes that are equally relevant: a writers responsibilities in a literary age demanding instant appeasement as well as the writer-subject relationship. What makes the analysis refreshing is the use of a style that is cheeky and engaging.                          
	The future of cricket: The rise of Twenty20 (Orient, Rs 295) by John Buchanan provides futuristic insights into cricket. Expectedly, there is a prophetic quality about Buchanans tone as he goes about forecasting what lies in store. The book also includes a comprehensive account of the first IPL tournament, and of the strategies that went into making the event a sporting and commercial success. Buchanan deserves credit for weaving in issues that are not strictly related to the game: for instance, the chapters on the cheergirls and Sourav Ganguly are instructive to understand how some foreign coaches perceive India, its sporting culture and its icons. Buchanan succeeds in identifying the business imperatives that have emerged as changemakers. But his theory that all three forms of cricket can coexist with necessary changes is unlikely to find many takers.                        
	The Penguin CNBC-TV18 Business Yearbook 2009 (Rs 399) has been compiled and edited by Derek O Brien. It is a comprehensive dossier on Indian business, economics and industry, and is padded with useful information about critical business sectors in the domestic economy. There is also a world section with details of the major global economies. While students will enjoy the bit about the history of Indian and world business from ancient times, experts and professionals might be interested in the analyses of the current economic downturn and the merits of Barack Obamas stimulus package, which is supposed to help America tide over the crisis.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Presidency: future tense
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        PRESIDENCY: FUTURE TENSE                          - Mere making of a university is no solution					 					      Sukanta Chaudhuri                                                      
	University status for Presidency College has hit banner headlines  a rare recognition for an academic institution. The motive force, ultimately, is middle-class Bengali sentiment for a cultural icon. Presidency ranks with Rabindranath and Satyajit  hence the strained efforts to flaunt its links with those stalwarts.         
	This is not to deny the colleges unique and sustained role in Bengals education. I myself owe it a profound debt from three years as a student and 19 as a teacher there. But now that the dream is turning real, we need to weigh the prospects soberly.         
	Presidencys chief lasting assets are its treasure-laden library and selectively well-endowed laboratories. In most other respects its infrastructure, though exceptional for a college, are inadequate for a university. The land and buildings cannot possibly suffice: a new campus is imperative, with the funds to stock and people it. Thereby hang several depressing tales.        
	One relates to staffing. Presidency is served by a floating body of government college teachers. Their Presidency posting is a matter of accident. A university will call for site-specific recruitment on a different pattern. Present teachers may apply for berths, but cannot demand them. The whole process raises complex procedural and even legal issues, not to mention pressure from the powerful teachers lobby. This may be the biggest roadblock to a smooth transition, which mere money or goodwill cannot remove.         
	A partial model is offered by the upgrading of Bengal Engineering College, Shibpur. But as one of the very few state-run engineering colleges, Shibpur had a more singular status vis-a-vis both the government and Calcutta University. It also had vastly more land and infrastructure. Presidency will have to steer a trickier course.               
	The structural problems are compounded by intangible ones which have never been dispassionately assessed. It is simply untrue to say that every teacher at Presidency in pre-Left days was a worthy scholar: there were always some unfit to teach anywhere. The balance was more than redressed by a core staff (largely, though not always, protected from transfer) with learning and research skills unknown in undergraduate colleges elsewhere, and a somewhat higher level of funding. The system was shored up by a network of official privilege and sentimental loyalty that evoked deep resentment in those outside the charmed circle.         
	That resentment found potent political expression once the Left Front came to power. The transfer policy was intensively applied to bring to the college (a) a few exceptional scholars who had earlier not found favour; (b) some sincere and competent teachers who made best use of the opportunity; and (c) a band of apparatchiks who virtually ran the college for a decade, almost designedly rubbishing its academic needs. Their efforts culminated in a great symbolic drive to abolish admission tests. The move failed, but vitiated and demoralized college life for years. This was when Professor Atin Gun was manhandled in the staff room, and the venerable Professor Amal Raychaudhuri accused of admitting students against bribes.        
	Presidency was sunk in these self-destructive broils just when the academic scenario was changing radically. It was the most intensive phase of founding and consolidating new universities in India: often with serious defects, but introducing new patterns and purposes that Presidency simply passed by.         
	What did it thereby lose out on? First, the confidence of its serious teachers and, still more crucially, its potential future teachers. The new universities promised more opportunities and less bureaucracy (on which more below); so, as never before, did non-government colleges. Recruitment to the Government Educational Service has undeniably declined in recent times. Outstanding Presidency alumni no longer think of returning to teach there, and probably could not find berths if they tried. To regain that confidence is no easy task: in the global era, it is hard enough to retain them in India, let alone West Bengal.         
	This loss of morale also affected infrastructural reform. The efforts of Professor Subrata Datta ensured that at Presidency, even Arts teachers learnt about computers before their compatriots elsewhere; but this was not backed up by upgrading the infrastructure as a whole.         
	The root problem was, and remains, what we might call mental infrastructure: the mindsets and procedures controlling planning and expenditure. Indias education system is hag-ridden by bureaucracy. Even within this prison, the government college occupies a special chamber of little-ease. When I left Presidency in 1991, the principals financial power in many vital matters was capped at Rs.2,000. As professor-in-charge of the library, I once obtained Rs 8 lakh to buy books but lacked Rs.10 for a pot of glue to label them. The problem is not financial but systemic.         
	Anecdotes can trivialize, but only by their means can I convey the endemic problems and frustrations of the milieu. In my 19 years at Presidency, I attended just two international conferences. Obtaining the clearances took 54 and 37 visits respectively to Writers Buildings. Those travelling without clearance were reprimanded and humiliated, threatened with criminal action, or forced to conceal academic distinctions that should be proudly announced. Some rules have now been relaxed, but new curbs put in their place. And needless to say, the problems are multiplied by the clerical incompetence of the secretariat.         
	Our government colleges are still effectively governed by the Bengal Education Code of 1930, indeed the 19th-century dispensation underlying it: predating the jet plane, the electronic text, information technology, and the concept of collective project-based research. These are the most important of countless innovations that have transformed the academic as most other sectors of life. Their blessings may not be unmixed, but they are radical; more crucially, they are non-negotiable. Some recent teachers at Presidency have made heroic efforts to introduce them, but working against the grain of the system. Their labours have not had proportionate reward.               
	No institution can mark time: it either advances or declines. By not changing sufficiently in relation to its milieu  which includes other premier institutions in the state  Presidency has effectively fallen back, in ways that cannot be gainsaid by invoking its hallowed traditions. It has a daunting deficit to make good.         
	University status presents an opportunity. It needs hardcore plans and decisions to back up what is, as yet, no more than a political fiat. I repeat that the search for the right teachers poses the greatest challenge. Guest lecturers and eminent visitors are the icing on the cake: Presidency University must stand or fall by the strength of its core, tenured staff. This is an asset that the government is loath to dispense, even while officials proliferate at the secretariat. Incredibly, the staff strength at Presidency was actually reduced with the introduction of full postgraduate teaching. Many colleges across the land function with two, or one, or no full-time teacher in an Honours department.         
	Let me close with that reminder of the wider picture: for we must not repeat the folly of thinking that Presidency can flourish by isolating itself from the general scene. (This is not a plea to make it an affiliating university.) Along with many hostile forces, the mush and snobbery of its loyal alumni have played no small part in drawing affliction upon the college. Presidency University can only prosper in interaction with other institutions; above all, as crowning a respectable system of universal schooling that seems no part of the state agenda. A well-staffed Presidency will work little good if there continue to be 60,000 missing teachers in primary schools for poor children. Till those schools provide a student catchment across social divides, elite downstream institutions can only survive by diverting one anothers waters. That thought should temper the current bhadralok elation over Presidency.

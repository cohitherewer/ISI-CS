The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | ploy to talk
                                                                                                                 PLOY TO TALK                                                    
	Indians love storms in teacups. The hot air emanating from sections of the Congress and from some pundits of Indo-Pak relations over the prime ministers mention of Baluchistan in the Indo-Pak joint statement is a product of one such storm. Baluchistan was mentioned in the context of Manmohan Singhs insistence that those who were responsible for the violence in Mumbai in November last year be brought to justice. While reassuring Mr Singh on this score, the Pakistan premier, Yousaf Raza Gilani, made the point that there were some problems in Baluchistan. Mr Singh said that dialogue was the only way forward. This, many people allege, is a betrayal of Indias position. The prime minister, they maintain, should have denied any involvement on Indias part in the events in Baluchistan. Instead of doing this, the prime minister opened up the issue for discussion and thus conceded ground to Pakistan. The official Indian position has always been that neither India nor any Indian agency has anything to do with whatever is happening in Baluchistan. The official Indian version is thus somewhat on a par with the official Pakistani position on violence in Kashmir.        
	Unfortunately, the intent and nature of Mr Singhs statement have been misunderstood even by some of his own partymen. The misunderstanding derives from a failure to appreciate the fundamentals of conducting a negotiation. Any such process, if it is to yield results, involves an element of reciprocity. Demands are put forward and concessions are made: parties sitting around a negotiating table make these gestures as ploys. Mr Singhs mention of Baluchistan has to be seen in this context. If India, as the establishment believes, is innocent of any involvement in the largest province of Pakistan that is under the shadow of insurgency since 2004, then Mr Singh has given away nothing. But he has secured an assurance from his Pakistani counterpart that perpetrators of terror on Indian soil will be dealt with. If, on the other hand, there is some truth in the allegations being made against India, then Mr Singh has perhaps done the right thing by joining the battle against terrorism. It cannot be anybodys position that Pakistan-instigated violence in Kashmir is bad but violence in Baluchistan provoked by India is good. Mr Singh has, in fact, entered a win-win situation.

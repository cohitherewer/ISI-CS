    A person riding a cycle was hit by a tractor and died. The legal representatives of the victim claimed compensation from the owner of the tractor before the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal. The insurance company pleaded that since the driver of the tractor did not possess a valid licence, it was not liable to pay insurance to the owner of the tractor. When the High Court of Uttarakhand dismissed the owner rsquo;s appeal against the insurance company, he took the case to the Supreme Court. The apex court held that since   the driver had a learner rsquo;s licence, which had expired and as there was no provision for automatic renewal of a driver rsquo;s licence, the driver could not be considered as holding a valid licence. Hence the insurance company was not bound to reimburse the compensation to the owner. (Bhuwan Singh vs Oriental Insurance Ltd.)     Troubled assets
    A public servant was convicted under the Prevention of Corruption Act for possessing assets disproportionate to his income. The special judge directed some of his assets to be sold in a public auction and the sale proceeds to go to the state. The accused appealed before the Andhra Pradesh High Court but died during pendency of the appeal. His representatives submitted that they were sentimentally attached to some of the assets like the house and wanted to buy the house before it was put on auction. The Supreme Court did not allow that but permitted the legal heirs to participate in the auction and buy the property. (N. Naveen Kumar amp; others vs State of A.P.)     Crime of passion
    A man suspected his wife of infidelity. In the course of a quarrel he hit her in the abdomen, which led to her death. He was convicted of murder by the sessions judge in Srikalulam. The accused appealed before the Andhra Pradesh High Court, which upheld the conviction. Subsequently, he appealed before the Supreme Court, which held that considering that it was a sudden quarrel and death occurred on account of a single blow, the accused should be convicted of culpable homicide not amounting to murder.

                                                                                                                 HARD LANDING                                                    
	Land, unlike capital or labour, is finite. In West Bengal, it is more scarce than in other states. Economic progress in the state is therefore all about the efficient use of land. Beyond the instant reactions to the scrapping of the IT hub in Rajarhat, there is a need for the state government and the society at large to revisit the land issue. If some major IT companies such as Wipro and Infosys are forced to drop their plans for fresh investments because of the governments bungling of the proposed IT hub, it will be sad for a state that has been struggling to attract investors. But the setback could be turned into an opportunity to rethink the land question in a new light. Unfortunately, the handling of land issues is overshadowed in West Bengal both by partisan politics and by the absence of an efficient delivery system. The land transfers for the IT hub may have been mired in shady deals and in the involvement of a criminal-politician nexus. No doubt all such transfers should be transparent, and all transgressions dealt with in accordance with the law.         
	But the fiasco over the IT hub should now set the stage for getting real on more substantive issues. The most important of these relates to the best way of getting land for industries and public utility projects. There are two options  acquisition of land by the government and direct purchase of land from its owners determined by market forces. In Singur, the government adopted the first method and was foiled by its political rivals. Stung by the Singur failure, the government went for the second option at Rajarhat, which too has now come to nought. Clearly, the two attempts suggest that the first option is a better one since it offers better justice to those who have lost their land and leaves less room for land sharks and their accomplices to use force and other unfair means. But the terms for the acquisition of land by the government need to be updated, as the government is known to acquire land at much lower rates than what the market offers. Even if the buying and selling of land is left to the market, the State should retain a role for itself. In fact, the State should have the primary role in acquiring and developing land for infrastructure projects, especially the construction of the expressways.        
	It is equally important to ask how much land an industry should need. Especially in a land-scarce state like West Bengal, it is crucial to assess the economic returns from each acre of land. Leaders of industries, both in manufacturing and in the services, should also ask themselves if they need to rethink their land requirements. There is a strong case for vertical, rather than horizontal, expansion of land for future projects in West Bengal. Changing land-use patterns involves hard choices and West Bengal must be prepared to bear the pain that accompanies such transitions.

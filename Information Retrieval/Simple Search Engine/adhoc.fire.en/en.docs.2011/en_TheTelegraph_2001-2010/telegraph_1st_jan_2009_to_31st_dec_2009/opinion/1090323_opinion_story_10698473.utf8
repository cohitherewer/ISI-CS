	Young man lost                  
	Sir  People like Varun Gandhi feel they can play with the emotions of the people with rabble-rousing speeches and attempts to spread hatred (In a hurry, the other Gandhi, March 19). The younger Gandhi did it aggressively in order to prove his loyalty to the Bharatiya Janata Party. What he did not bargain for were the murmurs of dissent among his partymen. His vitriolic speeches are reminiscent of the Bahujan Samaj Party campaigns in its early days. Such rhetoric is bad for India because it divides an already fragmented society. If the BJP wants to make a serious bid for power, it must cancel the candidacy of politicians such as Varun Gandhi, who are exploiting divisions in society to further their political career.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Ambar Mallick, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Instructions from the Election Commission for the filing of a criminal case against Varun Gandhi followed by the transfer of top district officials are welcome steps. This should be a lesson for our roadshow heroes, who often make inflammatory speeches with a communal touch. The bureaucratic shuffle shows the EC is not taking matters lightly. Leaders have to show restraint in their election speeches and avoid making personal attacks or commenting on sensitive issues.           
	Yours faithfully,       
R. Sekar, Visakhapatnam 

                
	Sir  Varun Gandhis speech actually shows his partys desperation. Now that the elections are here, the BJP has gone back to its communal rhetoric. The people of this country have to understand the partys vested interest in promoting communalism. Varun Gandhis speech reflected the BJPs carefully thought-out strategy. He only took it a step further. This is not the first time such speeches have been made. Whenever elections are close, the BJP tries its best to woo people this way.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Manjunath R. Goudar, Dharwad 

                
	Sir  It is now more than three decades since the Gandhi surname became synonymous with a dynasty and its political ambitions. The present claimants to the famous surname have descended from Feroze Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru. Varun Gandhi has conveniently suppressed part of his name  Feroze. He claims he is a proud Gandhi, Indian and Hindu. He is an Indian, but he cannot claim to be a Hindu as his grandfathers side was Parsi. If he wishes to claim his grandfathers surname, to which he has every right, he ceases to be a Hindu. Should he not decide on his own identity before he bashes non-Hindus?          
	Yours faithfully,       
Susanta Ghosh, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  It is ironic that Maneka Gandhi should be fighting on the behalf of animals when her son can only think of hatred (Varun in communal comment storm, March 17). Even at the height of his powers, Sanjay Gandhi never initiated a hate campaign against another community. In a country where half the population is under 45 years and when the nation is eagerly waiting for a young leader to take charge, it is most unfortunate to see young people like Varun Gandhi preaching violence. Such campaigns are routine for leaders like Narendra Modi, and they point to the BJPs medieval mindset. Its hold on the minds of the young is pernicious. Varun Gandhi, who is said to love poetry, is a shining example of this.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad 

                
	Placing the police          
	Sir  It is sad that not all in the Calcutta Police support the proposal for extending the jurisdiction of the force to Behala, Jadavpur and other areas that have long come under the purview of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (State and city cops turf duel spills out, March 15). The step would have made for good governance. Unlike Navi Mumbai and Thane, Behala or Thakurpukur are contiguous to the city, so there is no question of the Calcutta Police biting off more than it can chew. There would certainly be augmentation of the infrastructure, including additional employment of police personnel. There is also no question of treating these added police stations as mere outposts of the Calcutta Police.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Pijush Banerjee, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  It is incorrect to draw parallels between Salt Lake and Navi Mumbai or Thane. Both are far from Mumbai. The whole of Greater Mumbai, which excludes Thane and Navi Mumbai, is policed by the Mumbai police alone. Salt Lake, Lake Town, Baranagar, Dum Dum, Tiljala, Kasba, Jadavpur, Garia, Behala and Thakurpukur are today integral parts of Calcutta. They have the same urban characteristics, and people have to pass through them constantly. This includes VIPs with special security. The Calcutta Police ought to keep a watch on this entire area. Such re-organization of jurisdiction ought to have taken place much earlier.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Suman S. Dasgupta, Calcutta

	Set an example                   
	Sir  Sharad Pawar and Farooq Abdullah have expressed concerns over the difficulties faced by members of parliament while travelling economy class (On economy avenue, Sept 12). By coming up with such arguments they have only confirmed the fact that they are parts of a parasitical class that spends large amounts of public money for personal needs, which want curtailing. We know that they enjoy free electricity, telephones and vehicles, for which the government pays. They also indulge in other practices such as bribery, which are hidden from the public eye, but which drain the public exchequer nonetheless. It needs to be seen whether the measures suggested by the finance minister, Pranab Mukherjee, bring any real and long-lasting change, or they are just meant to pacify the people for the time being.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Ujjwal Karmakar, Malda 

                
	Sir  Pranab Mukherjee, Praful Patel and Mamata Banerjee need to be applauded for adopting austerity measures (Austerity axe falls on MP hike, Sept 13). However, I would rather have Banerjee travelling by trains too. That way she would be able to see the conditions of the compartments and stations for herself, and take steps to improve them. The prime minister and Sonia Gandhi should also consider cutting down the size of Congress state ministries to 15 per cent of their current strength. This would result in huge amounts being saved which could be utilized for public welfare.          
	Yours faithfully,      
M.M. Kale, Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh 

                
	Sir  The austerities recommended by the finance minister for VIPs are steps in the right direction. As public servants, they must adopt these measures at all times, and not just during the current period. Sharad Pawar and Farooq Abdullah have complained that tall and plump ministers do not feel comfortable in the economy class of fliers. Do ordinary tall or plump people not travel economy class? The reason why the government wants the dignitaries to travel by this class is to assure the people, and demonstrate that the ministers are one of them.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  When the real issue raised by Where to stay (Sept 10) relates to the unwillingness of MPs to give up their bungalows even after their tenure in office is over, thus creating scarcity, it is not right, as the editorial does, to question an individuals freedom to live on his own terms. S.M. Krishna and Shashi Tharoor have been conducting official business from the five-star hotels where they have been staying, and not wasting public funds. If one can fund ones own accommodation, it is not the business of other people to question it.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Bhaskar Majumdar, Kuwait 

                
	Sir  A large portion of the electorate in India is not financially well-off. One wonders whether elected ministers such as S.M. Krishna and Shashi Tharoor, used to five-star comforts, would be able to do full justice to the problems that the people of India face. Ministers should set an example of simple living by their own initiative. Mamata Banerjee has been known to practice austerity all along, and even after being inducted as the railways minister, she has not organized lavish lunch meets. Other ministers should take a leaf out of her book.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

                
	Tough life          
	Sir  In Lessons not learnt (Sept 11), Malvika Singh is exuberant about the recent changes Kapil Sibal has brought about in the education system of the Central Board of Secondary Education schools. But which change was she elated about  the introduction of extra-curricular activities and other subjects such as arts, photography, theatre and music, or making the Class XI qualifying examinations optional?          
	It is beyond doubt that the present system of rote-learning is old-fashioned and out of sync with the expanding market. Yet one should remember that it is the present rigorous system of education in Indian schools and colleges which makes the hard-working students of the country successful professionals, who are often the best among their counterparts in the world. This is one of the major reasons why India is witness to a massive brain-drain. Developed nations prefer Indian students as they are zealous, enthusiastic and committed. They acquire these qualities as a result of the extreme pressure they are put under since childhood. Of course, there are some bitter fallouts of this system like suicides, but that is due not so much to the faulty education as to the lack of proper teachers and guidance for some students.           
	If the present rigid examination system is diluted, India would see a marked decline in the students standards. In professional and technical arenas, it is not general knowledge, literature or pursuit of sports that make a person the best. An academically oriented mindset is a prerequisite in such fields and to acquire it, a student should be subjected to the rigours of academics and also encouraged to think out-of-the-box, as Singh says. Of course, students should be allowed to choose the subjects they desire. But without strict evaluation, we would see students thriving only in music and dance classes. What good would that do to an emerging India?           
	Yours faithfully,      
Abhirup Sen, Calcutta

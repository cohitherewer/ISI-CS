	In a recent entry in his blog on Guardianunlimited, Jonathan Jones, the art critic, laments the passing of an era when art was a craft. This elegy for a lost age is inspired by Joness experience of writing about the Italian Renaissance because writing can be a form of time travel. Looking at the sublime creations of Shreyasi Chatterjee at her first solo exhibition, Through the Eye of a Needle (CIMA, till April 18), I remembered Joness phrase, thinking how Chatterjees art itself turns into a journey in time at many levels.        
	In Chatterjees case, this voyaging out involves not only a return to the past, but also living in the thick of the moment and in anticipation of the future. Her use of stitches harks back to indigenous traditions of embroidery employed in nakshikantha  originally, patchwork quilts exquisitely decorated with delicate threadwork. This craft is now commonly used on saris, as well as on other fabrics. Chatterjee, however, appropriates this process to suit her unique mlange of shapes and colours. The thread and needle take on many roles in her hand  becoming pencil or paintbrush  other than their usual function of mending tears or putting tattered pieces of cloth together. Similarly, textiles either exist as pure textiles or else they become something unfamiliar. Pieces cut out of saris cohere to form eyes and lips in Breaking it up  I, or simply exist as cloth in Knot, Ghunghat and Chunni. This shift in register creates a sense of puzzlement: the viewer has to constantly negotiate with every layer of the riddle.         
	The various idioms of domestic life, sense impressions and an acute awareness of the history of modern art place Chatterjees work in an unmistakably contemporary frame. As this show goes on in Calcutta, a British artist, Rosalind Wyatt, who works with thread and needle as well, is also showing in London. Wyatts The Stitched Lives of Others is, however, a rather different body of work from Chatterjees, though impelled by a common urge to record the vestiges of time. Tracey Emin and Louise Bourgeois have used this medium to create brilliantly avant-garde work, though the sense of fading time and memory have also remained equally crucial to their art.        
	In Chatterjees work, too, the sense of time is inscribed in her chosen media, in the intimate, yet painstaking, association of thread, needle, scissors, textile, paint, paper and the human hand rescuing the relics of everyday life from the fleeting memory of the eye. Even while holding up a mirror to the passing moment, Chatterjees art becomes a personal journal of thoughts and observations. The distinct mark of her personality is also imprinted in her habitual doodling, often as preamble to the larger works, especially to the pen-and-ink portraits that she makes. However, the amorphous faces with a cubist flavour, though attractive as thought games, are not as compelling as the solitary cotyledon or the menacing edge of Cabbage-like and Away scarf. The last two reminded me of some of Anish Kapoors installed shapes, although in a different scale and in two dimensions.        
	With its seeming formlessness, the fragility of its textures and apparent incoherence, Chatterjees work also allows the viewer to explore its structures in his own terms. For the viewer, this quest for meaning involves looking into his own history of emotions; only then can he begin to inhabit these time-space mosaics. In The Divide (206 cm x 148.5 cm), an area teeming with the refuse of life is broken into two by a dirty green piece of fabric suggesting a ditch. The perspective becomes artfully skewed as vertical and horizontal planes of vision are juxtaposed. This superimposition opens out the space on the canvas in optically challenging ways. The eye has to constantly realign itself with each bit of the canvas to hold together the interplay of multiple dimensions. But beyond this structural ingenuity, what stays with the viewer is the luminous golden glow of the sky that fills the fetid air with a murmur of poetry. The sky looms like an ethereal mystery, bringing to mind broken lands, divided terrain, Bengal broken into epaar and opaar Bangla.        
	In the same way, the mind plays peculiar tricks on the eye as one looks at the bits of handwoven saris stitched into canvas: the various parts of a sari  its parh (the border) and the jomi (the body, also literally, land)  become aides to memory. The eye notes the sinuous transformation of cloth into land, tapestry into topology, and embroidered motifs into the sophisticated diction of art. There is a touching coexistence of innocence and experience, of first impressions and mature reflections, in Chatterjees artistry. The immense diptych, Toposcape, resounds like a symphony in blue, interlacing open vistas with enclosed nooks. The sea becomes a mirror for the sky, the sky reflects the sea, while rocks and plants float about. The tiny balcony, with its flowing curtains, remains the only fixed mark around which this entire arrangement of colours and forms is anchored.        
	Chatterjees art tempts the eye to seek out hidden patterns (as in the crowded mesh of life in The Holy Dip series), to look for the whole in the parts (in the miniature Gift Wrappers series), and to relate to the mysteries of scale (OK Tata). But the intrinsic magic of her work is best captured in the Flotsam Jetsam series (picture). Here, the natural world exists on the threshold separating the abstract from the figurative. In this restless continuum, enigmatic forms come into, and go out of, focus  as if the invisible rhythms of life are struggling to make themselves visible.

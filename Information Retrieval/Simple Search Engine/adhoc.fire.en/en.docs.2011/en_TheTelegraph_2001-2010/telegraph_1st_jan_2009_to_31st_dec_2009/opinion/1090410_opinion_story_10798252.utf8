	LIVING TO TELL THE TALE  
	Under two dictators: Prisoner of Stalin and Hitler By Margarete Buber- Neumann, Pimlico, 8.99  
	This is a chilling memoir of a woman who survived Hitlers concentration camps and Stalins gulag. Margarete Buber-Neumann was a member of the German communist party in the 1930s. She and her husband were forced to flee Germany with the coming of the Nazi rule. Even as loyal communists they were not safe in Stalins Russia. She was arrested by the secret police in 1938 and sent off to the Central Asian concentration and slave-labour camp of Karaganda. She had to suffer this for two years. In 1940, she was extradited to Germany in the wake of the Nazi-Soviet pact. The Gestapo imprisoned her in the Nazi concentration and death camp for women, Ravensbruck. This memoir describes her life and what she saw in the two camps. Her recollections are both moving and shocking. Her powers of recall and observation are dispassionate and clear. It is a rare testament of one of the most terrible periods of human history.                          
	NEW VENTURE   
	The cultures of history in early modern India: Persianization and Mughal culture in Bengal By Kumkum Chatterjee, Oxford, Rs 795  
	Indian culture is supposed to pay scant regard to the writing and preservation of history. Kumkum Chatterjees scholarly monograph runs counter to this conventional wisdom. She analyses the nature and function of history-writing in India in the 17th and 18th centuries. Her focus is on the traditions of history writing in Bengal in the above periods and as Bengal moved into colonial rule. This book is a significant intervention in the intellectual history of early modern India. It is a book on a subject on which very little has been written. Chatterjees research in primary and secondary sources is extensive and she explores the relationship between regional and vernacular traditions with the Islamicate and Persianized culture that emanated from the Mughal court and its successor in Bengal. This is a specialists book and it is bound to create debate among scholars of the period.                             
	SCHOLARLY MEDITATIONS   
	The origins of yoga and tantra:Indic religions to the thirteenth century By Geoffrey Samuel, Cambridge, Rs 995  
	Forms of meditation, of which yoga and tantra are two, have now conquered the world through what has come to be called soft power. Both have their origins in two important Indian religions  Hinduism and Buddhism. The author refers to these religions and Jainism as Indic religions. The bulk of this book deals with the traditions of renunciation in early Hinduism and the early growth of Buddhism and Jainism. The period he covers is huge  from fourth century BC to 12th century AD. Between the fourth and second centuries BC, yogic and meditational techniques were conceived and developed. The period between the fifth and 12th centuries AD saw the growth of tantric practices. The author looks at the relationship between these practices and yoga to make sense of them and the rituals associated with tantra and yoga. This is a scholarly contribution to a field that has too many simplified surveys.

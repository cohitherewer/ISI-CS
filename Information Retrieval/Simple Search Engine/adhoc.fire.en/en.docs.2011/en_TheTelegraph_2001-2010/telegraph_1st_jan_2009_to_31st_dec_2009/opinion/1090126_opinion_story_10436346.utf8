                                                                                                                 CONSTRAINTS OF OFFICE                          - Those crucial words that went missing from Obamas speech        The thin edge - Ruchir Joshi                          Within bounds                                              
	Though I doubt Ill ever see it, I do look forward to the gradual, peaceful, disappearance of the nation state from this planet. Its a bit like wanting to see the end of the petrol-fuelled motor vehicle, the shutting down of the dirty energy of coal, the genuine abolition of dowry and the kind of laws that allow only males to inherit wealth and property, the total extinction of nuclear weapons  that sort of thing. The fact that it is currently unavoidable that humans organize and divide themselves according to notions of region and race doesnt mean it always has to be so. There will emerge alternatives which will one day lead to humankind looking at relics of national flags and seals and wondering about their ancestors  us  in the same way we now scratch our heads and wonder about our forebearers who believed the earth was flat, who failed to realize that the sun didnt actually revolve around the earth.        
	For now, though, we are quagmired in these archaic ideas of country, borders, national integrity and patriotism, and every national holiday attached to the republic and independence obliges us to re-examine the whole project. This Republic Day, we are in the newly-cast shadow of one of the greatest nation-trumpeting shows on earth, and, that too one of the greatest ever editions of that show: Nu US Prez, feat. Bro O.               
	Before saying anything else, let me say this out loud and clear: watching That Speech, I was moved. I was elated. I couldnt stop fizzing like a current between hope and huge, delicious schadenfreude; after the most minimalist of nods towards his predecessors service to the country, the tight verbal slaps on the faces of this departing evil cabal came measured and rhythmic and beautiful. By the end of Barack Obamas speech, George W. Bush was in the wheelchair as well, sitting more or less on Dick Cheneys lap as ruthless nurses wheeled the two of them into the hospice of history. There is no quick and easy way to counterbalance the damage eight years of Bush/Cheney have done to the world, but as a pre-funeral oration those first twenty minutes of Obamas presidency will go down in time as one of the greatest political speeches ever. With massive civility and eloquence  two qualities so sorely missing around Pennsylvania Avenue in recent times  what Barack Obama said to Bush and his cohorts was: You are now dead. It may take us a while to bury you, to safely get rid of your toxic remains, but you are, as of now, utterly and completely dead.        
	On this day we gather because we have chosen hope over fearon this day we come to proclaim an end to thefalse promises, the worn-out dogmas that for far too long have strangled our politics. Cut to GWBs face, his eyes narrowing, wondering if the guys talking about him. We must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off and begin again the work of re-making America. Shot of Hillary C, and in the frame behind her Bush Senior, a man whos having no problem getting it. What the cynics fail to understand is that the ground has shifted beneath them. And, even more bluntly, we will do our business in the light of day for only then can we restore the vital trust between the people and our government.         
	Whether written by a 27-year-old or the 47-year-old delivering it, the speech was a multi-level, contrapuntal masterpiece. There was the ringing message of hope, of an immediate change of direction, that ran across the thing; there were the straight slaps at the Bushwhackers and then there were subtler kicks as well. We will restore science to its rightful place (end of the Christian fundamentalist hijack of government health and education policies); there was the reference to neighbours taking in people when the levees break (as during Hurricane Katrina, because the Bush government couldnt have cared less); in the list of battlefields where Americans had sacrificed their lives for us, ranging from Gettysburg to Normandy to Khe Sahn, there was pointedly no mention of Iraq or Baghdad (this is a pointless war, that is not being fought for us); however, American soldiers currently serving were not forgotten but brought in at a later point, for the example of service that they uphold. Everyones favourite line in the speech should be an object lesson to our politicians who pushed through draconian laws in the mass knee-jerk post 26/11: We reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals and, possibly for the first time, Hindus and, far more courageously, non-believers made an appearance in a US presidents inaugural address in the passage about Americas patchwork heritage.         
	It sticks in my craw whenever anybody, especially an American, talks about leading the world, but one of the best moments of slappage came when the man simply said we are ready to lead again. I suspended my distaste for once because this was a sentence aimed straight at the Failed Cowboy sitting a few feet behind the speaker; even the language-challeged Dubya couldnt miss that this one was marked special delivery to himself, him with his eight-year-long mumble-rant of showin liddershup, and therein lay the greatest of satisfactions.         
	Yes, it was a rocking speech, a straight rocket into the heart of the darkness that has ruled America and raped the world for nearly a decade. Yes, it was baad, in the sense that black people use the word to mean the opposite, in that this man has undoubtedly the most beautiful voice of any American President (compare it to JFKs nasal Boston-whine, Reagans hyena laugh or Bill Clintons con mans drawl) and he knows what to do with it and how not to overdo it. Yes, it was, in most part, like a huge, generous rainstorm on a drought-blasted wasteland. Yes, its been a long time coming, and I am among many who are glad that this day and this man and these words have finally come.         
	But.         
	There was a small patch of cracked earth that didnt get any water. There were a few important words missing from President Obamas address. No doubt there are already several lines of defence being run by the new administration on the absence in the speech of any specific mention of the Israel-Palestine conflict, at least two of them probably go like this: 1. This was an inaugural address, not an encyclopaedic exposition of the mans intended policies and actions, 2. For all his command over rhetoric, no-drama Obama didnt want to get any backs up in what will surely be his trickiest foreign policy challenge, but be sure he will act when the time is right, which will be very soon. To both the answer is, Nope, that doesnt wash.               
	In this, a small change in one paragraph would perhaps have been sufficient. Where Obama said the following: and for those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents, we say to you now that our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken; you cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you. What he should have said was: and for those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror, we say to you now that our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken; you cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you. And to those who slaughter innocents, even if they be our allies, we say the time has come for you to change your ways, we will stand by your right to freedom but we will stand not by your crimes. Yes, it would have caused a seismic shock in Tel Aviv, and possibly smaller earthquakes in Rahm Emanuel and Hillary Clinton, but it would have completed in full the display of courage and honesty for which Obama was striving. To be even more greedy for this courage and honesty stuff, the end of the sentence could also have read: we will not stand by your crimes, just as we will not let go unpunished the crimes committed by American citizens anywhere, whether they be in uniform or not.        
	But this is, of course, adding two radical levels of fantasy to something thats far better than one could have dreamed of when GWB was, incredibly, being sworn in for a second term four years ago. Perhaps Obama will act on Israel and Palestine, perhaps he will execute yet another Houdini act, breaking out of the old constraints of his office the way he has slipped the age-old bonds of class and colour, but at the moment, the absence of those crucial words tells me that this is a man who has entered the gilded prison of the presidency, which, in turn, is contained in an outer prison of the most powerful nation state in the world. It leaves me unmoved from my desire to see the end of these boundaries, it leaves me very aware that some of us have a dream thats still a long way from becoming real.

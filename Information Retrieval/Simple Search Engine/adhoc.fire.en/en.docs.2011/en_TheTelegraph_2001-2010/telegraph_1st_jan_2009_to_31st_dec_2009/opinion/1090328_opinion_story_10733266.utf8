	Bob Petrella, in his late fifties, and Jill Price, in her early forties, have unnaturally retentive memories. Ms Price remembers just about every detail of her life, pleasant and unpleasant, since she was 14. Mr Petrellas memory is more selective, retaining things he has enjoyed or is interested in, which amounts to between a quarter and a half of every month since he was five. At present, only four such people, including Mr Petrella and Ms Price, are known to exist. Their condition is called hyperthymesia, often translated as super-autobiographical memory. It appears, though, that Mr Petrella is a happy hyperthymestic, whereas Ms Price thinks of her condition as a burden rather than a gift. He has got used to being like this, and likes not having to panic after losing his mobile phone, for all the numbers are stored in his head. But she is depressive, and her overdeveloped memory leaves her alternately crazy and paralysed. It retains not only the warm, safe feelings but every error, insult and embarrassment as well. Hyperthymesia, it turns out, is enabling or disabling depending on how much control the person has over the selectivity of his or her memory. Mr Petrella retains the power to filter things out, whereas Ms Price seems helplessly retentive.        
	Memory has its own goddess, Mnemosyne, but forgetting has none. Yet, the contrast between Mr Petrellas cheeriness and Ms Prices misery highlights how the ability to forget remains crucial to human wellbeing. Forgetting is crucial not only to an individuals inner and outer lives from day to day, but also to more collective human formations as they move through history. At both these levels, sanity  and, indeed, the difference between the human and the inhuman  rests on being able to strike a balance between remembering and forgetting, between holding on and letting go, looking back and moving on. Its a poor sort of memory that only works backwards, the White Queen sternly reminds Alice.        
	For John Locke writing in the 17th century, The pictures drawn in our minds are laid in fading colours. But in the centuries that followed, the modern worlds growing investment in arresting or reversing times arrow produced the faster colours of photography and psychoanalysis. Each tries to undo forgetting, to make memory more vivid and vivifying, working with the traces left by time, chemical or psychic. And now, the advent of the digital frees the image from chemistry, making it unfading and hence, unforgettable.        
	But the modern world invests just as much, and often more powerfully, in forgetting. Hence, the need for, say, a Museum of Resistance on the remains of the Gulbarg Society building in Ahmedabad, where at least 68 residents were killed during the 2002 genocide. Otherwise, Gujarat will forget in order to develop. Here, it is the word, resistance, that captures the doubleness of memory  for resistance lies as much in the will to forget as in the will not to forget.

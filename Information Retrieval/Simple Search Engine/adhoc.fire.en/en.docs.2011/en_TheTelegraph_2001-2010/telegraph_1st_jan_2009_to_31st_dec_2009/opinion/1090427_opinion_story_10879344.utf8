                                                                                                                 BEYOND RULES                                                    
	The word, discipline, usually has an unsavoury ring to it that takes on a specifically juvenile quality in certain contexts. It suggests archaic punishments in school for the violation of illiberal rules. But the current trouble in some of Calcuttas colleges and hostels demands clear and firm rethinking on the issue of rules and discipline. Discipline is a question of rules and ethics in institutions that must work out their internal mechanisms of maintaining it. But the young people who study in them are also adults, and so the breach of internal discipline also become law and order issues that are part of an adult, and therefore a highly politicized and often violent, world. Two colleges are having to deal with violent students trying to coerce the authorities into letting them sit for examinations for which they have been disqualified for poor attendance. A medical college hostel had to deal with violent protests from students for the expulsion of two students for alleged misbehaviour.        
	In both cases, the students have resorted to violence that necessitated the intervention of the police. Clearly, institutions of higher education are dealing with a generation of students that seriously challenges the extent to which the maintenance of discipline is allowed to remain an internal matter. Teachers and other staff are now getting together to organize their own protest out of a feeling of physical insecurity. The lopsided nature of higher education in the state, where getting a degree acquires a sort of desperate functionalism, is at the root of this violence that remains dormant within student communities, waiting to erupt at the slightest provocation. This is made worse by the party-political structures within which these colleges and hostels inevitably operate, and which infuse a sense of empowerment and entitlement in the students that makes them break the rules with impunity.

	Q: In June 2008, we rented out the ground floor of our house as per a registered leave and licence agreement for 11months and 29 days, with two months notice period on either side. Our agreement period ended in May, 2009. When asked about renewal, the tenant said that hed vacate the house in a month or two. However, till date he has not vacated the premises. He has also stopped paying his rent since August, citing monetary difficulties. How can we get the premises vacated?
    Rajat Dutta, Calcutta  
	A:A: You can send your licencee a notice to quit on grounds that the licence period as stipulated in the agreement has terminated. Thereafter, you may file a suit for eviction against him as per the provisions of the Transfer Of Property Act, 1882.  
	Q:My tenant is a 90-year-old man whose wife has expired. His son lives with him. After my tenant dies, if I issue a rent receipt in his sons name, will that mean that I have accepted him as a tenant? Can I file an eviction suit against the son immediately?        
	Debashish Ghosh, Calcutta  
	A: Whether you recognise your tenant rsquo;s son as a tenant or not, according to the provisions of The West Bengal Premises Tenancy Act 1997, he will inherit the tenancy of his father since he has been residing with him and can remain on the premises for five years from the time of his father rsquo;s demise. Hence, you cannot immediately file an eviction suit.   
	Q:My sister, who has no children, has bought a flat in a co-operative housing society in West Bengal.She has made my son the only nominee for membership to the housing society, despite the fact that her husband and other legal heirs are alive. I would like to know if the nominee will have undisputed ownership of the flat after her demise or will her legal heirs have to forgo their claim to the said property?
    Keka Mitra, Calcutta  
	A: According to the West Bengal Co-operative Societies Rules, 1984, a member of a co-operative society may nominate, in writing, any person belonging to his family to whom the share shall be transferred upon his death. But if the member has no such family he may nominate any other person. The term ldquo;family rdquo; includes sons and daughters. Since your sister has no children she can nominate your son. But since her husband is alive he may challenge the nomination. However, it may not stand in a court of law since the co-operative society has accepted her nomination.

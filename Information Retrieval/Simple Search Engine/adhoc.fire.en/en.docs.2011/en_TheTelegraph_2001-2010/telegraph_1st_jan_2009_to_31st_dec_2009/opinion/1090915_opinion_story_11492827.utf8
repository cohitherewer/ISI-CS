                                                                                                                 NO OBJECTION                                                    
	What is the rule of law? Who practises it and who embodies it? These fundamental questions of civilized life come up, or are swept under the carpet, every year in Calcutta during the Pujas. This year too, with the Puja committees already well into their building of the pandals, the question of what the rules are, who enforces them, who breaks them and what happens to those who break them has arisen again  so far, in vain. The high court has asked for fresh guidelines, and this has immediately led to a deadlock because of the way the authorities addressed by the court have responded. There are four such authorities: the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, the police, the fire department and the CESC. The first three have responded to the court with a mysterious, but not unfamiliar, blankness. The logic of this blankness goes like this. There are rules; these are never obeyed because there are not enough people to enforce them; but all agree that nothing can be done about this, hence the authorities have nothing new to say to the court. So it is really up to the court to think up something, and even then, there is not much hope that what the court rules will be implemented. And everybody is back to Square One.        
	But Calcutta  everybody who lives and rules here  loves Square One. It is quite wrong to talk about going back to this godforsaken square, for Calcuttans have never left it, even in their imagination. For everybody, from the eternally busy mayor to the most junior policeman and corporation official, wanting to progress to Squares Two, Three or Four would mean more work and less revenue (official and unofficial). So nobody ever breaks the law. All pandals, even the ones erected about six inches away from somebodys house, are perfectly legal, and all committees have their no-objection certificates in impeccable order. This is because the certifying authorities do not care about the rules. If they did, they would have had to get their act together. So, if somebody happens to be ill, on a wheelchair or in an ambulance, or if his house is up in flames, or if he simply needs to get into his car and go somewhere, or is thalassaemic and needs to get a transfusion in a blood bank, there is every chance that he would find himself tightly wedged between his own house and a pandal. And nobody, none of his citys keepers immersed in the festivities, would be interested in pulling him out of that tight spot.

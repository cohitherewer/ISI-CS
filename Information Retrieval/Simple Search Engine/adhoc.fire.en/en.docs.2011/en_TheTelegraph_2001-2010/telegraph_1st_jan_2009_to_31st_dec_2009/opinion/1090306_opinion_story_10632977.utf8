The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | How to succeed in the market 
                                                                                                                 HOW TO SUCCEED IN THE MARKET                               Bookwise                         New tactic				                           
	To begin with, here are two stories. D.H. Lawrence wrote to Edward Garnett in 1913, If Hamlet and Oedipus were published now, they wouldnt sell more than 100 copies, unless they were pushed. And in 1885, Walt Whitman promoted Leaves of Grass with an enthusiastic review that he wrote himself.        
	If authors need to promote their own books, then it is so much more now when the competition for time and mental space is far more intense: all authors, without exception, are therefore expected to give their books a little nudge. They can do it in subtle ways, either by mentioning them in seminars or getting their cronies to do so; or in not-so-subtle ways by signing copies in bookshops, going on promotional tours (at the publishers expense) and by appearing in talk shows on television. Very simply, publishers sales strategies have to be complemented by authors self-promotion, even if some intellectuals feel offended when commercial tactic is applied to prose and poetry.        
	There are three reasons why authors can no longer sit back and leave it all to the publishers to promote and sell their books.         
	First, quite apart from the competition, publishers themselves realize that they dont know enough about how the market operates. It isnt just a question of low prices, high discounts, unlimited credit and facilities to return unsold copies that makes the retail trade stock copies and push them. The trade wants publicity to stock copies and display them  (dont ever forget bookshops today are totally cramped for space)  and the best publicity is word of mouth recommendation that would ensure copies are sold and space released for fresh stock.         
	The economics of bookselling demands that stock is turned over at least three times in a year, and to do this, space has to be created for display and easy accessibility. Second, the retail trade knows that most book reviews (for English language books, at least) are fixed. No reviewer would ever write a harsh review saying its not worth it. Publishers spend vast sums on publicity, beginning with launches and following up with briefings to the press, more so when the initial investment and pre-publication expenses are high.         
	Indian publishers know this and therefore go by bestseller lists in British and American press and/or by the prevailing wind, another name for hunches. Above all, they go by word of mouth of their trusted customers and even then move slowly with initial orders for a few copies before keeping titles in regular stock.        
	Third, and this is perhaps the most important factor, the Indian bookseller stands in slight awe of the author, especially if he or she is a well-known public figure. It gives his bookshop a special standing among the competitors and as the news gets around that such-and-such author visited the bookshop, more customers are attracted to the shop, which then builds up a regular clientele. At the very least, the bookseller will stock multiple copies of the book.         
	Writers are no longer secluded and private scribblers touched by the muse; they are part and parcel of our daily lives from where they get the stuff for their books. They also know that writing can often be a painful process but having written a book, they want it to be read. The moral was enshrined many years ago by Hilaire Belloc: When I am dead, I hope it may be said: His sins were scarlet, but his books were read.       RAVI VYAS

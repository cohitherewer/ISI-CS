The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Play the good butcher
                                                                                                                 PLAY THE GOOD BUTCHER                          - Indias economic future is hostage to crooks and cheats					 					      Sunanda K. Datta-Ray                        True lies				                                             
	Its almost as if Barack Obama had India in mind when he said in his inaugural address that greed and irresponsibility on the part of some had weakened the economy. As the Satyam saga unfolds, one cannot but wonder if the some does not embrace our entire business class. Its a disturbing thought because the market, whose power to generate wealth and expand freedom is unmatched, as Obama also said, makes businessmen the engine of growth. Is Indias economic future hostage then to crooks and cheats?        
	We are told that one dishonest swallow doesnt make for a dishonest summer. But Britains Noble Group, an independent investment bank, warns of more Satyams in the pipeline thanks to enfeebled regulation, weak accounting discipline, and aggressive promoter behaviour among Indias 500 top companies. Looking back over a past studded with the likes of Dharma Teja and Harshad Mehta, its impossible not to recall Kautilyas dictum about tasting the sweetness of honey. Can our entrepreneurs resist the temptation as their companies open up to the world and even greater fortunes become accessible?         
	Indians are not necessarily more dishonest than others. But apart from the loopholes Noble mentioned, our corrective machinery is hamstrung. It does not immediately and automatically swing into action when criminal activity is suspected, investigate without fear and speedily get to the bottom of things. The Santhanam Commissions most important recommendations on checking corruption were ignored. Indias equivalent of Indonesias, Semuanya bisa diatur (Everything can be arranged), is Everything depends on who you know. With the judges of the Supreme Court  the highest tribune in the land  coy about disclosing their assets, thieves and swindlers are convinced they need not fear the law.               
	But if businessmen are not disciplined, what the prime minister calls a blot on our corporate image will blot out the image itself. No one doubts Manmohan Singhs determination to unravel the full nature of the (Satyam) fraud and punish those involved. But he is too gentlemanly to be the good butcher Gladstone regarded as a prime ministers first essential. We have also learnt well from the British who joke that royal commissions are appointed to hush up things.         
	Our inquiries are either so much eyewash or leave no lasting impact. I know of a company that government auditors visited every day, ostensibly to scrutinize its books. It was common knowledge that its shareholding and trusts were a fiddle, that the CEO, who made a point of speaking loud and long about integrity in public life, was surreptitiously selling off valuable real estate, and that the proceeds were spirited away abroad. When the government auditors claimed to have found nothing, it meant either they had been squared or the CEOs creative accounting was cleverer than B. Ramalinga Rajus.        
	The Das Commission did not end the politician-businessman nexus, as we know from the patronage N. Chandrababu Naidu and Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy extended to Raju. No doubt Sunil Mittal, the Ambanis and even Ratan Tata expect similar benefits from Narendra Modi. Media ethics did not improve as a result of the Vivian Bose Commission on the Dalmia-Jain group. Those who pressured the Life Insurance Corporation to invest massively in Haridas Mundhras companies must have known he was, as the Chagla Commission reported, not an industrialist at all, but an adventurer, whose passion was to swallow as many firms as possible and whose methods were dubious, to say the least. The Jaganmohan Reddy Commission compounded the Nagarwala mystery (after the investigating officer died in a car crash and the former intelligence agent accused of mimicking Indira Gandhis voice died in prison) with its intriguing admission of several lacunae that could not be answered without leaving the safe haven of facts which required to be established by evidence and entering the realm of conjectures and speculation.         
	Scams are rooted in patronage, the system of planning and permits, and Indias mix of poverty, sanctimoniousness (in a variant of the old affectation of Gandhian plutocrats, Raju is supposedly monk-like and a visionary) and money-mindedness. Bogus employees, benami assets and fictitious bills are the staple of Indian commerce. Some smaller firms may be less corrupt than the giants, some business communities more prone to malpractices than others. But dishonesty is so pervasive that a body or two would surely swing from every lamp post in the country if Nehrus legendary threat were carried out. High taxes and the licence-permit-raj can no longer be blamed. Its sheer greed.        
	Calcutta Electric Supply Corporation gets away with diddling lakhs of consumers every month out of the rupee or two rebate that should be deducted from the gross bill. Wipros denial of any wrongdoing would have been more convincing if it had disclosed earlier that it had been banned since 2007 from dealing with the World Bank for offering shares to World Bank employees when it floated stock in the United States of America. Megasoft Consultants was also barred after participating in a joint venture with World Bank employees while conducting business with the institution.         
	One reason why DCM and Escorts (controlled, like Satyam, through a familys tiny share of equity) went to such lengths to thwart Swraj Paul was that an outsider would upset the cozy arrangement whereby public companies are treated like personal property, with houses, cars, jewellery, weddings, receptions and all other luxuries charged to shareholders. The law has caught up at last with the head of Nagarjuna Finance but that does not mean that more than 85,000 depositors will recover their savings of Rs 100 crore. Meanwhile, Duncan Industries depositors (including air force servicemens associations) are running from pillar to post trying to make sense of an unintelligible repayment scheme that fobs them off with words while Duncans pockets their money and goes scot free! The captains of industry who swindle people of their savings are the pillars of society. They support every political party and lord it over august organizations like the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry and Confederation of Indian Industry.               
	If Satyams accounts were as impeccable as PricewaterhouseCoopers, the auditors, claim, what were the material accounting irregularities that DSP Merrill Lynch, the global investment banker, cited to terminate its 10-days-old agreement to advise on strategic options? For that matter, was Merrill Lynchs appointment connected to its sale, less than a week earlier, of 3,900,000 Satyam shares? Other substantial offloading by senior Satyam executives suggests insider trading. The sellers may have been warned that the game was up. Or smelt a rat.        
	The prospect of the investigation extending to Mauritius and elsewhere because Satyam allegedly sent funds abroad raises the further spectre of investigators enjoying foreign holidays at public expense. Scepticism is unavoidable because of the all-round decline in standards. Corruption is no longer an election issue, except to smear opponents. Members of parliament take up scandals only when a rival party is involved. Businessmen give a stake in their enterprises to relatives of politicians. Nor are there many judges like M.C. Chagla, or jurists like M.C. Setalvad, the attorney-general who assisted him in the Mundhra affair. The media focus on drama and entertainment. The small voice of conscience of journals like C.R. Rajagopalacharis Swarajya, hammering away at untruth, demanding implementation of the Santhanam proposals and seeking to cleanse public life, is no longer heard.         
	There is talk of new laws, rules and investigating agencies. Honest intention matters far more. The guilty can be brought to book if existing agencies enforce and execute the laws that are already available. Its no longer only the Congress in whose coffin corruption will prove a nail, as Rajendra Prasad warned. The coffin is of a country that should be poised for global take-off. The market economy is inevitable but as Obama also warned, without a watchful eye, the market can spin out of control. India has enough institutional controls to prove Kautilya wrong and prevent such a catastrophe.

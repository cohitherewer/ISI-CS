	Map of the invisible world 
  By Tash Aw, HarperCollins, Rs 450         
	On his first day in school, Adam de Willigen, the 16-year-old protagonist of Tash Aws second novel, watched as a group of boys emptied the contents of his satchel and tore pages from the atlas, folded them into tiny paper planes and threw them into the air with sharp spearing motions. Bits of the atlas glided past Adam, the pink-and-green of the United States floated dreamily in circles until it stubbed its nose on the blackboard and fell abruptly to the ground.         
	This act  the scrapping of the map of the world, that familiar, comfortable arrangement of spaces, countries and cultures, disturbed by random violence  resonates with a deeper meaning in Aws book. It actually symbolizes the turmoil in the life of Adam and in the land he comes from. An orphan from Sumatra, Adam watched as his brother, Johan, was taken away to Malaysia by his affluent foster family. Adam, who was left behind in the orphanage, was then adopted by Karl, a Dutch-Indonesian painter, who had tried hard to belong to a land that was not his own. The novel starts with Karls arrest by soldiers as part of a purge of suspected communists. These constant shifts and changes in people and places, the familiar signposts of Adams life, are also linked to a greater churning in Indonesia, a fledgling nation trying to chart its way through a turbulent world. Adams life, with its many twists and turns, thus mirrors that of his motherland.        
	Aws novel also incorporates numerous quests that are layered and complex. Although each pursuit is in a sense individual, seemingly independent of other searches by other people with different motives, the characters and their journeys are bound by narrative links. The book proceeds at a languid pace, and the reader gradually comes to discover the links as each piece of the puzzle falls teasingly into place.        
	After Karls arrest, Adam leaves Perdo for Jakarta, that faraway city with ochre skies, in search of not only his foster father, but also of Margaret Bates, an American anthropologist. Adam hopes that Margaret will be able to help him find Karl. Margaret, whose past and future are inextricably linked to those of Karls and Adams, is on some sort of an inner quest as well. She is trying to understand why Indonesia, a country she loved and which she thought had loved her in return, was disintegrating around her. Margaret is compelled to join Adam out of love. Karl is the man she fell in love with in roughly twelve minutes after she set eyes on him.         
	There is also Din, Margarets university colleague, a man who wants to retell the story of the Indonesian islands through a non-Western voice. But the path that Din chooses to realize his goal is flawed and dangerous, and he even uses the unsuspecting Adam as a pawn for a nefarious mission. Mick, a not-too-skilled Australian journalist, Bill Schneider, an American diplomat, and Zubeida, a revolutionary caught in the lap of luxury, are some of the other characters who become part of the search for Karl, but each for his or her own reason.         
	Aw also develops a sub-plot, one that offers glimpses of Johans pampered life in Malaysia. Johan, lacking no material comfort, is as tortured as his brother. He remains a prisoner of a past that he cannot escape, and seeks illicit pleasure in the citys seamy underbelly in a desperate attempt to forget. But it all comes back to him, and his foster family, including Farah, the step-sister whom he loves, is incapable of providing the answers that he is looking for.         
	That Karl is found in the end does not come as a surprise. Bill Schneiders contacts and Zubeidas able assistance help Adam and Margaret retrieve Karl alive. The search for one of the central characters ends, but what is interesting is that Aw chooses to leave certain questions unresolved.         
	In the final chapter, Karl, Adam and Margaret are waiting for the ferry to take them to the islands where there are not too many people. But does Adam really crave this domesticity? Will he not embark on a journey, once again, for his brother across the sea? And can Margaret, a child of the wilderness, find happiness in a life with Karl? This unwillingness to resolve things with a finality is perhaps a conscious decision. After all, the uncertainty in the life of each character in the novel mirrors that of Indonesia, which was soon to enter a period of civil war.        
	One of Aws abiding interests is the social, cultural and political faultlines that divide people. This is a theme that informed The Harmony Silk Factory, his earlier work, as well. Here, it appears as though the people in Sukarnos Indonesia are battling the orang putih (white people) only. But there are other, smaller, battles that are being fought within as well: the antagonism against and the ostracization of the Madurese point to one such inner barrier.        
	Aws strength as a writer lies in his ability to describe in detail mundane, every-day scenes in Indonesia during the 1960s. Soldiers dusting themselves and straightening their trousers after jumping off the truck, the hollow banging of boots on the roof of a car during a violent demonstration, the din and squalor of Jakarta, the beauty of a quiet, moonlit, Balinese night  there is nothing contrived about the manner in which Aw constructs these settings. His prose, though restrained, is lyrical. Bill Schneiders description, an overgrown schoolboy forced into a mans body, makes the powerful American diplomat appear poignantly vulnerable.        
	But not every character is fleshed out with a similar dexterity. For instance, President Sukarno, as a figure of supreme authority, is made to appear adequately powerful and inaccessible. But, at the same time, Aw does not do enough to show us what lies behind his steely exterior or the demons that haunt him.         
	Where Aw fails more markedly is in the dissemination of historical and cultural information about Indonesia. This kind of information is critical for readers who are unfamiliar with the setting as well as with the historical period. To be fair to Aw, he does try to insert nuggets of Indonesias indigenous history, myth, art and literature with the help of narratives, flashbacks and anecdotes. But they are not enough to give the reader a cohesive idea about the nation and its tumultuous past. As a result, even till the very end, the islands and their people remain distant and elusive.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Shed the Dead Skin
                                                                                                                 SHED THE DEAD SKIN                                  Malvika Singh                              
	Narendra Modi seems very perturbed and a trifle uncomfortable with the regular presence of Rahul Gandhi in Gujarat. The visits have triggered a sense of insecurity that is reflected in the rather hysterical references: comparing the young leader to a fish in a pond juxtaposed in the forthcoming political battle with Modi, the large fish, swimming with ease in the open ocean! This comparative description has shown the strong and supposedly popular chief minister of Gujarat as being on the backfoot, as he desperately tries to counter an energetic, untested politician who is working diligently to break out of the rut of corroded Congress politics in an attempt to forge a fresh strategy and path, encouraging new ideas to make a real impact on the imagination of the Generation Next. As the narrative begins to change, chances are that the Congress will do better in the Lok Sabha elections and gain ground. If that happens, it will signal a resurgent Congress that could garner a majority in a few years.        
	Punjab, where Rahul Gandhi has put some of his ideas into play, and Gujarat, where he is attempting to take on not only the future hope of the Bharatiya Janata party, but also the heavyweights of the corporate world, could be two critical litmus tests that could empower young leaders to break out of the stagnation that has been responsible for the dilution of the party. The young Gandhi is clearly making an impact on the opposition within his own party as well as in other parties. It was bizarre to see L.K. Advani in a television clip lift a a dumb bell to prove his youthfulness at 80 years as he competes for the political space in India with a 38-year-old Rahul Gandhi. Modi and Advani, the two BJP stalwarts, by their unnecessary assault on the young aspirant have, willy nilly, placed him on the high table of national politics. Their insecurity is palpable.                
	Young blood        
	Why does the BJP keep its young leaders in the dark and hidden recesses of the party? Why does it not pitch its Manvendra Singhs and suchlike against the Rahul Gandhis? Why does Mulayam Singh not make way for his son instead of keeping him in the shadows of the Samajwadi Party? Where are the 40-year-old leaders in the various other political parties? Why not actively encourage the change of guard? That way, India could be saved from the experience of those who corrupted the political arena and destroyed civil society by abusing the laws, norms, values and ethics that were mandated to govern us. We need to break away from that diseased construct and build anew. To do so effectively, a new set of faces and personalities will have to lead the charge fearlessly and passionately.        
	It would be far easier for the new-generation leaders to confer and deal with our new generation. They speak the same language, belong to the same period in history, have similar aspirations and face common global problems. Cross-generation dialogues are restrictive and frustrating as the players, naturally, tend to pull in different directions. Disputes remain unresolved. Innovations and the radical reversal of staid ideas by the new generation are an anathema to the older one, leading to a status quo that is detrimental to growth and change.        
	It is time to shed the dead skin and dead brain cells. Calculated risks bring change, and change nurtures vitality and energy. The system that governs us needs a radical overhaul. Colonial laws and police acts need to be rewritten. Institutions need to be revitalized and sensitized to the changed environment and its demands. The political class must set the agenda. Bureaucrats and the judiciary must ensure the delivery of that agenda and be accountable to the citizenry in an effort to restore integrity and dignity into the body politic.

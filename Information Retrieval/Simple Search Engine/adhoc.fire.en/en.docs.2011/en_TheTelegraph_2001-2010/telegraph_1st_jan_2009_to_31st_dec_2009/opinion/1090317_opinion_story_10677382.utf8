                                                                                                                 HOME TROUBLE                                                    
	It is time for patchwork and patch-ups in Indian politics. The Communist Party of India (Marxist), which is leading the charge of the possible third front, has its own troubles to mend on home turf in Kerala. The party may eventually make peace with the Communist Party of India over the contentious Ponnani constituency, but that is unlikely to be the end of the story. And the man who knows this best is Prakash Karat, the CPI(M) general secretary. Even as he shuttles from one meeting to another to sew up the third front, the communists own problems in Kerala go far beyond one Lok Sabha seat. Also, the differences between the allies in the ruling Left Front are only a footnote to those within the CPI(M) itself. The open, and sometimes ugly, factional fight between supporters of the chief minister, V.S. Achyutanandan and the CPI(M) state unit secretary, P. Vijayan, has long reduced the Lefts claim of ideological cohesion to a mockery. It was only a matter of time that the CPI(M)s inner-party problems rubbed off on the other constituents of the front. Mutual suspicion and distrust in the Left camp in Kerala predate these elections and can hence last far beyond them.         
	Given the disaffection in the CPI(M) and its partners distrust of the party, the Left is likely to lose heavily in Kerala in these elections. A bad defeat in these polls can only add to the Marxists  and other Left parties  woes in Kerala. What is more significant is the possible impact such a loss may have on national politics. The Left may suffer substantial losses in Bengal too. Mr Karat and his comrades, now the prime movers of the third front, may well be cut to size if their own forts fall. Even before that happens, the Kerala tangle raises questions about the Lefts credentials to act as alliance-makers. If the Left cannot keep its own house in order, it cannot be trusted to hold together political elements as disparate as Mayavati, J. Jayalalithaa and H.D. Deve Gowda. For Mr Karat, the Kerala crisis is like a setback not only because he hails from the state but also because it has worsened since he took over as the party chief. His critics can even argue that the problems within the CPI(M)s Kerala unit are already a glaring example of Mr Karats failure in mending political differences. A drastically reduced CPI(M) in the next Lok Sabha could make the communists  and Mr Karat  irrelevant in national politics.

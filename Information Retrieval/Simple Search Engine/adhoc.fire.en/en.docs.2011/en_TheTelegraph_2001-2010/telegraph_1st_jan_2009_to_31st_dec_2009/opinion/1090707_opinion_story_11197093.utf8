	Sweet but not safe enough                  
	Sir  Bengalis are known for their sweet tooth. Calcutta abounds with sweet shops. But the people who work in these shops invariably handle sweets with bare, often unclean, hands and pass on deadly germs to unsuspecting customers. Recently, I was in Visakhapatnam, where I was pleasantly surprised to find all workers in sweet shops wearing clean hand-gloves. On my return to Calcutta, I went to a famous establishment and asked to be served by someone wearing gloves. On hearing my request, the shop-owner looked at me fixedly, either bemused or in disdain. Maybe I was asking for too much in a city where filth, squalor and pollution have become part of everyday life.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Reform first          
	Sir  In Why affirmative action (July 2), Andr Bteille has provided an insightful analysis of the drama around the womens reservation bill tabled in the Parliament. It is ironic that even after 60 years of independence, politicians have failed to reach a unanimous decision on the issue of womens reservation, although it has been repeatedly debated upon.          
	This time too, the monkey-wrench has been thrown in, courtesy Sharad Yadavs suicide episode and Mulayam Singh Yadav, who wasted no time in using the floor to show how much his heart wept for the minorities and backward castes. Mulayam Singhs argument that without quotas the upper-caste women with better education and political awareness would reap the benefits of reservation is strange. Running a country requires a proper understanding of political and social issues, and it is only logical that women who have a good education should take up key posts in governance. They should be selected on the basis of their intellect and not the castes they have been born into. The stress should be on providing quality education and healthcare to women from the backward castes so that in time they can come on a par with the rest. Promoting a victimhood mentality among sections of the population for political mileage is contemptible.          
	The social and religious fabric in India has always projected women as weak, and undermined their strength. Over the years, the status of women has gone down. Barring those who are either from royal and illustrious families and those who gained such stature through matrimony, few women have graced top positions in governance. The first step towards true empowerment of women should be proper and mandatory schooling so that women from the lower strata learn to think and take decisions for themselves. Simply introducing quotas in higher education will only lead to certain sections of society that are already solvent and well-to-do walking away with the benefits. Politicians must cut across party lines to promote deserving women to positions of responsibility.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Andr Bteille, while advocating reservation for women ,writes that What we need is affirmative action that will help women to act more extensively against the prevalent bias so as to develop their own unrecognized and unutilized potential. To give everybody equal opportunity to come up is an accepted principle. Bteilles contention is that the disabilities imposed on women for centuries have to be corrected. But this can only be done by giving more women a chance to get better education. Doling out a prized position here and there to a woman can never be a solution.           
	One wonders if women have been treated biasedly in Europe as well. Why else is the role of women in public life still not large enough there? Is there still some prejudice against women in Europe? If so, then why have European countries not yet resorted to a womens reservation scheme?          
	Yours faithfully,

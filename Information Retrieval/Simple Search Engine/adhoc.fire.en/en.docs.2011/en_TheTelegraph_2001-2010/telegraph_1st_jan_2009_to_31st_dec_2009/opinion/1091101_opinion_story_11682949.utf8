                                                                                                               DIARY
                  
	 With victory comes responsibility, and that often means keeping the victors in their places. In her long tenure as the Congress president, Sonia Gandhi had relaxed into the habit of giving chief ministers of party-ruled states almost full control over matters of governance and ticket distribution. But the sudden death of Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy, and the ensuing crisis over succession, opened Madams eyes to a new problem: that it may not always be wise to let chief ministers grow into larger-than-life figures. Then came the verdict in the Haryana assembly polls, where Bhupinder Singh Hooda, in spite of his triumph, failed to deliver the 60-odd seats he had promised his party chief before the polls. So Madam has decided to look beyond exaggerated claims of superiority, and focus on ground realities. Which is why, from now on, Congress-ruled states would be under constant surveillance of the high command. Is it merely a coincidence that this new approach coincides with the 25th death anniversary of the Iron Lady?                
	 A mysterious bug is afflicting both politicians and pretty faces alike. It is not just Narendra Modi who is reporting sick to work. Priyanka Chopra, we hear, is also down with flu, though not of the porcine variety. Recently, Piggy Chops admitted herself that these days her diary is filled more with sick leave than with work schedule. The stars havent been too kind on poor Priyanka for a while. First came the blighted Whats Your Raashee? Then she had an ugly bout of food poisoning. Apparently, it was all due to some spinach she had eaten after her good friend, Shahid Kapoor, recommended a pure vegetarian diet to make her look healthy. Sadly, best advices often hit back in bizarre ways. Or perhaps it was just bad rashee.                            
	 A storm was recently raised, not in a teacup, but over a bottle of alcohol. The business tycoon and Rajya Sabha MP, Vijay Mallya, sent a bottle of alcohol to each member of parliament this Diwali. But, in spite of best intentions, friendly gestures sometime backfire badly. The gift enraged BJP MP Prabhat Jha, who considered it an affront and strictly against Indian culture. Jhas belligerence left some of his colleagues tittering. One came up with a terse rejoinder. Isnt it interesting, said the gentleman, so far no one has refused the calender Mallya has sent us? On the contrary, there is strong demand for that scintillating item.                            
	 The chief minister of Madhya Pradesh, Shivraj Singh Chauhan, has hit upon a novel idea for celebrating his states foundation day. Today, a motley political crowd  including the governor, chief minister, leader of the Opposition, the state Congress president and all elected representatives  will gather to hoist the national flag. It will be followed by the reading of a sankalp patra or pledge, and a song of praise, composed for the occasion, will be sung. The idea, it is being said, is not Chauhans own but has been inspired by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. After the thumping defeat in the Maharashtra assembly polls, the RSS has decided to change tack, hence its injunction to Chauhan to inculcate a sense of Madhya Pradesh identity among the people of the state. (Now, doesnt that phrase ring an all-familiar bell?) But Chauhans task has been made that much more difficult by the diversity of cultures, cuisine and dialects in his home state. Add to this, the 70-odd Congress MLAs who have agreed to read out his message at the various district and tehsil headquarters, and you have a very crestfallen CM!                            
	 While the Congress has been, by and large, chastened by the recent austerity drive, a few odd ones have slipped the net. When Anil Shastri, editor of the party mouthpiece, Sandesh, went to Kazakhstan as part of a delegation (with his wife in tow), he decided to make himself comfortable in the executive class while the others sat fuming in economy!                            
	 Diwali season also saw Congress leader Sajjan Kumar, sidelined by the party for his alleged involvement in the 1984 riots, in an expansive mood. Not only did Kumar visit the Union human resource minister, Kapil Sibal, to exchange pleasantries, but was seen touching Sibals feet in full public view. The intriguing sight set the rumour mills on an overdrive. It is not for nothing that a politician, with a CBI investigation haunting him visits a colleague who is said to be closest to the prime minister.

	 It is unlikely that Arun Jaitley had anticipated the occupational hazards of being the president of the Delhi and District Cricket Association. The poor man had to virtually go underground on the eve of the India-Australia one-day match on October 31. Everyone who is, or whose forefathers have been, anyone lined up at Jaitleys office looking for complimentary tickets. On top of it, municipal authorities and police and state officials had to be kept in good humour lest they felt left out. So, close to half of the newly renovated Feroz Shah Kotla was earmarked for freeloaders of various kinds. If, after such a huge headache, the DDCA managed to make some profit, it was more due to the popularity of the sport and clever financial planning.

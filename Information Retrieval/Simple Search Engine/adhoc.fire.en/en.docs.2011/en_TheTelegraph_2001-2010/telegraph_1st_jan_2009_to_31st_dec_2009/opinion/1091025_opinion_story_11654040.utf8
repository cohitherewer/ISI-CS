	 Next is what? For the Congress, the victory in the assembly elections could mean that it is time to put some loud thinking into action. For a while now, a section of Congress leaders has been veering towards a go-it-alone, or, as some say, Ekla chalo re position. At the Panchmarhi session in 1998, the party had expressly rejected the coalition dharma, but political exigency dictated a different path. That may change now, especially since no less than Rahul Gandhi himself is said to be pushing for a new mantra to expand the party base. The attitude is already in evidence from the patronizing manner in which the Haryana Janhit Congress, the Nationalist Congress Party and the Trinamul Congress are being dealt with. Down South, where equations need to be reworked badly, Rahuls meeting with Rajnikant is said to be on the anvil. In fact, the CBI raid and the muddying of waters over the dealings of DMKs A Raja on the day the election results were out apparently have much to do with the subterranean shifts in Congress politics. Perhaps only time will tell if the Congress is going too fast, too soon.                
	 For now, however, Congress managers are busy working on a solution in Haryana where the party has fallen short of majority. Suddenly, innumerable well-wishers of Bhajan Lal have surfaced. The game plan is to offer merger-talks to Lals party, the Haryana Janhit Congress, which has seven MLAs. The veteran leader, the plan goes, will be accommodated in some Raj Bhavan. But Lal is proving to be a tough nut to crack. He wants to know how his own lal (son), Kuldeep Bishnoi, will be accommodated by the Congress. Another thing. Both Lal and Bishnoi have been insisting that Bhoopy (Bhupinder Singh Hooda) should not be returned as chief minister. This might prove to be difficult.                            
	 Twenty five years after her demise, Indira Gandhi has managed to unite the two ladies who started their political career during her time  Ambika Soni and Sheila Dixit. The Union information and broadcasting minister and the Delhi CM, who have no love lost between them, are working in tandem for the commemoration of the 25th death anniversary of Indiraji. Perhaps the other Mrs G is keeping a close watch on their progress on the matter.                             
	 Knives are out in the Bharatiya Janata Party after the debacle in all three assembly polls. As before, some leaders are questioning the incumbent group about a few decisions. For instance, why did the party spurn the hand of friendship extended by Om Prakash Chautala and Kuldeep Bishnoi in Haryana? The coterie around Rajnath Singh, the BJP president, is supposed to have first rebuffed Chautala, who was keen to team up with the party. The demand for seats was pitched so high that the chief of the Indian National Lok Dal could not have agreed to it.      
	In the case of an alliance with Bishnois HJC, the same set of men torpedoed all chances by refusing to project the leader as the joint chief ministerial candidate. An honest inquiry would perhaps reveal how dubious business interests have come to influence the decision-making process in the national Opposition party.                             
	 One would expect the countrys apex intelligence agencies to be free from internal bickering. Unfortunately, the arbitrary manner of posting and transfers has vitiated working relationships in the CBI and the RAW. If the appointment of the RAW director caused much heartburn some time ago, more recently, a couple of senior sleuths have registered their protest against the appointment of the No. 2 by going on leave. It seems that politicians stir the pot in intelligence agencies as well. Last heard, the protest leave was still on.                             
	 Before the Maharashtra polls, the BJP submitted a list of campaigners to the EC with AB Vajpayee marked at the top. Some senior BJP leaders announced that this time the seniormost leader of the party would appear before people through video-conferencing. It was a different story after the election. Party leaders from the state were caught complaining that they had not got any campaign material related to Vajpayeeji. Was it a hoax then?                
	FOOTNOTE
      
	 Slightly bizarre things are happening to the BJP. Take Murli Manohar Joshis Diwali Milan, an event that coincided with an important party meeting. Joshi, obviously, gave two hoots. The host, after all, couldnt miss his own party. The bash obviously set tongues wagging. Many say that with the BJP-RSS gamble failing in Maharashtra, veteran party leaders like Joshi and Sushma Swaraj have begun fancying their chances of leading the party. At Joshis do, which had a mouth-watering assortment of kalakand, parval, lalpaida, kulfi and rabri, a wag was heard wondering aloud if the professor was celebrating in advance. Things are not okay elsewhere. The BJP spokesman, Ravi Shankar Prasad, had circulated notes among scribes with his august intention to rip apart Jairam Ramesh on his U-turn on the Kyoto Protocol. Soon after, the notes were taken back and instead of Prasad, it was Arun Jaitley who held the briefing. His note, distributed among the journos, was thankfully allowed to stay.

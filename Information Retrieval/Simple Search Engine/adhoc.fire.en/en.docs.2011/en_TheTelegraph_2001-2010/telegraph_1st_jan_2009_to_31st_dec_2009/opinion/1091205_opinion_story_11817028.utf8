                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        THE MAN WITH SEVERAL FACES                                  This above all - Khushwant Singh                          Very intriguing                                        
	Now that Justice M.S. Liberhan has squarely blamed Atal Bihari Vajpayee as being one of the conspirators in the destruction of the Babri Masjid on December 6, 1992, I can mention my meeting with him a few days after the event. It was at a small dinner party of five or six people, specially arranged to enable us to meet. I was still reeling under the shock of that barbarous act of vandalism and could not believe that a suave, civilized man whom I respected and for whom I had a feeling of friendly warmth could be a party to it. He arrived accompanied by his life-long friend, Mrs Kaul, in whose home he stayed. For a few minutes, we sipped our Scotch in silence. Then Mrs Kaul said to me Ask him to read out a poem he has recently composed. I repeated the request to Vajpayee. It was obviously all pre-planned between them. Vajpayee fished out a piece of paper from his pocket and read out his poem entitled Kya main boorha ho gaya hoon? (Have I turned old?) It was about the destruction of the mosque and the deep regret he felt over the episode. I could not hold myself back and said Vajpayeeji, why dont you say so openly  khullam khulla  why just read it out to me? He simply nodded his head without saying anything. I continued: Will you let me publish it in my column? I will translate it into English. He handed over the poem to me saying: Do what you like with it. I said: Sign it. He put his signature on it and handed it back to me. I published it in the weekly column I write for The Hindustan Times.        
	I still cannot make anything of Vajpayees personality. He oozes warmth and goodwill. Maybe I am easily fooled. Or perhaps he is, as K.N. Govindachari described him, a mukhota  double-faced. A fundoo with fundoos, a liberal with liberals.                
	Fruit basket                
	Some weeks ago, I wrote how many kinds of fruit, vegetables and juices, which could be easily produced in our own country, were being imported from abroad. Among other things, I mentioned the Kiwi fruit imported from New Zealand and available in Khan Market across the road. The write-up paid me handsome dividends.         
	I got a letter from General J.J. Singh, governor of Arunachal Pradesh, enclosing a photograph of a tree laden with Kiwi being grown in his state. With it came a basket full of Arunachali Kiwis  every bit as tasty and nutritious as those from New Zealand. My next question is  if they grow in profusion in Arunachal, why are they not available in towns and cities of India?        
	Furthermore, there are fruits and vegetables grown in India and relished by foreigners for which Indians have yet to cultivate a taste. If grown on a large scale, they can be economically viable. We can offer, for instance, avocados, artichokes and asparagus, to our common folks for their enjoyment.         
	My mother, who was a dehatian and a vegetarian, developed a passion for asparagus, as it was often the only non-meat, non-egg item on offer in European homes.

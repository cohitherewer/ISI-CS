                                                                                                                 SAME AS BEFORE                                  BONA FIDE - MALVIKA SINGH                                    
	Haryana and Maharashtra are going to the polls next week and electioneering, laden with all kinds of promises, is going on at every corner. The Shiv Sena, led by Uddhav Thackeray, is desperately trying to speak in a language that is less strident about Maratha nationalism than before, articulating, in a slightly more sophisticated way what the grand old man of the Sena has being saying for decades. But there is, in fact, no difference in position, attitude or promise. Shivaji will rise out of the sea, and all political parties have found the words and rationale to support what they decry elsewhere. They all believe that to garner vote they have to have Shivaji present anywhere and everywhere on call. Nothing appears to have changed mdash; neither the political rhetoric nor the manner in which the parties are operating this time. Lobbying, buying and selling, backbiting mdash; all of it has come together yet again in this election season.
    
	The outcome in Maharashtra is anybodys guess. No one really knows whether the Congress-Nationalist Congress Party combine will pull off an absolute majority, without which the state will falter in its movement forward and descend deeper into the reality of a failed, flagging region that was once an energetic hub of business and culture. Weak and personalized local governance, an inability to confront social realities and deal with them in an effort to cleanse the public space of all the irregularities, administrative ineptitude and corrupt practices, have generated deep disillusionment among the inhabitants of the state. Therefore, parties such as the Shiv Sena and their alliance partner, the Bharatiya Janata Party, gain ground with their fervent and emotional nationalistic rhetoric that hits a nerve centre that, in turn, produces a faithful throng of irrational followers. In the end, nothing changes.          
	Better machinery        
	Nothing can truly change in a pluralistic society such as Indias without political commitment to secular and liberal governance. Simple measures could begin to change the direction. The first and most important area that needs a radical overhaul and complete cleansing is the many municipalities across the country. They have collectively succeeded in making the public places in this subcontinent uninhabitable, filthy and polluted. There is absolutely no excuse in the book for this pathetic and unacceptable state of affairs. Nowhere in the world do you walk or drive through a town or a city that has muck piled high everywhere. It is shameful and needs immediate rectification. A clean, well-swept public space will instantly alter the social lethargy and helplessness that plague us as a society. This one move would trigger active public involvement in change and growth.        
	Citizen groups need to be empowered to work in collaboration with government bodies to devise the parameters within which civil society can operate safely. The confrontational attitude that the state takes towards citizens for whom it is mandated to function has to be done away with. A joint venture needs to be created that ensures the good of all. This is not a difficult thing to do if there is a political will that makes clear demands on its administration to deliver.        
	And so, the real priority is rapid and decisive administrative reforms. A vast collection of reports is gathering thick layers of dust because any attempt to introduce radical measures, which will ensure cleaner, neater and more effective governance, will rudely disrupt the cosy and cushioned existence of a moribund bureaucracy. This machine has to be overhauled, oiled and watched as it performs. It has to stop holding our nation to ransom. It has to aid the elected representative and deliver on the mandate. It must cease to act silently against the best interests of the people of India. It must be answerable to the Constitution of India.

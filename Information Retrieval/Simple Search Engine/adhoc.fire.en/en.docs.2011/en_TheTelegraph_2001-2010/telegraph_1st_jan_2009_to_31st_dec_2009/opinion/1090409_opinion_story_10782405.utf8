	Different peaks                  
	Sir  The G20 summit in London was the right step taken at the right time (G20 package lifts hope, April 3). It is commendable that so many nations joined hands in pursuit of a common objective, that of meeting the challenges of the current financial crisis. Developed as well as developing nations need to take coordinated steps to reach this goal, as the American president, Barack Obama emphasized.           
	The other significant aspect of this summit was the growth in the roles of China, India, and other developing countries in shaping the world economy. That India gained the membership of two prestigious bodies, namely, the financial stability forum and the Basel committee on banking regulations is reason for pride. The summit also presented the Indian prime minister as a very strong figure regarding economic matters. That many parts of Manmohan Singhs speech were used in the final communiqu is evidence of his importance.          
	Perhaps the most significant issues discussed in the summit were the clause pertaining to greater surveillance of financial institutions, and that against protectionism, apart from the decision to allocate a huge amount to developing countries. But even though these clauses sound optimistic, much would depend on the steps taken for their implementation when the leaders return to their respective countries. The London summit was historic. It needs to be seen whether it will be able to achieve its objectives, mainly in economic growth and growth in jobs.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Harshika Singh, London

                
	Filling a black hole          
	Sir  L.K. Advani is being ridiculed by all and sundry as well as in your editorial (Colour of money, April 1) for having asked the prime minister to bring up the issue of black money during the G20 summit. He was referring to the money allegedly being held by Swiss banks for Indian clients. He has been laughed at particularly because he said that if this supposedly enormous pile can be brought back to the country, it can be utilized for various welfare schemes. It is alleged that Indians hold the highest amount of unaccounted for money in Swiss bank accounts. It would have really helped the Indian economy if it could be brought back.           
	One charge against Advani is that he did not raise this subject when the National Democratic Alliance was in power, and is doing so now only to score some brownie points before the elections. But those who say this are conveniently forgetting the strict secrecy policy of Swiss banks and their staunch refusal to reveal the identity of the account holders until recently.           
	Now that Swiss banks, under pressure from the Barack Obama government, have agreed to reveal the identity of some American citizens holding such accounts, Advani could have felt encouraged to initiate action through the prime minister so the Swiss do the same with regard to Indian account holders. What is wrong in this? Why ridicule the veteran politician just because he belongs to a so-called Hindutva party, although the logic and the timing of his demand are absolutely right?           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The plan or scheme to bring back black money from Swiss banks and foreign tax havens is a blessing in disguise, since nobody took the phenomenon of overseas accounts seriously until we faced recession. The huge amount salted away as black money will be a great stimulus for the economy, and the government will not have to spend the taxpayers money to overcome recession.           
	Honest tax-payers should demand the return of black money from overseas since it was because of the tax-evaders that law-abiding citizens had to pay extra taxes. Had the tax evaders not siphoned off black money abroad, the tax slab could have been lower. It is now payback time as the country is facing an extraordinary situation and needs money most. But the amnesty scheme allowing the tax evader to keep 50 per cent of his pile cannot be called immoral, since only a part of the money was black through the non-payment of tax.           
	But there is a serious hurdle in bringing back black money from tax havens and banks abroad. The countries and banks keeping the the black money are surviving only because of this huge wealth. If people from all countries draw out their overseas savings, these places will fail like the American banks, as they have also invested or loaned the money as part of their businesses. Even a big country such as India drawing out its money will have the same effect. If we bother about this at all, the solution would lie in slow withdrawals from these banks and other tax havens. That would stop them from collapsing suddenly. It is interesting that L.K. Advani thought about bringing back black money from abroad only at the time of the general elections, not when the NDA was in power. Why did the noble plan not strike anyone else? Are Congress leaders short on such brilliant wisdom?                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta 

                
	Parting shot          
	Sir  It is a shame that India is among the ten most corrupt countries in the world (India in corrupt top five, March 9). More than half-a-century after our independence, we find ourselves lagging far behind on all fronts when we look at the progress of Japan, Australia, the United States of America and China. The leaders have ruled or, rather, ruined us by dividing voters on the basis of caste, creed and gender or whatever meanest way was available to them.           
	An opportunity has come in the shape of the elections. I appeal particularly to young people, many of them first-time voters, as well as to all others, to come forward to change the system by rejecting corrupt and inefficient candidates along with their antiquated policies. The candidates credentials and careers must be assessed before voting. Let us end the era of worship for musclemen and moneybags from this election. A beginning has to be made now           
	Yours faithfully,        Raj Varshney, Victoria, Australia

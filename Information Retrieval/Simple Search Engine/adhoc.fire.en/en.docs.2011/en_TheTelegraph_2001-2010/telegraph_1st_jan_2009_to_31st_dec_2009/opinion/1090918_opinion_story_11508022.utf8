                                                                                                                 HARD LESSON                                                    
	Every policy in India, however well-intentioned, gets caught between a rock and a hard place. The right to education law has come up against the principles on which minority educational institutions are run, to protect which the United Progressive Alliance had created the National Commission for Minority Educational Institutions in 2004. The policy-makers behind the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, among whom the Union human resource development minister, Kapil Sibal, is the most visible face, seem to have overlooked the fine print at crucial points. The new law as it stands and as it is expected to work would be unconstitutional if applied to minority institutions, the NCMEI has claimed. It is a slightly absurd situation when the same government spawns two routes to doing good  and gaining votes  and then finds that the routes are on a collision course.        
	The NCMEI has picked two issues, but there seems to be an underlying sense of overall injury as well that minority institutions should be expected to fall within the purview of a law applying to general educational institutions. The quota law did not include them. The universal elementary education law not only says that all schools, including minority institutions, should allot 25 per cent of their seats to underprivileged children, differently-abled children and children from backward communities, but also warmly suggests that minority institutions could raise this proportion to 50 per cent if they so wish. The NCMEI, however, feels that nurturing children with disadvantages is something that minority institutions would do voluntarily; to force the action by Central law is to violate the Constitution. Similarly, to have parents of students as a major part of school managing committees, as the new law demands, would be tantamount to losing minority status. Students come from many communities, whereas the managing committee of a minority institution is composed mainly of the community which runs the institution. It is a pity that promulgators of the right to education law missed these issues, because the law is undoubtedly of great importance. It should not have laid itself bare to objections like these. Either these issues should have been thought through and modifications provided, or minority institutions exempted, as they were in the case of the law on quotas.

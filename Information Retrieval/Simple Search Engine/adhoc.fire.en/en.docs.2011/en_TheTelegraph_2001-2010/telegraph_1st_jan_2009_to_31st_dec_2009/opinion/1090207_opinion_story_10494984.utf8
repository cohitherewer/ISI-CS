	Linked to failure                  
	Sir  I went to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation office in Behala last week to pay domestic tax. I was not surprised by the long queue, but by the fact that only two counters were open. The rest were closed with a link failure notice. When I enquired about it, the personnel rudely told me to wait in line. Being an engineer, I knew that if the link really failed, it would not work on any computer. When I started arguing, others too joined in and the link was suddenly restored in all the counters. The CMC should take lessons from the CESC on customer service.           
	Yours faithfully,        Snehasish Choudhury, Calcutta
        
	Wealth is wisdom          
	Sir  Good education leads to prosperity (Two sisters, Feb 1). So Lakshmi and Saraswati can inhabit the same dwelling, thereby proving the Bengali proverb wrong. But it isnt good education alone that helps a person become a complete man, since his education is complete only if he is graceful and humane by nature. Today, education implies bookish knowledge, and for students, it is a mad race to secure high marks. Prosperity too can be attained without knowledge, or without being civil or kind. Alas, it seems that Saraswati has not blessed us with the power to interpret old proverbs correctly and put them to good use.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
R. Subhranshu, Chandernagore 

                
	Sir  Amit Chaudhuri in Two sisters has mourned the changes in the culture of Bengalis who now associate lofty academic careers with the filth of lucre. But this is inevitable in a capitalist and consumerist society. Chaudhuri, hopefully, would not want Bengalis to perish while clinging to their idealism. Bengals communists have held on to their ideals for three decades now. But while offering virtually free education in government schools, they have ruined the education system. Bengalis now prefer paying high fees and sending their children to private, English-medium schools to enrolling them in government institutions. Lakshmis wealth can thus buy Saraswatis blessings.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sound and silence          
	Sir  I am a resident of Gokhale Road. It feels good to tell people that my house is in the lane next to the prestigious Calcutta Club. However, of late, I find that the club is taking undue advantage of its fame. It is but natural that a club will organize cultural events and musical programmes for its members. But in the case of the Calcutta Club, these events are organized in the open lawns on the premises and, invariably, the noise is much too loud. The shows may entertain the members, but they disturb the residents of the area. The club usually adheres to the laid-down rules on timings, but the club authorities perhaps do not understand that the residents have no desire to listen to sitar recitals or disco evenings during the daytime or in the evening.           
	I am not the only person who is affected by this. Old people, school and college students facing exams, babies and peace-loving citizens are also inconvenienced. Residents have approached the clubs operations manager and its chief manager, but to no avail. Complaints at the Bhowanipur police station have not elicited a response from the police.           
	Is this because the approach of the complainants has been dignified and gentlemanly? Perhaps Bengalis today pay no heed to civility. Will it take a protest by an ad hoc committee of local residents or a red- flag demonstration to make this institution see reason? There was a time when I thought that street politics was the realm of the unruly and the uncivilized. But the city now seems to understand only the crude language of protest.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
S. Sen, Calcutta

	Food for thought                  
	Sir  The Shame Factor by Ashok Mitra (Aug 31) was an eye-opener. Mitra deserves to be congratulated for opening our eyes to the vicious cycle of poverty, illiteracy and lack of consciousness which poses an unseen but real threat to society. There is a lady who works as a maid in our colony. She has never been to school. Her husband left her without a penny and with five children. None of them goes to school because their mother cannot meet the expenses. Even the youngest, who is eleven years old, is working as a maid. This reality, which Mitra portrays in his piece, should serve as a wake up call to all.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Government policies to eradicate illiteracy have been a failure. They are not being enforced with the passion with which they were formulated. A successful democracy is possible only in a country in which all the citizens are literate, as the progress of a society depends on its educated members. After 62 years of independence, Indias position with regard to literacy is not anything to write home about. Village schools still lack basic facilities. The country has a long way to go to achieve the universalization of education.           
	Ashok Mitra is right when he says that we do not feel ashamed to acknowledge that the majority of our population is illiterate, and the reason for the illiteracy is poverty. It seems that the power brokers are interested in every other issue except education. Politicians perhaps fear that the ignorant masses, if educated, will start using their democratic rights judiciously which might affect the leaders adversely during elections.           
	One agrees with Mitras contention that India can become a fully literate country if educated young men and women help to eradicate illiteracy. The government too should treat the financing of primary education on a separate footing. India can count itself a developed country only when every child receives education as a fundamental right.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Ashok Mitra is absolutely right in pointing out the deplorable condition of the Indian education system. The harsh reality seems to impinge more on students like us. I remember how Article 41 and Article 45 of the Constitution, regarding free and compulsory education for children, filled me with surprise when they were read out in a Political Science class. I could not believe that such Articles existed as the education system and literacy rate present a completely contrasting picture.           
	Mitra states correctly that literacy is not an issue of life and death for India s leaders. Illiteracy is a convenient way to deny the masses the knowledge that could rouse them to action. I guess Foucaults concept of the interrelation of knowledge and power is not unknown to Indian leaders. However, it is not only the apathy borne by politicians that is responsible for the poor literacy rate. There are other causes, such as the lack of concern shown by some teachers. If a teacher lacks initiative, one can hardly expect students, especially those who cannot afford a days meal, to show any interest. That apart, education has become a business nowadays.           
	However, the problem is much more serious than Mitra thinks, and a solution is not possible by raising an education army. Not many graduates from even Indias most prestigious institutions are willing to go and teach in the rural interiors for a proposed stipend of Rs 15,000 as there are other lucrative offers. If anything needs to change, it is the indifference of the people on whose shoulders the responsibility of raising literacy levels is placed. Indias political leaders, teachers and students, all have their respective roles to play. A united effort is required to improve this abysmal condition.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Ashok Mitras call for stress on literacy and school education should attract support from all institutional quarters without any reservations. School education has long been neglected by governments. The Centre must allocate more money for education. But the inept state governments must work hard enough to utilize the funds as well. There are countless rural schools in Bengal where both the standard of teaching and as well as the quality of mid-day meal are abysmal. The latter point is important since school drop-out rates decrease in proportion with the provision of mid-day meals.           
	Problems such as pupils dropping out of schools and illiteracy are far more acute in the villages. The average farm worker gets a real wage that is much less than what the average worker makes in a city. Mitras suggestion of recruiting millions of social workers is laudable. In fact, the social workers can not only coax parents to send their children to school but they can also help the adult rural population to learn skills that can help them make a living by moving to cities and towns that have a much better standard of living.           
	Unfortunately, this is easier said than done. On the one hand, it is hard to entice young graduates to work in villages as social workers. On the other hand, there is an irrational condescension among middle class, urban men and women towards rural folks who migrate to cities in search of employment.                     
	Yours faithfully,

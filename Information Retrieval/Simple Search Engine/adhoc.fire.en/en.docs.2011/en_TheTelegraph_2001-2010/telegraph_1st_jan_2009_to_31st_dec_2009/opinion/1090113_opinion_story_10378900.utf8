	The history of the governments intervention in population control has not been a happy one in India. But the estimated population of 1.6 billion for 2050 rightly fills the Indian State with misgivings. The latest signs of concern come from Kerala. The law commission appointed by the state government has recommended that couples with more than two children should be fined Rs 10,000, apart from being made to forfeit privileges like free elementary education. Having children involves choices and decisions that emanate from the most private spheres of the lives of men and women. Every modern democracy would want to protect that privacy, and should think repeatedly and hard before trying to regulate this sphere of the private and bring it within the purview of rewards and punishments. The Kerala law commissions recommendation seems to have bypassed this essential process to come to a sort of levelling arbitrariness. In a country where economic and sexual inequalities are chronic, and in a state with a very high number of Catholic Christians and Muslims, unthinkingly drastic measures can only result in actual and perceived injustice. Punishments for having more than a stipulated number of children often end up victimizing the most disempowered, usually poor women who have the least control over their reproductive lives.        
	China is often cited as an example by those advocating State intervention, and as a warning by those concerned about the violation of fundamental rights. But even Chinas one-child policy allows exemptions for several categories like rural families, ethnic minorities and parents who are only children themselves. In India, the Supreme Court had upheld the Haryana assemblys legal competence to enact a law that could disqualify a member of the municipality for crossing the two-children limit, or debar parents of more than two children from entering panchayats and zilla parishads. In these cases, fundamental or constitutional rights were not violated (contesting elections is not a fundamental right) and there was no curbing of religious freedom. Doggedly working at spreading awareness regarding birth control (particularly in men, who still make most of the reproductive decisions within marriage), with an eye to specific sensitivities and a proper respect for privacy, remains the only way in which modern democracies can deal with the matter.

	Neighbourhood worry                  
	Sir  Sujan Datta has made a useful distinction between terror attacks in India and those carried out in Pakistan (Our terror, their terror, March 31). Originating in Pakistan, their terrorism is not only home-grown but also used by the State as a policy. Mondays terrorist attack in Manawan, coming less than a month after gunmen opened fire on a coach carrying Sri Lankan cricketers to Lahores Gaddafi Stadium, reveals Pakistan to be a nation increasingly undermined by a demon of its own creation. Pakistan has endured scores of suicide attacks in recent years, and faces tremendous pressure from the United States of America to eradicate al Qaida and Taliban insurgents from its soil.          
	Barack Obama has warned that militancy poses a threat to Pakistans very existence, while US officials complain that the nations secret service agencies continue to keep close ties with the insurgents. Only a few hours after Obama outlined his new AfPak strategy of removing militancy from the region, jihadi groups retaliated with the Manawan attack.          
	From whichever way one looks at it, this recent spate of terrorist activities proves that Islamabad is incapable of dealing with the terror operating on its soil. This is a reflection of the complex situation prevailing in Pakistan, and the strike on the police academy is a warning to the US. Baitullah Mehsud, the Taliban leader, responsible for the attack, has sent out a firm message to Obama. The attack brings out the weakness of State institutions as merely half-a-dozen terrorists were able to take a major establishment hostage. An isolated Pakistan will be easily overwhelmed by terrorists, which the world should not allow. If the government, army and the Inter-Services Intelligence are unable to read the writing on the wall, Pakistan itself will turn into a fidayeen bringing its own destruction. More than the West, Pakistanis themselves can only save their country from this chaos.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The terrorist attack in Manawan, just 12 km from the Indian border, underscores the inability of Pakistan to deal with serial terrorist strikes despite unconditional support from the US. In his fight against the Taliban, the US president has been hotly pursuing his Afpak policy vigorously. While Barack Obama recognizes the security challenges emanating from the region, both the US and the Pakistan administrations have learnt next to nothing from the recent terror attacks.           
	While Pakistans ineffectual handling of jihad may still be understandable, the dilemma of the Obama administration in implementing the Afpak strategy fails to convince anyone. What is worrying is the unfailing reliance of the US that the Pakistan army will eventually deliver. Apart from raising the bogey of Kashmir, Pakistans clueless response to its self-created monster is also alarming. A Pakistan reeling under endless internal turmoil is not in the interest of its neighbours.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The editorial, In and out (March 31), was timely but requires some modifications. Instead of trying to be a superhero, Barack Obama should use pragmatism in his Afpak and central Asian policies. One, the US should exit Afghanistan and Iraq immediately as American presence in these two countries is the biggest cause for instability there. Two, Pakistan should be left alone to sort itself out. Three, a one-to-one dialogue with Osama bin Laden should be started (there is no such thing as a moderate Taliban). Four, the US should work closely with Iran by reciprocating what the former president, Mohammad Khatami, tried to do over two terms but failed due to the non-cooperation from the Clinton administration. Finally, India should unilaterally convert the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir into a formal border.           
	Unlike his predecessor, Obama must utilize all the instruments of statecraft to earn the rank of a global statesman. But the steps that he is contemplating will only increase the conflict.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Cultural exchange          
	Sir  In The culture shock (March 30), Ashok Mitra takes an example from a random quiz programme and infers from it a colonial mindset. He is concerned that our youngsters are no longer conversant with Indian history and culture. The real question to ask is whether our schools and our standardized textbooks are teaching these subjects in depth. I am an expatriate with a daughter who has transferred from a highly respected school in Calcutta to an American school in Kuwait. She is doing an Advanced Placement course in world history in high school. I was not only amazed at the depth of scholarship of the American high-school textbook, but also surprised by the explanations on Indian history, religion and culture. The book also presents extracts and reproductions from other publications that cover a different viewpoint.           
	One such extract is from the wonderful discourse on Hinduism made by Abul Fazl at the court of emperor Akbar. Here is a Muslim scholar explaining the tenets of Hinduism to Akbar in all its complexity and beauty and without distortion. Its reproduction in a high school textbook allows children to go straight to its essence.           
	I wish our Indian textbooks were as good. I have met some of my daughters American classmates and am impressed by their depth of knowledge and interest about India (and other cultures), which are pitched at a level much higher than those found in comparable Indian textbooks. Quiz programmes may not be the correct reference point to infer whether our kids are learning about the real India. Mitra, like most of his ilk, is still petrified that some foreign power will come and colonize the country once again. We should all politely disagree with this bogey.           
	Yours faithfully,

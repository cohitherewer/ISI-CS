	Chandrayaan-I, Indias first lunar orbital satellite, is now a free-floating body in outer space following the snapping of Indias radio contact with it. This unexpected closure of Indias first lunar expedition has raised questions about the countrys space programme that could perhaps have been avoided had the scientific team of the Indian Space Research Organization not tried to overreach itself. This it did by first predicting, without sufficient reason, that the satellite would last in space for no less than two years. Isro scientists are now busy trying to argue that since no satellite lasts more than six to seven months, Chandrayaan-I has done well by comparison. This is irrefutable, but Isro could have left the facts to be borne out by actual experience. Had it done so, Isro would not have found itself so desperately trying to prove its credibility, especially since the Chandrayaan-I expedition leaves no room to doubt its success. The second count on which it tripped was on not keeping the public in the loop about what was happening to Chandrayaan-I. The satellite had its first technical problems within months of the launch. In April, its power regulators failed, allowing the satellite to have only 50 per cent of the power it required. In May, its star-sensors failed and the gyroscopes had to take on their function. It should have been apparent by then that the satellite was living on borrowed time. Yet, it was made to appear that the programme was running smoothly.         
	That Isro might have felt compelled to put up a brave front has a lot to say about its need for public acceptance. It is true that government organizations and departments become sitting ducks for public criticism and anger directed against political dispensations in power. But that should be regarded as the starting point of introspection, not self-flagellation. Nor should that prompt any attempt to mislead or misguide public opinion. The Indian space programme has had major successes since it began in the Seventies, and Isro has been its guiding star. Even before Chandrayaan-I had been sent into space to plant the Tricolour on the moon, India had beaten Russia in launching ten satellites into space at one go. Chandrayaan-I had beaten the odds so long because of the expertise of the scientific community. One hopes that together with greater technical skill, other lessons have been learnt as well.

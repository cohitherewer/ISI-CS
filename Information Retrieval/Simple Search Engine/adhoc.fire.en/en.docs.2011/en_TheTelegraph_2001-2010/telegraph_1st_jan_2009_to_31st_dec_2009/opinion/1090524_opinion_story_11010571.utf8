                                                                                                               DIARY
                  
	 Jolted out of her fond dreams of ascending the high chair, Mayavati is now reeling from the bitter aftertaste of defeat. Suddenly, the reality seems quite unbearable. Far from helping their beloved behenji earn the prime ministerial crown, the people of her own state have thrown a crown of thorns at her. As if the sweeping triumph of the Congress wasnt shocking enough, now the Bahujan Samaj Party supremo has to reckon with securing an ignoble third place behind her arch-rival, Mulayam Singh Yadav. The much-touted Dalit-Brahmin bhaichara flopped on its face, as the upper caste candidates got badly trounced. Insult was heaped on injury when the BSP failed to retain even its very own Dalit base. For the time being, Mayavati has retreated from the public eye, presumably for some introspection. But then, Lady Luck isnt exactly smiling on her foes either. Certainly, not on maulana Mulayam, who is devastated by the mass exodus of his most supportive vote bank to the Congress side. At least behenji has the (small) consolation of still being the chief minister. Poor Mulayam, on the other hand, is miles removed from power of any kind. After all, the only reason his party hits the headlines these days is because of a certain someone called Amar Singh.                
	 With the elephant taking a tumble in Uttar Pradesh, the golden days are over for behenjis one-time blue-eyed boy, Sudhir Goel. After being stripped of his ministerial berth, Goel is reportedly on his way out of the Vidhan Parishad as well. But, given the highs and lows of his career, Goel is probably not all that surprised. He lost the information and broadcasting portfolio within months of getting it when he started being a little too chummy with the media. His next avatar, as the minister of science and technology, was short-lived as well. Finally, Goel was denied darshan the other day as behenji addressed a press conference. This seems to be the last straw.                            
	 Defeat is never easy to live with. But for some losers, life seems to be going from bad to worse. The Bharatiya Janata Party may be trying to put up a dignified front in the wake of its appalling loss of face in the polls; but reality, like the ever-volatile electorate, seems to be playing strange games with it. While taking stock of its dismal score-card, the BJP was newly aghast by a strange sleight of hand. The election of six of its Rajya Sabha members to the Lok Sabha is, believe it or not, cause for only limited cheer. The BJP, in fact, is on its way to lose three seats in the Upper House. As per Rajya Sabha norms, the seat vacated by a member causing a by-election goes to the ruling party. So Jaswant Singhs victory in Darjeeling is not all bad news for the Congress as it is set to gain a berth in the Rajya Sabha. Similarly, the victory of Yashwant Sinha is a gain for Congressmen in Jharkhand. And, in spite of the general air of gloom and doom, Murli Mahonar Joshis victory from Varanasi has brought a faint smile on Mayavatis lips: she will now be netting his Rajya Sabha seat. Not only do some people have all the luck, even the silver lining seems to shine on only a few.                            
	 While this election proved to be a glorious steal (in terms of the seat gain) for some, there are others who are flummoxed by more literal losses. The Jai Vilas Palace in Gwalior is in total upheaval over the theft of expensive antique silverware. First, Yashodhara Raje Scindia filed a complaint at the Jhansi Road police station. Moments later, her nephew, Jyotiraditya Scindia, followed suit. As it is, there are strange rumours doing the rounds about the periodic loss of precious artefacts from the palace. Now the people of Gwalior are all curious why the two of them could not have approached the police together. Is it because the word, loss, means rather different things to different people?                            
	 If there was anyone who looked confident about the victory of the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government, it was madam herself. Sonia Gandhi looked the picture of graceful dignity in an exquisite sunset pink sari on the day the results were declared. Apparently, the day before, the All India Congress Committee chief had gone off to an emporium known for its excellent collection of handloom-woven saris to select something special for the big day. On May 16, she emerged in this historic piece of cloth with great lan. Small wonder, Mamata Banerjee got another lucky charm from Dhanekhali for madam as she went to attend her first UPA meeting.                      
	 The spectacular victory of the Congress in the Lok Sabha polls brought goodwill messages from the oddest corners; but nothing could beat the strange reaction in Bangladesh. For once, the battling begums suspended their petty tiffs and sent warm notes to Sonia Gandhi. Sheikh Hasina Wajed, the Awami League chief and prime minister of Bangladesh, rang up the Congress president to remind her of the friendship extended by the Congress regime towards Bangladesh in the 1971 war. Hasina expected the new dispensation in Delhi to be no less supportive of her equally new government in Dhaka. On the other hand, Begum Khaleda Zia, Hasinas rival and leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, made emphatic comments about Indias ever-growing clout in the subcontinent. But the icing was laid on the cake when the Bangladesh high commission, which is supposed to have been soft on the Reds so far, suddenly changed colours and sent a huge bouquet to didi.

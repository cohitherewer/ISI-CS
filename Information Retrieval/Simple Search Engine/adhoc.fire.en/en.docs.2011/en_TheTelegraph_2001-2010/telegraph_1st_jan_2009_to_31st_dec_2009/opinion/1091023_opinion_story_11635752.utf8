	New lessons                  
	Sir  Kapil Sibal, the Union human resource development minister, deserves credit for introducing a new eligibility criterion for the entrance examination to the Indian Institutes of Technology (Class XII cutoff for IITs to be raised, Oct 20). Sibal has been trying to initiate changes in higher education. He has sent a strong message by proposing to increase the score in the higher secondary exams as a minimum requirement for taking the entrance test to the IITs.           
	It is sad that the importance of higher secondary education is diminishing as a result of archaic curricula that the boards follow. To fill that gap, teaching shops, or coaching centres, have been mushrooming all over the country. Education has become a trade, and talent has taken a back seat. It will not be easy to set this right, but the government has to take an active role in this respect.           
	Under the present education system, students suffer owing to the lack of coordination between the Central and the state governments. Because education falls under the concurrent list in the Constitution, many projects fail to be implemented properly. This is due to conflict arising from the shared jurisdiction of the Centre and the states over education. The Centre needs to help state governments improve the education system. However, if a state resists such change, the Centre may have to override the state governments decision and go ahead with its own policies. Besides, the government has to open up to greater private investment in higher education.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The reason that has occasioned the HRD ministry to raise the eligibility criterion for taking the IIT entrance examination is difficult to comprehend. According to the official declaration, this step is meant to ensure that students do not neglect their board examinations. But the proposed cutoff of 80 per cent in the higher secondary examination seems a little too high. Increasing the percentage of marks required to pass by a considerable margin, and enforcing strict rules for marking the papers, would automatically make students take their board exams seriously. This will certainly have an adverse impact on the income of coaching centres meant to prepare students for admission to the IITs. This, in turn, will satisfy the intention of the HRD ministry, which wants to curb the proliferation of teaching shops. Refurbishing the admission process to lure foreign students can have a positive impact in more ways than one. But, at the same time, measures should be taken to ensure that there is no disparity between Indian and foreign students studying in these institutes.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Kapil Sibal appears to be barking up the wrong tree. It is not the IITs or IIMs or even board examinations that need attention. It is secondary and primary education that need to be reviewed. These early stages of learning train children for their future, and it is evident that they have failed in this crucial aspect. Children are becoming wayward because a system of education that concentrates on inculcating civic sense and discipline no longer exists. But such an education is necessary as it imparts basic values to children and helps them become good citizens. In so doing, it would make students naturally competitive. The reforms now being contemplated by Sibal could then become unnecessary.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Too loud          
	Sir  The editorial, Soundly uncivil (Oct 19), hit the nail on the head. It is absolutely true that during Diwali, we had to suffer sound pollution as a result of the behaviour of our fellow citizens. The police may be at fault, but we as citizens have failed as far as civilized behaviour is concerned. The editorial also expressed concern for the newborn, the grievously ill children, as well as the sick and elderly. The noise was such as to be unbearable even for healthy persons.           
	The police should have obstructed the sale and supply of offending crackers. Once the crackers found their way into the hands of the revellers, there was little the police could do. It was just not possible for the police to stop each and every person from bursting crackers. The police were a complete failure, but what about those who celebrated Diwali by indulging in noise pollution? Their conduct can only be explained as contempt for other human beings. The nuisance was more pronounced in suburban towns such as Durgapur, where the police were nowhere to be seen. The price of crackers makes it obvious that the poor could not have purchased them in large numbers. The majority of the revellers belonged to the wealthy and educated class. If such responsible citizens decide to throw away their good sense, there is little that one can do.                    
	Yours faithfully,

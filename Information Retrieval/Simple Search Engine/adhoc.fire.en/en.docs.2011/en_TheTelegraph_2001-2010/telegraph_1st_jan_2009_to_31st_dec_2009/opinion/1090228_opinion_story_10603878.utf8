	Amal Ghosh and Peter Daglish are two senior artists from London who visit Calcutta quite frequently. Their media are vitreous enamel and linocut print respectively, and their styles and sensibilities could not have been more different. This became clear from their joint exhibition, Vitreous enamels and linocut prints, at Ganges Art Gallery (January 16-31). Ghoshs works are mellow and contemplative, whereas Daglishs prints are full of hot-blooded, lusty women, many of them of African origin. His women have angular faces and wear headdresses in geometric shapes. The prints in which he uses clashing shades of red and green or mauve, red, green, blue and black, the colours come close to extemporization in jazz, free-flowing yet structured. Seemingly off-the-cuff, his work carefully conceals art, and makes it look easy.         
	Ghoshs enamel paintings are highly finished and at first glance look like abstract works. He uses dark shades of brown and blue that are close to black with occasional streaks of bright paint that flash through the gloom like red, green or blue lightning. Some of the paler shades suggest dancing lights. Ghoshs technical finesse is evident from the way he manages to delineate the elongated figure of a nude woman or the face of a meditative man against this background of deep tones.

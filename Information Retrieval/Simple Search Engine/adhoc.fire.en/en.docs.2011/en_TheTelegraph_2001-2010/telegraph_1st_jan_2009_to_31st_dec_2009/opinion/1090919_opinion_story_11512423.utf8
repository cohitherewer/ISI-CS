Datta-Ray                                                      
	One of the many stories about Sir Thomas Beecham, the famous English conductor, has him practising with his orchestra when an incredibly tall man slips into the room and sits down in a corner as unobtrusively as he can. You know the king of Sweden, Beecham remarks casually without pausing in his conducting but indicating the newcomer. Norway, actually, the self-effacing King Haakon VII murmurs from his corner.        
	Such an episode is inconceivable in India where anyone with the slightest pretension to prominence will bustle late into a crowded hall, march self-importantly up to the front row or high table, and if all the places are already taken, imperiously demand that another chair be brought up even if it blocks the aisle and everyone elses view. Thats the mark of the arriviste. The sophistication of the old Scots proverb Wherever Macdonald [head of the eponymous clan] sits, there is the head of the table, conveying the essence of aristocratic distinction, is beyond the comprehension of our VIPs.              
	Thats why the current debate over austerity rings so false. The Congress is not to blame. It just happens that being first on the scene, it set the tone for the rest. But the tone it set was determined by much deeper cultural characteristics. Politics is a legitimate career and entitled to its just rewards. But no party of the Right or Left dare concede this because of the power of the myth of selfless service and sacrifice. Krishna Hutheesinghs account of Allahabads original Anand Bhavan being gifted to the nation, and its Dresden and Sevres treasures put away when Motilal Nehru entered politics is the abiding image. It is zealously perpetuated by todays political operators who, being in politics, can afford Dresden and Sevres but wouldnt know what to do with either.        
	When the apolitical Manmohan Singh deplores conspicuous consumption, he is speaking as an economist against unproductive expenditure and as a man of refinement against vulgarity. But when Sonia Gandhi says that in a country like ours, the kind of ostentatious display of wealth we see is unacceptable, she is a political tactician reminding party satraps that the aam admi will not vote for them in a country like ours (the key words) if they behave like a class apart.         
	The image is all. Nursing a juice at a cocktail party, the late Biju Patnaik once told me he avoided anything stronger when wearing what Jawaharlal Nehru called the livery of freedom. The famous cartoon of a dinner-jacketed Deshapriya (thereby hangs another tale) J.M. Sengupta sipping Scotch while his bearer held out his meeting ka kapra (dhoti and kurta) made the point much earlier. Given this obsession, S.M. Krishna and Shashi Tharoor were at fault not for lavishness but for being seen to be lavish. Had simplicity been the true objective, they would not have got away with the own money plea. They would then have been judged guilty of luxurious tastes, accumulating wealth and extravagant spending.        
	My mother would din into me that nothing was more dishonest than the honesty is the best policy adage. Her point was that honesty should be instinctive and without expectation. If it is policy, then its calculation. So, too, with austerity. Lee Kuan Yew illustrated that when he told a Bombay audience that Singapore had not abolished the car pennants, revolving lights, sirens and special number plates so beloved of Indians for any moral reason. It had done so because ruling party politicians who flaunt these symbols are easily recognized and identified with governmental failures. They, therefore, tend to lose elections.        
	Indians are one of the most status-conscious people on earth. Hence the brazen self-assertiveness, described at the beginning, with which prominent citizens trample on the less privileged to muscle their way into the front row. Hence also the story of the carpet in a bureaucrats new office being snipped on all sides to match his grade. The recent Congress directive not to use titles implicitly recognized this hierarchical yearning. Indias liquidation of the princely order did not include a general abolition of titles, as in France where baron and count have been incorporated into names by deed poll. It is not illegal here to address a maharaja as such or as Huzoor or Durbar (other traditional forms), although the imported Highness may need official sanction. Egalitarian affectation at the top will not stop us from creating our own titled elite of lok matas, gurujis, shaheeds, deshaprans, deshabandhus and deshapriyas.         
	Mahatma naturally crowns the titled heap. Undaunted by Sarojini Naidus famous quip, Sonia Gandhi reiterated during the 2007 Satyagraha centenary celebrations the importance of what she called the Gandhian way. Now, Lalu Prasad hopes to hoist her with her own petard by demanding (again disregarding the Naidu barb) more visible adherence to the Gandhian way of austerity. Economy class flights are not enough; ministers must travel by train. Rahul Gandhis pre-emptive gesture of not just train but chair-car provoked Lalu to suggest third-class compartments and unreserved bogies. With elections approaching, we might witness even this parody of austerity.         
	First-class travel was associated in 1937 with British governors and senior civil servants. It was astute strategy then to urge Congressmen to shun Raj practices and highlight the marked contrast between an alien elite and the peoples leaders. Such symbolic gestures invite scorn today. Indians have no need for an example of simple living. Most cannot afford anything else.         
	The need is for substantive action to cut costs, cleanse politics, invigorate a sagging administration and restore public confidence in governance. We need economy more than austerity. None of those aims will be achieved by rescheduling ministerial travel on circuitous commercial flights or by commandeering railway trains. The former can mean more expense; the latter will subject ordinary passengers to the further harassment of elaborate security arrangements for X-rated VIPs on the move.              
	Already, the directive to patronize only Air India has pushed up fares: private passengers are not only saddled with the higher cost of their own tickets but must also foot the bill for officials and politicians who travel free. Its reminiscent of Indira Gandhis horse-drawn buggy preceded and followed by cars in first gear, ostensibly to save on petrol. Austerity is reduced to a self-defeating fetish.        
	Its a moot point whether the obsession with simplicity began with the fakirstriding half-naked up the steps of the viceregal palace or whether he was responding to pre-existing national characteristics. A friend recently sent me an article titled Why Indians dont give back to society whose author, Aakar Patel, cites opportunism, indiscipline, self-aggrandizement, indifference to morality and a transactional attitude to god (I give you this, you give me that). These attributes explain, according to the author, why we worship Vishnu, manager of the cosmos, and Siva, its eventual destroyer but not Brahma the creator. He has nothing to offer us. What he could do for us, create the universe, he already has. There is no gain in petitioning him now.               
	Politicians who would ram what they think is Gandhian austerity down our throats would do well to read Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi on the subject. Austerity, he wrote, implies external renunciation, endurance, and sometimes even hypocrisy. He much preferred saintliness which he called an inner quality of the soul. But inner saintliness cannot be imposed by fiat. Nor can it be displayed for public exhibition. Austerity, on the other hand, is threatening to snowball into a countrywide frenzy recalling The Witches of Salem. Even the private sector has fallen prey to a craze that Gandhi thought external and hypocritical and which further distracts attention from the countrys real needs.

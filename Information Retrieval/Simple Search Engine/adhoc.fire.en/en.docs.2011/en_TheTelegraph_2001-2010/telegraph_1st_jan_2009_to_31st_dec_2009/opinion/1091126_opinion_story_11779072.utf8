                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        WAITING WITH TREPIDATION                                                                  
	Nothing usually changes in Mumbai except the real estate. Being the commercial capital of India and being the biggest investment banking headquarters of South Asia, Mumbai is a natural target for any organization bent on hitting the Indian economy. As the headquarter of the western naval command, coast guards and various intelligence agencies, Mumbai and its surrounding area have never had any dearth of operational forces, but always suffered due to the absence of those two crucial requirements  cooperation and coordination.         
	Every department had the command and control in place, but did not have the space for cooperation with and coordination among one another in a crisis. Hence no intelligence could be thought of as an actionable intelligence  could not be followed and acted upon because of a possible waste of time, energy, money and manpower. This single drawback in the system persisted rather too long, giving miscreants the chance to hit Mumbai hard, and India harder. Thus the Mumbai blast of March 12, 1993 resulted in mayhem, and 26/11 created an unprecedented fear psychosis across the country. Maritime threat can no longer be ignored.        
	For a change perhaps, a sense of urgency can be felt as the Indian navy is made responsible for overall maritime security, thereby replacing the coast guards, who have so long policed over 2.01 million square kilometres of Indias exclusive economic zone, and 4,104 nautical miles of the coastline. Coordination, which was conspicuous by its absence before, would now take place through the national command, control, communication and intelligence network, linking the operation rooms of the navy and the coast guards with active support from operation centres at Mumbai, Kochi, Visakhapatnam and Port Blair. Incidentally, the head of all these organizations is a three-star vice admiral. In a way, therefore, not much has changed, only the existing command system and operation procedures have been upgraded. The problem is that there (always) exists a time lag between terrorist attacks and the turning of the States defense machinery.        
	It is true that things are going to be much more difficult for terrorists when, for the first time, 13 agencies have been roped in for security manoeuvres under the navy. There is now more effective analysis and dissemination of information on the ground and this urgency perhaps was not felt earlier, says the Union minister of state for defence, M.M. Pallam Raju. What darkens this optimistic scene is the fact that the proposed maritime security advisory board, a central body for coordinating all the 13 agencies, has not yet been set up.        
	The minimum security deterrent is unlikely to be complete without the establishment of this board, think many responsible professionals associated with it. This delay, which many consider to be avoidable, seems to be the product of the usual bureaucratic system of extra-checks and extra-caution.        
	In this background, one can understand the concern of the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, who believes in the possibility of the recurrence of 26/11 owing to the adoption of terrorism as an instrument of State policy by Pakistan. The next target could very well be the organization and the people in charge of the nations maritime security after 26/11.        
	This may sound absurd, but if one watches the non-State actors of Pakistan (created by the State itself) killing high-ranking officers, one will get a vision of the future. Also, one may recall the American naval ship, Cole, being attacked by terrorists off the coast of Aden a few years ago. Hence, the mighty and expensive naval assets of India could well be the targets of terrorists. India should not forget the RDX bombs being landed on the Mumbai coast in 1993 and then the serial blasts on March 12 that year. What next?                          ABHIJIT BHATTACHARYYA

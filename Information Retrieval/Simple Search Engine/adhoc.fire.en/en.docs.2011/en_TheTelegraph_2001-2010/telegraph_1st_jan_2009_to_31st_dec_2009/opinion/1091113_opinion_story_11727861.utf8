	Like Calcutta, Varanasi and Paris, Goa is a trap for photographers. Theres Trashy Goa and theres Old Goa, each with its own set of visual clichs waiting to gobble up the unwary eye. The way to get past the problem is, of course, not to do Goa at all and look for other kinds of subject. But if one still finds oneself with a camera in Goa wanting to make a book, then the thing to do, perhaps, is to forget that this is Goa and bring to what one is photographing something larger, deeper and beyond the place, the people and the medium. This kind of work would have more to do with what is going on inside the photographers head  the world behind, rather than in front of, his eyes. It is his mind that will make his Mapusa, but only if it has something of its own to bring to Mapusa. That ineffable something would have nothing intrinsically to do with Goa or even with photography, but with the richness of the photographers inner and outer lives, his evolving relationships with art, life and himself. The rest, especially in photography, is technology and luck, for neither of which a serious artist would want to take much credit.         
	Prabuddha Dasguptas EDGE OF FAITH (Seagull, $29), with an essay by William Dalrymple, is a serious attempt at photographing Catholic Goa. It is also a carefully designed book that tries to bring together image, text, material and form to realize what one would have liked to call a distinctive vision. But what is this book a distinctive vision of? And to what extent does it make the reader look at, think about, and get to know, a subject that cannot be reduced to a label like Catholic Goa? Dayanita Singhs show, Demello Vado (2000), at Goas Saligao Institute and her book, Privacy (Steidl, 2003), are formidable predecessors to this body of black-and-white work by Dasgupta and to the shape he gives to it as a book. One looks for, and does not quite find, an informing originality in Dasguptas photography that takes Edge of Faith in a significantly new or different direction. Dileep Prakashs colour work, The Anglo-Indians (Photoink, 2007), also comes somewhat in Dasguptas way. There are arresting portraits, interiors, textures and details. But the promise of something more in Dasguptas use of Sukrita Paul Kumars fine little poem, Unloyal Memory, of a quality of feeling or thought that takes photography beyond the documentary towards art or literature, never quite materializes in the book as a whole.        
	Dalrymples formula always works: an effortless prose that narrates and informs with equal felicity. He never fails to find just the right sort of exotica in the midst of the familiar, enlightening and entertaining without making too much of a demand on the easy elegance of coffee- tables in Jor Bagh or Islington. But his essay, placed before the pictures, gently diffuses, instead of intensifying, their sharpness. He does not try to gloss the pictures, which is good, but neither does he open up new ways of looking at photographs that take history or ethnography to another level of perception.                    AVEEK SEN

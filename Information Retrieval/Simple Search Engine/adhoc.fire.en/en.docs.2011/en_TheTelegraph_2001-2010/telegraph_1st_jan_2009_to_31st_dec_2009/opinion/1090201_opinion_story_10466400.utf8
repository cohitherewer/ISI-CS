                              The chosen one        
	 Some people have all the luck, and AK Antony is certainly one of them. On the eve of the Republic Day celebrations, with Manmohan Singh confined to his hospital bed, all eyes were turned on Pranab Mukherjee. But then Pranabda did not get to play king... er... prime minister for a day. Lady Fortunas grace fell, yet again, on Antony. Twice before he had become the chief minister of his home state by sheer fluke, when his sworn rival, K Karunakaran, resigned in a huff. He inched his way into the Rajya Sabha during the Narasimha Rao years, thanks, once again, to Karunakarans moody exit. Finally, when Natwar Singh was shown the door in the wake of the Iraq oil scam, Antony found himself in the cabinet. And so the journey continues: from the defence ministry to becoming the public face of the nation on one of the most auspicious days in the political calendar. Pranabda may have been given additional portfolios and responsibilities in the PMs absence, but destinys favourite child has stolen the show again.                
	 The past seems to be catching up with M Karunanidhi in the strangest of ways: through an acute pain in the back. Recently, the ageing patriarch had to be rushed to hospital with a terrible backache, and was promptly advised bedrest for a few weeks. The DMK chief blames his failing health on an injury he suffered during his midnight arrest in 2001, when he was dragged away by the police unceremoniously. He was hit on the shoulder then, and that pain still lingers. Karunanidhi may not be able to campaign for the forthcoming Lok Sabha polls, but party managers are not too worried. Their leaders chip on the shoulder, they hope, will turn into a blessing in disguise. Since Karunanidhis painful back dates from the time J. Jayalalithaa came back to power, it may well become a good excuse to bolster public sympathy.                             
	 Ghulam Nabi Azad, we hear, had been on a pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina, and it is not all that difficult to guess why he went there. After all, things have been going splendidly well for him over the past few weeks, and he has very good reasons to be thankful to the almighty. First, he was given the privilege of completing his tenure as the chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir. And although he stepped down graciously to make way for Omar Abdullah after the assembly polls, the Congress did manage to retain a share of the political pie. Even better, Mufti Mohammed Sayeed, who is not in the best of terms with Azad, was put to his place. What more could a man ask for?       
	But the grapevine tells us that Azad did not merely stop at thanking god; he prayed for something more. Indeed, over the next few months, Azad would need all the help he can get. His name is already doing the rounds for a Rajya Sabha nomination from his home state. And he certainly does not seem averse to the idea of contesting the Lok Sabha elections. Since he has recently won as an MLA from Jammu and Kashmir, chances of his success look high. God willing, win he will.                            
	 A new star is rising from 24 Akbar Road. Janardhan Dwivedi, popularly known as JD, has suddenly found himself handling grave responsibilities. First, the AICC gen-sec was sent off to Raipur as an emissary of the party high command, where he had to deal with the belligerent Ajit Jogi. Having taken care of Jogi and, what more, having installed a Congress MLA opposed to Jogi and Co, JD went on to Jammu and Kashmir. The local satraps were tamed there as well. His next stop was Orissa, where the seasoned warhorse, JB Patnaik, had to be given a stern talking to. This massive clean-up operation over, Dwivedi was heard briefing the media about his partys plans to go to the Lok Sabha elections on its own, without roping in allies at the national level. JDs flurry of activities has reminded cynics of the former gen-sec, Diggy Raja, and the way he tried to emerge larger than everyone else. But the buzz in the AICC headquarters is that JD is vying to become political secretary to the Congress president. Thats still some way left to go.                            
	 Lal Krishna Advani, with a brand new web address, may have turned tech savvy, but technology is yet to arrive in Indian politics. A vast majority of MPs, though provided with laptops, tend to remain computer illiterate. Or should we say, they remain learners forever, since most of them fail to return their machines at the end of their parliamentary term?                  
	 For a manglik bahu, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan has brought quite a bit of luck to Big B and his family so far. This newest member of the Bachchan parivar has no doubt enhanced the glamour of the first family of Bollywood. And now, it seems, she has been given a new role to play by the first family of Indian politics. The Padma award conferred on her by the UPA government has, presumably, bestowed on her this new responsibility, or so the friends of the Bachchans and the Gandhis say. With Ash willing to play the peace-maker, a new chapter is likely to open up in the long-standing feud between the two houses. Perhaps Amar Singh had a point indeed when he decided to cast Ash in the role of a goodwill ambassador. Abhishek, too, has been making soothing noises for a while now, saying that he has no problem with the new generation mending broken ties. His cousin, Bhim (son of Ajitabh), was recently seen dining with Rahulbaba at a prominent restaurant in Delhi. This is what we call true dostana.

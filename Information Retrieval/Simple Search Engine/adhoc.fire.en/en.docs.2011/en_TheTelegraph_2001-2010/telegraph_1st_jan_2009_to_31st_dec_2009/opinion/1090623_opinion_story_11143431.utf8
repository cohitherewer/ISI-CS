                                                                                                                 ODD NUMBERS                                                    
	Nothing short of fresh elections, conducted with a new set of rules and independent monitoring, can resolve the crisis in Iran. But so far this has not been a plausible option for the highest authorities of the country  nor is it ever likely to be. After all the hard work they had put into bringing the president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, back for another four-year term, the very idea of a re-election would sound like infamy. The supreme leader of the nation declared Mr Ahmadinejad victorious even before the official counting was over. Incredible figures were released soon after: the winner apparently got 65 per cent of the vote on an 85 per cent turnout, leaving his rival, Mir Hossein Mousavi, far behind. Credulity was stretched even further when it emerged that in some provinces the turnout had exceeded 100 per cent (it is traditional in Iran to vote using identification papers of the dead). The overall increase in the conservative vote across different provinces varied between 113 per cent and 296 per cent compared to the 2005 polls. Mr Mousavis huge defeat, especially in Tabriz, his home city, only suggests a most absurd theory: unexplained mass defection among his own supporters.        
	Ten days of relentless street demonstrations and sporadic outbursts of violence have forced the rulers to rethink their strategies. To win some, they have to lose some. So they have conceded that around three million votes were indeed dubious. There is not just safety but also shrewd political sense in this number. First, it comes nowhere close to the ten million votes that were allegedly rigged. Whats better, Mr Ahmadinejad not only gets to keep the high chair, but is also able to put a sheen of credibility on his own government  a discrepancy has been admitted, but the admission is not going to change the big picture one bit. The mayhem is going to get only worse until new elections are called. But then, even such a decision is not going to ensure Mr Mousavi instant success. Repolling will only give him another chance to wager his luck. After all, it is deeply intriguing, and telling, that so far the strongest support for Mr Ahmadinejads claims has come from analysts of American think-tanks. After conducting phone polls across all the 30 provinces weeks before the elections, they had given Mr Ahmadinejad a 2-1 lead  which is consistent with the officially released figures. People can be oddly unpredictable.

	It is an ill wind that does nobody any good. We should be thankful, the hell let loose in Charminar city has brought to a halt the daily sermon to the nation from the till-now-holier-than-thou IT barons. Some of them have turned out to be crooks.        
	But are the confidence-tricksters, parading as the most sagacious of business and industrial leaders, the only parties responsible for the developing mess in the global economic system we are now an integral part of? Corporate crime is a cooperative venture. Those identified as scam leaders in corporate bodies have abettors on the side. The part played by accountants and auditors is, of course, obvious; they often conspire with company bosses to create illusions of paradise when the reality is vastly different. The two species in the profession equally share the guilt. The internal auditors cook the books at the behest of the bosses, the external auditors are much too smart a lot not to know what is taking place; they, nonetheless, go along. Have a heart, it is a fiercely competitive world. If they do not join the conspiracy of fraud, the company management would remove them and have another set of external auditors. So they choose to be abettors, before, during and after the event.         
	Should the list of felons be left at that? What about the tribe of economists, employed in stock exchanges, banks, investment firms, insurance agencies, public administration and, let it be added, academia?               
	It is a sorry story. The past quarter of a century has seen economics reach a dead end. An enormous quantity of economic literature generated in this period concentrates on speculation on the interrelations among risk, uncertainty and profit. The focus of most of the research to unravel these interrelations is from the point of view of an individual or a business firm; the rest of the universe has no place in the investigations. In the process, economists have strained to be helpful to only that thin stratum of society, which has its eye only on the main chance; those keen to know how risk is minimized under different conditions of uncertainty and, at the same time, profit-taking gets maximized. Economists oblige. Making alternative assumptions, they build model after model illuminating in diverse manner the point that, notwithstanding looming uncertainties, profit could indeed skyrocket, provided one dares to undertake risks of particular kinds.         
	This is, however, playing with fire. The global economy and its components constitute a complex Pandoras box. How human beings with heterogeneous backgrounds will react to situations and circumstances that are out of the ordinary cannot always be faithfully reflected in patterns suggested by mathematical models. But fly-by-night operators are impatient beings, and are filled with vaulting ambition. They are not satisfied with the normal levels of profit existing market forces ensure. They want more and are delighted when they discover a cluster of people, inhabiting university campuses, who love to display stratagems that could lift normal profits to regions of the absurdly abnormal.         
	This category of economists is lapped up by banks, insurance firms, investment companies, stock exchanges, corporate bodies. Maybe the latter are only too eager to be led up the garden path. Nonetheless, they make their crucial decisions because of encouragement from a group of people who mesmerize them by their apparently academic wizardry. Economists tell the supposedly practical people how to dare to dare, what safety positions to occupy in the event of emergence of particular kinds of peril. Whether the advice they render would, if implemented, have any repercussions  big, medium or small  across the entire range of the economic universe is no part of their agenda. And they can provide no warranty either that their advice, even if followed to the hilt, is risk-proof for their clients.        
	Another scatter of so-called economists soon join the fun and games. They carve out for themselves a fascinating and hazardous sphere of activity. Adept at slipping in and out of the swirling waves of differential equations, with a reasonably fast computer at their disposal, they work out involved mathematical formulae to explain how the derivative of a share could be manipulated to look extraordinarily covetable. The over-greedy ones who love to play around in the share markets are ensnared in no time; so are investment banks and company promoters. They are all quick learners. They start splitting shares into wildly generous numbers of derivatives and offer these to the market. From then on, avarice refuses to be reined in: why stop only with hawking derivatives, why not launch into derivatives of derivatives, and proceed even further, market derivatives of derivatives of derivatives?        
	Much of the chaos the global economy is currently enmeshed in is the outcome of the extravaganza set in motion by economists in love with the mystique of their artefact. They provide the inspiration for an unscrupulous bunch of speculators to create illusions of paradise, yielding fabulous returns out of nothing. The paradise is always a private paradise, the cost to society in case some crooks cut clever corners is not taken into account. Nor does it ever occur to these hoodoo experts that hallucinations have, inevitably, a terminating point; the withdrawal symptoms are devastating and harshly real.               
	Dig a little more, and it will be discovered that a considerable component of the economists contributing to the mayhem is made up of frustrated mathematicians or rejected physicists. In the abstract world of mathematics, one can make any number of far-out assumptions, construct the most weird assortment of models and arrive at the wildest of conclusions. As long as these exercises remain locked in in the computer, they serve a purpose reasonably harmless, titillating the ego of the mathematician at play. It is only when the mathematically coherent, but societally dangerous, abstract formulations are sought to be made operational within the framework of the real world that the volcano erupts; the reveries of hypothesizing of an idling economist turn into fearfully lethal instruments of disaster.         
	Economics, in its earlier progeny, was committed to the cause of expanding the wealth and welfare of society, embracing the entire spectrum of human beings. It has been reduced to an exclusive device to create, by hook or by crook, wealth and more wealth for a handful in society, never mind if the rest of humanity is thereby condemned to pestilential living. Another set of these practitioners love to play Satan and tempt the citizenry to take wild leaps into a speculative bliss-promising future; the future, it is eventually realized, will not walk anywhere near the fantasy.         
	Economists  that is, unbound economists, those who follow the whims of their intellect and have managed to forget what a social conscience is  are dangerous animals. They should be kept in their lair and never let out.

	The Congress will, of course, not say it. Not just because polite society has its own norms, the Opposition too has skirted round the real issue in the parliamentary discussions on the India-Pakistan joint statement. That the venue chosen for the statement was a Non-Aligned Movement gathering was neither here nor there; it was signed at the prodding of the United States of America. Its contents mdash; interpreted in India as slightly tilting towards Pakistan on account of the reference to lsquo;threats rsquo; in Baluchistan mdash; were again something Foggy Bottom must have persuaded India to, please, go along with. Both subcontinental countries are now firmly launched as strategic partners of the US, courtesy demands that subsidiary partners offer, every now and then, a helping hand when the major domo encounters trouble  
	And the US, indeed, is in deep difficulties. It has been laid low by the worst economic recession in eight decades. Resources are being drained away by economic fire-fighting operations at home. 9/11 was a good enough pretext for George W. Bush to overrun Iraq and capture and kill Saddam Hussein. However, the American nation is convinced that that outrage was more the handiwork of al Qaida and its alter ego, the Taliban currently entrenched in Afghanistan. The Taliban must be destroyed. Crushing them is proving to be no easy matter though. Coming on top of the seemingly inexorable entanglement in Iraq, the expedition against the Taliban, who have meanwhile spilled over into Pakistan, calls for deployment of enormous further resources, including human resources. The recession-hit US is in a jam. The Western allies are most reluctant to send their troops to be ambushed and killed in Afghanistan. The Obama administration is also under pledge to the electorate to wind down the war in West Asia. In the circumstances, the allies in South Asia have to be called upon to bail out the US. The obvious first choice, Pakistan, abuts Afghanistan and, in any case, is already a hotbed of Taliban conspiracy.   
	But there have been problems. Pervez Musharraf, whom the Americans had lent full support in the beginning, was losing his grip over the countrys military establishment. He was careless enough to let the Taliban penetrate into the countrys Inter-Services Intelligence, and committed the equally grievous folly of allowing them both to take control of most of the countrys mosques and set up thousands of madrasas to indoctrinate Pakistans younger generation. He therefore needed to be replaced. The US administration preferred Bhuttos Pakistan Peoples Party to Nawaz Sharifs Pakistan Muslim League as the former promised a firmer anti-Taliban stand. Still, Zardari cannot fight on two fronts; there must be some sort of dtente with the traditional enemy, India, before Pakistan could give its undivided attention to the task of tackling the Taliban.         
	Americans, appreciative of Pakistans argument, have gone to work. The US has enough clout to nudge a reluctant India to the negotiation table with Pakistan. The emerging Indian middle class has not only nuclear ambitions; it has also begun to weave dreams to be Chinas equal in military and industrial might. The US administration is willing to humour India along in the matter and supply the much-coveted weaponry, including the strategically most sensitive ones. It is, however, going to be a conditional willingness: the contours of New Delhis foreign policy must not stray beyond guidelines set by Foggy Bottom. Actually, Americans are in a position to drive home another advantage. While Indias merchandise exports are declining, close to 90 billion dollars accrue to the country from software exports to the US; another 60 billion dollars are coming in as remittances by expatriate Indians serving mostly as software technicians there. This total kitty of 150 billion dollars is sustaining the comfortable, often luxurious, living of Indias affluent class, who also happen to be the backbone of support for the ruling politicians.         
	The US administration is thus well placed to cajole the Indian authorities into seeing reason. Not that New Delhi has not done its own arithmetic. Given the overlapping class base of the two main political parties in the country, it is not difficult to persuade them to reach a tacit agreement to abide by American advice to go somewhat easy with Pakistan. Since one of the two parties constitutes the major Opposition, it has to make the standard noises alleging compromise of national interests embedded in the Sharm el-Sheikh statement. The reference to Baluchistan is irksome, but a balancing factor is Pakistans admission that 26/11 was perpetrated by its citizens, to apprehend whom the Interpol has been called in. Pakistan has also banned a number of terrorist outfits named by India. The greater cause  to be on the right side of the US  needs to prevail. It is for the sake of that cause too that the odious arrangement on end-use inspection of sensitive weaponry and materiel shipped from the US has to be swallowed. Common sense must not be taken leave of: once you have signed the nuclear deal with the US, you have already accepted the cloying provisions of the Hyde Act.        
	So far, so good. The Americans, however, have yet other ambitions. It is their covert desire that India should also agree to recognize the Taliban as the principal threat to its own national security. Once that realization dawns, India too, the Americans hope, will agree to form a joint front with Pakistan against the Taliban. In pure vernacular, the US wants India to bear, sooner or later, sooner rather than later, a part of the burden of fighting the Taliban. For is it not a great noble cause? South Asia, along with the rest of the world, has to be made rid of those barbarians, the Taliban, who have been terrorizing India through surreptitious attacks organized by subsidiary outfits. India should not, must not, flinch from deploying its troops and security forces to the hilt to fight the common enemy. To optimize the effectiveness of the effort, India should also explore the possibility of joint action with Pakistan under the umbrella of the overall strategy mapped out in the Pentagon.                     
	A century and a half later, India is no longer enslaved in the technical sense. But there is such a thing as enlightened self-interest; the countrys rising middle class might still agree to share, if not in full, at least in part, the burden of Americas Taliban war. It knows which side its class bread is buttered.         
	Someone, some day, will perhaps have the guts to tell the US that the problem is not the pestilential common enemy, the Taliban, representing global terror; it is the American establishment which is the problem. Their overarching aspiration is to establish a global hegemony; therefore wars have to be launched in different parts of the world, people have to be killed and civilizations destroyed. The Indian middle class will have no part in such plain-speaking, at least not at this juncture when they never had it so good. The Indian parliament, it follows, will only indulge in genteel debates.

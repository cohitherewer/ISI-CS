	In an ironic twist, on the very day that the acting finance minister, Pranab Mukherjee, announced a third fiscal stimulus package, Standard amp; Poors, the global rating agency, downgraded Indias credit rating to near-junk status. The rationale for SandPs downgrade was the alarming increase in the governments fiscal deficit brought about by tax cuts and additional government spending; the latest stimulus package is estimated to cost around Rs 30,000 crore and add about 0.5 per cent to the already very high fiscal deficit for the year, taking it to a consolidated level over 11 per cent of the gross domestic product. The measures comprise a reduction in the median excise rate  from 10 to eight per cent  and a service tax cut  from 12 to 10 per cent  that become effective immediately. The impact of the reduction in median excise duty will be minimal, as goods on which excise is charged at higher or lower than the median rate are likely to remain unaffected. The impact of the service tax reduction is not likely to make a very big difference to ordinary consumers, assuming that the cuts will actually be passed on. But for companies whose margins are being squeezed remorselessly by high input costs, the effects on balance sheets are likely to be beneficial. Observers and analysts wonder why Mr Mukherjee used the fig-leaf of constitutional propriety when he presented the interim budget on February 16, when he could just as easily have included these measures in that budget itself.        
	The package has not stopped companies from clamouring for more, especially in the form of further interest rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of India. An interest rate cut by the central bank is widely anticipated, and the RBI governor, D. Subbarao, has indicated that he is not averse to one should the circumstances warrant it. But the timing of the cut could be fairly important. In yesterdays auction of government bonds, the RBI rejected several bids which would have raised the yield on government securities, signalling that it wants to keep interest rates at current levels or lower. Keeping rates low would also keep the interest costs for government borrowing low. The RBI could, however, cut policy rates towards the end of March; that would improve the asset value of bank investments in government securities that will hopefully provide impetus to an economic revival and the fiscal stimulus package.         
	But the chances of an economic revival in the next three months look fairly small. What is more likely, sadly, is the real possibility of another ratings downgrade when the new government takes office after the elections.

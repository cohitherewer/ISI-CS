	Floating coffin                  
	Sir  The Indian navy had objected to being saddled with a decrepit carrier like the Gorshkov (A scam to shame Bofors, July 25), but all its objections have been overruled. The arms market operators usually bribe selected politicians from both the ruling and the opposition parties in the target country. India has consistently sidelined its indigenous weapon manufacturers because they can only offer peanuts as bribe. Therefore, the country has been importing arms for over six decades in spite of the fact that our military scientists are among the best in the world and can provide our armed forces with first-rate equipment.           
	Yours faithfully,       
J.K. Dutt, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Most of the defence deals that India has entered into with other countries have invariably generated controversy. The Swedish Bofors field guns scam and the German HDW submarines come to mind. The decision to purchase Gorshkov, the aircraft carrier from Russia, is the latest in this history. Let us hope that we will not have to rename it the floating coffin, in keeping with the nickname, flying coffin, given to its cousin, the Mig 21, from the same supplier, because of its inferior quality.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Arun Malankar, Mumbai

                
	New image          
	Sir  The Trinamul Congresss annual Martyrs Day rally in Esplanade on July 21 had perhaps the biggest turnout that Calcuttans have ever seen. But Mamata Banerjee in her changed political demeanour is something to look out for (Mamatas sonar Bangla (2011-), July 22). Although she lambasted the present government during her speech, she remained composed on the whole, like a pragmatic statesman. She also managed to bring together on one stage eminent people like the writer Mahasweta Devi, theatre personality Bratya Basu, painter Suvaprasanna and academic Sunanda Sanyal. Nachiketa and the TMC member of parliament, Kabir Suman, singing together that rainy afternoon was also new.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Subhayu Saha, Khagra, Murshidabad

                
	Sir  Mamata Banerjees popularity has grown because of her ability to interact with the masses. Now when the people of West Bengal are dissatisfied with the performance of the Left Front government, one hopes that Banerjee maintains her tempo and encourages her party workers to connect with the people as well, so that she may win the 2011 state polls. She must also ensure that the ten commandments she had outlined in her Martyrs Day speech are followed.           
	Yours faithfully,       
A.S. Mehta, London

                
	Little merit          
	 Sir  The Sikh community is deeply hurt by your paper depicting a Sikh police officer in womans attire (Do it to dont do it, July 18). On behalf of the Sikh community, we strongly condemn this insensitive portrayal, which has caused anguish to men and women alike. Your disclaimer does not absolve you of responsibility. The Sikh community, which specially patronizes your paper, never expected such mockery of a loyal community that has courageously fought against the Moghuls, the British raj. Moreover, in our religion, Guru Nanak granted equal status to women. So how can you depict them as creatures of inaction?                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Jagmohan Singh Gill, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The IAS and IPS Associations of West Bengal strongly condemn the depiction of the chief minister and senior civil servants draped in saris. Members of both associations consider this effort to heap indignities on individual officials as draped in humour to be in extremely poor taste. This is not generally associated with a publication of your repute.          
	There is little merit in a senseless debate on the merits of moulding public opinion on the basis of selective quotes from senior officials about unfortunate incidents that are beyond their control. While criticism of the government, its policies and the conduct of its top bureaucrats is your prerogative, we unequivocally condemn this effort to use traditionally biased notions of gender inequality in order to represent eto bhanga Bangadesh, tobu range bhara. We feel that this is singularly unjust to the contribution of outstanding women politicians, bureaucrats and police officials. Our anguish was made worse by the national emblem worn with pride by the caricatured version of director-general and inspector-general of police in West Bengal on his uniform.          
	We believe that the newspaper-reading public is more concerned with the increase in political intolerance and conflict, and shares the nationwide concern about the decline of the rule of law and the economic recession. Everybody appreciates the value of a good laugh, and the work of many cartoonists has been enjoyed over the years. But this is not to indulge such questionable journalism, together with the futile effort to justify the communication of a political message.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Sanjeev Chopra, secretary, IAS Association, and Vivek Sahai, secretary, IPS Association, Calcutta

                
	Parting shot          
	Sir  Apart from ensuring less poison in the air, the July 24 transport strike also led to much less congestion on the roads. This clearly shows that keeping private buses and taxis off the roads can considerably reduce traffic problems. If the state government runs even half the number of private and mini buses that ply the streets now in addition to its existing fleet, the commuting problems of Calcutta will be solved. Government buses should not stop at unscheduled stops, a habit common among private and mini-bus drivers, causing accidents and congestion. The city will also be less polluted, assuming that government vehicles will have regular checks.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Amitava Banerjee, Calcutta

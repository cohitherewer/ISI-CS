	Stark picture                  
	Sir  The dark secrets of the apparently sophisticated and decorous corporate culture that attracts so many people, especially ambitious freshers who cherish the dream of discovering its undisclosed allures, have presently come out in the open. After the Satyam scandal, commonly held beliefs about corporate ethics and mission have to change. We all know now what filthy activities and immoral gaming control todays world, which is still shivering from the shock of the economic recession. In his article, Economists unbound (Jan 30), Ashok Mitra delineates the realities of a world in which economists, in connivance with the apex bodies of corporate houses, cheat the investors. Mitra talks about the internal and external auditing wings of corporate houses that deliberately misappropriate and misrepresent the account structure so as to mislead the shareholders. However frightening the picture painted by Mitra might seem, almost all of it is likely to be true.           
	Todays industrial leaders, while engaging in the most dubious of practices, will highlight their performance in the gaudiest of colours so as to attract as many customers as possible. What is most shocking is the fact that high-profile academics conspire with these business barons to thwart the aspirations of the ordinary man. Such depraved professionals, whether they are economists or auditors, are the enemies of our society. Their crime is unpardonable, and should be treated as such by the judiciary. But before they are punished, attention needs to be paid to the managing bodies of different corporate houses that are compelling these men to commit these disastrous crimes. We should not forget that though big financial crimes are punishable, the damage brought about by these misdeeds cannot be repaired easily.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Pranab Hazra, Asansol 

      
	Sir  Within a capitalistic and semi-globalized structure, corporate crimes are unavoidable, no matter how much the corporate houses choose to reform their ethics of functioning. Ashok Mitra is being unfair when he includes the economist in the circle of such corruption. Industrial leaders and economists are not the same. Their professions are different. Economic modelling, as shown in theory by the economist, can hardly take all the different aspects of real economy into account. As such, Mitra is being harsh in labelling economists as dangerous animals. However, economists should be honest if our faith in the intelligentsia and the academic community is to be kept intact.           
	Yours faithfully,      
R. Subhranshu, Chandernagore 

                
	Common needs           
	Sir  The government recently reduced the prices of petrol, kerosene and cooking gas. Keeping in mind middle-class customers, who have been hard hit by the soaring costs of essential commodities like pulses, vegetables and edible oil, will the government lower the prices of these goods as well? As a middle-class consumer, I shall be grateful to the government if it heeds my request.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Inderjit Singh Lamba, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Kerosene is supposed to sell at Rs 9 per litre in ration shops. The fuel is highly subsidized, and this creates heavy losses for the government. The subsidies are there for the benefit of the consumers living below the poverty line. But contrary to popular belief, it is the middle segment of the society that consumes this fuel more than the lower income group. Instead of helping the poor, the subsidy merely serves to create a huge black market for kerosene. Ration shop-goers scramble for their share of the fuel and then sell it in the black market. These days, kerosene is actually being sold at Rs 28 per litre.           
	Imagine the amount of money that the government would have recovered by way of VAT revenue if it knew that kerosene is being sold at this price. The governments loss is twofold since black marketers are also not going to declare their profits and pay income tax. The problem could have been solved if the government sold kerosene at variant prices through two different channels. The fuel can be sold at the subsidized rate in ration shops, and at Rs 25/28 a litre at petrol pumps for those able to pay a higher price and not willing to stand in queues at the ration shops.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Barani Kumar, Chennai 

                
	Sir  As soon as the West Bengal government has announced that transport fares will be slashed, bus operators are threatening to go on a strike. Such reactions appear to be part of a charade that is played out each time a proposal to reduce fares is declared. The government proclaims, the operators go on a strike, and then everything goes back to square one. The nexus that seems to operate between the state transport department and the unions benefits both the parties involved. The only losers are the common men, who bear the brunt of rising prices while others make merry.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Saaba Ahmed, Calcutta

                
	Parting shot           
	Sir  It is not surprising that the self-appointed cultural icon of Delhi, Khushwant Singh, will champion the cause of pub-culture and of the scantily-clad, drinking, prancing, pub-hopping women who were attacked by activists of the Sri Ram Sena in Mangalore (A clash of civilizations, Feb 7). The actions of Sri Ram Sena cannot be supported. At the same time, Singh and his ilk should be told that dancing in pubs, discos or nightclub is neither a cultural activity nor does it represent the landmark of any civilization. As such, what happened at Mangalore cannot be called a clash of civilizations. Notwithstanding a handful of defenders of modernity, Indian society in general tends to look at club-hopping men and women with disdain. This general disapproval is good enough. The Ram Sena need not have gone overboard in its self-righteousness.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
A. Roy Mukherjee, Calcutta

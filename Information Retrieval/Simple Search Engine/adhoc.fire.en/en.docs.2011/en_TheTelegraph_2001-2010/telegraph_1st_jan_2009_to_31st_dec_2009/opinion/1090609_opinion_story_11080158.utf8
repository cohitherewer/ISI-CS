	For never serious misgiving
  Occurred to anyone
  Though in the light of recent researches
  Many would find the cause
  In a not uncommon form of terror;
  Others, still more astute,
  Point to possibilities of error
  At the very start.  W.H. Auden        
	When in crisis fall back on fundamentals: this has been a well-known instrument of political practice. The Communist Party of India (Marxist), after a humiliating defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, has decided to do just that. In so doing, what it has characteristically overlooked is that in the fundamentals lies the problem.        
	What the CPI(M) is not willing to accept is that its defeat is rooted in a deep and growing popular discontent against the way it has ruled West Bengal over the last 30 years and more. Of course, the political arithmetic produced by the Congress-Trinamul alliance was a factor in the election results. But the alliance does not explain the extent of the debacle. A simple look at the map of West Bengal in terms of the election results reveals that the famous red fortress of West Bengal has been reduced to the control of a few districts like Burdwan, Bankura and Purulia. Even there significant breaches are noticeable.        
	Post the debacle what has the CPI(M) fallen back on? Arrogance, false propaganda, selective terror and a continuation of administrative incompetence. Consider the evidence.              
	To take false propaganda first  because it is the most stupid. The secretary of the West Bengal CPI(M) declared in all seriousness that the influence of money bags had determined the election results. In other words, large amounts of money had been spent by the Congress and the Trinamul to influence the voters. The implication is that the voters were bribed and bought. This assumes that the people of West Bengal are foolish and venal and can be made to change their political preferences through bribery. The same people over the last 30 years were described by the same party as having an advanced and progressive political consciousness. If they could be bribed, what happened to that elevated consciousness? What this accusation of the CPI(M)s general secretary reveals is his and his partys utter contempt for the people of the state. This contempt was a reason for the defeat. The people finally protested through the ballot against being treated like cattle.        
	For arrogance, one has to go no further than the behaviour of the chief minister when he went on tour to meet the people who have lost everything in the cyclone. There he reprimanded one man with the following words: Tumi oi rokom bhabe kotha bolle ami tomake ghar theke bar kore debo (if you talk like that, I will throw you out of the room). For arguments sake, let us assume that the man had been rude. But is this any way to talk to someone who has been the victim of a natural calamity? He is entitled to express his anger. Any sensible chief minister would have allowed the man to vent his anger and then tried to calm him down and win him over. But not the chief minister of West Bengal. He decided to show his power. His statement also implies that in a meeting to listen to the peoples grievances, the chief minister thinks he should decide the tone and the register in which the people present should speak to him. Respect should have precedence over grievances, according to this communist chief minister.        
	It is significant that the chief minister chose to address the man as tumi and not apni. It was the first time the chief minister had set eyes on this person. The common courtesy among Bengalis is to address a stranger as apni. Perhaps the chief minister thought that this code of courtesy could be breached because the man was a poor villager. There was a time when communists set the standards of good behaviour in Bengali life. A Hiren Mukerji, an Indrajit Gupta or even a Jyoti Basu would never address a complete stranger as tumi. This is an index of how much the behaviour of communists has changed over the years and of the standards of common decency that the chief minister sets for himself. It is also a measure of his distance with the downtrodden.        
	While the chief minister was touring the cyclone-devastated areas near the Sunderbans, relief workers were locked up for two hours in a small room in Basanti. The police cited security as the reason, even though all the workers were unarmed and not known to be either terrorists or Maoists. The real reason was revealed by the secretary of the Gosaba-Basanti zonal committee of the CPI(M), who said that there was apprehension that these people would protest in the presence of the chief minister, and were therefore locked up. What kind of State is this that locks up people on grounds of suspicion that they might protest? Is the show of dissent illegal in West Bengal? Is West Bengal part of a democratic polity or is it a Stalinist/fascist terror State where no dissent is allowed?              
	Administrative incompetence is writ large all over the relief operations. Indifference, bureaucratic red tape and partisanship have hindered relief from reaching the affected people swiftly. This has increased the suffering of the people and has tried their patience. NGO workers and those suspected of having non-Left sympathies have been stopped from entering the affected areas. This has been a familiar story in West Bengal whenever a natural disaster has hit parts of the state. Officials know that unless they are seen to be for the ruling party  read willing to take orders from Alimuddin Street and party apparatchiki  they are liable to be removed or transferred. Hence apathy and mediocrity thrive. What is privileged is not performance but loyalty to the party.        
	These  arrogance, lies, terror and incompetence  have been the fundamentals of CPI(M) rule. Despite the defeat  or maybe because of it  the party and the government it controls have fallen back on these. A little delving into recent memory will show the truth of this: think of the chief ministers infamous us-and-them statement after the Nandigram violence; the incitement to violence  la Dum Dum dawai by the only woman member of the CPI(M) politbureau with the chief minister sitting on the same podium; the handling of the Rizwanur case the list is long and appalling. Yet comrades never learn because their half-baked ideology has taught them that the party is always right.              
	It is significant that when the governor of West Bengal visited some of the same places where the chief minister had been booed, he was greeted with flowers. The people were as quick to discern sincerity and genuine concern as they had been to pick out smugness and insincerity. The consciousness of the people cannot be bought by money bags.

	An elementary, if deliberate, confusion marks the criticism directed at the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, for his joint statement with Pakistan. The confusion lies in assuming that an agreement to resume dialogue with Pakistan is to condone terrorism that emanates from there. Common sense dictates that the two issues are separate and should be kept so. As the prime minister reminded members of parliament on Wednesday afternoon, it is a fact of history and geography that India has Pakistan as a neighbour. No one, except a small section of the political loony fringe, seriously believes that India should be at war with Pakistan. Given this fact, it is to Indias interest, and to the interest of the entire region, that the governments of India and Pakistan continue to talk to each other to resolve differences and to reduce areas of suspicion and hostility. From Indias point of view, nothing can be lost through such a process of dialogue and discussion. There is peace to be gained. Mr Singh has taken the only sensible step by re-opening channels of communication with Pakistan.        
	It is important to highlight that the prime minister has made no concessions on the issue of terror. In his speech to Parliament, Mr Singh reiterated that it is impossible for any government in India to work towards full normalization of relations with Pakistan unless the government of Pakistan fulfils, in letter and spirit, its commitment not to allow its territory to be used in any manner for terrorist activities against India. This is a position on which India cannot compromise and Mr Singh has upheld it very firmly. He has also informed the country that after the attack on Mumbai last year, Pakistan made the gesture of briefing India for the first time about the results of an investigation into a terrorist attack on India. This gesture cannot but be interpreted as a measure of goodwill on the part of Pakistan towards India. It would be silly to ignore this.        
	What makers of Indias policy towards Pakistan have to take into account is that Pakistan itself has become a target of terrorist violence. There are extremist Islamic groups in Pakistan who are committed to destroying democracy there. It is in Indias and Pakistans joint interests to eradicate terrorism completely. That eradication will be a necessary condition for a lasting peace with Pakistan. Mr Singh has prepared the ground for trust. But he has not done so blindly. He has said, sagely, that verification must precede trust. This, too, is dictated by common sense. The prime minister has proceeded with his characteristic good sense without making any unrealistic promises to either his own country or to Pakistan. He is also aware that the situation is fraught with uncertainties. Mr Singhs dealings with Pakistan bear the marks of his personality  realism, good sense, sobriety and grace.

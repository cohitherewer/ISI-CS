The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | fake makeover
                                                                                                                 FAKE MAKEOVER                                                    
	A government runs out of ideas before it runs out of steam. That seems to be the case with West Bengals Marxist government. The latest evidence comes in the reshuffle of portfolios for ministers belonging to the Communist Party of India (Marxist). So inconsequential are the changes that one wonders about the intentions behind the exercise. Whatever other purposes the reshuffle may serve, there should be absolutely no doubt that it would do nothing to improve the performance of the government. No minister has been dropped; several of them who are known to be suffering from serious illnesses stay on. The case of the transport minister, Subhas Chakraborty, who died on Monday after suffering from cancer for some time, should have been a warning to the CPI(M), especially in view of the serious issues that confront the government in the transport sector. But the party did not think it necessary to drop such ministers, although it is public knowledge that their ill health prevents them from doing justice to their ministerial responsibilities. This shows not just utter disregard for the obligations of governance, but also a craving for power without responsibility.         
	For the CPI(M), though, the roots of the problem lie deeper in its regimented organizational structure. The partys choice of minister has little to do with vision or administrative ability. It has everything to do with the importance of the chosen ones in the party and with hierarchical structure. If someone like Surjya Kanta Mishra, whose record as health minister is a case study in incompetence, is allowed to retain the portfolio, it is simply because of his importance in the party. If a cancer-stricken Mrinal Banerjee continues to hold the important post of power minister, it is because he is a senior leader of the CPI(M)s trade union wing. An ailing and aged Sailen Sarkar has to carry on, because he is the lone leader in the cabinet from his district. All these ministers have had their additional portfolios taken away from them. But that is a half-measure that is not going to make any difference to either their reduced responsibilities or the functioning of the government as a whole. The fake makeover attempt, it seems, is purely a political move forced by the Marxists recent poll debacle. Improving governance was never part of its agenda. The dispirited party is perhaps incapable of doing any better.

                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	When late is as good as never                  
	Sir  At last, the chief minister of West Bengal, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, apologized for the police firing in Nandigram. While that can be appreciated, we can ask what prompted him to apologize on the eve of the Lok Sabha elections. The apology was no doubt a means to draw public sympathy and fetch votes in favour of the Left. Bhattacharjee also has shielded the police by saying they were compelled to open fire in Nandigram. Was there no alternative for the police other than firing upon the agitating people to bring the situation under control?          
	Yours faithfully,      
Uday Bhattacharya, Calcutta

      
	Act for change          
	Sir  Elections come and go, but it seems things hardly change at the ground level. Promises are made and promises are broken. Sometimes there are not even any promises, as in the case of Binayak Sen. As rightly pointed out by Bhaswati Chakravorty in No country for the brave (May 12), there are plenty of Binayak Sens in our society. Some may find a mention in the press, while many may be missed out. When we the people, who can make a difference at least through our votes, decide that index cases like Sen do not even deserve to be mentioned, let alone merit our consideration, what more do we expect?          
	We are doing no more than encouraging a system that appears to disapprove of people becoming active agents of change rather than remaining merely passive recipients. In this system, anyone who dares to raise his or her voice against injustice or even merely to voice an opinion is always seen as the other.          
	Although we talk so much of change, we hardly consider that it is time certain draconian laws were changed. These become convenient tools in the hands of the powerful to crush the voice of the common man. Unless we accept the role we play in the plight of people like Sen, and act responsibly, we can never claim to be true citizens of this country. Being a citizen goes beyond casting ones vote. It is also about standing up for ones rights, and making sure that we do our duties.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Asmi Biswas, Calcutta

                          
	Flawed approach          
	Sir  Adheesha Sarkars article, Under the Nano Spell (May 14), highlights the arguments and counter-arguments towards her conclusion that a noble cause has to be substantiated with a practical plan and sincere effort.          
	The Tata Motors site was a highly fertile area in Singur as well as in West Bengal. More than a lakh people earned their living from this land through agriculture, but Tata had promised only 2,000 direct jobs in its stead. Consequently, the natives felt threatened. It is undoubtedly true that Bengal needed to bag the Nano project to pave the path for future investments and to resolve underdevelopment in the state. But the governments direct involvement in forcible land acquisition for the development of private business not only proved its lack of sincere effort but was also turned into a historical blunder.          
	Afraid of losing their livelihood and of the projects undermining effect on ecology, peasants led by the Opposition protested against the government, a protest that received support from rights groups and local bodies. The movement gathered intensity as absentee landlords, poor farmers and Trinamul Congress supporters made more demands than the compensations offered.          
	The governments approach to the Nano project, as well as towards housing schemes and special economic zones, was unaccompanied by practical plans or sincere effort. Both this approach and the hostile protests against it are equally liable for the departure of the Nano and other projects.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Suman Jalal, Calcutta

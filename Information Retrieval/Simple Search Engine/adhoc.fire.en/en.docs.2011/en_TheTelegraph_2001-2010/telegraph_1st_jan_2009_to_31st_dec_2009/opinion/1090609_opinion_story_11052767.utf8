                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Fist of fury                  
	Sir  It was inhuman of the police to confine villagers distributing relief at Basanti in a small tin shed for hours just because protocol demanded that foolproof security be provided to the chief minister visiting the flood-affected areas (Cyclone anger erupts on CM, June 1). What happened at Gosaba during Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees visit seems like a replay of Satyajit Rays film, Hirak Rajar Deshe, where the exploited miners were prevented by the king from ventilating their anguish to the ambassadors of another country so that the king could be seen as great.          
	Given the way Bhattacharjee and the chief of the Trinamul Congress, Mamata Banerjee, were competing with each other to reach the cyclone-victims, we thought that the suffering of the latter would cease in no time. But that was not to be. It soon became apparent that the leaders were prompted by narrow political gains rather than by humanitarian considerations. What was the purpose of the chief minister rushing over to the flood-affected area of Gosaba just after the Left Front had suffered an electoral defeat? Was it not to refurbish the image of the Left and regain mass support by projecting the Communist Party of India (Marxist) as the messiah? While the villagers waited for food, water, tarpaulin and medicines, all they got was a cavalcade of policemen and government officials. The villagers were so aggrieved that the volley of their angry complaints caused Bhattacharjee to lose his cool.          
	Instructions for the distribution of relief could have been issued directly from the Writers Building to the block development officers and village administrative heads to reduce bureaucratic hurdles. Bhattacharjees visit was a misuse of money and manpower. The BDOs had to spend hours with the chief minister when time was precious. Government red tape, which prevented relief from reaching the victims in time, also caused the frustrated villagers to manhandle the visiting state official (Muck attack on MLA, June 3). The state government should learn a lesson from its experience in Gosaba. It should start training block officials on how to tackle natural disasters, which, it seems, will become a recurring feature as the problem of global warming deepens.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Subhankar Mukherjee, Borehat, Burdwan 

                
	Sir  The way the people expressed their anger at Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee in Gosaba is regrettable. No matter how great the magnitude of their grievances, people should behave themselves when they talk to a man officially at the helm of affairs in the state. It does not speak much about our culture when people smear the local MLA with muck a few hours before the chief ministers visit. It is an indirect way of telling the chief minister that he might well be beaten up one day. I do not want to embroil myself in the Nandigram controversy. But the way people are protesting against all their problems Nandigram-style may not always be right.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Ujjwal Karmakar, Ketika, Purulia 

                
	A passionate life          
	Sir  It is sad that Kamala Das is no more with us today (Woman who wrote of passion and created a stir, June 1). With her demise, India has lost a poet par excellence and a good short story-writer. She was always a rebel at heart. Her blunt honesty was her strongest point. She did not mince words when she bared her heart to the world. Her frank discussions of female sexuality did not go down well with our conservative society. Although mostly educated at home in Punnaryurkulam in Thrissur, she made her presence felt across India through her writings. Her poetry was studied in colleges all over the country even in her lifetime.           
	Was it disillusionment with our insensitive society that caused Das to change her religion later in life? Could she have said during her last days in Pune that Today the world is a little more my own (Punishment in Kindergarten)?                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Tapan Das, Hyderabad 

                
	Sir  The renowned writer, Kamala Das, might not have won the Booker, but she was actually one of the shortlisted candidates for the Nobel Prize for literature in 1984 along with Marguerite Yourcenar, Doris Lessing and Nadine Gordimer. Her autobiography, My Story, translated into 15 languages, won her international recognition.          
	It is a wonder that Das, who had no formal education, could express herself in such beautiful language. She received the Sahitya Academy Award, the Kerala Sahitya Academy Award, and the Kent Award for English Writing from Asian Countries. She will live on in the memory of her readers.           
	Yours faithfully,      
B.K. Chatterjee, Faridabad 

                
	Sir  The death of Kamala Das has left a void in Indian writing in English. In her poems, Das gave vent to her repressed anger against the injustices committed on women in a male-dominated society. Her poems are reflective and their autobiographical strain gives us a glimpse into her personal life. The honesty of her work makes them delightful.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Priyanka Dutta, Calcutta

                
	Eye on the wild          
	Sir  The report, Camera for hill bear survey (May 22) by Vivek Chhetri wrongly mentions that heat-sensor cameras will be used in a survey to count Himalayan Black Bear in the Senchel Wildlife Sanctuary of Darjeeling for the first time in India. As the head of the department of Endangered Species Management in the Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun, I wish to point out that our institution has been using heat- and motion-sensor cameras to study the ecology of the black bear and bear-human conflicts at the Dachigam National Park in Kashmir since 2007. Using this technology, substantial scientific information on black bears and bear-human conflict have been generated over the last three years. The information has been shared with wildlife managers for adaptive management. As part of this ongoing research, we propose to radio-collar six black bears using GPS/ ARGOS satellite collars to study their movement and ranging patterns. I wish to add here that camera traps are now being widely used for wildlife research and monitoring. In the Northeast, studies on carnivores in the Jeypore/Digboi areas of Assam and in the Khangchendzonga National Park in Sikkim are currently underway. A few studies on wildlife using cameras have also been carried out in Arunachal Pradesh.          
	Yours faithfully,

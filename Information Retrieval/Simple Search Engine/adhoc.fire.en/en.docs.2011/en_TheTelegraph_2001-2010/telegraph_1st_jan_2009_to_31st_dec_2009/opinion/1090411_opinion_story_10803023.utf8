The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Humour in spirit
                                                                                                                 HUMOUR IN SPIRIT                              Ananda Lal      THEATRE                                                        
	Club theatre normally flaunts such dismal histrionics and uneducated choice of texts that it deserves to be ignored. A couple of exceptions lately embolden us to give credit where it is due. Tollygunge Club and the director, Punam Singh, earn applause for bringing Nol Coward back on the Calcutta stage, reviving Blithe Spirit. After Oscar Wilde, nobody handled comedy of manners better than Sir Noel. And, as with Wilde, he coated his straight romantic couples with the homosexual coding that gives his plays renewed interest today.        
	In Blithe Spirit, we cannot miss the significance of the droll ending that leaves Charles Condomine (a characteristic Cowardly pun) twice widowed. A sad finale, no doubt, yet one that finds him rather merry at the prospect of no wives to bother him  a gay delight, so to say. But in mock punishment for his heterosexuality, Coward makes both wives torment him as ghosts. Before the 1960s, only Coward could cook up such a campy tale. Kabir Seth fits Condomines part to a T, and receives delicious spooking from Punam Singh as wife No. 1 (picture). After an unsure start, Komal Khanna grows into the role of wife No 2. Deepika Jaidka (the sance artist, Madame Arcati) imparts to the production the arch accent associated with Coward, and Gitanjali Jollys drawing-room set looked elegant in the open-air against the redbrick backdrop of Tolly Towers.        
	Calcutta Club trod the conventional path to present a stock West End farce, Ken Ludwigs Lend Me a Tenor, directed by Kumar Basu, not winning brownie points except for some funny performances. Leading the pack were Arya Gupta as the celebrity Italian tenor who passes out and is replaced by a local opera fan, and Pradip Mitra as the local companys tense manager. The comic peak came after two star-struck girls enter the tenors lodgings; the manager senses something illicit and tells him that he cant have a woman in there, to which he responds in genuine bewilderment, Which one?        
	Finally, I Am Only Human by Stage Fusion (Guwahati), which did the club circuit with its so-called musical adaptation of another West End farce, Ray Cooneys It Runs in the Family, boasting the same formula  of a man with many women in his life and a show happening in the background. As in director Rupa Hazarika Soms previous disaster that toured here last year, the musical aspect meant pathetic lip-syncing and jelly-like dancing to a recorded soundtrack of pop hits.

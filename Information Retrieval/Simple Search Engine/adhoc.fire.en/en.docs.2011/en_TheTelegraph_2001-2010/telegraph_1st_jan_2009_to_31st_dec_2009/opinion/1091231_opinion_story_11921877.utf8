	The first decade of the 21st century has come to an end and newspapers in Britain have been treating us to instant histories of the period that they insist on calling by the ugly name, the noughties. Most of the events recalled are big, fatal and dramatic  the tsunami that swept the Indian Ocean, 9/11, the siege of the Taj in Mumbai. One more gradual and less frequently noted phenomenon is the decline of newspapers themselves. The circulation of the ten national dailies published from London has declined by almost a fifth since 2000. The nine national Sunday newspapers have fallen even further, registering a sales slump of more than a quarter. Within that general pattern there have been some spectacular individual declines. The Daily Mirror sold 2,777,501 copies in November 2000 and 1,260,019 two months ago (a fall of 55 per cent); the Daily Express has tumbled by a third. No newspaper is immune save for the worst one, the Daily Star, whose sales have actually risen. This may illustrate a famous dictum, possibly spoken by Rupert Murdoch, that nobody ever went bust by underestimating the tastes of the British public, but it would be hard to draw a general lesson from the Stars success. Newspapers with only a slightly more elevated approach to sex and celebrity  Murdochs News of the World, for example  are having just as hard a time as the more serious Guardian and Telegraph.        
	For anyone who likes or values newspapers (or, like me, has earned most of his living from them), theres very little light at the end of this particular tunnel. A combination of economic recession and the unstoppable migration of readers and advertisers to the web has led to a widely-believed prognosis that newspapers in Britain and America are finished, at least as profitable enterprises. In the longer term, they may well be. In the meantime, however, the surprise is the number of people who are prepared to lose money by owning one.              
	In Britain, the latest is the Russian oligarch, Alexander Lebedev. Last year, he bought 75 per cent of Londons Evening Standard from the Rothermere family. The fact that he paid all of 1 for this privilege will tell you how hopeless the Standards future looked. Until very recent times, the paper was the indispensable companion of every London commuter and could boast coverage of politics, books and the arts that compared well with many national dailies. But then it fell victim to a war between two rival free newspapers, piles of which were given away at street corners and Tube stations. The Standard, on the other hand, cost 50p. No matter that its journalism was ten times better than the stuff in the free sheets, or that it offered all kinds of gifts (umbrellas, books, backpacks) as inducements, the circulation could never be rescued from its relentless decline.        
	Lebedevs solution was to make the Standard free too, which means that he hopes to meet all of the papers costs, from the theatre critics salary to the newsprint bill, from advertising revenue. In one way, this isnt the gamble it seems: the Standards free rivals have closed and the paper now has the streets to itself. In another way, it looks desperate: the free papers closed, after all, because advertising revenue was in such steep decline. My bet is that Lebedev will need to subsidize the Standard by many million pounds every year if  as he promises  the papers editorial reputation is to be preserved.        
	Why would he want to spend his money like this? According to one explanation Ive heard, we should look to the internal politics of Russia. The Standard offers Lebedev a platform if he comes under attack from Vladimir Putin  though it seems unlikely that the Russian president would give more than a seconds thought to the opinion of a free evening newspaper published in a foreign capital. Lebedev himself says he bought the newspaper because he admires good, independent journalism and came to respect the Standard after he was posted to London as his countrys economics attach 20 years ago (in fact, he was working for the KGB). A more traditional, and perhaps more persuasive, explanation is vanity. Men who are already rich often buy newspapers because they want to be recognized as socially important. According to Forbes magazine, Lebedev is worth about $3.5 billion, wealth that originates in the collapse of the Soviet Union and Russias transformation to a private enterprise economy. He owns a third of Aeroflot, as well as chemical, hotel, textile, tramway and construction companies. In Britain, he has become known mainly as a philanthropist who saved a decent newspaper. As with the case of Roman Abramovich, who has poured money into Chelsea football club, the source of his wealth remains distant and, by most people, unexamined.        
	Other British newspapers may soon be under Lebedevs control. The Irish owners of Londons Independent and Independent on Sunday look likely to reach a deal with him and get two loss-making titles off their hands. Who, in 1989, could have imagined that the collapse of the Soviet Union would have this as one of its smaller results? Who, even ten years ago, could have imagined the British newspaper industry in such a sorry financial condition that important parts of it could be sold at basement prices to a former operative of the KGB? Anyone predicting the next ten years should heed this lesson in the unknowable. All I shall guess is that come 2020, the number of British newspapers will be halved at the very least, despite Alexander Lebedevs so far benign interventions.              
	*************              
	Im writing this with cold fingers in a house on an island in the Firth of Clyde. Theres ice on the road and snow in the garden. The temperature sometimes slumps to minus seven degrees. Ive never known it to be so cold here  the west coast of Scotland is used to rain and wind rather than our present Alpine days of blue skies and white hills. This year though, the British winter is meeting our romantic expectations. Many parts of the country have had a white Christmas. An Indian friend, in Europe for the first time, told me shed been charmed by her first snowfall and the sight of snowflakes fluttering down on black London streets. In two days time (as I write) another charming and seasonal phenomenon will echo around our small island when the ferries at the pier sound their sirens to welcome in the New Year.              
	The sound always sets off a chain of remembering. When I was a boy in Fife, steam locomotives would whistle for all they were worth at midnight on December 31. Later, when I lived in Glasgow and Glasgow was still a port, the ships in the docks would signal midnight with blasts on their horns. In Calcutta, where I spent several New Years in the 1980s, the same sound came from the direction of Kidderpore. All these places and times will be mixed up when I hear the ferries. I might even remember the seasonal fruit cake that I bought at Flurys in Park Street and carried home to Ballygunge, or the party at the Dalhousie Institute, or myself in bed aged seven (too young to stay up) listening to the distant peep of engine whistles from over the hill. Of course, its sentimental of me to recall such occasions, but New Year is the supreme celebration of sentiment  universally, but especially in Scotland, which (lets not forget) gave it a theme tune. So for the sake of Auld Lang Syne, I wish you a happy one. In Britain it has to be better than 2009, or so we keep telling ourselves.

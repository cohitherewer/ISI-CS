                                                                                                                 SINGLE FOCUS                                                    
	Energy and thoughtfulness need not go together. There is evidence of ebullient energy in the proposals of the Union human resource development minister, Kapil Sibal, regarding school and higher education, but some of them seem to be a little short on reflection. The ministers intentions are of the best: education in India does need reform, the sooner the better. Mr Sibal has chosen sooner: he has set a target for 100 days. But education is on the concurrent list. The states are bound to have a say  they are already speaking up  and 100 days is a tough target for any new system to be agreed upon.        
	But that perhaps is the least of the problems in the mixed bag of changes Mr Sibal has thought up. The two main proposals regarding school education provide enough food for startled thought. Mr Sibal has proposed that the Class X board examination become optional. For those children who wish to continue studying in school, internal assessment should be enough for promotion to Class XI. Mr Sibals aim here is to lessen the psychological burden on children, who, he feels, are traumatized by the pressure of having to perform to the limit of their youthful abilities simply to be admitted into Class XI. To ease the burden further, the minister has suggested that children in Class X be graded rather than marked. Given the feverishness, even sense of doom, associated with differences of even half a mark in the Class X board examination results, this seems a healthy proposal. Such a change would, of course, imply greater credibility on the part of all schools and greater equivalence in teacher-training, something that Mr Sibals proposals merely touch upon.        
	Whatever the state governments objections to this proposal, far more worrying is Mr Sibals suggestion that a single all-India board should conduct the school-leaving examination. Even the Yashpal committee recommendations, about which Mr Sibal is so enthusiastic, seem to argue against such centralization. Apart from the huge practical problems such a board would face, the principle itself is flawed. Centrally determined education would hold the country down to a regimented middle standard, denying institutions the autonomy to innovate and grow in their independent quests of excellence, or even suitability, in this multi-lingual, multi-layered country. Reform should be in the opposite direction, towards greater decentralization and freedom for schools to determine standards and curricula, so that human resources can be developed in varied directions. It is strange that the proposal to abolish the Class X board examination optionally hints at greater freedom. The contradictory principle implied by a centralized board indicates confused thinking. Without a deeper analysis of the problems in school education, and the working out of a coherent system of change, Mr Sibals energy and good intentions may go sadly to waste.

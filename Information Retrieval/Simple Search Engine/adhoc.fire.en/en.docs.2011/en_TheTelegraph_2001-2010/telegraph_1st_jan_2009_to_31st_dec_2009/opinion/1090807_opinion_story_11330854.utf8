The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Draped in beauty
                                                                                                                 DRAPED IN BEAUTY                                                                    
	The sari is one of the chief wonders of India. The West can never be surprised enough by the magic of this nine-yard piece of cloth, which can be draped around the female form to produce the epitome of womanhood. Vijai Singh Katiyar celebrates the beauty and craftsmanship of this unique dress in INDIAN SARIS: TRADITIONS-PERSPECTIVES-DESIGN (Wisdom Tree, Rs 3,495). He discusses in detail the history, and the various draping styles and textile designs of the sari in the different states of India. It is a pity he does not pay as much attention to the design of the book itself, which looks quite tacky. On the top is a layout for a silk patola sari. Bottom left is a sculpture from the Gandharva period that shows Greek and Roman influences in the style of the drapes. In the middle is a traditional designer from Varanasi translating a paper design into a naksha. Right is a kolam design from South India that finds its reflection in the regions saris.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        RISING DAMP                                                    
	As bad investment ideas go, there are few that can beat one made by Dubai World: building luxury submarines for recreational use. Dubais State-owned corporation even set up a separate company called Exomos in 2003 to oversee their manufacture and sale. In September this year, Dubai World sued the former Exomos CEO, Herve Jaubert, for fraud; court papers filed in a Florida court said that he did not have the expertise he claimed to have in the business, and he overcharged Dubai World through a company he controlled for submarines that did not work. So much for due diligence. Today, many question most of Dubai Worlds investment decisions, including luxury real estate, where prices have dropped 50 per cent over the last year, and vacancies abound. The amount of debt that the Dubai government is asking for a standstill on  about $60 billion  is not much in the global context. But the dent to fragile confidence in world economic recovery is much larger. About 4.5 million Indians live and work in the Emirate, about 25 per cent of that from Kerala, whose finance minister said that Dubais troubles could affect remittances  about $10 billion annually  though the Central government in New Delhi said the impact would be negligible.        
	The direct impact could be very small  companies and banks in the United Kingdom are among the largest creditors, about $50 billion to all of the United Arab Emirates that includes Abu Dhabi  but the indirect effects should cause concern. Interest rates on sovereign debt could go higher, and credit could get tighter as risk aversion returns. Governments have been borrowing heavily to manage the crisis impact, and may have to cut back on the scale of their borrowing. Exchange rate volatility is expected to increase, besides volatility in world equity markets; the carry trade  borrowing in a zero interest currency like the dollar to invest in higher return assets such as emerging market equities  may unwind rapidly, causing another large stock market correction. Many say that markets are already overvalued anyway, and this could lend impetus to their fall. It also means lower profits as people tighten belts further, and that implies lower investment and lower commodity prices as consumer demand disappears. That means global recovery gets delayed further. Is a bailout realistically possible? No one is sure where it could come from.

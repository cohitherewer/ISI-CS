The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Arrayed in grandeur
                                                                                                                 ARRAYED IN GRANDEUR                                                      
	Andrew Taylor starts his introduction to THE RISE AND FALL OF THE GREAT EMPIRES (Quercus, Rs 995) with the remark, Empires seem to have gone out of fashion. The truth of this is irrefutable, considering the fact that the new world order is dominated by a single superpower. Perhaps this also explains Taylors motive behind the gigantic literary task that he undertakes here: selecting 25 imperial hegemonies from every period of global history, and documenting the nature of their power structures, the social and cultural values that were integral to their functioning and the factors that contributed to their rise and fall.        
	Taylors selection may not be a chronological account but will undoubtedly impress the most fastidious historian. He starts with the Sumerian Empire  the earliest empire known to have existed  and moves on to examine others in the early period: Assyria, Greece, Rome and the ones founded by the Chinese and the Mongols.         
	The greatness of empires lies not only in their military might but also in their geographical vastness. There are other factors that make them compelling subjects of research, and Taylor seems to be aware of this. Thus, he includes the Chola kingdom in South India, which rose to prominence as a centre of excellence in trade and the arts, as well as the volatile Umayyad Empire that witnessed the strange democratic spectacle of the people demanding the same rights and privileges as the rulers. The domains carved out by the Ottomans, Mughals, Portuguese, Spanish, French and later by the British, Germans and Soviets expectedly make it to Taylors list.        
	Like any other skilled journalist, Taylor too has an eye for detail. Apart from giving simple and concise accounts of the empires, he tries to ascertain the external and internal challenges they faced  for instance, the threats posed by rival powers as well as by their disparate subjects  and the legacies they left behind for the future generations. The argument in the final chapter as to whether the US has an empire, and how the notion of empire has changed in the modern times is also engaging.        
	However, unlike the colourful interludes and the larger-than-life characters, the paintings, lithographs and portraits in this book are dull. Extreme left is a floor mosaic found at the House of Faun in Pompeii, showing Alexander at the Battle of Issus. Bottom centre is a 19th-century mural of the Roman senate. Top centre is a lithographed representation of the meeting between the Spanish adventurist, Hernn Corts, and the Aztecs. Jacques-Louis Davids celebrated portrait of Napoleon is top right while bottom right shows the historic summit between the US president, Ronald Reagan, and the Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev in Geneva, Switzerland, in 1985.

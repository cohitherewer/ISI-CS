The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | back to square one
                                                                                                                 BACK TO SQUARE ONE                                  Malvika Singh                              
	Much is happening around us but the sound bite of Ashok Gehlot continues to haunt us, particularly since it sounds increasingly like the Bajrang Dal-VHP-BJP chorus. If the chief minister of Rajasthan thought he is being smart by diluting the positive developments of the previous government in a simplistic effort to gain brownie points in New Delhi, he is sorely mistaken. On the contrary, he has, by his thoughtlessness, joined the gang within the BJP and its allied dispensations that fought the comparatively new-generation leadership represented by Vasundhara Raje in Rajasthan. He has also shown his limitations as a leader and administrator because good governance means you carry on with the business of a smooth transition regardless of politics and parties. Gehlot has managed to damage the fundamental ethos of the Congress.        
	Maybe Gehlot needs to first understand Indian culture and tradition before he makes sweeping personal statements that are a deviation from the party mandate. Some questions come to mind. Will he want to see those Incredible India edifices, the temples of Khajuraho, damaged and mutilated like the Bamiyan Buddhas, because they have panels that show erotica? After all, those images depict much more than boys and girls holding hands in modern-day shopping malls. Would he sponsor the renewal of suttee since it was an act based on deep cultural, spiritual and traditional beliefs? Will he restore the traditional prasad during Shivratri  bhang  in all the temples across Rajasthan? Will he enforce purdah, a cultural tradition in his state? Will he interfere in the education of girls and discourage them from entering the male-dominated world of education, business and commerce? Will he force widows to wear white clothes and no bangles on their wrists since that was the Hindu tradition? Will widow remarriage be banned? Will he cover the statues of our bare-breasted gods and goddesses, shivlingams set in yonis, all the icons that we worship?                
	Cruel farce        
	All this is nothing short of being a cruel farce. But it is also extremely dangerous when leaders get away with spouting such ridiculous statements. They need to be severely reprimanded. What joy if Gehlot had addressed the media and said that he as a Gandhian, as he claims to be, swears by the Gita that he will deliver potable water to every single citizen of his state within one year and that his administration will ensure that all castes from top to bottom will draw water from the same well at all wells in Rajasthan. Why does he not provide at least one light bulb in every home in Rajasthan and 24-hour electricity? Why does every simple licence and application gets cleared only with a bribe?         
	Intelligent, transparent and good governance means being democratic, secular and inclusive, operating within the values of honesty and integrity and dealing decisively with corruption. Neither B.S. Yeddyurappa of the BJP nor Gehlot of the Congress gives the rational, liberal, honest citizen any sense of confidence that comes from upholding the tenets of civil freedoms. They come across as regressive, intellectually inept and wanting, insecure and sycophantic. Citizens must learn to make their choices from the large diversity. They do not require diktats from their transient rulers. Bans only create new avenues for corruption, lies and deceit, all of which were an anathema to M.K. Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, as they are to Rahul Gandhi and other liberal leaders today, and to those who will take charge in the future. Like the United States of America, we too need a change. A new-generation leadership discards the diseased, decayed skin and, with a dynamic vision sans the baggage of the past, takes us into a difficult future.

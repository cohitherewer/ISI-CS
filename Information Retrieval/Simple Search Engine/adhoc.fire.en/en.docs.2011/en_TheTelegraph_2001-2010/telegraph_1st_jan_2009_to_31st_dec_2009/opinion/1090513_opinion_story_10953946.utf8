The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | face the people
                                                                                                                 FACE THE PEOPLE                                                    
	There are leaders of people who have never faced the people to secure a mandate for themselves. This is a paradox embedded in parties like the Communist Party of India (Marxist). In its ideology and in its rhetoric, the CPI(M) sees itself as a mass party. In places like West Bengal and Kerala, the CPI(M) also enjoys substantial support from the people. Not even its critics or its rivals can deny this. Yet, some of the principal office-bearers of the CPI(M) have never contested an election either at the state or at the national level. At least one of these office-bearers  given the organizational structure of the communist party  commands enormous power. This is the general secretary. The post is now held by Prakash Karat, and it is well known that other than in Jawaharlal Nehru University, Mr Karat has never contested an election outside his own party. Within the party hierarchy, the general secretary is primus inter pares. This means that Mr Karats word carries more weight than say that of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee who is an elected representative of the people. In the CPI(M), a representative of the comrades has a more privileged position than an elected representative of the people. What can be more ridiculous in a democracy? It would be no exaggeration to say that Mr Karat enjoys a position and power that have no basis in the Constitution of India.        
	It would be unfair and untrue to see the CPI(M) as the only political formation plagued by this particular paradox. Indian political parties in general do not accept the position that only a parliamentary party of the Lower House should be accepted as a valid political entity. This follows from the simple fact that members of the Lok Sabha have been elected by the people. (The Telegraph has always maintained the position that the prime minister of the country should come from the Lower House.) At the present political juncture, the paradox is most prominent in the CPI(M), especially as it is the loudest in its claim to represent the people. It is also evident from the public pronouncements of certain comrades that there is some discontent within the CPI(M) that many of its office-bearers never face the electorate yet call the shots within the party organization and while determining the party line. The CPI(M) remains tied to an organizational structure that is Stalinist. It should tune in to the norms of democracy.

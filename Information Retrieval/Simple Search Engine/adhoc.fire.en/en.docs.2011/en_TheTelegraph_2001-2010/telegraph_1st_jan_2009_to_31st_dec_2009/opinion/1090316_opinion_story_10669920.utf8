                                                                                                                 BAD START                                                    
	Electoral alliances are, by definition, seasonal affairs. But a national political party like the Congress is also expected to have long-term goals, the most important of which is to use an election to rejuvenate itself. If Congress workers in West Bengal are unhappy about the way the party high command surrendered to Mamata Banerjee over seat-sharing for the Lok Sabha polls, they have good reasons to be so. After a long time, the party had a real chance of retrieving some of its lost ground in Bengal, thanks both to its re-emergence at the national level and to the erosion of support for the ruling Marxists. Since Ms Banerjee is at the centre of the fight against the Marxists, it made eminent political sense for the Congress to choose to have an alliance with her. But Congress leaders and activists in the state had hoped that it would be a good start to a long and honourable relationship, which would help the party rebuild itself in Bengal.         
	K. Keshava Rao, the negotiator appointed by the Congress high command for the alliance talks for Bengal, got it right when he said that the party could not go into the electoral battle as a demoralized force. What happened eventually could well turn out to be a betrayal of the partys cause in Bengal. Given the seats Ms Banerjee has offered to the Congress, it is rather unlikely that the partys tally in Bengal would rise even marginally from what it was in the last Lok Sabha. It cannot be a cause for celebration for Congress activists and supporters if the Trinamul Congress alone benefits from the alliance. In fact, if this happens, the Congress in Bengal could be pushed into further irrelevance, and the partys central leadership will have none but itself to blame for that.        
	Given the rising anti-Left mood, especially in Bengals villages, the Trinamul Congress is expected to make major gains in these polls. These polls come at the crest of a series of reverses the Marxists have suffered in the last few elections. It would have been politically wise for Ms Banerjee to be more accommodative towards the Congress. That would have made her look a leader more of the alliance than of just her own party. In that sense, she too has lost an opportunity to rise above purely partisan calculations. Both parties apparently hope to continue their alliance till the state assembly elections in 2011. Electoral adjustments being so fragile anyway, only mutual trust and respect can be the basis for such a lasting relationship. But then, the Congress, like the Bharatiya Janata Party and the communists, is increasingly playing second fiddle to regional outfits in the states. It is up to Sonia Gandhi to ponder if this is in the best interest of the partys future  in Bengal and elsewhere.

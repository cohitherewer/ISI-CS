The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Arbitrary borders, words of comfort, and absurd regimens
                                                                                                                 ARBITRARY BORDERS, WORDS OF COMFORT, AND ABSURD REGIMENS                              Ananda Lal      Theatre                                                
	Gulzar celebrates his 75th birthday this year. Intentionally or coincidentally, director Salim Arif of Essay Communications (Mumbai), which expresses a special interest in Urdu literature, undertook a trilogy of Gulzar dramatizations, assisted by the authors own choice of stories. The second in this series, Lakeeren  preceded by Kharashen (on the scars left by Partition riots), with a play on his experiences of Mumbai to follow  arrived in town by courtesy of Sangit Kala Mandir.        
	The evocative title of Lakeeren refers to lines: those arbitrary demarcations of borders, as well as to the handiwork of Gulzars poetic craft. The most touching of the three tales on view, L.O.C., related how an army officer in the 1965 war discovers that his counterpart on the Pakistani side had been his friend and neighbour in his hometown before Independence  something that Gulzar, himself born in west Punjab, could relate to. Yashpal Sharma gave a poignant portrayal of the officer (picture).        
	Kuldeep Nayyars recollections to Gulzar of his birthplace, Sialkot, forms the core of Pir Sahib, which narrated how a pirs words of comfort to Nayyars family used to see them through difficulties, his supernatural presence felt by Nayyar and finally set to rest when he revisited Sialkot. In Over, an almost absurdist depiction of military vigils, a brainless actress in a film unit on the front plays with a soldiers rifle, while an army radio operator has become so accustomed to ending messages with Over! that he does the same in face-to-face conversations too.        
	For reasons unknown, Calcutta did not get to see the fourth story in this compilation, Batwara. Sharma proved to be by far the most accomplished of the multiple-role actors, the acting drawing maximum attention along with the narratives, because Arif hardly utilized sets. Seema Sehgal linked the three parts by singing some of Gulzars lyrics, for which she had composed the music.         
	Sangit Kala Mandirs other recent offering from Mumbai, Avanis Apki Lajja, was a hackneyed Hindi comedy written by Manish Mehta about the autocratic domestic regimen dictated by a family patriarch  that staple of Hindi movies and soaps. The director, Homi Wadia, essayed the despots part and made himself thoroughly unpleasant, as required. The breath of warmth brought by a newly-employed ayah (Ami Trivedi, speaking authentic dialectal Gujarati) provided the necessary contrast and, naturally, the secret of the plot lay in the tyrants past connection with her.

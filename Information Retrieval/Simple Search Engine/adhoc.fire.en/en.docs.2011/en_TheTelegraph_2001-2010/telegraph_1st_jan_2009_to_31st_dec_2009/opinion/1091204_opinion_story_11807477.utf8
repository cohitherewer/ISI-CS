	Looking at India from a small and perfect Shangri-la, it was clear that the degradation of our values, ethics and material resources in the desperation to ape and clone alien cultures that are deemed modern, and the desire to acquire wealth at any cost by breaking rules and norms, have reduced India into a weak and vulnerable State. Why has this happened with such rapidity post Independence? After all, we in India had a nation galvanized under a leader  Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi  who hit the correct nerve and liberated us from colonial domination. He was a leader of extraordinary stature, as were the others around him. They were committed, passionate men and women who gave up their lives of comfort to build and serve an infant nation state. They brought their skills and strengths to the table and laid a foundation that we could have built upon and been a superpower at the dawn of this new millennium. Instead, we corrupted, mutilated and mangled our base.        
	The reason is very simple and straightforward. There is a severe crisis of leadership in India and this has been so since 1975  a watershed year for our fledgling democracy. In the period of Emergency, deviations from the statute book and laws of the land, the legitimization of corrupt practices, the increasing reluctance of government babus, aided and abetted by elected representatives, to enforce the law and established mandate, destroyed the early constructs. What followed after the withdrawal of special powers that the declaration of the Emergency had introduced was the same high-handed misuse of authority and law. No leader or party collective had the gumption to cure the near-fatal illness. Now it has become the basis of all governance and exploitation. Transgressions of the law drown transparency and clean administration.                
	Rapacious breed        
	People follow their leaders, like Indians followed Gandhi. We need new leaders who will lift us out of this quagmire. What we witness everyday when Parliament is in session, and thereafter in the larger public space, makes one want to squirm and throw up. National leaders biffing one another, others adjourning the proceedings because they do not want their misdemeanours exposed to the national public, political workers breaking into private offices and physically attacking individuals because of disagreements, politicians joining illegal demolition sprees, the police force in complete denial, unable, maybe unwilling, to enforce the law, the lower and upper courts being influenced by personal predilections, an elite class comfortable in the all-pervading muck because this horror protects their illegal privileges, and more, are the various ingredients that have curdled the spirit of our great and plural civilization.        
	The rapacious breed of elected leaders has been responsible for the criminalization of society as well as for the dilution of the many processes that make for civilized living. The poison unleashed has managed to suffocate civil society. Till the corrective is not made at the top, at the level of the person who stands for office, India will continue to sink into the depths of social anarchy. High percentages of growth in such an anarchic situation will only fuel disorder. The only reason we are still standing is that there are a few scores of leaders of calibre at the helm  very few, when you think of working for a billion-plus citizens who deserve the dignity of life and living.        
	We need thoughtful, compassionate, committed leadership. In the Shangri-la that lies at the crown of the sub-continent, the monarchy is far more democratic than our democratically elected rulers. We have many lessons to learn. We need to change the priorities, rewrite the methodology, and govern from the panchayat upwards, with transparency.

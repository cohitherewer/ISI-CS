The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Tests of a different kind
                                                                                                                 TESTS OF A DIFFERENT KIND                                  CLASS APART      Does the State think that children have the lowest stakes in their own schooling?                                                  
	Dear Stakeholder  greets the user interface on the CBSE website containing questionnaires for students, parents, teachers and principals. The questionnaire is a measure adopted by the Union human resource development ministry to engage in a dialogue with those who will be affected if the Class X board examinations are made optional. The objective of this survey is to know the views of the various concerned parties, to gauge their mood and assess their worries. One cannot, however, help but note the disparity in the number of questions put to each group  46 to students, 74 to principals, 76 to parents and 70 to the teachers.        
	Two things emerge from the questions. Do parents, principals and teachers hold greater stakes in the education of children today than the students themselves? Also, the same kind of questions are rehashed to fit the respondents  each group is asked if it feels teachers rush through the syllabus in class, and the teachers are asked if they feel the pressure to do the same. There are some additional questions asked of parents, teachers and principals that deal with concerns exclusive to the adults  parents are asked if they can concentrate on their work because of their childrens studies, principals are asked if they are worried about their schools standard, teachers asked if they suffer from insomnia or mood swings during exams, and so on. So does this mean that education is a lot about reinforcing an adult-child relationship? That is, parents and teachers provide him with guidance and the child in turn studies to fulfil parents desires to see him do well in life and have a bright future. The alternative is to lose sleep over the childs failure to do so.        
	The survey is quite exhaustive in that it raises questions about the state of school education and evaluation systems. All four groups are asked if students feel panic or anxiety attacks during exam time, if they feel the monotony of classroom interactions, if they have time to play games, read, or pursue other interests. Emphasis is on the perceived flaws of the current system and the survey seems an attempt to see how many of the respondents agree with the policy-makers.         
	The fundamental notions about school education are never really challenged in the survey, but are reinforced through it. Academic performance is given precedence over other activities, referred to as extra-curriculars or soft skills (music, dance, poetry). The survey assumes that students are most definitely under pressure, but their need to excel in studies, to get into a good college in a good stream is not questioned.         
	The alternative to this pressure  the reason for the survey  is to make the Class X board exams optional (though the coaching centre exams, internal exams, the Class XII board exams, would all remain intact). The continuous and comprehensive evaluation system comes up in the survey as a token gesture  respondents are asked if they feel CCE is a better evaluative measure, but even there, academic performance is rated over all others. The CCE grade card divides evaluation four ways, based on academic performance, art and health education, personal and social qualities (punctuality and cleanliness), and attitude and values (towards teachers and peers). Though it is doubtful whether a student who is, say, excellent at dance would be promoted if his academic grade is not up to the mark. Most certainly not the child who turns out tidy for class, but fails in history.

	Hall of names                  
	Sir  The article, With you, every waking hour (Aug 14), touches upon a much-debated subject, which has bewildered sensible citizens of the country over the years. The practice of naming government-sponsored welfare schemes after icons from the Nehru-Gandhi family might be understood in the context of Indian political culture, where obsession with the names of some chosen leaders is common. But there is a lack of interest in pursuing their visions.           
	Another reason for such bias could be the Congresss desire to show its respects to the memory of these past leaders. However, a staggering number of 175 schemes being named after the famous trio of the revered family is an incredible feat, which demands a place in the Guinness World Records. What, however, remains a mystery is the governments reluctance to recognize the names of other great leaders, who had made no less sacrifices for and contributions towards achieving the countrys independence, and have also left remarkable impressions in various fields.           
	By promoting a few chosen leaders and ignoring the others, the government has shown how insensitive it could be to the wishes of a vast majority of Indians. By acting so, the government has encouraged division within the nation. Surely, during its second term, the United Progressive Alliance government would launch more schemes named after members of the Nehru-Gandhi clan to attain a new record figure?           
	Yours faithfully,         Srikanta Bhattacharjee, Calcutta              
	Sir  As the editorial, Names after leaders (Aug 15), says, it is indeed a bit irritating to have to come across the names of the members of the Nehru-Gandhi family for every government-funded scheme repeatedly. Rajiv Gandhi was a young and popular prime minister, and had great visions for the country. A number of public projects have already been named after him. In the future, the government should spare the Nehru-Gandhi family and instead come up with new names, which would describe the nature of the schemes.          
	Yours faithfully,      
A.K. Ghosh, Calcutta

                
	Cost concerns          
	Sir  Our country is passing through a critical period brought about by the rise in the prices of essential commodities. Prices of everyday goods such as sugar, cereals, wheat flour, mustard oil and so on are rising by the day, and are now almost beyond the reach of common people. The government does not seem to have any control over the supply of essential commodities. In the open market, the prices of commodities are entirely dependent on the mercy of wholesellers, who control supply and so create demand artificially.           
	It is true that in a liberalized economy such as ours, the government has little role to play in the matter. But it can still give some relief to the people. Since the common people are the backbone of the country, industrial and agricultural development will not be possible in India unless the economic condition and purchasing power of the people improve. The government should give relief to the people that will ultimately accelerate economic growth.           
	Yours faithfully,      
A.K. Das, Calcutta

                
	Sir  From media reports of the inflation turning negative for the first time in 30 years, one might have assumed that the economy would be deflated soon (Inflation lands in negative zone, June 19). But that, evidently, has not been the case. When the price of all necessary goods is increasing rapidly, how can inflation be claimed to be so low? The prices of essentials have practically become the double of what they were a few months back.           
	The common people have nothing to gain from the rate of inflation, whether it is at its lowest or the highest: what the people need is a stable grid of market-prices for goods. What the experts in economics such as Manmohan Singh, Montek Singh Ahluwalia and Pranab Mukherjee are unable manage, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, never known for his skill in economics, had easily accomplished during the period of drought India faced when the National Democratic Alliance was in power. At these times, it is political will that is required more than economic expertise.                     
	Yours faithfully,         Sudhir Pattnaik, Kalahandi, Orissa              
	Sir  I dont think everybody will agree with the point raised in the editorial, Think right(Aug 17), which argues against government intervention in the market, and speaks in favour of opening the State stock. It is true that our government has a sufficient reserve of foodgrains. But this is a buffer or emergency stock which should not be used only to control prices, especially when the danger of drought is looming over us. Moreover, why should the government be soft on businessmen who act like hoarders, profiteers and black-marketers, and are thus no less culpable than criminals who thrive on peoples woes?                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

	Music at the Limits: Three Decades of Essays and Articles on Music By Edward W. Said, Bloomsbury, 20  
	It was the death of Glenn Gould, the great Canadian pianist, in 1982 that drove Edward Said to writing seriously on music. And death remained, until his own in 2003, a constant presence in his lifelong closeness to music. A few months after Goulds death, the writers son caught an infection and had to be hospitalized. Saids widow, Mariam, writes, in her foreword to Music at the Limits, about how he absorbed the news of their sons potentially fatal illness and, half an hour later, asked her to get ready for the concert they had tickets to that night. Puzzled, she chose to stay back. It was only years later that she realized how important it was for him to seek out music when faced with the fear of death.         
	While their son was in hospital, Saids mother  to whom he owed his earliest interest in music (an ambiguous debt starkly remembered in his memoir, Out of Place)  was diagnosed with cancer, and her protracted illness is woven into his first years as music critic of The Nation, the essays and reviews for which form the bulk of this volume. During these years, the family would drive from New York to Washington, D.C. to see his mother and, again to Mariams disconcertment, Said would immerse himself in music, especially in Wagners Ring, throughout the five-hour-long journey instead of conversing with his family. In a 1990 article reprinted here, Said describes Wagners cycle of four limitless operas as really a work about slipping and going backward, pointing the reader towards Prousts brilliant observation that the unity of the Ring is provided only by retrospective illumination.         
	Saids mother also died in 1990, and Musical Elaborations, perhaps his most profound work on music, was published the following year, and dedicated to her memory. That very year, Said himself was diagnosed with leukemia. From then until two weeks before his death, his battle with the illness and the progress of the harrowing treatment interlace his fiercely driven writings on music and his elaboration of the idea of Late Style. Inspired by late Adorno listening to late Beethoven, Said uses the notion of the Late Style as that which characterizes the last, valedictory works of great artists (many of them composers and musicians): intransigence, difficulty, and unresolved contradictions.         
	Written over a little more than twenty years, this collection  together with everything else by Said that would endure, the legacy of Orientalism (1978) and his commitment to the Palestinian cause  leaves a sense of something ineffably tragic, yet vitally heroic, being lived through to its inevitable end. Heroic, because the magnificent interconnectedness of the structures of life and of art that Saids pieces strive to grasp, presenting itself to the mind and body as a complexity both in and out of time, is like a terrible angel with whom the intellect must wrestle perpetually. So, the relentless progress of Saids critical articulacy and scholarship, stalked by the fear that there never will be world enough and time, is also a chronicle of this wrestling with the angel of connectedness in a darkness both historical and personal. And tragic, not only because of the inevitability of the Last Things, but also because of the nature of music itself.         
	In his review of a 1992 recital by the Hungarian pianist, Andrs Schiff, dedicated to the memory of Rudolf Serkin, Said writes about the inherent tragedy of musical eloquence: Music is an art of expression without the capacity to say denotatively and concretely what is being expressed The sadder the music, then, the closer it comes to metamusic, music confined to itself, meditating on itself, mourning the loss of its object. Thus, quoting Keats and Proust in a late and loving essay on his friend and collaborator in musical peace-making, the Jewish pianist and conductor, Daniel Barenboim, Said presents the musical work, like all other works of art, as the child of silence. The work of elaboration, therefore, is an endless process of interpretation on the part of the performer  drawing music out of its silence, so to speak  that must match a great composers capacity for endless invention, as Gould wracked himself to match Bachs. The listening writer, shackled to a world of words that music forever eludes, becomes a co-labourer in this enterprise, elaborating the elaborated in his attempt to restore the experience of music to the realm of intelligent critical reception.         
	This book begins and ends with two grand musical careers at opposite ends of the spectrum of musical genius: Goulds neurotically self-destructive, rigorously cerebral, self-apotheosizing pianism and, its radiant obverse, Barenboims seemingly effortless, and still unfolding, mastery of an extraordinary range of pianistic, operatic and symphonic expression. Paradoxically inseparable in his inner life of music, Gould and Barenboim together embody Saids terminal vision of what musical elaboration must aspire to  both in the making of, and in writing about the making of, music: [the] seemingly infinite capacity for taking the material of music and giving it the density and complexity of life itself, life elaborating itself into pattern, structure, order, energy and, not least, surprise and joy.        
	With J.S. Bachs achievements in counterpoint as a sort of Platonic template (setting the limits of musical contemplation and execution that were continually tested by Gould), Saids abiding interests remain both the virtuosic and the intellectual elements in Western classical music. Being a gifted pianist as well as a regular concert-goer, Saids critical understanding of virtuosity is both musicological and sociological. He is as alert to the production of musical greatness or showmanship within what Adorno had called the modern Culture Industry as to the details and nuances of digital or vocal technique and interpretation. His warmest and most sharply discerning criticism is reserved for the talking musicians like Gould, Alfred Brendel, Charles Rosen and Pierre Boulez, whose careers deliberately combine playing, conducting and composing music with teaching, writing and lecturing about it. His favourite bte noire is the Metropolitan Opera in New York, with its addiction to the routine and the safe and its intellectual cowardice  the latter, specifically in opera and generally in the international concert and music-festival circuit, provokes him to a devastatingly entertaining prose. Saids criticism draws as much from historical scholarship (Larry Dreyfus on Bach, Winton Dean on Handel, Maynard Solomons biographies of Beethoven and Mozart, or Peter Ostwalds of Gould) as from his vast, yet intimate knowledge of literature and cultural or political theory, elegantly using Shakespeares Cleopatra to illuminate Handels or Donnes image of the ecstatic to clarify Goulds eccentricity.        
	Reading Music at the Limits in India, where the death of the classical is all but perfected, and where the most powerful public discourses on culture tend to be founded on anything but intelligence and honesty, it is difficult to rescue the uplift of Saids immense brilliance from the pull of an equally immense bleakness.                    AVEEK SEN

	The global language                  
	Sir  With reference to Million-word march? Nothing but sham, June 16, two corrections are in order. One, scholars do not react with blunt outrage to our work, linguists do. In fact, our work is regularly incorporated into peer-reviewed, scholarly articles across the world. Two, Global Language Monitor has never sought the approval of linguists who from the beginning have maintained that since you cannot define what a word is, you cannot count them.          
	Finally, the article (and the linguists) failed to address the oft-stated purpose of the Million Word March  the celebration of the coming of age of English as the first, true global language.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Royally stripped          
	Sir  Since Independence, India has dispensed with the zamindari and the feudal systems. About 40 years ago, Indira Gandhi took away the privy purses of the erstwhile maharajas. However, over time, we have created new kinds of rajas of varying grades  from panchayat members to Central ministers, from D-grade government employees to secretary-level bureaucrats in our administrative departments  who acquire riches and favours according to their positions in the bureaucracy. They do so by using varied and ingenious obstructive techniques. Ordinary citizens are at their mercy for getting any work done.          
	Can the new government cut these rajas down to their real status of diligent public servants? If it can, then it will be remembered as one that delivered the country from evil.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Biswajit Chaudhuri, Calcutta

      
	Sir  The editorial, Bowed out (June 18), while stating the legitimacy of the dropping of the royal titles among politicians, does not take into account a feudal mindset among a large section of Indians, as seen in the same days Your voice SMS poll. Fifty per cent of the respondents said that the former royals should be allowed to use their titles.          
	This attitude is hard to fathom in these times among the educated. One ought to realize that the theatrical loftiness of royalty does not come from their abilities or from hard work. It is nauseating that a persons status is because of his ancestors having lived off the labour and taxes of others.           
	With politics becoming a lucrative career option in India, such people from royal families, fit for very little else, are taking it up in droves. After all, how many of these royals are academically brilliant or have civil or military competence or entrepreneurial skills?          
	Ultimately shorn of their titles and privy purses, they see politics as a way of giving vent to their silly raja-praja psychosis. The use of royal titles  the silliness apart  is also discriminatory and should be lawfully deemed as an offense equal to the discrimination on the basis of caste, religion and gender.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Health horror          
	Sir  I was horrified to hear about the conditions at the Beleghata hospital (Swine flu suspect walks out, June 8). It is inexcusable that a metropolitan city does not have proper healthcare facilities to handle infectious diseases, and it is a shame that the government is doing nothing to change the hellish condition of the hospital. I wonder why Mamata Banerjee is not raising her voice about this, after all her claims to being constructive in her opposition.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Sourav Roy, Bangalore

                
	Sir  There seems to be just too much of a scurry over the reported cases of swine flu in India. It seems to be a viral infection best treated with rest, plenty of fluids and anti-fever pills. In a country the size of ours, instead of providing relief to poor harried citizens dying of starvation and thirst, swine flu seems to have become the preoccupation of the season, claiming too much attention from the government.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Plastic menace          
	Sir  Even if the governments notification on the health warning to be displayed on all tobacco products results in only a marginal downturn in cancer cases, it is worth the effort. Another aspect that needs to be touched upon is the nuisance caused by the tiny plastic sachets in which chewing tobacco products are retailed. Roads and side-walks are littered with empty plastic sachets. These are not attractive enough for the rag-pickers and are small enough to be shoved into the grilled drains by the municipality sweepers. They could also find their way into the drains during the rains. There is a strong case for banning plastic sachets for all products including tobacco. Large packages containing, say, 50 paper sachets may be allowed in plastic bags of permissible grade. Even liquid consumer products like soaps and sauces, though not usually consumed in open spaces, should be retailed in aluminium sachets. The environmental issues fall within the state governments ambit. They need not wait for the Centre to act.          
	Yours faithfully,

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Letters to Editor
                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Out of place                  
	Sir  The citizens of the United States of America have created history by electing the nations first Afro-American president, Barack Obama. Once upon a time, in the same country, blacks were not even allowed to vote or eat in restaurants frequented by whites. But Americans now have taken a bold step and accepted change by electing their president on the basis of his capabilities rather than his religion or race.          
	I have been a victim of religious discrimination and made to feel like a second-class citizen in my own country when I was refused accommodation because of my religion. But I still dream that India will overcome such communal profiling and become a land of opportunities like the US by shunning bigotry and providing equal opportunity for all.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Mohammed Asif Iqbal, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The fact that Mohammed Asif Iqbal was refused a flat for rent because he is Muslim is a blot on secular West Bengal (Not for all, Jan 22). It has unmasked the biased face of the secular bhadralok. Is this the same state that offered refuge to the Gujarat riot-victim, Qutubuddin Ansari? Do the educated people of the state, governed by a secular party, think that Muslims are, by default, terrorists? Shrikant Purohit and Pragya Singh Thakur were not Muslims. But because of their involvement in the Malegaon blast, should Hindus now be denied accommodation as well?           
	On the one hand, Muslims are being mistreated, and on the other, the community is being asked to prove its patriotic credentials to a nation whose majority despises it. People can be patriotic, if they are treated equally. Will Muslims ever be allowed to live a peaceful and secure life anywhere in India?                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Shahid Jalal Hashami, Kankinara, 24 Parganas (N)

      
	Sir  Whenever Calcuttas Bengalis demand their cultural rights, liberals term them zealots and oppose their claim on the ground that this cosmopolitan city is home to a large number of non-Bengalis. But when any kind of ill plagues the city, the sword inevitably dangles over Bengalis. The credit for all that is good in Calcutta is given to the migrant non-Bengalis, while the native Bengalis are made to bear the burden of the citys liabilities. The editorial, Not for all, employs the same twisted philosophy to lambaste Bengalis for Calcuttas communal mindset. But does The Telegraph know how many Bengalis are still left in this city? Thanks to the numerical and economic strengths of non-Bengalis, the original inhabitants have almost ceased to exist. Calcutta has become communal because of the take-over of the city by outsiders, who have brought along with them the communal culture of the places of their origin. Consequently, the liberal culture of this city has perished. Many housing societies populated by non-Bengalis who are vegetarian see to it that fish-eating Bengalis do not purchase apartments there. Bengalis interested in buying property are asked to adhere to a strict vegetarian diet. In spite of having full knowledge of this, individuals, political parties or the media have not come forward to highlight the atrocities perpetrated on Bengalis for the fear of being called parochial.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Kajal Chatterjee, Sodepur

                
	Sir  The case involving Mohammed Asif Iqbal is puzzling. Iqbal apparently does not face any problem in his present locality: the predominantly Hindu College Street area. But he was denied lodging in Salt Lake because of his religion. Are the people of Salt Lake mentally and culturally different from those in central Calcutta? It is well-known that affluent people are usually tactful and seldom show their true feelings. Even if they have a prejudice against someone, they are unlikely to express it blatantly, and the people of Salt Lake are no exception. The allegations are serious and need to be probed thoroughly because people of all communities, castes and religions have a right to live peacefully here.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
A. Roy Mukherjee, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  The discrimination faced by Mohammed Asif Iqbal is appalling. Such incidents, albeit widespread, often pass unnoticed. One wonders how such things can happen in Calcutta, supposedly the cultural capital of India.           
	I am a journalist-turned-educationist. A couple of years back, when I was working for a news agency in the city, I had to go house-hunting for a few months. But I ended up having the same experience as Iqbals. Finally, I had to make do with a small room in a Muslim para. It is unfortunate that in the wake of the Mumbai attack, Muslims are being looked upon with suspicion. The connection of a handful of so-called Muslims with terrorism should not make people think that every individual in the community is a criminal. In fact, no religion, be it Islam or others, teaches the practice of terror. Calcutta has always been acclaimed for its cosmopolitan ambience. Such divisions will just bring it infamy unless Calcuttans shake off their petty prejudices.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Ahtesham Ahmad, Andal, Burdwan

                
	Sir  The Telegraph has unnecessarily given importance to Mohammed Asif Iqbals experience while looking for a place to stay in Salt Lake. It is a known fact that Hindus and Muslims live in segregated spaces n every city, town or village in India. To ascertain this fact, one only has to visit Raja Bazar, Watgunge, Kidderpore or Topsia, which are well-known Muslim ghettos. Like Iqbal in Salt Lake, a Bhattacharjee too would find these areas out of bounds for him.           
	Incidentally, how many high-rises in Calcutta have a substantial Muslim population? In India, Muslims and Hindus have never lived in harmony. The veneer of secularism falls off at the slightest scratch. If Hindus and Muslims were indeed brothers, why was the country divided on religious lines, and at the cost of countless lives?          
	The sad truth is that whatever their social standing, Indians are a communal people. So why blame Hindu or Muslim fundamentalists alone?           
	Yours faithfully,      
Satyabrata Gupta, Calcutta

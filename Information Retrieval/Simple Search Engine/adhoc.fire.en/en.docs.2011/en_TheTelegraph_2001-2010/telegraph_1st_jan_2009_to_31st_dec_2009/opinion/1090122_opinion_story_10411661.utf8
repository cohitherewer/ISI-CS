                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Tug of war                  
	Sir  In Principle of exclusion (Jan 15), Mukul Kesavan points out that Hamas could be a bad omen for the future Palestinian state because of its inherently fundamentalist character. However, Hamas is the popular party for the majority of the Palestinian people. It has undertaken many philanthropic measures, unlike its rival, Fatah. So, Israels collusion with the United States of America to throttle Palestinian support for Hamas should be condemned. The recent outbreak of conflict in the Middle East could have been averted had Fatah been more sincere in its efforts to curb corruption and to put pressure on the US and Israel to bring about a two-state solution.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The carnage in Gaza went on for days, with the international community unable to bring any form of solace to the besieged and beleaguered strip. Even schools run by the UN came under the purview of the Israel army as innocent children were killed. Israel has, under the false pretext of securing its borders, capitalized on the lives of innocent people in order to gain electoral mileage in the forthcoming elections.           
	Since the 1967 war, Gaza has been an open prison, where 1.5 million people are struggling with penury, humiliation, malnutrition and illiteracy. The economic blockade, and the inability of NGOs to reach essential aid to Gazans make daily life excruciatingly difficult. Israel has every right to defend its borders, but this does not allow it to target civilians. It is ironic that even after years of trying to control Gaza through torture, harassment and indiscriminate firing, Israel has not succeeded in fortifying its territory. Further, it has failed to acknowledge the clear mandate given to Hamas by Palestinians. Israel has maintained instead that Hamas is a terrorist outfit.           
	While many media have been allowed into Israel to examine the rockets launched by Hamas, few have been given entry into the occupied territory. And the rockets launched by Hamas cannot be compared with the sophisticated weapons supplied to Israel by the US. The only solution, it seems, lies in mutual dialogue.           
	Yours faithfully,         Yasmin Banu, Abu Dhabi, UAE               
	Sir  It is perhaps not all that well-known that during the six-month-long truce called by Hamas, Israel ignored the pact, carried on targeted killings, and imposed a vicious blockade of Gaza, prompting United Nations agencies to call it a humanitarian catastrophe. During this one-sided ceasefire, Israel continued to plan how to subjugate Gaza further. It is ironic that the victims of Nazi atrocities are now committing war crimes in a tiny piece of land, bombarding it from air, water and land. The Hamas rockets are mostly homemade and of much shorter range than the complex electronic weaponry supplied by the US to Israel that are targeted on Hamas and the civilian population. No US administration has had the courage to stand up to the Jewish lobby, since its votes and cash are essential to its survival. By now, the uselessness of the UN security council has been repeatedly exposed. The abject inefficacy of Arab nations like Egypt that are mostly US cronies also brings out the lack of a strong will to stand up and be counted.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The Israel armys attack on Gaza city in the name of eliminating the Hamas is inhuman and condemnable. It is sad that the so-called powerful nations are keeping mum, while the UN remains mysteriously ineffective. As always, the US did precious little to preserve peace in the region, although it claims itself to be the negotiator between Palestine and Israel. It is shameful that India never choose not to clarify its position.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Kapil Sarma, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  The Israeli occupation was half as brutal as the Palestinians allege. Surely, they could have done everything in their power to ensure that Israel did not reoccupy Gaza after leaving it unilaterally. Instead, Palestinians did everything they could to make sure that Israel did reoccupy the territory. This is not the first time that Israel has left the region only to return in response to Palestinian terror. Clearly, Palestinians have something to gain by remaining an occupied nation. What brings about this situation? Do Palestinians prefer to remain victims in the eyes of the world, together with the excuse to continue the conflict in the guise of a resistance, more than they desire the end of the occupation?           
	It is the Israelis who stand to gain most from ending the occupation. Israel has a successful economy and, for such a small country, excels in fields of technology, medical research and much else. Israel does not want to see young lives wasted in the army through continued conflict. Given the international view of the conflict, it may sound odd to say that Israelis want the end of occupation more than Palestinians. But how else can one explain Israels unilateral decision to end the occupation of Gaza? I cannot imagine most brutal occupiers choosing to end their siege willingly, when they have the military might to continue.           
	Yours faithfully,        Michelle Moshelian, Givatayim, Israel              
	Singled out          
	Sir  The Kerala police had allegedly demanded no-crime certificates from migrant labourers of West Bengal before letting them live and work in the state. These clearances had to be provided by local police stations, voters identity card and ration card not being good enough. Such demands infringe on the citizens right to move anywhere within India. This attitude also smacks of regionalism. The editorial, Who goes there? (Jan 2), supports the move partially, and in a structured manner. If this mode of operation is accepted in principle, before long it would be difficult to resist similar demands from other states. Many would automatically be turned into outsiders. People of dubious character do not come from one specific region, nor speak only Bengali. Why should then people from West Bengal be singled out for discrimination?          
	Yours faithfully,

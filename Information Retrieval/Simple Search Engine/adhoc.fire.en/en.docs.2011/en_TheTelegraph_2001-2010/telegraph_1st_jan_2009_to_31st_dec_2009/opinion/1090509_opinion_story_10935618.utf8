                                                                                                                 COOLLY INAPPROPRIATE                                                          
	An animal, obviously, would not have done. But Section 160 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 does say that the Election Commission is free to requisition any vehicle, vessel or animal for the transporting of ballot boxes or human beings for the sake of the elections. India offers a variety of animals for transport: bullocks, oxen, camels, horses, elephants, donkeys, mules  the EC can take its pick. But none is fitted with twin air-conditioners and televisions, as is Sachin Halders Tata Safari, designed to carry his ailing wife to and from her doctor. The election officer using it simply cannot give it up since the EC requisitioned it for election duty from April 23.        
	Mr Halder, a trader from Canning, went to court in desperation. But the district election officer of South 24-Parganas has contested the court order to return the vehicle to its owner, while the counsel for the state government has claimed that the court has no jurisdiction in a case involving the EC once the electoral process has begun. This is a frightening escalation in the ECs self-assertion, coming after its determined entry into the National Library for electoral purposes. There seems to be a singular flaw in the basic understanding of what the electoral process in a democracy is all about. The flaw emanates from the RPA itself. The act legitimizes the requisitioning of private property and vehicles for public, or governmental, purposes during elections. Requisitioning is not the same as snatching. Especially in a democracy, based on concepts of certain basic freedoms, such requisitioning should rely on the owners permission and freely given cooperation. Coercion is antithetical to everything a democracy symbolizes. And the EC, charged with the onerous duty of ensuring the conduct of free and fair polls, is the last institution that can afford to be seen as coercive, unfair and uncaring of a court order.        
	Mr Halders incredible predicament is cause for even greater alarm on two counts. The first is more obvious. He represents the ordinary Indian at the mercy of administrative institutions, including the all-encompassing and faceless phenomenon called the government. That his car, which his ill wife needs, is being used in the noble task of making arrangements for every Indian to express his choice is a piece of black humour Kafka would have delighted in. But less obvious is the quiet corruption of allegedly the most upright institutions by the insidious atmosphere of power-abuse. There is an alarming affinity between the ECs attitude and the state government lawyers defence of it that would immediately remind every thinking citizen of West Bengal of the rude and intolerant culture of the Left Front, particularly of the Communist Party of India (Marxist). The EC should be the first to accept that conducting free and fair polls also means perpetuating a free and fair democratic culture.

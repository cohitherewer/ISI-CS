                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Common ground                  
	Sir  Ashok Mitras gift of being able to see beyond the surface of things is well reflected in his article, Royal moves (May 25). As the Indian Premier League raged on with its auctioned royals, chargers, kings and knights, Mitra contrived an American link between the New York Yankees and the Mumbai Indians, since he could not link the latter with any cavalry glory. For obvious reasons, Mitra seems to have remained silent on the Delhi Daredevils.          
	But who would dare refute Mitras view that India is a loosely-knit country, sutured and plastered by the British Raj before the handover on the midnight of August 15, 1947? Linguistically, culturally, culinarily and aesthetically, an individual of a state in India differs from his fellow of another state as much as he differs from the citizens of Sudan or Greenland. Indians miserably lack a common consciousness. To add to this woe, a large portion of the population seeks such a consciousness in the form of Hindu gods and goddesses or, as Mitra would have us believe, in reliving Indias glorious romantic past. As the recent polls point out, these gods and goddesses have played a considerable role in the electoral success in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra, notwithstanding the personal disappointment of L.K. Advani.           
	It seems that the Indian people  as opposed to Mitras peoples  are more in need of a stable rule than a national ethos. This is why they are inexorably drawn towards dynasties. Only the dynasts are able to generate the assurance of stability and of a fight against the spectre of Hindu communalism. The lives of the dynasts have not been a bed of roses. The foremost of the lot, Jawaharlal Nehru, with years of imprisonment behind him, had to contend with the horrors of communal riots and rising Hindu communalism in his time. The second-in-line, Indira Gandhi, had gone through the agonies of bank nationalization, discontinuation of royal remittances, the creation of Bangladesh and Operation Blue Star at Amritsar. The third one, Rajiv Gandhi, met a tragic end.           
	These dynasts were neither royals nor kings, but had evolved from an erudite Kashmiri clan. True, the patriarch, Motilal Nehru, had made his pile through legal practice; yet, he became a confirmed nationalist, although less of a radical than his son. The Nehru dynasty did not give rise to kings or industrialists (the closest to kings in contemporary India) but rather to a barrister, a pilot, an automobile engineer, and statesmen.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Soumitra Lahiri, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Ashok Mitras assaults on familiar windmills have ceased to amuse, or even outrage. Repetition, alas, is the worst enemy of such sentiments. Mitra has offered us a set of fantasies that would do Winston Churchill proud. Indians are merely a collage of languages, ethnicities, caste groups and other demi-nationalities who choose to live together largely because of inertia. Indians are not a people, but peoples bound by a special species of yeast made of a romantic yearning for medieval monarchies. For evidence we just need to take a look at the names of the IPL franchises. Does Mitra expect that to amuse us? Or would that cause outrage? Mitra could surely do better.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Kushajata, Philadelphia, US

                
	Right time          
	Sir  Two much-neglected public issues need immediate attention.          
	First, the electricity bills of the Calcutta Electric Supply Corporation reach many of its consumers in the third week of the month, while the date for payment is slated in the last week of each month. Many consumers fail to pay the bills within the stipulated date for want of cash in hand, and they prefer to pay the dues at the beginning of the next month. In this way, they lose out on the rebate amount that is offered for payments within the due date, and the CESC stands to gain lakhs every month.          
	Second, the Calcutta Telephones also operates on the same principle. Its monthly bills often reach consumers either on a fixed due date or a day in advance. This date also happens to come towards the end of the month when pockets are empty. Here, too, the consumers are forced to pay late charges. Moreover, only a limited number of post offices and cash offices receive the bill payment till the due date. Thereafter, one has to go to one of the handful of Caltel cash offices or to the central cash collection department on Hare Street. Post offices do not accept cash payments after the due date, and either refuse to take bills for cellphone services or ask the consumers to stand in a separate queue after they have paid the landline bill. Why is it that a single post office counter cannot accept two separate bills at a go?                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Kshitij Mhamia, Calcutta

                
	Erratum          
	In A different closeness (May 23) by Somak Ghoshal, Sarbari Roy Choudhurys sculpture, Gurudev, was identified to be a portrait of Rabindranath Tagore. Akar Prakar, which hosted the exhibition of Roy Choudhurys sculptures, points out that the work was actually based on the artists own guru, Pradosh Dasgupta. The error is regretted.           
	 The Editor

	Slumdog Millionaire has taken the film world by storm. The film is an international recognition, and celebration, of the profound resilience of the less-privileged in an evolving India. The film is positive, because it reflects the strength and spirit of a large number of citizens, despite the unfathomable hard realities that they live through, fight against and often conquer. It should be compulsory viewing for all politicians and administrators who have failed to deliver the simple, ordinary dignities of life to the majority in this nation. We need to move away from the predictable reaction to films such as this that reveal both the underbelly and the fulfilment of a dream, which traverses the horrors and emerges out of the mire, ready to fly. Imagine, if we had put a basic infrastructure in place over the last 60 years, India and Bharat would have been a superpower to contend with, charged with the energy of its human resource bank, a buoyant stock!        
	At a time when the rich, Western world is in deep recession, India wins in comparison because it is able to live within the constraints of a shortage economy, something it has had to endure for decades post Independence. Our leaders and administrators have ignored the call and failed to deliver the basic needs of the people through the long period of the command economy and thereafter. From that mess rises the slumdog millionaire, and, simultaneously, the latent guilt of the privileged along with the baring of the underbelly of the economic metropolis of India that was luring foreign investments, having looked the other way from what lay at the entry point to a shining India.         
	These are the parallel lines of India and Bharat. Exposing them had the nationalists up in arms. The pseudo-intellectuals called it a Bollywood film like any other, with all the chat-pata ingredients of music and dance. They were condescending about its content and cinematic quality, while the Bafta Awards hailed Slumdog Millionaire as the best British Film, with two Indians getting awards, one for the music and the other for sound editing.                
	Break free        
	The Brits are not getting paranoid and hysterical about the Indian theme, the Indian faces, the Indian music, and have proudly called it their countrys best film. We, too, need to grow up and shed the insecurities that continue to haunt us despite having been freed from colonial domination over half a century ago. And if we are so sensitive about our neglected poor, the abject poverty that stalks vast sections of this civilization and the seedy underbelly of this dynamic nation that is in the throes of change, we need to demand and ensure that a radical solution is crafted to stem the dilution of civil society and turn the tide. It is only when we face the truth of our inabilities thus far that we will be in a position to identify, and put in place, the correctives on a war footing.        
	In all this neo-nationalism and constant talk of Indian pride that influence reviews and deliberations on books and films about aspects and realities of Indian society, there seems to be another kind of yardstick when it comes to being awarded good money by overseas companies, partners, agents and even products. That was the result of the opening up of the economy, of joining the excitement of the world order, of shedding the erstwhile parochial positions, of embracing all as one large and diverse community. It was positive and we needed to add value to this exercise by a renewal of our repressed skills and sensibilities. We ignored India and its best and brightest. We continue to do so.         
	Congratulations to Slumdog Millionaire, to its ethos and its inspiration. It represents one of the many realities of India that compels individuals to reach for the sky. It was an alien vision, unencumbered by any baggage of guilt, and applauded the human determination to break loose.

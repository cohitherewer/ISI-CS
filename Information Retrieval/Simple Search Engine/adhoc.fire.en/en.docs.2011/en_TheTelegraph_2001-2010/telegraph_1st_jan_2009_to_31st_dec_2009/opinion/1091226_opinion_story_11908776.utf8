	Why did it take 19 years for a molestation case to reach sentencing? Of all the questions raised by the shameful outcome of Ruchika Girhotras case, this has to be answered first. Ruchika killed herself three years after the former director-general of the Haryana police, S.P.S. Rathore, molested her and was caught out by Ruchikas friend, Aradhana Parkash. She did not die because of disgust or shame, but, in a painful irony, because of the courage she and her friend showed by complaining against the policeman who was then an inspector-general. Although a first information report was not registered then, a departmental inquiry found him guilty. But power has often been shown to have a longer reach than the law in India. Rathore evidently had powerful political protectors, who are now feebly claiming innocence. He reportedly threatened the superior officer who conducted the inquiry, the report of which was quietly shelved by the government. Rathore continued to rise in the police force, and continued to threaten Ruchikas family  her brother was charged with car thefts, the two girls were threatened by goons wherever they went, Aradhanas father, who had taken up the fight for justice for Ruchika, suddenly found complaints piling up against him in his workplace. Expelled from school on a trumped-up charge three years later, and unable to bear what was happening to her loved ones, Ruchika poisoned herself at 17.        
	Three years is a long enough time for the case of molestation of a minor by an adult in charge  Rathore was president of the Haryana Lawn Tennis Association and Ruchika and Aradhana were young players  to have been judged. Perhaps the most unbearable feature of this case is that Ruchika might have lived had the law its own rightful space to function in. For a long time now, activists have been asking that cases of sexual abuse, molestation and rape be disposed off fast. Ruchikas case shows why delay is so treasured by the establishment. Although the Central Bureau of Investigation took on the investigation in 2003, nothing would have moved without the determination of Aradhana and her parents.        
	Yet, what has at last arrived in the form of justice is bitterly inadequate. The link between Rathores actions, especially after Ruchikas complaint, and Ruchikas suicide, has not been made. So the ex-policeman has escaped  gleefully  the charge of abetment to suicide. In India, it may be impossible to imagine how far the establishment will go to protect a political favourite; for that, it is necessary to refer to reality. The first judgment in the case of Jessica Lals murder, too, had the same quality of the surreal. Even without the abetment charge, a six-month jail term and a fine of Rs 1,000, with immediate bail, begins to look like a bad joke. The fight for justice cannot be over yet.

                                                                                                                 TRUE ASSET                                                    
	Friendship can be of many kinds. By politely refusing the Delhi High Courts request to act as amicus curiae, or friend of the court, the constitutional expert, Fali S. Nariman, may have acted out one of its many varieties. Mr Nariman has not left anyone in any doubt as to his reasons for refusal. He cannot be neutral, he has said, he has very clear views on the matter to be decided upon. That is not surprising, because the matter is fundamental to the understanding of equality before the law. The Supreme Court has filed a petition in the Delhi High Court, challenging the Central Information Commissions directive that judges must publicly declare their assets. Mr Nariman has lucidly argued for full transparency on the part of the judiciary regarding asset declaration. Since judges have the power of life and death over offenders, as well as the power to imprison anyone who flouts their direction, they must also set the example in obeying the law.        
	Mr Narimans emphasis on the need for judges to set an example suggests more than is said. The law demands that all officers of the government, all representatives of the people, elected or nominated, and even judges in the lower courts declare their assets. It would be an illustration of the equality of the law when the higher judiciary does so too. It is confusing for people when they find exceptions to the law; if they cannot discern the logic, they would question the principle behind the law. Reverence for wisdom and impartiality is built on trust, not on opacity or mystery. The trust in those beings who wield the rod of justice grows through the perception of their transparency, their willingness to be accountable and their enacted faith in equality before the law. Mr Nariman mentioned the law in the United States of America that requires judges to not only declare their assets but also to explain the source of any gift worth over $50. Once again, what Mr Nariman has said is as important as what he has left unsaid. Allegations of corruption damage the high respect in which the judiciary should ideally be held, and which it evidently expects. More transparency, rather than less, is one way to tackle such allegations, alongside immediate investigation into specific charges against individuals. A judge needs to live by the strictest of codes, stricter than most, and he must be perceived to do so. Only in this is a judge more equal than others.

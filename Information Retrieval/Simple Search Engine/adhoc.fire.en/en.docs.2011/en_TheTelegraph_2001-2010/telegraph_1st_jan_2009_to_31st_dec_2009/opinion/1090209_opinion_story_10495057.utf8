	Matter for caution                  
	Sir  The news of the death of little Yash Lakhotia is truly painful (Fest put off, school dead quiet, Feb 1). What is cause for both surprise and anger is the absolute lack of strategy on the part of the police, who seem to have had no training in the handling of such cases. They had more than 36 hours and yet no attempt was made to intimidate the kidnapper through the media once it became clear that it was a person close to the family who had taken the child. Given a choice of being let off lightly or spending a life in prison, the kidnapper would probably have settled for the former. Why should the taxpayers money be wasted on a police force that has proved itself useless in cases like these?          
	Yours faithfully,       
Indraneel Chandra, New Jersey, US 

                
	Sir  I am a student of class IX and am deeply grieved by the news of the murder of the seven-year-old child, Yash Lakhotia. I also use a pool car to travel to and from school. Yash would have been celebrating Basant Panchami had his pool car not been 20 minutes late.          
	The childs murder raises serious questions about the security of students. There should be system of protection for every child under 10 years of age within and outside the school premises.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Ahana Sengupta, Calcutta

                
	Sir  There is no point in burning buses. Agitation over the murder of Yash Lakhotia should only be directed towards the police. That the child was killed makes apparent the incompetence of the police who are hand-in-glove with extortionists, illegal promoters, illicit liquor vendors and other anti-social elements. One glaring example of this is Howrah, which has turned into a hellhole because of the inefficiency and the lackadaisical attitude of the law and order enforcing personnel. The nefarious activities in Howrah haat and the regular traffic congestion are sources of income for the police. The Howrah Maidan and its adjoining areas have become the den of criminals and drug-peddlers. The situation causes untold sufferings for the people, and only the police and the political parties reap the benefits of this lawlessness.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Tusar Kanti Kar, Howrah 

                
	Sir  Incidents of indiscriminate slaughter of the innocent, cases of kidnapping, abduction and murder are on the rise not only in West Bengal but in the whole of India. Whatever the motive behind the murder of Yash Lakhotia, the manner it was perpetrated has shaken the civilized society to its roots. The child was made to eat sweets from his fathers shop that were mixed with sedatives. This is barely human. The punishments enjoined in section 302 of the Indian Penal Code may be insufficient for such criminals. I fervently appeal to the investigating agency that the probe is concluded within the shortest period and the murderers put on trial.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Salil Kumar Kar, Calcutta

                
	Struck by feeling          
	Sir  One cannot but appreciate the people of Tamil Nadu for ignoring the bandh call of some political outfits which are protesting against Sri Lankas military offensive on the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (People express bandh feelings, Feb 5). But the observation of the chief justice about the inability of the court to do anything about the peoples right to express [their] feelings comes as a surprise. It becomes a problem when such expression impinges on the rights of innumerable daily wage-earners, students and others who suffer during bandhs. The chief justice was in the past part of the Kerala high court bench, which gave a historic verdict against bandhs in 1997 with the observation that no political party or organization can claim that it is entitled to paralyse industry and commerce or to prevent citizens unsympathetic to its viewpoint from exercising their fundamental rights. That judgment was subsequently upheld by the Supreme Court.           
	Yours faithfully,       
N. Nagarajan, Secunderabad 

                
	Sir  Yet another strike, this time by lawyers, in spite of courts ruling that lawyers cannot strike. Why do strikes occur? The main culprit is the government. It does not want to enter into any dialogue with the sections of society which have grievances, and imposes its will on them. There is trouble brewing again in the banking sector as the government is unwilling to concede to bank employees demand for pension and wage revision. Where governments do not want to talk across the table, strikes will invariably occur. It is for the people to realize that failed politicians are bringing the country to a standstill.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Vasudev, Bangalore

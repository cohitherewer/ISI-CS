                                                                                                                 IMAGE, CITY AND TEXT                                                                  
	What strikes one first about Christopher Taylor and Soumitra Dass Journey to the Centre of Imperial Calcutta through photographs and writing is the title  WHITE amp; BLACK (Niyogi, Rs 2,495). It holds together the various strands of Taylor and Dass study of Calcuttas Dalhousie Square: colonialism, modernity, photography, and the collaboration between an English photographer with his ancient Rolleiflex and a native Calcuttan with an equally ancient familiarity with his citys depths and surfaces, secrets and silences. But the mischievous inversion in the title lends an askewness to these elements. We look at the photographs and read the writing expecting to be suprised as well as moved.        
	Taylors Calcutta is the spiritual kin of Eugne Atgets Paris. As a photographer, Taylor is both inclusive and intimate, standing back and looking at the city with a dispassionate eye, but also moving close and lovingly registering the details. To adapt Walter Benjamins words on Atgets Paris, Remarkably, however, almost all these pictures are empty... the city in these pictures looks cleared out, like a lodging that has not yet found a new tenant.        
	But Dass writing sketches the human absences and presences, the past and the present, into this abandoned and often ruined imperium taken forward into the life of a robust and even anarchic modernity. This is a living history of survival and inhabitation, of Hogarthian variety and Swiftian chaos, that becomes a vital counterpoint to the stillness and desolation of Taylors vision of the city. London, with its neoclassical grandeur and orderliness, is a ghostly template for this modern city. But its streets, pavements, markets and offices teem with a life that the first makers of Dalhousie Square had not bargained for: It would not be far-fetched to describe the vision of so many mouths chomping and swallowing and at the end of it excreting huge quantities of mess every day as apocalyptic. So great is the volume of trash...they generate that apart from littering every single pavement, the underground sewerage system too is clogged. Consequently, the streets go under water after every smart shower. This is how the common man strikes back at Empire  all empires.        
	This striking back takes on civic and political forms, not all of which deserve to be celebrated. It results in a kind of destruction and neglect that is allowed to continue by the citys keepers and by most of its inhabitants, whose love for the city is marked by a conspicuous absence of any idea of heritage or conservation. But the spirit of White amp; Black  in the photographs, in the text and in the relationship between the two  goes beyond the documentary and the nostalgic towards an attempt to capture a history of the present that is at once objective and personal.

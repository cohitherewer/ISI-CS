	Different strategies                  
	Sir  As far as the governments policy on dealing with cross-border terrorism is concerned, members of the Union cabinet seem to be speaking two different languages. On the one hand, the prime minister has asserted his willingness to resolve all issues with Pakistan peacefully. On the other hand, the Union home minister has said that any further misdemeanour from Pakistan will invite fierce retaliation from India. But one wonders whether such retaliation would amount to anything more than strongly-worded protests.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Broken lands          
	Sir  Ashok V. Desais article, Walls between minds (Nov 3), was illuminating. It is quite astonishing that there is still so much to learn about the Berlin Wall, even after 20 years of its demolition. And learning it from somebody who has witnessed quite a bit of the divide and its after-effects is especially enriching.          
	But, in an effort to condemn East Germanys claustrophobic regime, Desai has praised West Germany a bit too much. All those who lived in West Germany were not flawless, and neither did all of them hate the Nazi rule. The Nazi rule collapsed because of external aggression. There was no internal rebellion against Hitler. In fact, Hitler was quite popular in Germany at one time. Even after the World War II, West Germany was not exactly a bed of roses. There was much more liberty in industrial activities no doubt, which led people to migrate to the west, not the economic miracle that Desai talks of.          
	The agenda of communism was to weed out inequality and injustice, and to protect the weak and exploited. Communist economies actually produced sportspersons of the highest calibre, able scientists, and also a reasonable amount of wealth. But the problem arose when the State, which owned all the resources, started being used by the party to suit its own purposes. The party, which was manned by its loyal leaders, enjoyed undue benefits at the expense of the common mans rights and liberties. This made the people angry, and the anger ended such communist regimes.          
	Desai compares the Berlin Wall with other borders, such as the border between Norway and Sweden, or between the United States of America and Canada. But there is a difference between other borders and the Berlin Wall. Borders are built to protect a country from external attacks. But the Berlin Wall was built to keep the citizens of East Germany inside the country.                    
	Yours faithfully,         Deba Pratim Ghatak,Durgapur                    
	Sir  Ashok V. Desai talks about the German miracle, calling it a miracle of the market economy. However, not just in Germany, but also in other countries like Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, such miracles have happened. On receiving aid under the Marshall Plan, West Germanys economic policy was to let labour and raw materials operate freely in the market, which did result in a miracle, unlike other economies where elaborate plans are adopted but ultimately fail to uplift the economy.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  Aishwarya Rai Bachchan had declined to appear in an advertisement for a fairness cream of LOral, as it would deepen the bias towards womens complexions in India. Her social concern is admirable (Ashen-faced LOreal, June 26). But now her husband, Abhishek Bachchan, is acting unwisely by endorsing a cellular network that asks its subscribers to walk when you talk, knowing well how dangerous that can be.          
	Yours faithfully,

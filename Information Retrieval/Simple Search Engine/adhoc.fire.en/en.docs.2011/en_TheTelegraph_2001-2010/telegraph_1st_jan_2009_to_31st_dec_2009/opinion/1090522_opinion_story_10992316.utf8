The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | From victim to survivor
                                                                                                                 FROM VICTIM TO SURVIVOR                                                    
	A Unique Crime: Understanding Rape in India Edited by Swati Bhattacharjee, Gangchil, Rs 450        
	The two great Indian epics and the Iliad are centred around issues of womens honour. In the Mahabharat, when Draupadi is stripped in full court, she cries revenge and would not rest until she has bathed her hair in her abusers blood. Her humiliation is avenged but at the end of the war which kills her sons, she is as miserable as the mother of her enemies, Gandhari, who has lost all her 100 sons. Her lamentations unite her with a woman like Hecuba in Euripedes eponymous play.         
	Like Draupadi, Hecuba had pursued revenge, which had left her devastated. In the absence of a legal system that could mete out justice for rape or violation, women in the ancient world had to take recourse to revenge as punishment for the outrage they had suffered. But revenge, as a form of justice, was dubious solution since it often left the avenger as bereft as the avenged. The rape of women in the epics thus become a symbol of the abuse of justice itself, as Sankarlal Bhattacharjee, quoting John Webster, points out in the essay, Rape in the Epics in this collection.        
	How much has the legal situation in relation to rape changed in the modern State, which tries to dispense with the eye for an eye ideology that justifies revenge? Unfortunately, not much, if one is to go by the essays collected here. The editor, Swati Bhattacharjee, points out in the introduction that rape is a unique crime because society inflicts more suffering on the victim that on the perpetrator. This is more so in a society like Indias where One slap a day for a woman is almost a matter of Indian culture (Rape, Mental Injury and the Law). The culture of honour, which considers rape itself as a way of avenging an insult, cannot allow the wronged women to even hope for justice. L.K. Advani, during his tenure as the Union home minister, may have have prescribed the death penalty for rapists but it is debatable, as Vir Sanghvi says in Rape is Murder, whether capital punishment for rape would prevent the crime from being repeated.        
	One of the most interesting essays here is the one entitled I am not a Victim by Susama Agarwala. Agarwala, an Indian-American working on gender issues, was raped during a visit to Ghatshila. [W]hat did these four boys take from me? Not my honour. That never lay between my legs, she writes. By refusing to be victimized, she acknowledges that there is life beyond rape.         
	The essays here touch on the legal, medical, ethical and psychological aspects of rape. As such, they are interesting and enlightening. Better editing would have eliminated such phrases as termed as a liar, and added to the books value.                     ANUSUA MUKHERJEE

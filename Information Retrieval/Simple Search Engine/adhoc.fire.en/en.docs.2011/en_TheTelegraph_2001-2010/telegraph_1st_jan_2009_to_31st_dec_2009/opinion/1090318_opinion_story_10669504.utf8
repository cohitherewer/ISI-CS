                                                                                                                 BOTH TWISTED AND TURNED                                  Stephen Hugh-Jones                              
	A long road tunnel is being driven through some hills near my home. A week or so ago, my local paper tells me, the tunnellers from the two ends met, as a digger smashed through the last few inches of sandstone, joining both the southern and northern parts of the tunnel. And the work was so accurate that both halves were within an inch of meeting up perfectly.        
	Too bad the reporters English wasnt so precise. Both the phrases Ive quoted contain misuses  of, as it happens, the word both. Theyre not grave ones, but even a local weeklys use of language should be not just more-or-less but exact.        
	In the first phrase, both is simply superfluous, indeed it sticks out like a sore thumb. The digger, in fact, simply joined the two parts of the tunnel, period. Then, having used the word, the report went on to a further, if lesser, misuse of it. With the construction both... and..., the words following the both and the and should be strictly parallel. Hes guilty of both fraud and blackmail, correct. Hes guilty both of fraud and of blackmail, correct. But hes guilty both of fraud and blackmail, wrong.         
	Like many rules of English, this isnt an iron one. I can imagine writing Nehru impressed both the British and Russians, omitting a second the, as our reporter did. But its a convention worth sticking to.                
	Bad habit        
	My second citation is more interesting. Both halves met up nearly perfectly, did they? Well indeed. Could one have done so, yet not the other? This is an example of a bad habit thats become almost epidemic: writing both when you mean the two.         
	Sometimes those phrases are indeed interchangeable: the police closed the two roads, for fear of a bomb could equally read closed both roads. But often that isnt so. Thus you might write both armies advanced, both opened fire, both fought bravely. But as night fell, did both sides negotiate a ceasefire? No: the two sides did so.        
	The broad rule here is that when two actors are individually doing something, each on his own, you can say both. But when the action is necessarily joint or reciprocal, say the two. Thus, both armies went to Waterloo, but the two fought a battle there. Sure, both, individually, were fighting but they were fighting each other; and when that phrase is involved, your only choice is the two. Both Jules and Jim loved Jeanne, but the two men (not both) also liked each other.        
	Ditto when each other, or some such idea, is only implied; the two men were rivals, not both. Thus the two shared a house, but loved the same woman, fell out, decided to live apart, ultimately agreed to a duel, met in a field near Versailles, shot simultaneously but had different skills and did not die together. After which, I dare say, the surviving lovers kissed  the two of them, not both.                
	Tricky rules        
	Sometimes either both or the two is possible, but the meaning alters accordingly. If two countries are at war, and the UN sends a mediator, you may correctly write that both countries agreed to stop shooting, if you mean that, separately, each so agreed with the mediator. But if you mean they agreed with each other, you must say the two. Both men hired a bicycle implies two bikes, one apiece. The two men hired a bicycle implies they did it jointly, one bike between the pair of them.        
	The distinctions arent always clear, and, however clear, they are hardly earthshaking. Yet the rules of English grammar, like those of war, love or bicycling, exist; and in English at least youll usually gain by following them.

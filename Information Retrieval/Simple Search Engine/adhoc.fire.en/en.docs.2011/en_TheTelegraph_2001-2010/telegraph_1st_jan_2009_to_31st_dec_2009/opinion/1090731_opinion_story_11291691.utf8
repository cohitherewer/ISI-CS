	The pattern is more or less the same in state after state: the more backward districts lag way behind the more advanced ones in both quality of day-to-day administration and implementation of welfare and development projects. Whether it is supply of minikits on the eve of the kharif season or providing work under the rural employment guarantee scheme or preparing the list of persons below the poverty level, the least developed districts have the worst record of performance. This is, in everybodys reckoning, an absurd situation. Awareness of what is horridly wrong does not, however, lead to any measures of rectification, which possibly provides one rationale for the sobriquet, Unchanging India.         
	Not surprisingly, the backward districts become principal targets of insurgency groups. They cannot be blamed for taking advantage of a situation that persistent deprivation tailor-makes for them. Sums are allocated by the state government, funds flow under this or that Central scheme, every other day new projects enter the pipeline. The so-called delivery system does not work though. Either the money allotted does not arrive, or does not arrive on time; even when it finally arrives, most of it is not spent, or disappears without reaching the intended destinations. The objective reality therefore remains unaltered: the poorest districts, largely peopled by Dalits and adivasis, stay the poorest and the distance between them and the relatively prosperous continues to widen.               
	The reason for such a denouement is not far to seek. A particular administrative culture is pervasive all over the country: the juniormost civil servants, with barely a few years experience at the sub-divisional level, are usually despatched to take charge of districts that are not only the most remote from state headquarters but economically the most backward as well. The greenhorns are expected to be jacks-of-all-trades, do their magisterial chores as well as assume responsibility for guiding and monitoring the development process in the districts. They have to establish rapport with the peoples representatives in the panchayat bodies, coordinate the routine activities of the line officers such as the district executive engineer, the district health officer and the district educational officer, and supervise numerous welfare and development projects already on or at the point of being initiated. The line officers, too, happen to be as raw as the district magistrate himself. It is a collection of novices who are expected to set in motion the districts development engine, which will supposedly transform the Indian countryside and, at the same time, usher in inclusive growth.         
	To be effective, these young officers have to be adept at public relations as well. In addition to liaising with political elements in the panchayats, they have to interact with local leaders of the political parties active in the district. The officers may be full of good intentions, they may be as earnest as earnestness can be. But they lack the background of experience to cope with situations arising from time to time that call for tact and the simultaneous presence of both firmness and flexibility. Given their lack of seniority, they are also at a disadvantage while dealing with problems needing to be sorted out with officialdom in state headquarters. If funds granted under certain schemes fail to reach by the scheduled date or a fresh proposal prima facie worthy of consideration has to be pushed through, the district magistrate has to get in touch with the powers-that-be in the state capital. He often fails to make much of a headway because in the hierarchical system entrenched in the administration, junior officers generally lack the courage to assert themselves.         
	In spite of such a state of affairs, talk continues, incessantly, on the theme of inclusive growth that programmes like the national rural employment guarantee scheme are assumed to ensure. Perhaps those most vociferous in the matter do not actually mean it, their class interest militates against everything the concept of inclusive growth implies. Even so, electoral compulsions can hardly be laid aside. To be in power, it is imperative to secure at poll time the support of substantial sections of the poor. If developmental projects do not get implemented, if construction of roads and irrigation channels is delayed, if campaigns for total literacy and universal primary education fail to take off, if the most deprived are unable to find work or cannot be provided with a minimum quantity of cereals at subsidized rates, if nutritional standards are stuck at an abysmally low level, the outcome is bound to be unwholesome for the governing classes. The balance of advantage therefore lies in improving the delivery system in the poverty-stricken districts. The series of development programmes, ongoing as well as contemplated, even if implemented in full, will change only marginally the structure of income distribution in the country, the rich will continue to grow richer. Still, the chances are that the poor will be a shade less discontented. Under the present administrative dispensation though, even such a modest turn of circumstances is beyond the pale of rational expectations.         
	It is in this context that one dares to sow a wild idea. Instead of sending the juniormost officers to take charge of the least developed districts, why not experiment with a topsy-turvy arrangement? An officer belonging to the Indian Administrative Service cadre gets the opportunity to move to the Centre, as secretary or additional secretary, after serving in the state administration for a period of 25 years or thereabouts. To most officers, this transfer to a Central ministry is a much-cherished goal. They arrive in New Delhi as mature administrators equipped with a rich fund of experience. Why not insert a rule that even when an IAS officer has completed more than two decades in state administration and has gone through the mill of serving as secretary in a number of departments, the officer will not be allowed to migrate to the Centre until he completes a tour of duty as administrative head of one of the most backward districts in the state. With the experience accumulated over the years and the clout his seniority provides, the officer will be ideally placed to give a badly needed extra thrust to the overall developmental effort in the district.              
	The question of incentives and disincentives cannot, of course, be brushed aside. It should be laid down as a general rule that a senior civil servant will be considered for a major appointment at the Centre  or for a superior position in the state itself  only after spending a minimum of two years as chief of administration in the backward districts. But there should be sweeteners. While posted in a hitherto backward district, the officer could be offered the salary and emoluments a secretary to the Union government is entitled to. In addition, he may also be offered a special allowance as compensation for inconveniences caused by displacement from an urban milieu at an advanced stage of his civil-service career. As officers sent to poverty-ridden districts get content with the postings and apply themselves to the assignment they have been called upon to undertake, who knows, the entire administrative set-up could feel the impact.         
	In the early 1930s, Mahatma Gandhi shifted himself to the wilderness of the then semi-village, Wardha, right at the dead centre of the country. He was always a bit of an old fox. He had a purpose in mind: to force political eminence seeking his darshan to undergo the drudgery of travelling to Wardha; they would thereby come to comprehend the dire plight of the nations overwhelming majority and be awash with noblesse oblige. Leaders in the post-Independence era missed the point of Gandhis message. Having paid some lip service to the cause of the underdog, they chose to concentrate on developing an intensely class-skewed metropolitan culture. The consequences of their decision are now gradually being revealed. Despatching hard-boiled civil servants to the countryside is no guarantee that things will change, but it could at least have one, not insignificant, spin-off. As the civil servants begin to travel to the countrys god-forsaken interior, ruling politicians might feel compelled not to be far behind.

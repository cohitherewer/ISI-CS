                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Green turns red                  
	Sir  The report, Bengal asks for Maidan, Antony shy (Feb 20), is alarming. The Maidan, the lungs of Calcutta, has time and again been trampled upon by political parties, which have organized meetings and rallies on this green stretch. If the Maidan were to be handed over to the government, it would sound the death knell for Calcuttans who are already gasping for fresh air. The 30 years of Left rule have witnessed illegal activities in the form of filling up of ponds, felling of beautiful trees, and indiscriminate extraction of groundwater. Transferring the Maidan to the government would result in encroachment on it by hawkers. A Citu office or a concrete jungle might come up on the Maidan in the name of the proposed sports complex. Given a chance, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee would like to see the Royal Calcutta Golf Club and the Tolly club turned into a haven for encroachers.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The Left Front government has not only managed to spoil the Curzon Park and the Howrah Maidan, as reported by The Telegraph, but also ensured that common people do not get to use the Park Circus Maidan or Maddox Square for purposes that parks are meant to serve. Calcuttas parks are often used to organize fairs. After they are over, children and adults cannot tread on the grounds for fear of getting hurt on the debris that are left behind. In fact, none of Calcuttas parks is good enough for children to play in, unlike other cities that have beautifully maintained open spaces. Mamata Banerjee, too, will not protest against this crime as she agitates only on issues that she considers harmful for the people of West Bengal. Saving the greens is definitely not on her agenda.           
	Left in the care of this government, the Maidan will be soon decorated with fountains and hideous concrete structures. Bus terminuses and auto-rickshaw stands will come up at some spots, and the rest of the Maidan will be used to host political rallies. It is evident that the present government as well as the Opposition do not care about the citys environment. It is now left to the media and a few environmental activists to rouse Calcuttans to stop this degradation of the citys environs.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Sravasti Ghosh Dastidar, Colombo

                
	Sir  When I visited Calcutta recently after some years, I was very pleased to see that the Maidan had remained untouched. Coming from Dehra Dun, where open green spaces are being swallowed up in the name of development, I was happy to see that the Maidan was still preserved in its pristine beauty. I had left Calcutta 19 years ago to settle in a suburb in Dehra Dun. At that time, the place was surrounded by a reserve forest and there were green hedges surrounding the houses. Now all this has gone, that too in the name of progress. Trees have been cut to build a technical institute, which was followed by shops, eateries, boarding houses for students and by a definite change in the climate. The pollution level in Dehra Dun has risen alarmingly with the increase in vehicular traffic. My appeal to the West Bengal government is that it should keep its hands off the Maidan. There are plenty of spaces to hold fairs in Calcutta. The Maidan, and its trees, should not be allowed to die.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Reyhan Datta, Dehra Dun

                
	Sir  There is no reason to transfer the ownership of Calcuttas Maidan from the army to the government. Such a move will only make it easier for political parties to hold rallies and pollute the greens. The Calcutta Book Fair has moved away from the Maidan and has now got a permanent site, which drew a large and enthusiastic crowd this year. There is thus no need to rake up the issue of bringing the fair back to the Maidan once again. At a time when the world is fighting to preserve the environment, Calcuttas Maidan is best left under the care of the army.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Ashok Kumar Ghosh, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Unhappy with the damage they have done so far, the much vilified transport minister and his profligate companions now wish to gobble up the Maidan. One wonders what impels the present government to exploit the few remaining green stretches in the city. It is not difficult to guess the real intent behind this proposal. The governments brazen attitude can only be described as environmental terrorism. Subhash Dutta must be thanked for taking up cudgels on behalf of a silent but appreciative population.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Kunal Lohar, Nadia 

                
	Sir  The Calcutta High Court and city-based environmental activists like Subhash Dutta deserve praise for protesting against the plundering of Calcuttas precious greenery. A few months back, the court put in place a ban on smoke-belching autorickshaws plying in Calcutta. Duttas battle to save the Maidan from the clutches of the government is as important as the court order.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Nirmalya Banerjee, Calcutta

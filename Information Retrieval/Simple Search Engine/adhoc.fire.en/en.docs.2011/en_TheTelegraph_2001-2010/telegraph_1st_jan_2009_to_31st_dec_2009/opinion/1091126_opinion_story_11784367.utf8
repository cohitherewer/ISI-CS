The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Three days that shook the country
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        THREE DAYS THAT SHOOK THE COUNTRY                                  Have politics and diplomacy, national security and the media, changed in the year since 26/11?                                            
	A year ago, ten gunmen took a city hostage for nearly three days and pushed a nation into a deadly void. That city was Mumbai, and the country, Pakistan. But what impact did 26/11 have on India? Thinking back on the political record of the past one year, the answer is pretty obvious and just as baffling: not much.        
	Mumbaikars were expected to vote in huge numbers at the general elections this year, ostensibly to give their verdict on the Centres mixed performance during the siege of their city. (Though security forces did a sterling job in the end, it was evident all along how tragically unprepared the government had been to tackle a terrorist attack of such magnitude.) Yet barely one out of two people stepped out to exercise their ballot. Not only did the United Progressive Alliance return to power in New Delhi, Mumbai also voted back the Congress-Nationalist Congress Party combine in the assembly polls. A few hours into the attacks, NCPs R.R. Patil had memorably said, Big cities face [such] small problems. He is back as the home minister of Maharashtra.        
	However, it is the glorious comeback of the great defender of Marathi manoos that takes the cake. A year ago, urban India erupted with rage not only against the armed young men who shook the countrys financial capital but also against the notorious Raj Thackeray, who advocated a virtual ban on non-Maharashtrians seeking employment and residence in his home state. Emails and text messages mocked Thackerays parochial passions while praising the heroism of the security forces, mostly comprising north Indian men, who put their lives at stake to rescue Mumbai. Neither was Thackeray nor were his thuggish sena anywhere on the scene.        
	Ironically, Thackeray had never minced words  his demand, however foolhardy, had been that his home state be kept free of non-Maharashtrian settlers; he had never refused any help from the Centre. Thackerays brand of chauvinism had at best a tenuous connection with national security. So it is perhaps not all that surprising that a large section of the electorate welcomed back its native darling with open arms. The canniness of the Indian electorate is often underestimated.        
	Recalling the various catastrophes that have befallen Mumbai over the years  serial blasts, explosions in crowded stations, gruesome communal riots  the 26/11 attacks do not appear unique. The scale of the devastation was familiar, although the careful planning and perfect execution that had gone into the attacks were unprecedented. As a spectacle unfolding over several days, 26/11 was also the first of its kind, documented meticulously by the media from its inception. No other terror attack in the history of India has received such a blow-by-blow presentation on prime-time TV. It was also the first time that five-star hotels, bastions of the rich and the famous, were invaded, alongside the usual haunts of the aam admi. 26/11 became a leveller of sorts.        
	Mumbais capacity to spring back to normal life is the stuff of legend; so is the dilly-dallying of the political classes. This chalta-hai attitude has also rubbed off on Indo-Pak diplomacy. Faced with the testimony given by Mohammad Ajmal Kasab, the gunman from Faridkot who was caught alive, Pakistans initial reaction was to deny all evidence. The denial went on for weeks even as foreign media traced Kasabs roots, interviewed his parents, and found links between the Lashkar-e-Toiba and al Qaida. Finally, with the United Nations security council and the United States of America stepping up pressure, Asif Ali Zardari decided to take matters into his able hands. He legalized sharia in the tribal areas, but wove a few conditions into the bill so that the Taliban would refuse to accept it. This provided Zardari with the perfect opening to send the army into mad-mullah country. But poor man, all his cleverness backfired in civil war and a trail of terror attacks all over Pakistan.        
	There is not much that Zardari can do as the head of a State governed by forces beyond his control. Even foreign aid fails to elicit promises of good behaviour from the Pakistani establishment. When the US offered a golden carrot of $7.5 billion as part of the Kerry-Luger Act, Pakistan, despite its imminent bankruptcy, turned up its nose and refused to compromise on its sovereignty (read, its licence to make mischief). No doubt India has a great deal to reckon with one year on from 26/11. Yet it is Pakistan that still has too many ghosts to exorcise  and it is increasingly mixing up its friends with its foes.                    SOMAK GHOSHAL

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                                
	Sir  In answer to Ashok Mitras arguments in To be a suitable boy (Dec 4), one can say it is not surprising that the United States of America, being a dominant world power, wants to use its influence to get its way with India. But in this game of realpolitik, America does not hold all the important cards. India, too, has some valuable bargaining chips to play with.          
	India is planning to spend about 10 billion US dollars to buy next-generation combat aircraft, and billions more to buy other military equipment. American companies such as Lockheed and Boeing are salivating at the prospect of getting a huge piece of the pie. On the nuclear front, India does not stand to lose too much by playing a waiting game. If the US wastes too much time to operationalize its deals on opening nuclear fuel reprocessing units in India, American nuclear reactor manufacturing companies such as Westinghouse and General Electrics, which are currently suffering from lack of business, will lose out to companies from Russia, France and Canada that are already openly hawking their nuclear related products and services. Finally, now that Barack Obama has publicly declared his intention of beginning to pull out combat troops from Afghanistan from the middle of 2011, the danger that India might have to succumb to US pressure to send troops to Afghanistan is close to nil. India may, however, agree to send instructors to train Afghan military personnel. This will allow India to maintain some influence within the ranks of the Afghan military establishment.           
	As a matter of fact, the US, right now, probably does not want the Indian military in Afghanistan, because that might make the Pakistani military establishment to think that India is conniving with the US to pose a security threat. What is more likely is that the US, being a thoroughly capitalist country, wants to put political pressure on India so as to allow US companies to sell both combat aircraft and nuclear reactors to India even if they do not make for a competitive deal in relation to those being offered by Canadian and European companies.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  In To be a suitable boy, Ashok Mitra has showered flower and perfume  as the Bengali saying goes  on China and, as is usual for a Marxist, has lambasted the US. Mitra says that the magnitude of US investments in China, currently rang[es] at around 80 billion dollars each year [while] the total flow of foreign direct investment into India is yet to reach the annual rate of even eight billion dollars.          
	A few generations back, most Marxists would have regarded such a flow of foreign capital into any country as the equivalent of that country being sold to the investors. By an ideological somersault, the Marxists in West Bengal now consider a country welcoming so much foreign investment to have done a great deed. Mitra has castigated India for extending an open invitation to international  and especially American  finance capital to come and partake of the grand Indian spread. While this may seem to contradict the previous point, it should not surprise in that it brings out Mitras Marxist credo in its true form.          
	Mitra thinks that cheap Chinese goods are necessary to keep American consumers happy. Perhaps he is not aware that the greater part of the goods imported from China by the US is low-technology objects such as safety pins, calculators, combs, belts and so on. By importing them, the US market, far from depending on China, reaps the benefits of getting cheap unorganized labour. Such goods are mostly produced by local subsidiaries of US companies. Even if China stops exporting such products, they can still be had from poorer countries such as Bangladesh or Bolivia. American markets are flooded with imports from all over the world. The US itself produces sophisticated goods  pipeline for sub-zero temperatures, giant computers, supersonic jets and so on  which are badly needed by China and many other countries.          
	Mitra goes on to write, Americans are not very particular about human rights. Yet, unlike in China, one can travel freely in America, can reside anywhere, form associations and talk against government policies without fear.          
	Lastly, one wonders how the writer could mix up the question of human rights with that of war. The USs wars in Iraq or in Afghanistan do not constitute a violation of human rights. Human rights pertain to individual rights whereas wars, whether right or wrong, are fought for the sake of national interest.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Watch out          
	Sir  The Telegraph carried a small photograph (Bird watch, Dec 2) of some birds in Allahabad with the caption, Seagulls over the Ganga in Allahabad on Tuesday.          
	Now, seagulls could never have gone to Allahabad. The picture is really small and it is difficult to make out the exact species from it, but an educated guess by senior bird-watchers in the city is that the birds are possibly brown-headed gulls. This might appear too trivial a distinction to non-bird-watchers. But the error is akin to displaying a photograph of boys playing cricket with the caption saying girls playing hockey. Being a regular reader of The Telegraph, I expect nothing short of the highest standards of reportage from the paper. If indeed seagulls have started going to Allahabad, it would make for an anchor story and merit a thorough scientific inquiry into the phenomenon.          
	Meanwhile, it is nice to know that gulls are actually thriving around the Ganga in Allahabad which means that the water is not as polluted there as we imagine it to be.

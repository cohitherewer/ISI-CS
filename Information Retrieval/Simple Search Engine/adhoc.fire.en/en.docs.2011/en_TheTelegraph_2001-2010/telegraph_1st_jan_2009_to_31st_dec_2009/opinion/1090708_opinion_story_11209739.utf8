	Not guilty        
	 Under Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, persons who act in furtherance of a common intention are jointly responsible for the offence committed. A trial court in Madhya Pradesh convicted all persons present at the site of a murder, holding that they acted in furtherance of a common intention. When the high court rejected their appeal, the accused approached the Supreme Court. The apex court held that Section 34 may be applicable where it was difficult to distinguish acts committed by several persons. The court concluded that in this case, two persons among those convicted had merely accompanied the offender. They were unarmed, had no enmity with the deceased and as no particular act was attributable to these two persons, they should be acquitted.

	Unjust fees        
	 The collector and district magistrate of Chhapra, Bihar, declared a certain area as a bus stand and imposed parking fees on the buses under the Motor Vehicles Act. A bus owner challenged the step as no bus stand actually stood there. The Patna High Court declared that parking fees should be imposed in exchange of service rendered by the state. Since the state is a beneficiary of the fees, it should provide the infrastructure required to park vehicles. Where parking and halting facilities were non-existent, the state could not collect fees by merely declaring an area to be a parking site. (Punam Singh vs state of Bihar)                     
	Invalid notice        
	 Under the Bihar Public Demands Recovery Act, the certificate officer of a bank issued a notice to M/s Bimal Wire Nail Industries. However, the proceeding was dropped as the form accompanying the notice was not signed by the certificate officer. The order was set aside when the bank made an appeal. The bank contended that the absence of signature was merely a procedural error. Disagreeing, the Jharkhand High Court held that the absence of a signature was enough for the certificate to be deemed invalid. However, the court allowed the officer to proceed with the case after complying with the mandatory provisions under the law. (M/s Bimal Wire Nail Industries vs state of Jharkhand and others)

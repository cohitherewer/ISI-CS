The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Those who found the true way
                                                                                                                 THOSE WHO FOUND THE TRUE WAY                                  THIS ABOVE ALL -   KHUSHWANT SINGH                          Serving god                                        
	Indians from all states of the union are to be found in almost every country of the world. The most visible are Sindhis, Sikhs, Gujaratis and Keralites. All the four try to maintain links with their motherland for at least a generation or two, and if they are doing well, send a part of their savings to improve the living conditions of their kinsmen back home. Some examples come readily to mind: the Hindujas (Sindhis) have built a huge hospital in Mumbai; Gulam Noon (Gujarati) has built a modern, fully-equipped hospital in Rajasthan where he spent some years. There is hardly a village in present-day Punjab which has not got a gurdwara, hospital, school or college donated by one of its sons living abroad.         
	A recently published book, Sikh Diaspora Philanthropy in Punjab: Global Giving for Local Good, edited by Verne A. Dusenbery and Darshan S. Tatla, makes a detailed historical survey of the Sikh diaspora living all over the world, with larger concentrations in England, Canada and the United States, of their contributions, and what motivated them to give away part of their earnings. It has the tedious and often boring details that scholars are prone to indulge in to give a full picture of the phenomenon.         
	They have also noted that all communities living abroad have funded fundamentalist Hindu organizations in India. For almost a decade, Sikh separatist organizations and Khalistani terrorists received handsome contributions from their fellow Sikhs settled abroad. Fortunately, they realized their folly in time  the funds dried up and the demand for Khalistan came to an end. Today, only a very embittered Simranjit Singh Mann remains. Periodically, he makes some outrageous statements to attract media attention. No one heeds him anymore.        
	The tradition of giving one-tenth of ones earnings (dasvandh) is an old Sikhism. Guru Nanak exhorted his followers:        
	Aklee Sahib seviae, Aklee paiye maan        
	Aklee parh kay bujhaia, Aklee keejey daan        
	Use your brains to serve God, and earn respect        
	Use your brains to read, understand and give in charity.                
	And again:        
	Ghall khai kiehh hutthan deh        
	Nanak raah pachhaaney seh        
	Earn by efforts and with your hands give some of it away        
	Nanak, such people have found the true way.                
	Guru after Guru lauded the need to give a part of ones earnings to the needy till it becomes a motto         
	Kirat Karo, Naam japo, Vand chhako        
	Work, take the name of God, and share your earnings with others.        
	The way these remittances are spent have fallen into a pattern. Building new gurdwaras is the first priority; schools and hospitals are second and third. If need be, the order can be reversed.         
	But a village gurdwara is not only a place of worship, it is also a community centre and a place for re-affirming the bonds of faith.                
	From a stricken heart                
	Remember Jarnail Singh? He is the man who hurled a shoe at the Union home minister, P. Chidambaram. He chose the wrong victim because Chidambaram had neither done him any harm nor had he anything to do with what had riled Jarnail. However, he hit the target he had in mind  the Congress leaders who had chosen Jagdish Tytler and Sajjan Singh as the candidates for two seats in the Lok Sabha elections to come. There was such an uproar of applause for his unpardonable misconduct that both names had to be withdrawn from the contest.        
	Jarnail Singh is going to be in the news again. Penguin (India) has signed a contract with him to tell his story and explain why he did what he did. His English is not good enough; so he has written in Hindi. Its English translation, I Accuse, is to be published in the near future.        
	I Accuse is a scathing indictment of all those who failed to discharge their duties when Hindu mobs went on a rampage following the assassination of Indira Gandhi on October 31, 1984 by two of her Sikh body-guards, and massacred nearly 5,000 innocent Sikhs, and destroyed or looted their houses. Jarnail Singh spares no one. President Zail Singh is specially mentioned for his inability to use his powers, and reluctance to leave the security of Rashtrapati Bhavan. The Delhi administration, primarily its police, is accused of conniving with the mobs. Rajiv Gandhi is condemned for indirectly condoning the crime by saying But, when a mighty tree falls, it is only natural that the earth around it [will] shake a little. In his indictment, Jarnail Singh includes men like H.K.L Bhagat and Jagdish Tytler, who were known to have incited violence in the cabinet.        
	Jarnail Singhs family was a victim of the pogrom. The family members were refugees from Pakistan who had found shelter in Lajpat Nagar. The boys, including Jarnail, played cricket with Hindu boys. All of a sudden, on October 31, hell broke loose and their neighbours turned against them. The boys hid themselves in a loft while many friends and relations were butchered or burnt alive. It is a chilling tale told by a man who saw it happen before his eyes. It is authentic, as it comes from a stricken heart.                
	Plastic nose                
	Santa went to a plastic surgeon to have his nose re-shaped. He asked the doctor what the operation would cost.        
	Around five lakh rupees, replied the doctor.        
	How much will it cost if I bring my own plastic?

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | who goes there?
                                                                                                                 WHO GOES THERE?                                                    
	When a citizens character and identity are both in the hands of the State, then it is time to worry. A significant number of migrant labourers from West Bengal, who had gone to Kerala as masons, have alleged harassment by the Kerala police. They had been asked to leave the state within 24 hours if they were unable to provide character certificates from their local police stations (most of them are from rural Murshidabad). At the Bengal end, they have not been issued such certificates, and have thus been forced to give up their jobs in Kerala and return home. The Kerala police have denied these allegations and maintain that voter identity cards remain sufficient as proof of identity and address. But police stations in Murshidabad report several hundred people asking for certificates stating there are no cases pending against them.        
	Needless to say, most of these migrant workers are from a minority community, and they allege that the Kerala police invoke the Mumbai terror attacks and infiltration from Bangladesh to justify their demand for character certificates. It is when the imperatives of national security begin to create a grey area between law and harassment (shading into human rights abuse) that the afterlife of terror begins to poison the State and civil society. One of the workers even alleged being thrashed by the police after pleading for some extra time in Kerala when he failed to get a certificate from his local thana. Maharashtra and, more violently, Assam have shown how people who come in from other states can be made to face brutal hostilities in the name of a kind of economic chauvinism. It is ironic that both within India and internationally the eruption of such resentments and prejudices is invariably associated with not only the more apparently liberating aspects of globalization, but also with threat perceptions tied up with terror. At a more practical level, uncoordinated policing among the different Indian states is often the cause of such abuse. If Kerala and West Bengal police communicated directly with each other about these certificates then these workers would not have been deprived of their human rights in this manner. But in these insecure times, a certain kind of coordinated policing might strike more terror in the hearts of ordinary people than making them feel protected in their own country.

	Statistics can play strange tricks. In the United States of America, 247,000 workers were thrown out of their jobs in July. But the unemployment rate fell from 9.5 to 9.4 per cent. The inference would be that the Bureau of Labor Statistics had lost its marbles, or at least its arithmetics. But that would be a hasty conclusion. For the department says that the civilian labour force shrank by 422,000. They did not leave the country or the world, for the number of adults who were not in the labour force  who ostensibly were not seeking work  went up by 637,000. So unemployment crept down because some half a million people stopped looking for work. Thus if enough people get tired of looking for work, unemployment may vanish. The US may see more such drops in unemployment in the coming months.        
	Even employment news is not entirely dark. It actually went up in three sectors. Education and health services employed another 17,000, leisure and hospitality another 9,000, and government another 7,000. But these figures were dwarfed by the 270,000 jobs lost elsewhere. The labour force figures tell a different story from those of hours worked, which were only 0.1 per cent less than in 2002; the average hours worked per week actually ticked up from 33 to 33.1. Total work done has hardly declined; those in jobs are working harder, and those out of jobs are finding it harder to get work. Overtime normally costs more than the cost of a new worker; but it avoids all the bother of taking on a new worker, going through the paperwork, training him and so on.        
	But such is human nature that commentators have begun to read these figures in a sunny mode. For five quarters running, payroll employment had declined by increasing numbers. In the last quarter, it declined, but by less than in the previous quarter. Similarly, gross domestic product had declined by increasing rates in the previous three quarters; it declined by much less in the last quarter. That can be read as a slowdown in the rate at which the economy is slowing down. That is the interpretation Christina Romer, chairperson of Barack Obamas Council of Economic Advisers, chose in her speech on August 6. She was an influential advocate of the stimulus package of $787 billion that Congress was persuaded to adopt; the unemployment figures are proof to her that it has worked  that the stimulus has been proved to be a well tested antibiotic, and not some newfangled gene therapy. If she is wrong, she is in good company, for she cited 20 countries that had used stimulus packages, varying between 0.1 per cent of GDP in Italy and 3.7 per cent in Korea. Indias was a measly 0.6 per cent. That will show the finance minister how parsimonious he has been  and how much more reckless he can be.

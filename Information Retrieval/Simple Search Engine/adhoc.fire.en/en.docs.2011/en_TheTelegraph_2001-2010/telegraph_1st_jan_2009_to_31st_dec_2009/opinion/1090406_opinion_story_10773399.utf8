	Ugly picture                  
	Sir The people of West Bengal are shocked at the Tughlaq-style firman from the Election Commission. Government offices are now to have photographs of Mahatma Gandhi, the incumbent president, and the governor of the state only, till the Lok Sabha elections are over. One fails to understand how photographs on the walls of government offices can sway the voters mind. Besides, be it Subhas Chandra Bose, Rabindranath Tagore, Kazi Nazrul Islam or Jawaharlal Nehru, these are people who either fought for the country or were sources of inspiration. They are not spiritual leaders. Why should the EC object to their photographs? What is more ridiculous is that the commission has given no explanation of this. Does it not owe the people one?           
	Yours faithfully,       
Prama Karmakar, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  It is not clear why Rabindranath Tagore and Subhas Chandra Bose are being targeted by the EC. It is also not clear if the directive about the removal of all pictures save a few holds for other states as well. The EC seems to be ignorant of the genius of Tagore. As for Bose, he is one of the greatest revolutionaries India has seen. By directing the West Bengal government to remove their pictures, the commission has insulted Bengalis in particular and Indians in general. Perhaps the EC should issue another directive asking government offices to adorn their walls only with pictures of the three commissioners.           
	As for Mahatma Gandhi, his picture can hardly do justice to his memory. We now remember him only through his picture on currency notes. It is disgraceful that the great man who had neither savings nor any desire for material gain should find space on currency notes.           
	Only days back, the EC courted controversy by asking the Bharatiya Janata Party not to nominate Varun Gandhi as the partys Lok Sabha candidate. The commission overstepped its limits by suggesting this. Instead of creating controversies, the EC should concentrate on the conduct of free and fair polls.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Tapan Dasgupta, Burdwan 

                
	Sir The ECs directive regarding the removal of photographs from the secretariat is absurd. How many voters could be influenced by such pictures? Only those who visit the secretariat can see them. And what about the pictures of political leaders shown by the print and electronic media?           
	Yours faithfully,

	This is not India          
	Sir Malvika Singhs The idea that isnt India (March 31) brought to the fore some harsh truths. Fanaticism, particularly religious fanaticism, has been the bane of Indian politics. This is the subject of discussion everywhere in the world, especially since the worlds second largest democracy brags about secularism so much. Despite being constitutionally a secular nation, India has deviated from secularism thanks to its leaders, who trample upon it with careless abandon to derive electoral dividends.           
	The happenings in Pilibhit have once again damaged Indias secular image. Varun Gandhis outburst cannot be forgiven, much less its defence by his mother, Maneka Gandhi, who happens to be a former Union minister and a member of the outgoing parliament. Rather than defusing the crisis, Maneka Gandhi has compounded it. More unfortunately, the self-styled prime minister-in-waiting, L.K. Advani, suffers no qualms about disowning what has been recorded. In fact, Advani even seems to lend tacit support to Varun Gandhi. Given the hooliganism of Varun Gandhis supporters, the Uttar Pradesh administration could not but have imposed the National Security Act. However, this has given Varun Gandhi more media footage. The ugly controversy is bound to affect the poll outcome in Pilibhit, dividing voters along communal lines.           
	Singhs observations on the matter are forthright and indisputable. From the top leadership of political parties to the supporters, she has spared none. The electoral contest this time has brought about a bizarre combination of parties and politicians who have put by their ideological differences in the hope of power. They are rank opportunists out to enjoy the largesse that the masnad in Delhi will bring with it.           
	The two major parties in the fray  the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party  are the two main culprits, although the regional parties are no better. Among the would-be ministers are possibly murderers, extortionists and rapists. All of us know that this has not happened overnight. We have done precious little to cleanse our system. Singh is right in observing that this is not the idea of India.           
	There is yet no law to prevent tainted politicians from holding power neither is there any intention to bring tainted ministers to book. What then is the way out? If we want change, we must use our discretion in choosing our representatives.           
	Yours faithfully,

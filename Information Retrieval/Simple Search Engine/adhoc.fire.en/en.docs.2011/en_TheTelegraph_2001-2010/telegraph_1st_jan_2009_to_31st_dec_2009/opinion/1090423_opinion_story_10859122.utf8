	Threat next door                  
	Sir  The report, Taliban enforce Sharia in new Pak tribal region (April 12), shows that Pakistan is now dancing to the tune of Taliban militants. The president of Pakistan, Asif Ali Zardari, was forced to sign the regulation introducing Islamic law in Swat Valley in north-western Pakistan in order to end Talibani violence.          
	Can the president give a full guarantee that the introduction of sharia will bring peace to the valley, which was once upon a time a paradise for tourists from all over the world? Does Zardari not have a responsibility towards the betterment of Pakistan and of its people? He should hang his head in shame after surrendering Swat politically to the Taliban. Does he not know that by harbouring and nurturing Taliban militants in his country for such a long time he is playing with fire? That day is not too far off when Taliban militants and their deadly activities will engulf the whole of Pakistan.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Paromita Jana, Calcutta

                
	Sir  If necessity is the mother of all invention, then politics is perhaps the father. If this idea is acceptable, it is possible to go further and ask whether perhaps Uncle Sam is the grandfather of the prevailing anarchy in South Asia.           
	The mujahedin, believed to be the beginning of all terrorist organizations in South Asia, were organized in Pakistan with aid from Washington, and then used as though to kill two birds with one stone. First, they were used in the fight against the Soviet army in Afghanistan, and second, they would execute subversive attacks within chosen territories.           
	Now that the Soviet army is no longer a factor, extremist organizations, such as the Taliban, have no suitable job, so they have started capturing Pakistani cities one after another to create a safe haven. To make sure of this safe haven, they are imposing sharia. Imposing Sharia law is essential from another point of view  they want to prevent any challenge from within.          
	But it seems that Washington has learnt very little, for the United States of America is again extending one billion dollars in aid to Pakistan with the hope of injecting fresh oxygen into its ramshackle economy. Past experiences suggest that this aid may be utilized for subversive activities in the region. If Washington really wants to uproot terrorism from its sanctuary in Pakistan, it should take concrete steps towards that rather than giving aid to this country. The civilian government of Pakistan is the Talibans main patron.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Asis Narayan Biswas, Durgapur

                
	Sir  Can we say that Talibanism is akin to communism in bringing about a revolution to undo economic inequality among people (Taliban exploit class rifts in Pakistan, April 17)?          
	Yours faithfully,      
Pijush Banerjee, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The print media have been highlighting the recent plight of Sikhs in the Taliban-controlled province of Swat. Many non-Muslims in Islamic states are facing similar situations, although in a somewhat less severe form. In some countries, during the month of Ramazan, they are forbidden to eat or drink in public from dawn to dusk.           
	Yours faithfully,        Vineet Phadtare, Mumbai
      
	Sir  The United Nations Human Rights Council should immediately rush a fact-finding team to Swat for an on-the-spot study of the Taliban regime in that part of Pakistan, where merciless flogging was carried out on a teenage girl (Girl denial, April, 7). It is time that the US stops all financial aid to Pakistan till the latter rids itself of any alliance with the Taliban regime in Swat. Isolating Pakistan to ensure the democratic rule of justice alone can compel the rulers to undertake measures for effectively checking militancy and terror not only in their own country but also in other parts of the world.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Madhu Agrawal, Delhi

      
	Sir  Pakistan, we are told, is crumbling and requires help. The Taliban have slowly but surely spread their wings. Yet, Pakistan does not seem ready to stop the infiltration of jihadi forces into India. Can it honour in the future any agreement it makes now? Whether we like it or not, history shows that such extremist forces as the Taliban have taken over states. They do not believe in honouring any treaty with a state that they feel is not in line with Islam. In fact, they will not honour an agreement even with a Muslim state if they believe it to be anti-Islamic, that is, not in line with the Islam that they believe is its true form. As the violent acts in mosques in Pakistan show, they will kill anyone that they feel does not profess their version of the religion.  
	Yours faithfully,      
Udita Agrawal, New Delhi

      
	Sir  There are reports in the leading newspapers about Taliban cadre sneaking into Jammu and Kashmir as part of a drive to expand their areas of operations. But are the numerous extremist outfits spread all over the world to carry out acts of insurgency any different from these dreaded militants? They are one and the same; the only dissimilarity among them being their group names, which they have adopted to suit local requirements.   
	Yours faithfully,        Arun Malankar, Mumbai
                
	Sir  I endorse the statement of the Indian prime minister that the spreading influence of the Taliban is a serious threat to India. The Taliban are a danger to mankind and they have no trust in democracy. Women are the most insecure group under the Taliban. These terrorists destroyed the Buddha statues in Bamiyan. The space provided by the Pakistan government to the Taliban in the Swat Valley is the greatest, most serious threat.           
	The suspicion that there has been recent infiltration in Kupwara is very worrying, raising the possibility that rebels within India may collude with the infiltrators to disturb the poll process. New strategies have to be developed to check insurgent action in general and Taliban infiltration in particular.           
	Yours faithfully,        K.A. Solaman, Alappuzha, Kerala

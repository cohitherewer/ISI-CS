Their health does not permit them to come to India. They don rsquo;t want to give anyone a power of attorney either. Will a gift deed notarised in Canada be valid to register the property in Calcutta? Alternatively, can the Indian consulate be approached regarding the same? What are the options available to us?
  Niranjan Biswal, Calcutta  A: A gift deed notarised in Canada will not be valid here because the property to be gifted is situated in India. The best option for your relatives would be to get a power of attorney made in favour of someone to whom they can entrust the formalities for registration of the gift deed in accordance with the Indian Registration Act. In case of persons residing in foreign lands, the power of attorney should be duly notarised or registered through the consulate of that country.  Q:I married in April 2008. My problem is that every time I do something for my mother, who is a widow, my wife threatens to institute a suit under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code against me. Once she slit her wrist and last September she went to hospital complaining of chest pain. She got a medical certificate from the hospital and submitted it at the local police station. My wife and her family often abuse my mother and are always threatening us with Section 498A. What can I do to get out of this hellish situation?
  Raj Kumar Das, Calcutta  A: Being in the unfortunate situation that you are, you can do little to prevent a case under Section 498A being instituted against you. If you have finally decided to get out of the hellish situation you could file a suit for judicial separation or divorce against your wife establishing appropriate grounds. You could also file a general diary at your local police station stating the above facts. But the better option would be to proceed for divorce through mutual consent provided that is possible.   Q: I am one of three joint owners of a flat. The individual shares were not specified in the registered agreement. What is the best process if one joint owner wants to sell his share?
  Amit Malhotra, via email  A: In your case each owner would have 1/3 share of the undivided property. However, if a joint owner intends to sell his undivided share, the best process would be to first give the offer to the other two joint owners as per the law of pre-emption.  Please send your legal queries with your name and address to

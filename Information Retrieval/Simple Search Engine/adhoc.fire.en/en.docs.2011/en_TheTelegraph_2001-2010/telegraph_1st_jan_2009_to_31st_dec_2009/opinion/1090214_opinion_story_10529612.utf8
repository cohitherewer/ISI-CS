	Last month, on a flight to Lahore, I read that days issue of the Pakistani newspaper, Dawn, which proclaims on its masthead that it was Founded by Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah. The lead story on the left-hand side of the front page was about Israeli incursions into Gaza. The lead on the right-hand side referred to a new government initiative within Pakistan. This was the Benazir Income Support Programme, whose focus is on providing credit to women in rural areas. The programme had attracted the ire of the Taliban, who claimed that for women to receive money in public was not in keeping with the tenets of their faith.         
	Dawns own story dealt with the response to the Talibans criticism offered by Farzana Raja, the chairperson of the BISP. We are committed to launching the programme because it is purely Islamic and aimed at helping the poor, said Raja. She clarified that the beneficiaries would not have to enter a government office themselves. The newspaper quoted her as saying that the women will not have to go out of their homes to get their cards because lady workers will visit them and complete the process. She added that the card would require only the beneficiarys thumb impression, and not her photograph (images being prohibited in fundamentalist Islam). In sum, as Dawn reported, Raja rejected [the] Talibans claim that tribal women would become morally corrupt and said that the programme was similar to the Zakat system. How can one call our programme un-Islamic, she said.              
	Reading this report, it was hard not to think comparatively of rural development initiatives promoted by the State on this side of the border. In India, too, these programmes tend to be named after controversial politicians. But they do not  at least not yet  need to be justified in the name of the faith of the majority. So far at least, no minister or official has had to make the case that the Jawahar Rozgar Yojana or the Indira Gandhi Paryavaran Puraskar is wholly in keeping with the tenets of Hinduism.        
	This difference between India and Pakistan goes back to the circumstances of their founding. That country was created as a homeland for Muslims. Thus the faith of the majority had, in lesser or greater degree, to be reflected in the policies and practices of the State. Some scholars believe that if Jinnah himself had lived longer, Pakistani Islam would have been more liberal, that is to say, more accommodating both of dissenting traditions within Islam (such as those represented by Sufis and Ahmediyas), and of the interests of citizens who were not Muslims. As it happened, over the years, a more exclusive model of Islam came to prevail over Pakistan. Under successive military rulers, the State began to openly ally with the clergy, and to change or modify State laws and policies in line with more literal interpretations of the Quran. Hence, the promoters of the BISP have now to go to such lengths to defend their activities as being consistent with the principles of the faith.         
	Admittedly, in India too, there are some who would like their state to be run on what they define as the principles of the majority religion. Fortunately, this view was resisted by our own founders, who insisted that all citizens would have equal rights regardless of religious affiliation. These ideas were encoded in the Constitution, and in successive plan and policy documents. Over the years, as the forces of Hindutva have gathered more support, there have been pressures to define our culture and our history in exclusively Hindu terms. However, there has been much less pressure to define our economic and social policies in these categories. Programmes of rural development (for instance, the National Rural Employment Guarantee Programme) are often very widely debated  but in terms of economic efficiency and social equity, not whether they are Hindu enough.         
	Pakistan was founded as a Muslim homeland  now, it is explicitly an Islamic State. Was the transition inevitable? Some Pakistanis blame Zia-ul-Haq for perverting the legacy of Jinnah by making common cause with the mullahs. Zia was, admittedly, as close to being evil as any modern politician, but taking the longer view, the case can be made that the original sin was Jinnahs, who, by defining a country in terms of religion, made it very likely, or perhaps even inevitable, that in course of time the State would be captured and directed by the faith.         
	In my own conversations with Pakistani liberals  the kind who admire Jinnah and detest Zia  I was struck by their nostalgia for the high noon of Muslim political power in the sub-continent. One dinner conversation was largely devoted to the merits  literary as well as political  of the great Mughals. Which was the more moving and readable work, they asked, the Baburnama or the Jahangirnama? And even though Akbar left no memoirs, was he not the most enchanting of them all? I cannot speak for an RSS shakha, but in a comparable, upper-class drawing-room in Delhi or Bangalore, the conversation would scarcely focus on the respective merits of Shivaji and Chandragupta Maurya.        
	One of the ladies at that dinner had married into an aristocratic family hailing from Hyderabad. As I left, she expressed regret that her children (aged about ten and eight respectively) had not yet succeeded in obtaining a visa to visit that city. Mujhe itna gussa aata hai (It makes me so angry), she said in Urdu, before switching to English and adding, After all, it is their history and heritage. The next day, the current capital of the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh came up again, in a conversation with a television cameraman. Now based in Karachi, his family had migrated from the Deccan  as he put it, in another display of effortless bilingualism, After the Fall of Hyderabad, unko yahan aana pada (they had to come here).         
	Hearing this, I recalled what the Pakistani cricketer, Abdul Hafeez Kardar, had written after he had visited Hyderabad in the winter of 1952-3. Kardar first went to the battlefield where Aurangzeb Alamgir, the last of the great Moghuls had won a famous victory. He then went to visit the Salar Jung Museum to see, among other things, the wine-cup of the Emperor Jahangir and a sword of Tipu Sultan (picture). Of the museum and its treasures he wrote, This is civilisation! This is culture! It is certainly a wonder of the world!              
	Kardar was of the opinion that it was Muslim rule that had brought civilization to backward India. Five and six decades later, these sentiments were being echoed by the aristocratic lady who believed that her own sweet, innocent, as yet intellectually unformed children, themselves living between Lahore and London, had a claim to the (Islamic) history and heritage of Hyderabad. Her view was grand, perhaps grandiose; the perspective of the cameraman, in which the Fall of Hyderabad approximated the Fall of Muslim Spain, tragic and even pathetic.         
	Themselves decent, good people, these nostalgists for Hyderabad were yet shaped by a warped view of the past and present of the Indian sub-continent. Akbar lived five centuries ago; but the Nizams Hyderabad was, in living memory, known to be a state of extreme backwardness and inequality, in which a few nobles lorded it over millions of illiterate, voiceless, and desperately poor peasants. Only a sentimental commitment to Islam could permit its defence or posthumous rehabilitation.         
	The Islam of the Pakistani intelligentsia is altogether more likeable than the Islam of the Taliban. Withal, it is still implicated in matters of State, for these liberals remain trapped and confined by the circumstances of their nations founding. Having once set up a State to protect Muslims from Hindu domination, they find it more and more difficult to protect themselves from domination by the mullahs and the fanatics.

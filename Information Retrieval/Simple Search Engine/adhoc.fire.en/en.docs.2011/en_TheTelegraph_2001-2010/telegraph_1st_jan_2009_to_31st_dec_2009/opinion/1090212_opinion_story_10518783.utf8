                                                                                                                 CHILDRENS WARD                                                    
	This is no country for infants. The childrens surgery ward and recovery room of Calcuttas Nilratan Sarkar Medical College Hospital have been long infested with cockroaches, big and small. They crawl all over the babies being treated in the hospital, getting into their bodies through every orifice and nibbling at their insides until the little ones start screaming and bleeding (those who are anaesthetized cannot scream). Sometimes, the cockroaches enter their windpipes and almost choke them, or even their saline bottles. Then, a few days back, a five-day-old baby in the NRS recovery room had one of its eyes almost gnawed out by a cockroach, which would have eaten up the cornea had a member of staff not noticed the cockroach in time. It is of some relevance that the baby had been born with only one eye, and the cockroach was going to get the other one. The medical staff have been patting one anothers backs for managing to prevent the baby from going incurably blind (after all, the cornea has been saved). Everybody apparently knew about the cockroaches and what they were doing to the babies, but had remained stoically silent until this accident tested the limits of their endurance. Everybody is blaming the pest-control company that has been employed to make the ward cockroach-free at minimum cost. It sends its staff, every now and then, and they come and spray water instead of chemicals. The company has promised to try harder, and the doctors and the superintendent are relieved to have been able to express their horror and disapproval, and they hope no more babies in their care are nibbled at by cockroaches. They have heard of ants and rats doing the same sort of thing in other hospitals. And in Punjab, the other day, five babies have been charred to death in their incubators, and several others badly burnt, because of lax maintenance. The charred babies have earned their families a lakh each from the state government.        
	There is crime, and there is savagery. Who are the criminals here? Or do such incidents take human action, accountability and punishment beyond the language of law and ethics towards the unspeakable? Perhaps there is a more banal way of looking at all this. The government has better things to worry about than pest control  elections, investors, culture. And do the Indian poor not make too many babies anyway?

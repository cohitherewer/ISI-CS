The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Sweet sound of bard song
                                                                                                                 SWEET SOUND OF BARD SONG                              Music      SREYASHI DASTIDAR                                                
	It is often said that one of the best indices of Shakespeares timeless popularity is the translation and adaptation of his plays around the world. In Bengal, this began from the early 19th century: in 1809, Claude Monckton, a student of Fort William College, turned The Tempest into Bengali, the first of the many engagements with the universal bard on Bengali stage. This association was traced in a script narrated rivetingly by Soumitra Chatterjee and Ananda Lal at the G.D. Birla Sabhagar on July 18. The fulcrum, however, was the songs from Shakespeare-inspired Bengali plays; hence the title, Mahakabir Manchagaan. The brain behind the Academy Theatre presentation was Devajit Bandopadhyay, whose research on and performance of Bengali theatre songs are quite well known. Riddhi Bandopadhyay made up the other half of the singing pair.        
	Although all the major Indian languages took to Shakespeare with gusto, it can be safely said that in sheer ingenuity Bengali was ahead of the rest. Hamlet became Hariraj (in Amarendranath Duttas adaptation), Falstaff became Jaladhar (Dinabandhu Mitras Nabin Tapaswini, 1853) and The Merchant of Venice became Bhanumati Chittavilas (Harachandra Ghosh, 1853). But the songs that were part of these early Bengali stage productions bear proof of imagination and creativity of an exceptional order. Piriti nagare basati koribo  arguably the best performance of the evening by Riddhi and Devajit  from Saudagar, Bhupendranath Bandopadhyays adaptation of The Merchant of Venice, would be just one example of how elements of contemporary culture (even sub-cultures) were seamlessly wedded to a foreign plotline.         
	Devajit Bandopadhyays spirited rendition of Tagores translation of Macbeths cauldron song showed up the sheer genius of the poet who claimed to have received more intoxication than nutrition from English literature. It was also an instance of being faithful to the original while transferring it to a different cultural register, something that Debendranath Basu did too, with Desdemonas recounting of her mothers maid, Barbara. This song, Torutale ekakini boshi bama Bimalini, was beautifully sung by Riddhi who was equally impressive in Premer katha ar bolo na (from the Othello-inspired 1880 production, Asrumati, by Jyotirindranath Tagore) and in Kusumita kanan (from Satischandra Chatterjees adaptation of A Midsummer Nights Dream). However, the singer should have worked on her diction a little more before venturing to sing Under the greenwood tree. Some of the songs were more tangentially connected to the theme than the rest. The two songs from Dwijendralal Rays Sirajdaulla and Shahjahan were included by virtue of the plays having vague influences of Henry V and King Lear. But if the reference were to be omitted, one would also have to miss Soumitra Chatterjees virtuoso gem from Shahjahan. Ananda Lals performance of Othellos Willow song carried an element of surprise.

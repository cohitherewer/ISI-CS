	Mon Art Gallerys exhibition, You show promise (October 9-25), leaves one in doubt about the future of art in Bengal. The works of 15 young artists were on display but none showed any of the technical finesse for which artists of this region are famous. Even the watercolours let the gallerist down. It left us feeling that either there is something seriously wrong with the local art scene, or this gallery has taken upon itself the unenviable task of promoting aesthetically-challenged practitioners. The artists went abstract, tried out photographic realism, Bengal School, so-called post-modern  actually images lifted from sundry sources  and also nostalgia but the effect was equally disastrous. Think of Suchismita Sahoos eagles nest made of plastic bags and CDs, or Palash Halders sad-eyed boy looming over what looks like an urban scene.        
	Ashoke Gangulys mask offering a flower to an underwater queen grabs styles and details from contemporary Bengal Masters. The artist has nothing of his own to add. So it is not even an honest attempt at showing off ones skill as a draughtsman. Arup Ratan Chowdhurys acrylic on canvas depicting a pistol with a butterfly fluttering on its nozzle (picture), supposedly signifying peace, also stems from a similar paucity of ideas. Artists should try to break out of psychological ghettoes. Khushnaz Najam loves them. What other conclusion can one draw from these attempts at Islamic art?

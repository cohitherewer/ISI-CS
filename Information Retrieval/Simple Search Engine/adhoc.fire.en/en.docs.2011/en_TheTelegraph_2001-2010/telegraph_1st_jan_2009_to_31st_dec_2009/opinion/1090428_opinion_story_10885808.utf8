                                                                                                                 WORDCAGE                                                      Old hurts                            
	Im in a rage. So what, you may ask, and what has it to do with the English language? The answer is a single word, and a principle that I often emphasize: that language is inseparable from its context.        
	The word is anti-semitic, and  on a basis of sheer fabrication  it is being aimed at me. Ive faced this before, in 1996, from an extreme but influential Jewish-American body called CAMERA. It targets any journalist daring to suggest that some Israeli action is less than perfect. It had taken umbrage at The Economists even-handed reports on the Palestine problem, and our readiness for such horrid anti-semitic ideas as a two-state solution  an idea later accepted by one Ariel Sharon, prime minister of Israel.        
	The Middle East was not my field. But it was my job to defend us. In poured the hate-mail from CAMERA supporters. I was a Jew-hating British b*****d, etc etc. It was meant to hurt, and though  or just because  was utterly unfounded, hurt it did. So Im sensitive.         
	But not alone. Does anti-semitic carry a huge emotional charge in India? I fancy not: India knows shaming prejudices, but not that one. But in Europe, for very solid reason, it is almost the ugliest accusation one can bring. Call the average Briton anti-Muslim, or a Dutchman anti-Moroccan, and these days he may murmur, Well, arent you? Call him anti-semitic and you might as well have said Adolf Eichmann and hinted he approves of gas chambers.        
	Yet thats not unreasonable. Any European must live with a hideous truth, seared into our consciousness: that not 70 years ago our continents most valuable minority, established here for centuries, was butchered by a civilized nation misled into seeing them as a sub-human species that was no part of us.         
	Thats been our experience. Indians may have read about it. You havent lived it. The European context of anti-semitic is simply different.        
	So imagine my horror at finding the word aimed at me, by a blogger masked as Cyrus. His true name Cyrus wont reveal; pseudonymity has its charm for character assassins. Hes a Christian, but  and  obsessed with Israel; and in his obsession almost a CAMERA-clone, and one not much worried by the Jewish/Christian commandment, Thou shalt not bear false witness.         
	His pet hates are a charity called Christian Aid, the BBC and any medium or person that differs with his views on the Middle East. I hadnt even touched that topic. But in 2006, Id read a piece in The Times by a vigorous  and Jewish  publicist attacking Britains tolerance of Islamist loonies. So be it. But she also said the doctrines of multiculturalism and minority rights sprang from a systematic onslaught by the British elite against the countrys own identity and values. I wrote to the paper challenging this.        
	Minority rights is, in fact, a misnomer in Britain: for practical purposes, all Britons have the same rights. Read legal protection against discrimination. Did the writer disapprove of our past ending of old discriminations against Jews and Catholics, I asked?         
	Only last autumn did I learn of Cyruss reaction. His blog had accused me of telling the Jewish writer that she was not quite One of Us. This was pure fiction (her reply in The Times hadnt even hinted at it), utterly unjustified by anything Id said. Cyrus had simply fabricated a crude anti-semitism, an idea that I find both offensive, to all Britons, and absurd; and fathered it on me.         
	I posted a comment on his blog, seeking an apology. No way. Cyrus sat on his hands for ten weeks, and then spat out a vast rant of fresh fabrications. I hit back, demonstrating their falsity. In vain: three weeks later, he was again still sitting on his hands.         
	Why worry about one silly smear-monger? Because any blog is like a plague germ: it can multiply millionsfold overnight. And I stand falsely accused of a sort of thinking not unknown in Britain a century ago, but which I have never even imagined  and which, carried to extremes by Hitlers Germany, killed six million Jews.         
	Accused in Europe, not India. Are you surprised Im angry?                    STEPHEN HUGH-JONES

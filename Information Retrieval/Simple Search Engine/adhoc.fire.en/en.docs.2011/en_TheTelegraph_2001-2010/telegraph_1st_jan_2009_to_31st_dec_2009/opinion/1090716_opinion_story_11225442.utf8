	Few takers                  
	Sir  Calcutta has managed to be rated as the toughest city to do business in by a World Bank survey of 17 Indian cities. The editorial, Hard to sell (July 2), rightly holds the bureaucracy responsible for the delays and obstacles that make business development a tough job in Calcutta. As expected, the bureaucracy has chosen to be in denial. However, there is a silver lining to this cloud. A late start to development can sometimes bring with it the privilege of using latest technologies that are more efficient and cost effective. For example, France first got the fastest train in the world. China got it later, but by then this train had become faster and more efficient than the original French model. Similarly, Calcutta is now about to construct high-rise buildings in its central business area, much later than other Indian cities. In designing these buildings, it can use contemporary technology without having to go through the intermediate stages of development that other cities have had to pass through. In a shorter time, the city can make itself business-friendly and give itself a makeover that it desperately needs.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Calcuttas bad patch started from the mid-1960s, when a group of people united under an agenda to stop production in industries, calling it a revolution. The absence of a work culture started to cripple the city from that time. The people at the helm of the citys administration almost enjoyed this situation. Many of the productive and profitable units of the industrial sector were shut down one after the other, and institutions like health, education and municipal services were made almost dysfunctional. The administration gave undue importance to promoters and auto-rickshaw unions in order to please the party cadre. Today, hundreds of multi-storeyed buildings have sprung up in Calcutta without any proper plan and sewer system, drinking-water facilities and supply of electricity. So, the slightest irregularity causes chaos in the city. In Calcutta, political parties force people to suit their whims without caring much for the peoples consent. When such acts are criticized, the parties see it as a conspiracy. Calcuttans often migrate to other cities, having realized that possibilities for progress are very few here. It is hard to find another city with such a self-destructive attitude.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Strange reservations          
	Sir  I have secured nearly 86 per cent marks in my higher secondary examinations, but I was denied admission by Jadavpur University as I narrowly missed the cut-off marks required for the subjects I wanted to study. But then I came to know that a few seats reserved for scheduled casts and scheduled tribes were still vacant. I approached these departments with a request to admit me , but they turned down my request saying that the seats in the SC and ST quota were to remain vacant even if none claimed them.           
	I am not against the system of improving backwardness through special facilities. But if there is a vacant seat belonging to a reserved quota and no one turns up to fill it, why would it not be offered to a general candidate who deserves it?                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Virtual threat          
	Sir  A number of social network sites have been launched and they are meant to help people make friends. But a number of people have opened accounts on Orkut or Facebook for dubious purposes. The recent incident in which a young girl from Shillong was allegedly abducted by a man whom she met online points out this fact (Chat friend abducts Shillong college girl, July 6). I strongly believe that teenagers should be discouraged from mingling freely with strangers. Their access to such websites should be restricted and the government should raise the age-limit for persons using these sites. Otherwise, it will be difficult to stop cyber crime and the exploitation of unsuspecting teens.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Unequal treatment          
	Sir  Help, my wife beats me (July 12) presented yet another ugly truth about urban India. Most people are worried about the well-being of women, ignoring the fact that women can also perpetrate violence. There are a number of laws to protect women against domestic abuse, but such legal provisions are absent when it comes to ensuring the protection of married men. Men and women should join hands to demand laws to stop the abuse of men.           
	Yours faithfully,

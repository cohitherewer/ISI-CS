	Event management                  
	Sir  The chief minister of West Bengal raised an unnecessary hue and cry over the naming of the new Metro stations in memory of late freedom fighters (Bad losers, Aug 26). The programme organized by Mamata Banerjee to mark the extension of the Metro Railway was certainly not a tamasha (it was dismissed as one by Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee). Any project that leads to the development of the state, especially when it had been long overdue, should be appreciated at all levels. The Union railways minister made a mistake by inviting the chief minister in an inappropriate manner to the occasion. However, Bhattacharjees reaction was unwarranted as well. It is high time the chief minister concentrated on issues like flood management and the maintenance of law and order instead of reacting to the Opposition in this impetuous manner. After all, the assembly polls are not very far away.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Indranil Sanyal, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Contrary to what the editorial, Bad losers, suggests, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has not done anything wrong by railing against the Union railways minister for using the names of Bengali icons at a programme to inaugurate the extension of the Metro Railway from Tollygunge to Garia. The Trinamul Congress chiefs gimmicks on stage had crossed all limits of decency. The recent successes of the party in the Lok Sabha elections and the by-polls seem to have got to Mamata Banerjees head.          
	From the day she took on as the railways minister, Banerjee had been crying foul against the Communist Party of India (Marxist), accusing it of ruining West Bengal in the course of its uninterrupted rule for over three decades. Even the Congress, with which the TMC was at loggerheads until recently but has now formed an alliance with, is critical of Banerjees attempts to establish her supremacy. Such a mode of operation, as the Congress has rightly felt, violates the rules of coalition politics.          
	That Banerjee is speaking in an altogether different voice now is evident. The lady who forced the Tatas to bid goodbye to the Nano project in Singur with her disruptive politics is now urging her cohorts to practice restraint and suavity in their dealings with others. Even more curious is her assurance to industrialists that if they comply with her guidelines, land acquisition and industrialization in the state would not pose any problem for them. Ironically, it was at her behest that her partymen unleashed chaos for nearly a month on the Durgapur Expressway  an incident that is still fresh in public memory. So, the less said of her antics at the inauguration ceremony, the better.          
	Yours faithfully,      
P.B. Saha, Calcutta

      
	Sir  The manner in which the Metro Railway extension was flagged off was rather surprising. It seemed as if the state government was largely unaware of the trial run and even the chief minister had been invited in a rather slipshod manner. This when the state has borne a substantial part of the expenses involved in the project. Will such a lapse of etiquette ever take place in similar programmes in other states? At the July 21 rally in Esplanade, Mamata Banerjee had announced that she does not endorse Us and Them politics but believes in inclusiveness. Is there not a wide gulf then between what she preaches and what she practices?          
	Yours faithfully,       
A.K. Das, Calcutta

                
	Sir  It is unfortunate that the chief minister and the state transport minister were not properly invited to the inauguration ceremony of the Metro Railway extension. It would have been prudent had these ministers been personally invited by one of the senior ministers of the TMC. Such a gesture would have boosted Mamata Banerjees image even further.          
	Yours faithfully,       
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

                
	Sir  As it is, after a series of reversals in the Lok Sabha and the rural polls, Left Front leaders are yet to come to terms with the erosion of their support base. Now, the TMC supremo, Mamata Banerjee, has left the CPI(M) even more ruffled. Both the chief minister and the transport minister distanced themselves from the function to commemorate the extended run of the Metro Railway since they had apparently been invited in a manner not befitting public leaders of their stature. The Left ministers are perhaps also alarmed at the speed with which the railways minister is implementing new schemes in West Bengal. Mamata Banerjee has taken Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees do-it-now injunction to another level by turning the promises she made in the railway budget into reality without any delay. However, instead of lending support to the new projects, the chief minister lost his cool and chose to make scathing remarks about Banerjee. Such a reaction is unbecoming of a politician of Bhattacharjees eminence.          
	Yours faithfully,         Subhankar Mukherjee, Borehat, Burdwan

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Quick, its the rich!
                                                                                                                 QUICK, ITS THE RICH!                                A public interest litigation in the supreme court wants cases involving influential people to be fast-tracked so that they can be brought to book sooner. V. Kumara Swamy examines both sides of the argument                        times up: It took almost a decade to convict Sanjeev Nanda, scion of a well known business family in Delhi, who had been charged with mowing down six people with his BMW				                                 
	Justice delayed, it is often said, is justice denied. But while the long wait for justice is immensely frustrating  and financially taxing  for the common man, there is a general perception that the rich would rather have it that way. Many feel that wealthy and influential people accused of a crime use the system to their advantage, and that trials that go on for years allow them to enjoy their freedom when speedy justice could well have put them behind bars.        
	It is to counter this trend that a public interest litigation (PIL) filed in the Supreme Court suggests the setting up of fast track courts to decide cases involving influential persons. Recently, a Supreme Court bench, comprising Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan and Justice P. Sathasivam, asked the central government to respond to the PIL, although it did note that it would be very difficult to define an influential person.        
	Influential people in India invariably dodge the judicial system. They have mastered the art of delaying their cases. This is paralysing our system of criminal justice, says V.K. Ohri, a Supreme Court advocate and the one who filed the PIL.        
	Citing the names of scores of politicians and other influential people against whom cases have been pending for decades, the PIL says that the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) should define influential persons and lay down a procedure for speedy investigation and trial of their cases.        
	The PIL says that the term influential persons should include district level office bearers of political parties and above, persons equivalent in rank to sub-divisional magistrates and above, magistrates of the 1st class, including civil judges and above, the elected panch and sarpanch of village panchayats and office bearers of NGOs that have a turnover of more than Rs 5 crore. Although it leaves out big industrialists, the list could well be expanded, adds the petitioner.        
	Nor is he the only one to raise such demands. At a seminar organised by the legal and legislative cell of the BJP on August 30, 2008, L.K. Advani, leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, said, We are willing to consider any effective mechanism for the fast track disposal of cases involving major economic offences and corruption cases against politicians and civil servants. This is necessary to strengthen the peoples faith in the political and judicial system, he said.        
	The PIL in the Supreme Court calls for changes to Chapters 18 and 19 of the CrPC (these empower the high courts to set up special courts) so as to lay down rules for the trial of influential persons. The petition says that a court should not be adjourned for more than seven days and evidence should be recorded as far as possible on a day-to-day basis.         
	But many legal experts feel that the very rationale of the PIL is flawed. Jagdeep Chhokar, member of the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), which works towards strengthening democracy and governance in the country, reasons, A corrupt and influential person will try to buy his way out of a case even in a fast track court. Chhokar adds that the system should not be tweaked to work in favour of one section of the people.        
	Others point out that since this one section of the people are in any case singled out for special treatment, fast track courts for them would be a kind of poetic justice. I.K. Chhugani, a resident of Mumbai who filed a similar petition in the Mumbai High Court last year, says wryly, VIPs in our country get priority everywhere  from traffic signals to plot allotment. So let the cases involving them get priority too. No citizen would mind that.        
	Prashant Bhushan, the Supreme Court lawyer who is arguing on behalf of Ohri, also asserts that fast track courts do not favour the rich. It is the poor who gain from faster justice. An influential person, in fact, doesnt want his case to be decided too quickly.        
	Those who support the PIL point out that it would not be too much of a problem to set up these courts as fast track courts on terror, rape and serious crimes are already up and running. Says Pinky Anand, a Supreme Court advocate, When the regular system is unable to cope with certain types of cases, I see no reason why they cannot be fast-tracked.              
	Citing the recent Satyam scam, Anand says that a special court to try economic offences could have ensured a faster trial of those accused. The world is looking at India now. If we had a faster justice mechanism, it would have improved Indias image in the eyes of the rest of the world, she says.        
	Of course, fast track courts have their share of problems too. They are not really the panacea to all the ills plaguing our system, as many people seem to think. Corruption is as rampant in fast track courts as it is in the lower judiciary, says Chhokar.        
	Questions are also raised about the quality of judgements coming out of these courts. Says Nasir Ali Naqvi, chairman, Bar Council of Rajasthan, a state where fast track courts happen to be known for their quick disposal of cases, The quality of judgement in many cases is very poor. As a result they do not stand a chance during an appeal in a higher court. Besides, higher courts function at a normal pace and the cases usually go on for ages anyway, so the purpose of quick justice is, in a way, defeated.         
	But Bhushan reveals that they have taken care to address this issue. We are asking for fast trials at all levels of our legal system when it comes to influential persons.        
	Despite the many arguments in favour of constituting fast track courts for powerful people, it is not very likely that the government will adopt such a measure. If for nothing else, for the simple reason that it smacks too much of special treatment for the rich and famous. I would like every trial to be completed expeditiously, irrespective of whether it belongs to a common man or an influential person, says Congress MP Sachin Pilot.        
	That politically correct statement will, in all likelihood, be the governments response to the PIL as well.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | SCARCE MONEY
                                                                                                                 SCARCE MONEY                                                    
	The Reserve Bank of Indias third quarter review of monetary policy produced no new measures in the form of policy rate cuts; but the policy statement of the RBI governor, D. Subbarao, was a cogent  if worried  analysis of the challenges for monetary policy should the global crisis get any worse than it already is. But rather than look at the review in just the Indian context, it may also be instructive to assess it in the global one. In Japan, Switzerland and the United States of America, policy rates are all below one per cent. In the United Kingdom and Europe (via the European Central Bank) policy rates are at 2 per cent, historically the lowest they have been. Yet, even in these economies, credit flows seem solidly frozen. All the trillions of dollars of liquidity generated by fiscal expansion policies have disappeared like water poured into the sand of the desert, instead of making their way into productive activities through the credit channel. Many now see resolution of the current crisis as a Hayekian versus Keynesian outcome. The economist, F.A. Hayek, was also schooled in the Great Depression, even if he had less influence on Depression-era thinking than John Maynard Keynes. His proposition that there must be a fundamental remaking of the institutions of capitalism is now gaining considerable ground.         
	By not cutting rates any further  as most market analysts and watchers were anticipating  the RBI was saying two things: first, the available liquidity in the system was adequate for current needs, and second, the central bank was preserving the remaining weapons and latitude in its armoury for bigger battles that lie ahead. True, ample liquidity has not translated into lending by the banks, and that is certainly cause for worry. Especially when the policy rates are so low, and small and medium enterprises that account for three quarters of the gross domestic product are borrowing at gigantic spreads  of over 10 per cent over government borrowing  to survive the downturn. The lack of credit flow has persuaded the RBI to increase the target credit growth rate to 24 per cent after lowering it for several quarters. It has also raised the target bank deposit growth rate to 19 per cent, as savers are flying to safety.         
	The RBIs view appears to be matched in the expression of two fears in the economy: that of a worsening slowdown and of corporate fraud in the wake of the Satyam fiasco that constrains the banks from increasing their lending to industry. For now, the RBI has two weapons for stimulating economic activity, reducing the cash credit ratio to encourage lending, or cutting interest rates. The latter has not worked very well, as industry seems still starved of much-needed credit. Reducing the CRR to zero will release another Rs 100,000 crores of liquidity. With no room to cut either CRR or rates any more, it may well be the end of monetary policy in India.

	Three years after the last drama involving Russia, Ukraine and gas supplies to Europe, here we are again. Russias monopoly supplier, Gazprom, cut off gas shipments to Ukraine on New Years Day because of alleged unpaid bills, and by January 7, no gas was moving across Ukraine to the European Union either. Since the EU depends on Russia for a quarter of its natural gas, and 80 per cent of that gas moves west through Ukrainian pipelines, this was no laughing matter.        
	Its the former Soviet satellites that are most dependent on Gazproms gas, because thats the way the pipelines ran in Soviet times. Some of them will run out very fast if their fellow EU members in western Europe do not share gas from their own strategic reserves. And Turkey (not an EU member) has turned to Iran to replace the missing Russian gas.        
	Only its not really Russian gas at all: most of it comes from the central Asian state of Turkmenistan. And the dispute between Russia and Ukraine is not a normal commercial dispute (both sides insist), nor is it some kind of Russian strategic move. It is a thieves quarrel. Since it is Turkmenistans gas, you would expect the Turkmens to sell it to European countries directly, and pay transit fees to Russia and Ukraine for shipping it west through their pipelines. Instead, Gazprom secured long-term rights to Turkmenistans gas by agreeing to pay it a rumoured $340 per thousand cubic metres  almost double the $179.50 per tcm that Ukraine actually paid in 2008.        
	Times are hard all over (Gazproms shares have fallen by 76 per cent since September) and Russia actually needs the money badly, so the pressure to raise the price of gas to subsidized ex-Soviet customers is higher than usual. But that is not what caused the gas to be cut off to Ukraine on January 1, and to Europe a week later. The reason is probably a murky internal fight over the division of the spoils.         
	Gazprom is an opaque organization with many leading Russian political figures on its board and management committee, but it is a model of transparency compared to RosUkrEnergo, yet another middleman with the job of buying gas from Gazprom and selling it to Ukraine. It was set up after the 2006 Russian-Ukrainian confrontation over gas, apparently at the insistence of Gazprom.                
	Sweet little scam        
	Half of RosUkrEnergo is owned by Gazprom, and the other half by Ukrainian businessmen, who steadfastly refuse to reveal their identities. The cut-off in gas shipments to Ukraine allegedly occurred because the Ukrainian government had paid an outstanding gas bill for $1.5 billion to RosUkrEnergo by the end of the year but the money had not yet appeared in Gazproms account  and probably, more importantly, because Ukraine was refusing to pay an additional $ 615 million in fines for late payment.        
	Maybe Ukraine was technically a month late in paying the bill, but whoever heard of a 40 per cent fine for one months late payment? The glaring lack of detail about this fine reinforces the suspicion that the sum involved is really money creamed off the sale of Gazproms sales to RosUkrEnergo, and on to Ukraine, that is now in dispute between the Russian and Ukrainian beneficiaries of a sweet little scam.        
	The thieves would certainly include high-ranking people in the Kremlin and in the government of the Ukrainian president, Viktor Yushchenko, so its easy to see how the quarrel could escalate into an inter-state confrontation, with Russia accusing Ukraine of stealing gas, and Kiev accusing Moscow of turning off the taps for all of Europe.         
	This episode will reinforce the conviction in the EU that it is unwise to remain heavily dependent on gas that comes via Russia and Ukraine. The short-term options for alternative sources of supply are limited. The long-term solution is to stop burning fossil fuels for Europes energy, but that isnt going to happen for quite a while.

                                                                                                                 THE SAFEST BET                                                    
	South Africas unique democratic system does not allow voters to vote for candidates, but for parties. However, the fourth national and provincial polls in South Africa (that were unhindered by the cricket bonanza imported from India) were all about one candidate  Jacob Zuma, who will be crowned president on May 9. The reason Mr Zuma became the cynosure of all eyes was partly owing to the opposition, which centred its entire electoral campaign around him. The Congress of the People  the pro-Thabo Mbeki breakaway faction of the African National Congress  contributed its bit to this phenomenon as much as the Democratic Alliance, which champions the cause of the white and coloured minorities and is strident against corruption. The nations obsession with Mr Zuma also had much to do with what he is seen to embody  the great black aspiration which the ANC is believed to have lost touch with in its movement against racial discrimination. Mr Zuma is perceived by his supporters as the real African, who is comfortable with his humble origins, true to his tribal identity (as his polygamous relations and dancing on the streets suggest) and conscious of the needs of the poor African. For the ANC, threatened by internecine rivalry and fearful of the loss of its dominant position in the polity, Mr Zuma was obviously the safest bet. Hence, in spite of his controversial past and legal troubles, Mr Zuma has had overwhelming support from his own party, including from Nelson Mandela, who could not but have seen in the ANCs Zulu candidate his last chance of correcting the Xhosa domination in the ANC and retaining the partys inclusive character.        
	Yet Mr Zumas popularity has not brought the ANC the desired two-thirds majority which it had held so long. That, in itself, may not be a terrible loss given the fact that the party would be unlikely to contemplate a drastic change of constitution. But the verdict indicates the rifts in the polity and the growing racial disharmony that may affect the functioning of Mr Zumas presidency. The ANC candidates enthusiasm about courting his black supporters has isolated the partys minority following who are apprehensive about the tribalism creeping into politics. Apart from his own legal baggage, Mr Zuma will also have to carry the burdens of South Africas faltering economy, and its problems of employment and health.

Datta-Ray                        Study in contrast				                                                   
	British grumbling about aid to India reminds us that it is as demeaning for a country to accept foreign money as it is to export economic refugees, whether highly qualified professionals to America or labourers to Singapore. India rsquo;s historical, cultural and emotional connection with Britain is too valuable to be jeopardized for the small change of aid which embitters the giver and hardly helps the recipient.  
	Many Britons feel that their country cannot afford to lavish 825 million on India over three years. The previous five years aid of 1,045 million raised fewer hackles because Britain was not then in the dumps and India was not so exuberant either. Denis MacShane, a junior foreign office minister in Tony Blairs government, puts it diplomatically. The taxpayer has given more than 1 billion of aid to India even though that great country has more billionaires and millionaires than Britain and runs its own well-financed development aid programme. More later about Indian help for less fortunate countries. What matters here is that the political, economic and emotional predicament of a country that has lost an empire without finding a role aggravates resentment.   
	The answer to that rhetorical question was even more revealing of British thinking. Well, after theyve paid for their military and space programmes, theres very little left for food. Hardly their fault is it you fascist, racist, holocaust denier! British aid, the internet writer explained, is a bribe to stop them hating us. Were now the fat kid whose dad owns a sweetshop buying friends. He called it pathetic.        
	Bitterness is not unconnected with the almost daily killing in Afghanistan of brave young Englishmen, some only in their teens. Economic distress compounds grief. The International Monetary Fund fears Britains public debt might double to a record 100 per cent of the gross domestic product over the next five years. Unemployment (2.4 million without jobs) is at a 14-year high, explaining a surge in drug addiction, alcoholism and domestic violence. A new word, Neets, standing for youths who are not in education, employment or training, accounts for one in six in the 16-24 age group. A spurt of what looks suspiciously like race friction and increased support for the ultra-nationalist British National Party can be attributed to the same cause. Conditions will worsen if the GDP shrinks by 5.5 per cent, as the Bank of England governor fears. Further cuts in Britains defence budget are not ruled out. No wonder William Hague, the shadow foreign secretary, laments that it will become increasingly difficult for Britain to exert on world affairs the influence we are used to.        
	But let Indias imagination not run away with delusions of grandeur. The image of grinding poverty dies hard despite the US ruling that while Pakistan and Bangladesh are developing countries, India is a transforming nation (which justified slashing American aid by 35 per cent to $81 million) and analysts constantly coupling India with China as the economic powers of the future. Thanks to Mother Teresas Nobel Prize and sainthood and Slumdog Millionaires eight Oscars and 31.6 million box office takings, the plight of more than 300 million Indians whose misery lends poignancy to the Incredible India slogan is as well known globally as the Mittal, Tata and Ambani fortunes. No country is richer than its poorest citizens.        
	Typically, third world window-dressing, like the campaign to brush Delhis beggars under a carpet of mobile courts, biometric database and special institutions before next years Commonwealth Games, invites ridicule. A similar gimmick in Colombo before the 1976 Non-Aligned Nations summit led to the mayor of Colombos mother, who was collecting driftwood, being bundled off to jail with suspected vagrants. Indias 2001 Census figure of 627,688 beggars was obviously a gross under-estimate, but the authorities are worried only about those in Delhi polluting the sight of foreign, mainly white, delegates. But a capital city that looks too spick and span might persuade donors that their charity is misplaced.        
	Appearances matter. Watching the extravagance of Sheikh Mujibur Rahmans arrival for a Commonwealth summit in Canada, Lee Kuan Yew reflected that the poorer the country, the bigger the Cadillacs they hired for their leaders. Mujibs chartered plane idled on the runway for a week while his entourage loaded it with crates of purchases. It would be more rewarding, Lee mused, for third world politicians to set out to impress the world that they were poor and in dire need of assistance. Lees advice admits by implication that aid is not always unjustified. Philosophically, it can be viewed in terms of global inter-dependence. Even the US welcomed a helping hand after Hurricane Katrina. Pragmatically, it can be called investment, and a blogger does write that every pound Britain gives India yields 10 in commercial exchanges.        
	But Indians have not forgotten Lyndon B. Johnsons humiliating short tether policy when the rains failed and a 17 per cent drop in foodgrain production meant the stark threat of famine. Johnson meticulously supervised the despatch of individual consignments of grain for specific locations, mastering ship, aircraft and railway schedules to retain personal control over every stage of historys largest food rescue operation. An eyewitness noted that when Indira Gandhi telephoned Johnson to appeal for food her hand gripped the instrument so hard during the conversation that her knuckles showed white. She knew that there is no such thing as a free lunch in global diplomacy.              
	Hence the relevance of MacShanes complimentary reference to the modest Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation programme launched in 1964 which now helps 156 countries, Afghanistan heading the list. The ITEC strengthens the case for technical cooperation for specific projects rather than general financial assistance which provokes resentment and is a drop in the ocean of a countrys needs. Ronald Reagans favourite tale of teaching a hungry man to catch fish instead of giving him a fish to eat highlighted a homely truth.        
	India may still need some help. But when Denmark imposed sanctions after Pokhran-II, Jaswant Singh was right to reject the driblets provided by 13 European countries, Australia and Saudi Arabia. India should now review the entire aid programme and the cost in terms of image, repayment and conditionalities.        
	Britain is a special case. Jawaharlal Nehrus argument that Indians and British would get on better if the latter did not rule the former also applies to funding. There is no question of trying to appease frustrated Britons with defence cuts. But ambitious plans should be kept under wraps, as Japan does. Meanwhile, London taxis painted Incredible India in psychedelic colours only draw attention to Indias incredible contrasts. A Delhi that more closely resembles, say, Calcutta might prompt fewer doubts among donors.A scattering of destitutes would help. If this offends patriotic pride, Jaswant Singhs doctrine should be taken a stage further. Surrendering British aid would remove an unnecessary irritant. It would also be good for Indias self-respect.       sunandadryahoo.co.in

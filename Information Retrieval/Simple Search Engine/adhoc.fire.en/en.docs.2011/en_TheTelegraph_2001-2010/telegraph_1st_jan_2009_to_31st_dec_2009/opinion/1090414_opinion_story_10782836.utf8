The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Letters to Editor
                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Low art                  
	Sir  Calcutta is perhaps one of the dirtiest and the most polluted cities of India. Instead of doing something about these problems, the politicians here are always planning to worsen the situation, much to the despair of the citizens (The great wall, March 21). We had seen ugly wall-writings in Calcutta all through the Seventies and the Eighties. In spite of the Election Commissions directive forbidding parties to paint graffiti without the house-owners permission this time, our politicians are bent on bringing the trend back. The leaders will allow anything so long as it serves their interests. They will make Calcutta uglier if they think that wall graffiti will help bring in more votes. The EC should have imposed a total ban on graffiti if it was serious about its intentions. It should have known that the law against graffiti as it stands now will leave enough space for the parties to trample the citizens rights at their will. Given the way conditions are deteriorating in Calcutta, I am sure that day is not far when theft will be legitimized in the city. Killer autorickshaws are being allowed to ply the streets on the pretext that taking autos off the roads will deprive thousands of their living. By the same logic, the Left Front government might decide to give criminals a free run.

	Sir  Prior to the elections, party activists in West Bengal are painting walls of houses beautifully with slogans, in total disregard of whether or not the house-owners are giving their consent to have their homes painted thus. Such a bold outburst of creativity by political parties despite the ECs ban on wall graffiti is charming. Common people try to avoid trouble by giving in to the parties demands. In election time, political parties not just deface houses but also disrupt traffic. Noise pollution reaches an unprecedented level thanks to ceaseless campaigning using microphones. Examination schedules also go haywire. This causes unnecessary harassment to students. Do political parties realize that people have lost all interest by now in the claptrap of election? Politics is for the people, but in India it has become a power play that has forgotten the needs of the common man. Elections should be conducted in a way that causes least the inconvenience to the people. But in India, in Bengal particularly, this seems like an impossible task.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Wall graffiti looks horrible, makes your home an eye sore and does not do anything good for the state. I am surprised that political leaders are in favour of graffiti. But then, given the mentality of most Indian politicians, perhaps I should not be surprised. Graffiti puts me off parties that paint them. Can Calcuttans vote for a party which is defacing their beautiful city? Instead of protesting against the menace, most Calcuttans are allowing their walls to be disfigured with graffiti. This reveals the essential character of the Bengalis, who are too intellectual to stand up to political bullying.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  It appears that in West Bengal the media and the people are collaborating in the venture of creating mountains out of molehills. Otherwise, how could The Telegraph target the graffiti issue while saying nothing about the huge number of ugly billboards all over West Bengal, especially Calcutta? This is more so since the coercion indulged in by parties in painting walls with graffiti is just a fraction of the whole problem.          
	The issue is not whether parties should be permitted to paint graffiti but whether any political party has the right to hoodwink the people and the laws of the land. At these times before the general elections, every politician is intent on making money while the sun shines. Their hypocrisy is all too apparent. What is the use of spending time debating on wall graffiti when we know that the entire election process, of which graffiti is a part, is a sham in the name of democracy? The Communist Party of India (Marxist) has been in power in West Bengal for over three decades. In all these years, it has done no good for the people but has created a class of zealots who murder, loot and rape to stay in power and then get away with all these. But I wonder if things will be any different if the Trinamul Congress comes to power. After 26/11, all the states in the nation except West Bengal have risen against the political class. We are fools in still reposing faith in the political system and in hoping that it will reform itself.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Lesser evil          
	Sir  S.L. Raos article, Shifting standards (April 6), was interesting. Rao has made an in-depth analysis of the problems with the US dollar and the Special Drawing Rights of the International Monetary Fund as reserve currencies of the world. The US dollar has lost its glamour due to its reckless if not criminal spending by successive American governments in the name of building a great society during the last four decades. The United States of America has used the dollar to finance losing wars in Vietnam and Iraq. The US administration played ducks and drakes not only with its own financial resources but also with the hard-earned reserves that were parked in the US treasury bonds by various nations of the world. Then came the financial crisis, which was the handiwork of Wall Street banks, financial institutions and Insurance companies.          
	The SDR, with its present weightage of 44 per cent for USD, 34 per cent for the euro and 11 per cent each for the Japanese yen and the British pound, is rather out of step with the present economic scene. The basket of currencies and their weightage are in for a change for quite some time. The USD cannot enjoy the weightage of 44 per cent for long. The Chinese renminbi, the Russian rouble and even the Indian rupee are strong candidates to be considered at the time of the next revision.          
	Yet the USD cannot be dumped just now since the alternative will then be the commodity-based reserves. If commodity based reserves come into existence, they will add even more volatility to the currency market and will thereby jeopardize the world economy. Hence, for the time being, we will have to live with the lesser evil and accept the USD as the reserve currency.           
	Yours faithfully,

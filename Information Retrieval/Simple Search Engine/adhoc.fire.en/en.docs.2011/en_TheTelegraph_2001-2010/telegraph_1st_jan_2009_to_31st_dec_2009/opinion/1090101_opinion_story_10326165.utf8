The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | year end chill
                                                                                                                 YEAR END CHILL                                                    
	Public memory is myopic. It tends to see the recent, over the more distant, past. But sometimes, the events of the recent past do genuinely overshadow what went a little before. The year 2008 was one such year. All the major events that seemed to have had determining influences on the shape of contemporary history were clustered in the last three months of the year. At the end of November, there was an attack on India, even though the bullets flew and grenades burst only in parts of Mumbai. Terrorists coming from Pakistan attacked some of Mumbais iconic buildings and killed innocent people. The violence exposed the failures of the intelligence agencies and an inept Union home minister had to step down. What was much more important was the fact that the attack led immediately to a heightening of tension between India and Pakistan. India is convinced that the Pakistan government is not taking adequate steps to eradicate terrorist outfits on its soil. India suspects that the ISI sponsors these outfits to act against India. The year ends in an atmosphere of chill between the two countries. The promise of a lasting peace is a receding horizon.        
	The sound of gunfire in Mumbai was preceded by the declining rustle of money. The Indian economy and the Indian stock exchange went into a downswing. The meltdown was caused by an unprecedented crisis in the global economy. The Indian economy, the optimists argue, has been saved from the worst effects because its fundamentals are strong. So India, the argument is, will register growth but not as high as was projected before the onset of the crisis. The pessimists hold that India is on the brink of a recession and no one can say when the bad cycle will end. The meltdown does not augur well for the New Year with threats of job and salary cuts, shrinkage of employment opportunities and resultant social unrest hovering over the country. The cookie has crumbled and the hope is that enhanced public expenditure will cement the bits and pieces together again.        
	Closer home, West Bengal saw the evaporation of hope when Ratan Tata announced in October that he was withdrawing the Nano project from the state. This decision was forced upon him by the irresponsible agitation launched by Mamata Banerjee at the site of the proposed Nano factory. The year was a bad one and there is no guarantee that 2009 will be better.

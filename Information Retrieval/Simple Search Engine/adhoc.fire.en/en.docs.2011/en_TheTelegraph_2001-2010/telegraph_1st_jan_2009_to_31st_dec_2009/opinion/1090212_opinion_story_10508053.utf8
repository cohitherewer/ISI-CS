	Rogue ride                  
	Sir  With Ram Swaroop, an allegedly drunk assistant driver, making off with the Garib Rath, it has become increasingly evident that Lalu Prasads pet project is more of a populist gesture than a reflection of true concern for the people (Rogue driver takes off with train, Feb 6). The railways ministers vision of change, embodied in this air-conditioned train for all, remains vacuous as long as the safety of the passengers is kept on tenterhooks. Under mysterious circumstances, a goods-train driver drove the train away for more than 400 km to a scheduled stop, while the assigned drivers, Shafeequl Alam and Manoj Kumar Singh, gave chase as if in an action film. The concerned departments, even after being alerted by Alam, watched helplessly as they do not have any technology to intercept a moving train. Although there was every possibility of a mishap due to the violation of signals, luckily the train had a smooth run. Strangely, it is not clear if the signalling posts along this long route lodged any complaint against the driver for his recklessness. And why did the assigned drivers reach the platform just a few minutes before the scheduled departure? Like the mandatory tests that drivers have to take before setting out on a journey, is it also not essential that the drivers themselves run routine checks of the engine?          
	A few months back, while I was travelling by the Chambal Express, it got stuck in between Howrah and Liluah, and was detained for an hour because of a fault in the engine. Did this happen because the pilots take their job too casually? There is ample opportunity for sabotaging a train if someone so intends, given the lackadaisical approach of the railways. After reaching a terminus, both the pilot and guard generally leave the engine unattended. It would be easy enough for anyone to access the cabin since the door remains open for quite some time. Ram Swaroops wilful behaviour should be an eye-opener for railway officials to sort their acts. Moreover, it reflects badly on the authorities when senior officers cover up the lapses by saying that the incident was blown out of proportion.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  As a former officer with the Indian Railways, I would like to make a few observations on the incident of Ram Swaroop, an assistant driver, driving away with the Garib Rath. If Swaroop is an assistant driver, qualified as an engine pilot, he is not even supposed to drive trains from the yard to the station. In case of exigencies, after obtaining permission from the higher authorities, he could be allowed to do such a thing; otherwise he is only a shunter. Swaroop must have known the route pretty well himself, which is why he dared to go all the way down to Kanpur.          
	No doubt, if Swaroop is found guilty on enquiry he should be recommended for stringent punishment. However, the assigned drivers, Manoj Kumar Singh and Shafeequl Alam, should have reported at least 15 minutes before departure. They get 30 minutes to undergo tests in the crew control cell and collect the necessary documents. The stationmaster at New Delhi is supposed to hand over some papers to the engine pilot. When the drivers could not persuade Swaroop to open the door, they should have reported to their seniors, who would have withheld the green signal which flagged off the train. This would have halted the grabs. After boarding the Guwahati-bound Rajdhani Express, the drivers should have informed the stationmaster at New Delhi, who could have stopped the train.           
	Yours faithfully,        K. Ramanaiah, Liluah, Howrah     
	Sir  The so-called rogue train-driver, Ram Swaroop, seems to have been made a scapegoat by those actually guilty. One of the passengers said the Garib Rath stopped a number of times at various places between New Delhi and Kanpur. Swaroop also drove the train for 440km safely  which means that he had followed the signals all along. The stationmasters en route should have been alerted, and the train could have been stopped by a red signal. Instead of catching the driver at Kanpur, he could have been caught within a few kilometres of New Delhi station.           
	It was also strange that the designated drivers reached the platform just minutes before the scheduled departure. Do these drivers set off without doing the mandatory checks? It is also absurd that a drunk driver drove a train without any fault and completed the journey only 15 minutes late. Has this got anything to do with the reluctance of the railway officials to reveal the outcome of the breath-alyzer test conducted on Swaroop at Kanpur? Even more intriguingly, the authorities tried to defend Swaroop by claiming him as a railway employee, not any outsider. They also tried to shamelessly play down the incident by saying that it was being unnecessarily blown out of proportion.           
	Yours faithfully,

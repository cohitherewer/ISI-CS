The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | dangerous city
                                                                                                                 DANGEROUS CITY                                                    
	When will venturing outdoors in Calcutta stop being an act of faith, a leap in the dark? The many dangers and unpredictabilities that Calcutta plants in the daily lives of its citizens make it a truly medieval city, to survive in which one has to keep the gods neurotically placated. So the first thing that the taxi-driver who, together with his passenger, narrowly escaped being impaled by part of the tram tracks thought of doing was to offer puja to Biswakarma. Significantly for the civic culture of the city, he chose to do this puja before lodging a complaint against the Calcutta Tramways Company. Just as significantly, this averted mishap was followed by locals blocking the road in protest for a while. A city that leaves no choice for its citizens other than one between superstitious worship and ineffectual road-blocking, has some basic work to do on the civic, municipal and urban development fronts. This is the third time that such an accident has been avoided on these tracks. In 2003, a young man lost his life after his lung was pierced by a steel cable lying exposed on the road.        
	Everywhere, a combination of public indifference (charitably called patience) and administrative negligence makes life hazardous in the city. Nobody seems accountable for there being poison in the air, arsenic in the water, no stringent fire-safety regulations, no standards for measuring the dangerousness of old houses, inadequate security measures, murderously rash drivers of public buses and a host of other perils that Calcuttans are forced to confront in public spaces and while availing themselves of public facilities. In taking these on, they could choose to be blithe, religious or angry. Taking recourse to the law, or thinking about citizens rights and entitlements occurs to them only as a last, diffident resort. This timidity is convenient for the authorities, while the anger is useful for politicians. The mark of a modern civilization is a degree of freedom from the fear of unpredictable harm to ones person.

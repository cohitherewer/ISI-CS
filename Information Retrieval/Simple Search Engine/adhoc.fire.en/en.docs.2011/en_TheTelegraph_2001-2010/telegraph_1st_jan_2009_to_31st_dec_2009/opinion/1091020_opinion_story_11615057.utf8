	Lawless roads                  
	Sir  The recent spate of accidents on the roads of Calcutta is not surprising given the fact that pedestrians often walk on roads instead of using footpaths. I would like to bring to the attention of the Calcutta Police the habit of certain people to gamble with cards from early morning till late at night on pavements, thus narrowing the walking space considerably. One such group can be seen regularly on Gobinda Auddy Road near the Durgapur Bridge. Not only do these people occupy the entire stretch of the pavement at times, forcing pedestrians to walk on the narrow and busy Gobinda Auddy Road, but they also curse in loud voices, ignoring the children and ladies passing by.           
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation has recently spent money from public funds to renovate the pavement and install new lights along the street. Was this done so that gamblers could sit and curse on the freshly-laid pavement under the new lights while pedestrians put themselves at risk?          
	Yours faithfully,      
K. Sen, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The other day, I was travelling by a bus (WB 04D 5687) of route 46B when I noticed to my amazement that the emergency door was on the left side of the vehicle, near the drivers cabin. By placing the door on the same side as the main doors, the very purpose of an emergency exit is defeated. Is the public vehicles department sleeping? I suggest that all emergency doors be painted black and white, both on the inside and outside, for easy identification in case of emergencies.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  One of the basic criteria while preparing the alignment of bridges is that the approaches to the bridge be kept straight. The access road at the western end of the bridge over the railway tracks along the Prince Anwar Shah Connector has three sharp bends over a distance of 120 metres. This abnormality is due to peculiar kinks in the adjoining boundary wall of the Central Glass and Ceramic Research Institute. As a consequence of this defect, this stretch of road suffers constantly from traffic congestions and accidents. The situation is further aggravated by surface drainage problems caused by the faulty alignment of the bridge. Stagnation of water on the surface of the road combined with continuous vehicular movement result in the development of potholes and craters, which are additional traffic hazards.          
	Although the second carriageway of the particular connector is yet to be completed, the latter is already a major arterial road of south Calcutta as it provides the shortest access to the E.M. Bypass leading to Salt Lake and the airport. It is imperative that the concerned authorities look into the matter immediately and correct the alignment of the bridge. The sooner they act, the better it is. Once the single storied building hugging the boundary wall on the inner side is further raised, straightening of the boundary wall by dismantling the building will prove to be even more difficult than it is now.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  I was shocked to see the garbage heap near the airport on the stretch of the VIP Road at the approach of Newtown. It is depressing to realize that people from other cities and countries entering Calcutta are welcomed with a rubbish dump. Not only is this an eyesore but is also dangerous, given the proximity of the place to the airport. To add to the beauty of the area, three or four trucks laden with garbage remain parked beside the road. Every time I go by, the dump seems to be getting bigger.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Special care           
	Sir  I felt quite hopeful on reading the report, Plan to give benefits for learning disabilities (Oct 12), which spoke of the social welfare ministrys proposal to treat autism and learning disabilities as disabilities under the Persons with Disability Act, and to make special provisions for such children. But then I had second thoughts about the ministrys proposal. On the one hand, I find the proposed amendment commendable but, on the other, I am worried about its effects, if it comes to be implemented. The comment, The ministry has also proposed that the education of children with disabilities be made more inclusive in regular schools, through better facilities, instead of giving preference to special institutions, made me rather apprehensive. To what extent can children with disabilities adjust themselves to the atmosphere of a regular school? Most of us adults are mature enough to understand their needs and provide them with love and affection. But what about children of the same age group? Will they be considerate enough to accommodate the special children into their friends circles?          
	The social welfare ministry has, very thoughtfully, suggested various provisions like that of free distance education for persons with disabilities up to Class XII, reservation of seats for the disabled in recognized institutions and so on. But it seems to be unaware of the fact that the special children need an affable environment in schools to feel comfortable. If an autistic child is introduced to a regular classroom, he might further withdraw into himself. But a friendly environment suited to his needs can be remedial for him.          
	Again, hiring special educators for disabled children in schools is a good suggestion. However, these children cannot always be kept isolated from other students just because they are under special supervision. They have to come out and interact with others. If the ministry takes care of these practical aspects, its proposals might help the special children.          
	Yours faithfully,

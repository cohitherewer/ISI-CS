                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Money in a muddle                  
	Sir  It is a matter of deep concern that a great many fake currency notes are in circulation. This may ruin the economy, which is precisely the motive of those behind the scam. The government should take urgent steps to end this malpractice. The police must seize all fake notes and stop the smuggling of more such notes into the country. Perhaps the printing of notes of higher denominations could be stopped until they are replaced by newly designed notes. Meanwhile, it might make sense to print more notes of lower denominations.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Richly left          
	Sir  The Communist Party of India (Marxist) has at last recognized the need to improve its image in West Bengal and Kerala. The party leaders have apparently discovered that a number of its functionaries lead a lavish life with the help of funds from unaccounted sources (Party of poor grapples with riddle of riches, Sept 6).          
	The Left Front leaders have long abandoned the Marxist ideology, despite warnings from leaders like V.S. Achuthanandan. Nevertheless, it is commendable that the CPI(M) is considering a proposal to implement a rule to make it mandatory for its members to declare their assets to the party. The affluence of many comrades, not just at the top but also at local levels, has alienated voters in Kerala and West Bengal. So if this proposal is not implemented immediately, the miscreants may transfer their wealth to the bank accounts of their relatives before declaring assets to save their own skin.          
	However, declaring assets is no big deal, as it can turn out to be just a tricky way of legitimizing black money. It is true that the comrades are being influenced by bourgeois tendencies and lifestyle deviations, but the proposal for asset declaration may not improve the reputation of the party significantly. In fact, if the party tries to pull up its erring functionaries by scanning their assets, the present leadership may land up in the biggest trouble.          
	Yours faithfully,      
K. James Williams, Alappuzha, Kerala    
	Head over heels  
	Sir  The editorial, Focused elsewhere(Sept 6), rightly points out that it needed no research to prove that men lose their heads around pretty women. But it should be added that a man also loses his interest in a pretty woman once he has successfully conquered her. Perhaps this is why women mostly look for a man who is a dependable provider and a good father. Women seem to understand very well that a mans attraction is temporary.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Men can indeed become quite daft in the company of beautiful women (Men can be pretty silly, Sept 5). This is why intelligence agencies have used gorgeous women as spies. Mata Hari, a double agent, fooled many military officers into thinking that she was a courtesan in order to accomplish her missions.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot  
	Sir  The home minister has clarified that the Centre cannot take action against Bengals Maoists unless the state government approaches it for help (Politics hurting guerrilla hunt: PC, Sept 7). But the Left is divided on the issue. Although the chief minister had decided to ban the outfit, some partymen feel that the problem can be solved politically. It seems that the menace would continue for some time.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Ranjit Sinha, Deolali

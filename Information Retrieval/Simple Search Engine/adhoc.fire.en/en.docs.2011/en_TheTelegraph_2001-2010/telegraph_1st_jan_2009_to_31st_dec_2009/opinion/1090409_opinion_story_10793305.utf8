The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | missed message
                                                                                                                 MISSED MESSAGE                                                    
	American presidents, Chinese prime ministers or Indian home ministers  nobody deserves a shoe in the face. The act, even at its most popular, remains uncivilized whatever the context, especially when performed by journalists or university students, who have other, more legitimate and by no means less powerful, means of protest at their disposal. There is no doubt about the fact that Jarnail Singhs gesture amounts to a public and serious breach of professional decorum. Yet, playing it down or using it as an opportunity to be magnanimous is to miss the seriousness of its import. However unacceptable the medium, refusing to hear and engage with the message of the missed shoe would gravely compromise this governments credentials as a dispenser of justice. It is impossible to look away from the fact that a quarter of a century has passed since the Sikh riots of 1984. It has taken until the beginning of this month for Jagdish Tytlers name to be officially cleared by the Central Bureau of Investigation. But in these more-than-two decades, most ordinary Indians who like to see justice done unequivocally would find it difficult to do away with those inverted commas. The timing of the CBIs clearing of Mr Tytlers name and its quiet dismissal of the Nanavati commissions recommendations regarding new evidence against him have deeply compromised the CBIs credibility as a non-partisan, justice-dispensing body. The extent to which the CBI and the various independent inquiries initiated by the State have failed to win the confidence of the people cannot be ignored any more or be dismissed as a matter of perception.        
	This is a reality that both the CBI and the Congress have to reckon with, each in its own way. Why do people, in Delhi and in the states, automatically refuse to believe any of the CBIs findings and acquittals? And what is the source of this profound mistrust? Is this just a lack of faith in the CBIs efficiency and intentions? Or is this also a form of popular scepticism directed at the way in which these procedures and their outcome are inevitably and inscrutably politicized, enmeshed in a web of power-driven motives? It is easy to dodge a shoe, but it is becoming increasingly difficult for the government to evade these questions, which go to the heart of a modern and democratic polity.

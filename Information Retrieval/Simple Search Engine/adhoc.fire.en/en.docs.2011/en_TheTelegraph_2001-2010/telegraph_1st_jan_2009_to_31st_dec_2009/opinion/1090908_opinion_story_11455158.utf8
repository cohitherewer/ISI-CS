The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | AGENT AGENDA
                                                                                                                 AGENT AGENDA                                                    
	If 70 per cent of mutual fund buyers and 90 per cent of insurance buyers resort to commission agents, then the quality of the agents service is important. Anyone who has looked at an insurance policy or the offer document of a mutual fund knows that they are indigestible; when he signs the applications for these financial products, he does so blindly. Hence the scope for cheating him is undeniable, and the government should concern itself with protecting him. So it was right to appoint the committee on investor awareness and protection. Its consultation paper is written in good English, and puts forward important ideas for public discussion.        
	Three of the ideas are important. First, the committee proposes a national financial wellbeing board, which, however grandiosely named, has a useful remit, namely to educate the people in managing their finances. This board is not meant to be another regulator, but an educator: it would set standards for distributors of financial instruments, and run examinations to ensure that the distributors know their job. It would also organize education programmes for budding investors. Second, it proposes a self-regulatory organization for financial instrument distributors which would enforce the NFWBs standards and punish distributors who do not follow the standards. And finally, it proposes an end to the present practice of distributors getting their commissions from the first premium of those who enrol in a pension scheme or take an insurance policy.        
	However, there can be doubts about its basic premise  that agents do not tell customers about all the choices available to them because neither is trained. The agents stick to one product to sell because that is the product on which they get a commission  they are all agents for one institution or another. And the reason why they serve only one institution is that the institution prefers it that way. It is in competition with other institutions, and is interested in maximizing its own sales. And as long as there is competition in financial industries, that is how it will remain  agents will sell products of only one institution however much training they are given. But they would give information about a variety of products if the financial institutions sold them; and the reason why the institutions do not offer such a variety is that they are not allowed to. Each of them is a slave to a regulator which does not allow it to diversify; just think of the fuss the Reserve Bank of India made when the ICICI Bank tried to enter insurance. And there are so many regulators because that is how bureaucrats maximize their deputation opportunities. If the government is interested in the financial welfare of its citizens, it should do two things. First, it should forbid the employment of bureaucrats by regulators unless they resign first. And second, they should combine all financial regulators into one.

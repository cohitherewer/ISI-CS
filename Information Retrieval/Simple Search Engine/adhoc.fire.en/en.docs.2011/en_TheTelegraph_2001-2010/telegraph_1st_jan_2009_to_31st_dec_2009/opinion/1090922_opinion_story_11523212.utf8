The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Thou shall not have fun
                                                                                                                 THOU SHALL NOT HAVE FUN                                                                  
	As a child born in the mid-Sixties and growing up in Calcutta in an upper-middle-class Brahmo joint family, I was often faced with a puzzling contradiction. How could the funniest, the most colourfully eccentric and affectionate of aunts, grandparents, grand-aunts and grand-uncles subscribe uncritically to a religious ethos that appeared to be so joyless and puritanical? How could people who loved to have fun, and were so much fun, have such a funless relationship with a god whom they chose to worship in a spirit of drear and unrelieved sobriety? And how could they, who were so delightful and unpretentious, believe deep in their hearts that their form of worship was essentially superior to other, idolatrous, expressions of faith?        
	These questions annoyed and embarrassed me throughout my childhood, but most keenly twice every year, during Holi and during the Pujas. It would seem on these two occasions that the entire city was part of the most alluringly riotous Carnival, while it was the greyest Lent in our house. Through its shutters and from its verandahs, I would catch the sights and sounds of universal merrymaking like a boy-Charulata, swinging between indignation and self-pity. Even if Charus opera-glasses werent actually in my hand, they were permanently lodged within my eyes through the tyranny of refinement that my upbringing would appear to be, at such moments, to myself. The embarrassment was felt at school, or on those rare evenings I would go with our cook to watch the play our neighbours had put up in the pujobari, where I couldnt help feeling oddly self-conscious.        
	When my classmates discussed their Puja plans, or their new clothes, a whole tradition of festivity would open up behind them, from which I felt boringly excluded. Id start off by being part of their discussion, but suddenly someone would say, O baba, tora to abar Brahmo! and from that moment, Id be regarded with a mix of caution, awe and derision. But every year, my best friend in class would take my books and keep them at Saraswatis feet when he and his sister did their own pujo at home. But he assumed that my religious sentiments would be outraged if he invited me to be part of the pujo and feasting. The next day, hed bring me the half-dry pujo flowers, which I kept in my pencil-box. I did feel a personal disinclination to go to his sacred-thread feast. But this had nothing to do with religion; I wasnt sure how I felt about caste. Yet I loved to watch his brisk mealtime rituals, which he performed quite unselfconsciously no matter whose table he was eating at.        
	I distinctly remember the combination of a vague, but instinctive, distaste and nervousness that I felt if someone brought me prasad to eat. The distaste had to do with hygiene, but is hygiene ever only about hygiene? The nervousness was more complicated. Did I not have to touch the prasad to my forehead before eating it, and wasnt the slightest hesitation to eat it a grave disrespect to the deity who had blessed it and also to the devotee who had brought the prasad for me? And if I did touch it to my forehead before eating it, wasnt I violating the principles of my own religion?        
	Years later, in a beautiful old gurdwara in Haryana, I found myself doing the flat-on-the-floor pranam that the others were doing in front of the Guru Granth Sahib. It was an act of impious piety for me, driven by a surge of emotions that ranged from the joy of transgression to genuine spiritual feeling. Afterwards, when offered the halwa at the altar, in my ignorance of how to do things properly, I took it with just one hand instead of both and without bowing low, provoking a severe reprimand from the elderly and saintly-looking priest that left me feeling deeply ashamed.        
	In Oxford, once, I went for Evensong without realizing that it was a special service during which Holy Communion was going to be administered. There were very few people, and slipping out was impossible. I remember the terror I felt while processing to the altar to receive the Eucharist, the terror of not knowing what to do, and then meekly saying Thank You! to the priest, whose eyes widened for a moment with what I had then taken to be shock, but now wonder if it was amusement.                    AVEEK SEN

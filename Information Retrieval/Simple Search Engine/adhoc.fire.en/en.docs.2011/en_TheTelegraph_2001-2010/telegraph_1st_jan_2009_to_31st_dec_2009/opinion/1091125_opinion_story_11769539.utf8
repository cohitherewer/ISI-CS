	Unfair comparison                  
	Sir  Mike Athertons column, Sachin: the other view (Nov 19), gives the impression that Sachin Tendulkar is not the greatest batsman ever. Anybody interested in cricket, including Tendulkar, will agree that it is almost impossible to find another player who can rival Donald Bradman in terms of consistency and technique. But we certainly cannot overlook Tendulkars consistency, or the enormity of his achievements. It is amazing that Tendulkar has not only scored a lot of runs in Tests and one-dayers, but has also displayed immense physical and mental strength to stay on top in international cricket for 20 long years. Whether Tendulkar wears a helmet or not is irrelevant in this context. An international cricketer of Athertons repute should have also considered the fact that fielding standards have improved remarkably since Bradmans time, making the batsmens job of scoring runs more difficult. Therefore, comparing the achievements of two players belonging to different eras is not fair. It is better that we desist from such comparisons and laud Tendulkar for his achievements.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Sachin Tendulkars detractors include Ian Chappell, Barry Richards, Rohan Kanhai, and now Mike Atherton. Very few experts have come to terms with the Indian maestros immense sustaining power, and his critics are in the habit of pointing out his flaws in one way or the other. Several charges have been levelled against Tendulkar: that he has seldom played match-winning knocks, that he cannot play the hook, and that he uses excessive protective gear, among others. But the fact remains that none of his detractors has been able to demonstrate the kind of discipline Tendulkar has shown in their own playing days. Ironically, it was another Englishman, Mike Brearley, who was one of the first players to start opting for specifically designed, protective headgear.          
	Players of yesteryear may not have had the protective gear of the modern era, but they were also not subject to the intense media scrutiny that is prevalent in this age. Many of the former greats got away with questionable, on-field behaviour. Unlike modern players, they did not have to put up with the stress of a demanding career either. Therefore, it is pertinent to ask how many players belonging to the earlier era can boast of Tendulkars impeccable personal reputation, something that he has maintained for over two decades? Complaints that modern players have an unfair advantage over their predecessors does not make much sense.

	Tongue trouble          
	Sir  I agree with S.L. Rao that linguistic chauvinism must be rooted out before it starts threatening Indias socio-political set-up, which has already been considerably weakened by globalization (Parochial passions, Nov 16). But, at the same time, we should try and identify the roots of the languages in our culture. The states reorganization commission, in order to identify the countrys cultural diversity, admitted that languages were a key cultural component of a nation. It is evident that the states are cultural rather than political entities. Rao talks about concepts such as migration and mobility, but the phenomena, in my opinion, should be looked at as socio-political issues.          
	The Indian state allows its citizens free movement any where within the country. Every citizen has the right to earn a living and own property anywhere in India. Imbalances in economic development in different states lead to the movement of populations from poorer areas to the ones that are better-developed in search of livelihood. Migration, as we know it, takes place as a result of the concentration of resources in a few cities. The term, migration, as used by scholars, requires a broader definition. When a local population terms a group as migrant, it implies that the migrants have less right in comparison to the native populations, the so-called sons of the soil. This cannot be condoned either legally or socially. Columnists like Rao must re-examine the processes such as human mobility and the unequal allocation of resources. After all, migration of human populations and the distribution of resources are inter-related. Therefore, to secure Indias social fabric, linguistic chauvinism must be effaced. It is also time to look at issues such as migration in a new light.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  S.L. Rao emphasizes that linguistic chauvinism must be rooted out before its too late. This is a valid argument. But the problem persists because Indian states are divided on the basis of language. However, this division has also created new political and economic barriers. Migrants  for instance, those who have settled in Mumbai  have had to downplay their linguistic and regional roots to survive in the city. Under the circumstances, linguistic chauvinism or divisions cannot be done away with unless another Mumbai is founded elsewhere. For this to happen, economic decentralization is necessary.          
	Yours faithfully,

                                                                                                                 TRUST MATTERS                                                    
	From Gujarat to Jammu and Kashmir to the Northeast, complaints about killings in fake encounters come at regular intervals. Some of these turn out to be politically motivated. But official responses to these complaints are often too unreal to carry conviction. In Manipur, the fight against militants has frequently forced the administration to face charges of fake encounters. It is still unknown if the killing of two people, including a pregnant woman, in July was due to a fake encounter. And now the state administration faces the same charge over the killing of six people in Imphal. The fight against ethnic militancy has to use unconventional methods, because the militants are known to use innocent civilians for strategic cover. But that precisely is the reason why the police and other forces fighting the militants need to win the trust of the local people. Suspicions of fake encounters alienate the people from the law-enforcing agencies. That certainly is no way to win either the peoples confidence or the battle against insurgents.        
	The official version of the circumstances behind the latest killings in Imphal may or may not be true. Only an impartial inquiry can reveal what actually happened. The government has nothing to gain by shying away from ordering the inquiry that residents of the area have demanded. More important, however, is a strategy to regain public confidence in the administrations intentions. Militants everywhere try to destroy the peoples faith in the rule of law. Governments in the Northeast need to convince the people that the militants themselves are the worst threat to their lives. True, the police and other forces in Manipur have their own schemes to help the local people in healthcare and other areas. But deaths of innocent people in police actions can undo the effects of these goodwill missions. Successful battles are always a mix of aggression and caution.

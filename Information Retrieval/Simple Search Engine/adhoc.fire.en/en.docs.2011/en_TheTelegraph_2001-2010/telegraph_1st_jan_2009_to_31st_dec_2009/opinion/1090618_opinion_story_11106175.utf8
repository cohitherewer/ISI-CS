	Careful with death                  
	Sir  The Supreme Court was very humane in advising the judges to think twice before awarding the death sentence (Think twice before death award, June 7). The court may have played a counter-majoritarian role in suggesting that people who strangle and behead a person, chop off arms and legs, put them in separate bags and dump them in different places, can still be reformed. The court observed that a jail term can serve several ends of the legal system, like preventing the convict from carrying out further crimes.           
	But with so many offenders around who repeat their crimes, and with the media reporting the crimes when the accused is out on bail, it is difficult to match these observations with everyday experience. The apex court questioned the theory that fear of the death sentence is the strongest deterrent for would-be criminals. The belief that exemplary punishment does act as a deterrent to severe crimes is, however, fairly widespread. Is it not a waste to keep criminals who are unlikely to be reformed alive on the taxpayers money?           
	Perhaps it is time to think whether leniency in awarding punishments would encourage unemployed persons like Santosh Kumar Satishbhushan Bariyar to commit such ghastly crimes. The Constitution permits the death sentence, and in the last six decades, the Indian polity has not thrown up any symptoms to suggest that the founding fathers of the Constitution and the members of the constituent assembly lacked foresight.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The Supreme Courts wise counsel to the judges to think twice before awarding the death sentence is a very humanitarian approach. The United Nations passed a resolution for abolishing the death sentence, although it was non-binding. Among the countries that still award the death penalty are India, the United States of America, China and Indonesia. In India death sentences are rare  between 1975 and 1991, only 40 people were hanged to death. In the US 37 people were sentenced to death in 2007. But in China, according to Amnesty International, at least 7,000 death sentences are the annual average. Yet, hardly any resistance to the death penalty can be seen in China, which is a model State for many.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Grey world          
	Sir  A couple of days back, television channels aired celebrations of the World Environment Day. One cannot find faults with the media coverage, but it would have been much better had there been a consistent and educative campaign about the perils of deforestation, wanton construction in the name of building infrastructure and the exploitation of water resources in the hilly regions for hydroelectric dams. These issues should be looked into seriously and with urgency.           
	The desire to meet burgeoning human needs has left us blind to reason. Setting up industries is perfectly all right, as is the need to provide electricity to industrial units. However, the sheer magnitude of construction along the fragile hilly terrain along the bank of the Teesta is frightening. The dams, which have been approved in these areas only recently, may yield short-term gains but will result in long-term losses. A micro-hydro project would have made far more sense, both environmentally and aesthetically. Earlier, there were rubber-plantation nurseries for planting trees along the riverbanks. These were meant to check the heavy erosion caused by strong currents. None of these exist today. Instead, one finds logging depots all over the hills that are ready to turn the green foliage into timber. Some things are better left alone. If the mangroves had not been there in the Sunderbans, Calcutta would have born the brunt of cyclones such as Aila. It is sad to see nature and its beauty disappear in ones own lifetime. How does one convince people that the green cover in the Himalayas is as necessary as their air-conditioned rooms in the city? And that we are all responsible for the melting of the distant polar icecaps? It is imperative that every citizen takes a pledge to stop this devastation that is taking place in the name of development. Otherwise, human beings will not even need wars to destroy themselves.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
E.D.T. Lepcha, Siliguri

                
	Sir  Recently, World Environment Day was celebrated with much fanfare. Though the level of awareness about the negative impacts of environmental degradation is appreciable, a lot more needs to be done. It is time for actions that would yield results and be sustainable. It will be helpful if newspapers devote a page for publishing articles on environmental issues. Pictorial descriptions, if available, can be of great help as well. Even in the age of electronic communication, the print media remain the most effective means of communication. A little effort in this direction will contribute a lot towards the protection of the environment.                     
	Yours faithfully,

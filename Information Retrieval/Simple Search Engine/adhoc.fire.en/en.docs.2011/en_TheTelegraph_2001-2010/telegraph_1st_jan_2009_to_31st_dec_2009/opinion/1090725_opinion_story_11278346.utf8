                                                                                                                 COMRADES UTOPIA                                                          
	One partys utopia is the common mans hell. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) should be proud that it has established in West Bengal the utopia visualized by Karl Marx. It has made the State wither away in West Bengal. The mode of making the State disappear may not have been the same as that advocated in the canons of classical Marxism; nor are the consequences of the withering away the same as those spelt out by Marx. Nonetheless, the State has withered away in West Bengal where communists held sway for over three decades. Critics of the CPI(M) do not give the party adequate credit for this remarkable achievement. It needs to be remembered that any political party deserves to be judged in terms of its ideology and vision. By these standards  and no one can deny that the ideology and vision of communism form the core of the CPI(M)s identity  the years of communist rule in West Bengal represent an absolute triumph of the CPI(M) and its highest aspirations.        
	In no field of activity in West Bengal have the state apparatus and the states decision-making been visible for sometime. The administration has failed in two of its principal tasks  the maintenance of law and order, and the protection of property. No less a person than the home minister admitted that the police had not acted adequately to bring the situation under control in Mangalkot in Burdwan. The police made themselves into spectators as Congress supporters went on a rampage on Thursday last week and destroyed public property. It is also clear that the government has taken no steps to enforce the court order regarding the removal of vehicles that are more than 15 years old. This failure has led to the bizarre situation where there could be a confrontation between the state administration and the judiciary. The government has put on hold projects relating to infrastructure because it is scared to implement its policies of land acquisition. There is also the incident where the state administration watched a political party block the main highway of the state for days on end. In health and in education, the state has stopped acting many moons ago. The withering away of the State in West Bengal has become palpable very recently but the process began long before the tenure of the present chief minister. Jyoti Basu, West Bengals minence grise, mastered the art of ruling without taking any major decision.        
	The path to the communist utopia in West Bengal is one that has too many signposts of inactivity, of promises made and not kept, and of hard decisions not taken out of populist concerns. Communists have achieved their utopia in West Bengal but the people of the state live in hell. According to Marx, in the communist utopia human beings would live according to their needs, not according to their abilities. In West Bengal, thanks to a party dedicated to the ideology he created, human beings live according to their physical might and without hope.

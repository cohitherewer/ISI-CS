                                                                                                                 NO ROOM FOR VALUES                                  Malvika Singh                              
	What an inordinate fuss we are making about the auction of Mahatma Gandhis personal effects, the auction and the buy-back. This false nationalism is nauseating, because this country, through its faulty governance and corrupt administrative operations, has managed to virtually auction off to posterity all that Gandhi stood and fought for. We do not deserve his personal belongings, which will be far better preserved at a place or in a museum overseas where he, and all that he symbolizes, continue to be respected and often worshipped.        
	We in India neither know how to create great museums and maintain them, nor do we honour those qualified to do so. Our babus have destroyed institutions, reducing them to virtual slums, where the environment drives away all creativity and flings it to the winds. I have always said that if the Padshah Nama, for example, had been lying in some broken-down nationalized museum in India, it would have rotted by now. At Windsor, it lives on.        
	India should have mounted one of the finest exhibitions of the life and times of Gandhi, a contemporary wonder of the world. We failed to do so because we know no better. Personal gain, self-aggrandizement, exploitation of privilege, and more, have dominated and drowned good governance in India. Our babus, who are at the helm of our cultural institutions, neither have the interest nor the expertise necessary to conceive of and nurture living or dead monuments. They do not have the aesthetic or intellectual wherewithal.        
	Our political class, the other face of the same coin, epitomizes all that Gandhi abhorred, and it is those men and women who are suddenly eager to buy the bits and bobs that the Mahatma used, having destroyed his ethos, values and beliefs through their bad governance and corruption. With full control of the administration, these servants of the nation were unable to ensure drinking water from the village well for all castes, let alone anything else. Sick. They do not deserve anything that Gandhi used.                
	Bell the cat        
	Cultural institutions, museums, archives and all such bhandars, repositories of our civilization, must be put in the hands of experts who know their job. An ex officio member, representing the government that happens to be the owner of the properties in many cases, can sit on the governing board but only that. All executive power must reside with the committee of experts, not babus. Public-private partnership is imperative here to ensure safe survival. We need to replace our fake and faulty nationalism of knowing it all and wanting it all with the effort to embrace the successful models in other nations that have preserved their buildings and objects of skill and beauty.        
	Sant Singh Chatwal was quick, longing to dispense largesse on behalf of the Indian government, and the question that looms large is  what will be the quid pro quo? What connections will be forged for this bailout? Will Chatwal pour millions into restoring the Mathura Museum, where some of our finest sculptures sit in the most dilapidated space? Anywhere in the world this would be considered criminal. The little bronze mermaid in Copenhagan is given more respect than the Yakshi at Mathura.        
	Some leaders get excited about contemporary paintings of gods and goddesses, forgetting that some of the greatest sculptures of the world celebrate the human form in its naked truth. Our temples are adorned with such crafted celestial beings. We worship them. Why this strange conservatism? Why not expend this vitriolic energy to make sure all Indians, living beings, are clothed and protected from the vagaries of the weather? Why this rampant hypocrisy? Why are we agitating about non-issues, allowing the real problems to escalate and become unmanageable?        
	Someone needs to bell this wild cat.

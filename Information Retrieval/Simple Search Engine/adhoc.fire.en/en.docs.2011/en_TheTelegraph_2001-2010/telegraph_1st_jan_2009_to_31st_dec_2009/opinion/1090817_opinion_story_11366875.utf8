The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Fast track to the world
                                                                                                                 FAST TRACK TO THE WORLD                          - How to create rural Davids to fight the urban Goliath        TAPAS MAJUMDAR                                            
	Looking for factors determining the incidence of school-going in the different states of India, one finds several interesting things: incomes as well as the spread of job opportunities before the educated youth are markedly less in villages than in small towns, and less in small towns than in the metropolitan cities. Also, sharp differences in earnings exist between the rural and the urban sectors even if the same degree of skill is acquired for a job  teaching, for example. The divergence between earning opportunities in town and country causes a big difference in the success rates of education, its external efficiency. I see this as the major cause of worry for Indian education. That worry will not go away with establishing 14 new universities of world-class standards in 14 states, as promised in Parliament, at locations from Greater Noida to Bhopal to Visakhapatnam. Nine new prestigious world-class Central universities have already started functioning at the highest level  that of the vice-chancellors.        
	Such knee-jerk reactions are not likely to help. As Darwin had found out, survival in the animal kingdom often depended on the ability to adapt to changes. We are in a panic because we do not know enough to decide what changes we are meant to adapt to. I suggest we accept, first, the proposition that all education must focus henceforth on addressing a basic common urge: to gain access to meaningful civic existence wherever one lives. For this, I do not think it will be necessary to be world-class on a grand scale. It will also not be necessary to copy all the good practices one sees around the world. But some copying may be advisable.              
	I dream of a future when well-run and well-loved institutions in predominantly rural areas  colleges and universities  will provide inspiration to students and teachers from the urban sector itself, as happens in countries of the world with highly developed education systems. I do not think I am just being utopian.         
	When I go back to my old memories of Europe, Japan and the United States of America, most of it of 50 years ago, I see that the paradigm of factory-based industrialization was already rapidly changing before ones very eyes. The small had always been beautiful. Now, increasingly, thanks to the convergence of different kinds of modern technology, the small have started competing with the large on equal terms, often beating them at their own games. These are the modern Davids of the countryside fighting the urban Goliath. Now you can find even the most modern tiny industries, be it watch-making in Switzerland or production of other beautiful and highly valued things of modern civilized life in Japan and elsewhere, all successfully absorbing the new IT-driven technologies, but seemingly operating as of old, from the traditional rural settings.        
	But not only the nano-sized enterprises of today but also large ventures had found it profitable to use new techniques and technologies over a century back, disregarding the then-dominant factory paradigm, to evolve, for example, what the Americans call the agriculture industry. All such activities had been located  and in many cases, had to be located  in the rural sector.         
	Take the service economy. With the fantastic reach of the internet, almost any service you could provide from a big-city office could be provided from a village too if only you knew how. These positive things about the far-flung rural societies you will not see  some of these, obviously, you cannot see  if you persist only with the large-factory, large-office paradigm invented during the great industrial revolutions of the past. We do not value enough the futuristic potentials of rural life. Therefore, we end up favouring even such clearly environment-polluting projects like producing thousands of small cars and selling the cars for personal use to people in the cities who should rather be taught how to live a better, richer and more meaningful civic life, wherever they live. The latter is exactly how people are responding to the needs of modern times in the most heavily industrialized and crowded places in the world. We must learn from their good practices. And that would mean looking at education in the future urban-friendly rural societies and the rural-friendly urban societies somewhat differently. The new-look education must be based on common access at all the portals and for all the people living anywhere.         
	In several studies, experts have found that we need not be worried so much about funding common-access education. But we need to worry a great deal more about the real cost of human (and associated physical) capital in building good schools, colleges and universities and, above all, good teachers and good students. We must try and reduce this cost by every possible way of real saving. One way of doing this is by providing opportunities of fast tracking for students in processes the students themselves can initiate. Basically, we have to accept that all the fast-tracking opportunities that save real costs do not depend on extraordinary talent in the normal sense of the term.         
	The types fit to be considered for fast-tracking that come to mind immediately are, first, academic achievers who could reach their chosen professions faster starting later or finishing earlier; second, serious students of high merit, who are prepared to work harder to go through school and college quickly, and enter high-quality manpower markets early; and third, serious students of average merit, who would gladly put in extra work to pass out earlier so they could join the mid-level workforce sooner. If pursued systematically, the provision for substantial fast tracking will not only reduce costs but also encourage quality. I dare to predict that this would gradually change the work ethic in schools and colleges for the better.               
	Funnily, these are not all new ideas. In our own older system you had double, even triple, promotions. Some of my most outstanding students who graduated in the 1950s could, and did, make their mark in all fields very early. Their counterparts, coming 50 years later, take much longer for no fault of theirs. They start compulsorily at Class I as five-plus or six-year-olds, and would be routinely denied chances of arriving at the workplace already prepared, but young. If they have to, or want to, start later, or ever take a break and spend a year or two doing good elsewhere, they will only carry a black mark. Yet these are the routine options in most educationally advanced nations. These are legitimate, not just second-chance, access routes. By denying these options, we have managed to shut ourselves out from responding to the demands of a changing world. To be world-class, we have to buy back the Indian greats from the world market using all available means of persuasion  if we can. But perhaps more important, we have to try and keep (or entice back home) our own younger, would-be celebrities. If that does not work, nothing else will.         
	Rome was not built in a day. Just soothing announcements in Parliament of planting two dozen seedling world-class universities (including the new Central ones) on unproven soil, and without world-class faculties and research students, can only make our nation the laughing stock of the global academia. Whom are we deceiving by these moves but ourselves?

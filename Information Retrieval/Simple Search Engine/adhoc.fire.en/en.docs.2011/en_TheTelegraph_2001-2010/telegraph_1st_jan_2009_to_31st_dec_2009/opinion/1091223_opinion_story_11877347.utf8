	Most languages but English, I noted two weeks ago, give gender-labels to the names of things that in the real world have no gender. Or even wrongly label things that do. Thus in German, the girl is das Mdchen, a neuter noun. (And in Latin-born languages, add male chauvinists, heart is masculine, but reason feminine).        
	Does it matter?, asks a reader  maybe, like native English-speakers, too content with her own largely gender-free language to worry about others. Yes, Ms Banerji, it matters. Why? The short answer, a friend tells me, is Try learning Tamil, and youll know. But lets not incite inter-state discord; Ill stick to Europe. Yes indeed, linguistic gender, like real-world sex, greatly complicates life.        
	Germans, for example, have to use der, die and das  masculine, feminine and neuter  for our simple the; and likewise for a/an. And likewise in other languages. But worse follows. For a start, languages that inflect their nouns often have different gender-dependent endings for each of their several cases of the noun. Thats a lot to learn.        
	Theres more. Adjectives must fit the gender of the noun they apply to, and they too may vary. This brings grief and woe to foreigners  indeed to many native children learning their own tongue. You want to say that the beaches of France are beautiful? The beaches, no problem: les plages  you neednt know what gender plage is, because the plural les goes for both. But oh yes you do: are these beaches beaux or belles? (Belles, in fact, but how can you tell?)        
	More grief if youre unsure of your grammar. A smiling Frenchwoman is une femme souriante, with a feminine -e added to souriant. But one smiling at her husband is une femme souriant  son mari, because this souriant is no adjective but a gender-free part of a verb.        
	And whats this son mari? Isnt son a masculine form, how can it mean not his but her? Masculine it is, but it too has to agree with the noun it applies to. More woe. Le mari aime sa maitresse  et son chat. The husband loves his mistress, fair enough, this is France. But is it his cat or her cat that he also loves? Lets hope they share one, because French cant tell his from her, unless it adds further words.        
	Now back to the Germans. Does das Mdchen need neuter-looking adjectives? Or ones showing that she is, after all, a girl? Im told  Ive met German girls in my time, but happily never ones who spoke only German  that the answer is neuter-looking, unlike the girls. Ah, but go to Italy, where the polite word for you is lei. Its a feminine word, she, by origin (and still also used for she )  but not one to ally with feminine adjectives, if the Italian youre talking to is a man.        
	Enough, you cry, Ms Banerji? Theres more. In Russian not only must adjectives agree in gender (and Russian has three) with the noun, but past tenses of verbs with the subject thereof. And in Arabic and Farsi, other tenses of the verb as well. Hindi, my friend tells me, goes even further: it may require the verb to agree with its object instead of subject. Enough? No, theres worse still: in some languages, such rules, quite recently, have altered....        
	Two weeks ago, I gave thanks that English, for all its other lunacies, had escaped most of the horrors of gender. Point proved?

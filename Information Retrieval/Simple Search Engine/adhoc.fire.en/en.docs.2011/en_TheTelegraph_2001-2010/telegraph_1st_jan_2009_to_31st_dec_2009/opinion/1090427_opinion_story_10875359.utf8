                                                                                                                 NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH                                  GWYNNE DYER                              
	The great virtue of a maverick like the Israeli foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, is that there is none of the usual pussy-footing around. He says exactly what he thinks. In a recent interview with a Russian newspaper, he said three, quite interesting, things. His first remark swept aside several months of public fretting in Israel about whether Barack Obama would try to push the countrys new right-wing government into making concessions to the Palestinians on settlements and sovereignty that it does not want to make. The Obama administration will only put forth new peace initiatives if Israel wants it to, said Lieberman.        
	Lieberman clearly believes that the new US president has accepted that there will be no progress towards a two-state solution under Binyamin Netanyahus government. Obama will go through the motions of seeking an Israeli-Palestinian peace, as every American president is obliged to, but he will not waste any of his valuable political capital trying to make Netanyahu go where he does not want to.        
	The second thing Lieberman said was more surprising, for he has spent the past few years talking up Iran and its alleged nuclear weapons programme as the greatest threat to Israels security. Now, suddenly, he has relegated Iran to second place, promoting Afpak to first place. Pakistan is nuclear and unstable, and Afghanistan is faced with a potential Taliban takeover, he said, and the combination form a contiguous area of radicalism ruled in the spirit of bin Laden.        
	This is hogwash, because neither Pakistan nor Afghanistan is currently ruled in the spirit of bin Laden. Afghanistan is governed by Hamid Karzai, chosen for the job by the United States of America after the 2001 invasion (though much of the Pashtun-populated south and south-east is controlled by the Taliban-led insurgency). Pakistan has a democratically elected civilian government (though the war in Afghanistan has radicalized the Pashtun-majority regions of Pakistan, and Pakistans government is making highly controversial concessions to the Pakistani Taliban.)                
	Hogwash again        
	But it is interesting hogwash, because the Taliban could win power in Afghanistan, and nobody knows what line the military will adopt when it takes back power in Pakistan. It is imaginable that Afpak could pose that kind of threat to Israel in the future, although nobody can say how likely it is. It is doubly interesting because it tells us what Israeli strategists are thinking. Why has Lieberman changed his position on the most important strategic threat to Israel? Because he has just become foreign minister, and had all the strategic briefings that incoming foreign ministers get. So now he knows what the general staff and professional diplomats think.        
	In that case, why does Israeli diplomacy and propaganda put all the public emphasis on Iran? Because there is no need to convince the US of the need for military action in Afghanistan, where it is fully committed, nor of the dangers that a collapse of the current political order in Pakistan would unleash. The Obama administration is not committed to military action against Iran, nor are US intelligence agencies even convinced that Iran is working on nuclear weapons now. So thats where the pressure needs to be applied.        
	That is the real thinking of the Israeli military and foreign policy establishment, and it means that Lieberman should still be touting the Iranian threat in public. But he is an unsubtle sort of guy, so he just gives us the briefing verbatim. Then he says that this means Russia must be brought back into the picture. Its not clear if this reflects official thinking in Israel or just Liebermans own dependence on the votes of Russian-speaking immigrants to Israel. But it is safe to say that Israeli foreign policy is going to be very different under the new government.

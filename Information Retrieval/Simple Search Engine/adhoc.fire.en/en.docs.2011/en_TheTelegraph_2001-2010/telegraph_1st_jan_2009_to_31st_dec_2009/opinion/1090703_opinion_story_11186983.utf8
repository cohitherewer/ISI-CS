	A corkscrew is most useful: 																														 The travellers of Empire
    By Nicholas Murray
  Little, Brown, Rs 1,250
        In his Wanderings in Arabia Deserta (1888), the Victorian traveller, Charles Doughty, tries to simulate the Arabic speech pattern. The work is otherwise a remarkable mixture of Chaucerian and Elizabethan English. The idea to do something to resist the decadence of English language had been on his mind before he set off on his travels through north-west Arabia. This was only one of the many reasons one could think of in Victorian England to set off on journeys into the unknown, be it to Arabia, the distant East, into dark Africa, the Americas or the frozen seas around the Poles  journeys that sometimes extended for decades, entailed inconceivable hardships and took lives. The tales of most of these journeys made it to the pages of travelogues, and were breathlessly consumed by ardent readers at home who would either satiate themselves with details of places they would never venture into or enlist with the travel company of Thomas Cook to try and do the places as the writers had done them.        
	This was the high noon of the Empire, and the eyes that saw recorded images in a light very different from that of early travellers like Tavernier or Bernier whose motivations had been slightly different. They were men working in their individual capacities to make a small opening either for themselves or the trading company they worked for in alien kingdoms and hostile territories. The balance of power had changed by the time of the Empire. The travel-writers of Victorian England were self-conscious people, aware of the power they wielded over the world and their enormous responsibilities. Nicholas Murray says they seldom doubted their right to be where they were or the justice of the imperial civilizing mission. The link between the knowledge acquired and the power wielded had become intrinsic. There was no innocence.        
	Murray selects his writers not only because of their importance in the travel-writing of the period, but also because of their quirkiness. Which is why some big names are left out and the lesser-known included. Murray divides the body of work according to the regions, and some of the names  Richard Burton, Isabella Bird, Isabella Burton and also David Livingstone (picture)  crop up more than once. Burton, particularly, seems ubiquitous. This has partly to do with the enormous range of his exploits  in the Mediterranean, in Africa as also in America  and partly with Murrays particular dislike for this man. Murray finds him a colourful character, an accomplished scholar and a linguist, but holds him in deep suspicion. He hates Burtons unapologetic egotism, his mannered prose, his wordy bombast that cannot give deft sketches of people like William Palgraves prose. He finds Burton deceptive (unlike Charles Doughty), suspects his claims of having made it to Mecca (even if in disguise) and comes very close to holding him responsible for the unseemly controversy over John Spekes claims to the discovery of the source of the White Nile.        
	There can be no doubt about Burtons pomposity and his love for theatrics, but like many of the other travellers during his era, he was playing to the gallery. He was neither exceptional in his racial prejudices nor in his ambitiousness (even Livingstone, as Murray himself implies, is not free of this last vice). Victorian travellers, Murray acknowledges, were products of their age and culture, and some, like Burton, went on to powerfully determine and define these. As Edward Said put it, they reinvent themselves, as also the Orient.        
	The women travellers of Britannica were also products of their age, but from their accounts they seem peculiarly free of some of the typical prejudices of their time  sexual, for one. They are fiercely independent (and not merely the spinsters), adventurous, terribly opinionated and more critical of missionaries and the civilizing mission of imperialism than the men.        
	Helen Caddick undertook her journey in central Africa to rebel against the warning in every account of the region that women must not go there alone. She noticed the ravages wrought by Western influence, was disgusted that in Livingstones Scotch settlement nearly everyones name should start with Mac, took unsullied pleasure in the company of the natives (unlike so many other travellers) and amused herself by collecting shells by the shores of Lake Tanganyika while the villagers gaped at her. In Japan, Isabella Bird distinguished herself by staying off the beaten track and wandering to places where no Englishwoman had ever gone before. In India, Fanny Parks bought herself a small pinnace to set sail, all alone, from Allahabad to Agra and then to Delhi. And in Constantinople, Julia Pardoe, like Burton, donned a disguise to go to St Sophia, which no Christian eye had ever heretofore looked on        
	Women like Pardoe were aware of the distorting lenses of Orientalism and the great gap that existed between the outside visitor and the local culture. Pardoe even anticipated Said when she said, The European mind has become so imbued with ideas of Oriental mysteriousness, mysticism, and magnificence, and it has so long [been] accustomed to pillow its faith on the marvels and metaphors of tourists, that it is to be doubted whether it will willingly cast off its old associations, and suffer itself to be undeceived.        
	Associations, as we see, persist. Which is why Murray wonders whether Clara Bromley  who had visited north America and commented that the progressive and free black population of this rapidly advancing country was like a lot of baboons got up as travestie on men and women  could be brought as a witness in any tribunal of inquiry into whether or not travel broadens the mind. And not merely Bromley, Isabella Bird, that pioneering traveller in Japan who showed enormous empathy in her dealings with and portrayal of the Japanese, also felt a lot of difficulty in associating with the Negresses of north America, particularly in managing a screaming infant so awfully ugly, so much like a black ape that I was obliged while I held it to avert my eyes from it, lest in a sudden fit of foolish prejudice and disgust I should let it fall.        
	Murray uses quotations from the writings to explicate a particular point, to show the heightened literary sensitivity of any traveller, to shock or to amuse. Take Mary Kingsleys observations on a particular native prince called Makaga in west Africa who appeared to her to be an Englishman who had from some misfortune lost his trousers and been compelled to replace them with a highly ornamental table-cloth. The quotations, together with Murrays account of the life and the career of the travellers, and his solid but free-flowing analyses, make up the short chapters in this book. Murray also ends each section with a pithy discourse on a particular subject that might range from loaded Orientalism to the growth of tourism and travel-guides and the first experiences on the camel. They are called digressions, and are perfectly suited to Murrays enterprise as he gradually peels away the layer and layer of interests, official learning, institutional pressure, that covered the Orient as a subject matter (Said).                    CHIROSREE BASU

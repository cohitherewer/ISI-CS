	Sanjay Dutt is disappointed, but many lawyers and activists are pleased. The Supreme Court will not permit the film star to contest the Lok Sabha elections because he has been convicted of a serious offence. The courts bar on Mr Dutt is being seen as an example of the laws ability to prevent convicted persons from trying to get to Parliament. That, in accordance with this logic, would help prevent the criminalization of politics. There is nothing wrong with the reasoning, except that it leaves much unsaid. The law forbids anyone sentenced to more than two years in prison to contest elections till six years after his release. Mr Dutt, sentenced to six years, would probably not have been hopeful had there not been someone else before him. The former cricketer, Navjot Singh Sidhu, charged with manslaughter, had been allowed to contest the polls because the court stayed his conviction. Many may share Mr Dutts unexpressed puzzlement. Is cricket  or cricket commentary  a nobler calling than acting? Did Mr Sidhu gain the crucial brownie points by resigning his parliamentary seat without being compelled to do so? Do culpable homicide not amounting to murder and illegal possession of arms in connection with the 1993 blasts  Mr Dutts crime  rate so differently on the scale of seriousness? But the law in question talks about the length of prison-term, not the seriousness of the crime.         
	It is very reassuring when the law is seen to be implemented, but more reassurance would have been welcome. Barring one or two persons will not stop the criminalization of politics. What is needed is a clear and inclusive law that prevents every convicted person from contesting polls or retaining his seat if he is a member of parliament. A conviction by a lower court should be enough, even if an appeal is pending in a higher court. The courts can take a law forward in practice, case by case, as they have done in many areas  in environmental matters, or in the change of transport fuel to reduce pollution. Caution and conservatism are solid virtues, but they can scarcely be lauded when they dominate the application of law in the political arena. The one step forward will always be weakened by the two steps back taken earlier. A chance to make an unambiguous statement about the way in which the law barring Mr Dutt should invariably be applied has been lost.

                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Braveheart                  
	Sir  May 25 was a red letter day for all human rights activists of India as the apex court, at long last, granted bail to Binayak Sen, who had been lodged in a Chhattisgarh jail for two years (Bail for Maoist doctor after two years, May 26). Earlier, on May 12, Bhaswati Chakravorty had written an enlightening article, No country for the brave, on Binayak Sen that I had read with avid interest and enjoyed immensely. All those who had read that article as well as every right-thinking citizen of the worlds largest democracy will surely hail the release of this iconic figure who had been detained in jail by the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Chhattisgarh government on allegedly trumped-up charges.           
	Sen, an award-winning paediatrician and the vice president of the Peoples Union for Civil Liberties, was jailed on May 14, 2007. He was accused of carrying a letter for the Maoist leader, Narayan Sanyal, who was then lodged in jail. There has been a global campaign for the release of the ailing Sen, with the noted thinker Noam Chomsky and 22 Nobel laureates joining human rights groups in sending petitions to the Indian government. But all appeals fell on deaf ears. Last year, a petition sent to the president and the prime minister by scholars, doctors, and activists on Sens behalf was also of no avail. No wonder that Sens wife, Ilina Sen, who had been running from pillar to post for her husbands release, felt relieved when justice, though delayed, was delivered at last on May 25.          
	What comment does the case of Sen make on Indias democratic credentials? The fact that the issue of Sens release order coincided with the successful completion of the Lok Sabha polls does not lessen the magnitude of the state governments fault in arbitrarily exercising its power to control the lives of its citizens. There is much in the Indian democracy of which we can be justifiably proud. At the same time, it is shameful to see the authorities displaying an unexplained vengefulness towards social activists. Such an attitude of the State defiles democracy. Victims such as Sen have felt humiliated and traumatized, their agony no doubt compounded by the conspicuous absence of an impartial system to which they could appeal for justice.          
	Sen and his wife had started a voluntary organization called Rupantar that trains health workers and supervises their work in the villages of Chhattisgarh. Sen regularly visited remote tribal villages, looking after and healing the poor. He had been untiring in his efforts to set up village-based laboratories, which would be able to diagnose cases of malaria promptly and so start the process of curing its victims. His success in this venture as well as his other initiatives were widely applauded in health circles. Having worked closely with the rural poor, Sen had his own beliefs regarding the causes of their misery. The government might have disagreed with his position. It could also have challenged his views openly and fought him according to the laws of the country. Unfortunately, it took the unjustified step of putting him behind the bars instead for two years.          
	The distinguished doctor has suffered enough anguish during his prolonged detention. The new government installed at the Centre with an emphatic public mandate would hopefully ensure that the judiciary is under no circumstances politicized. The people of a democratic State, especially those as dedicated to its betterment as Sen is, should not be disgraced by its institutions.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  It is appalling that the vice president of the PUCL, Binayak Sen, a paediatrician who has spent three decades treating the poor in the remotest parts of the country, had to languish in a Raipur jail for two years for alleged collaboration with the Maoists. Sen was released on a personal bond of Rs 100,000 as decided by a local court following an order from the Supreme Court. Now that the Supreme Court has granted Sen bail, will justice prevail and the charges against the doctor be removed ultimately?           
	With his impeccable track record of selfless service among the poor, Sen is the kind of person who inspires people, who have never thought of civil liberties, to campaign for his freedom. It is a pity that in states like Chhattisgarh, the ruling party, which seems to lack all humanitarian values, has the final say on everything. How many times will the Supreme Court come to the rescue of the victims of State power? The fate of a human rights activist like Sen reminds us of the rot within the worlds most populous democracy.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Huge gaps          
	Sir  The new rule of the University Grants Commission making the national and state level eligibility tests mandatory for college lecturers with exemption only to holders of PhD degrees (Tougher PhD norms kick in, May 29) has left MPhil researchers at the edge of desperation. The UGCs strategy of altering its position in relation to PhD every year is proving to be a nuisance for research scholars. I sincerely appreciate the UGCs plans to raise the standards of PhD and MPhil theses, but I must say that its methodology is unipolar and inadequate.          
	A research has a tripartite structure based on the researchers aptitude, involvement of the supervisor, and monetary assistance.The UGC has not bothered to increase the stipend amount even after the sixth pay commission. It also has not assessed the quality and quantity of guidance provided by the supervisors. Having pursued MA and MPhil from two different central universities, I have come to the conclusion that students who intend to do research must be trained in it right from their graduation.The UGC has been oblivious to the fact that there are actually very few professors in India who evaluate class assignments from the perspective of research methodology. Hence, when students appear for an MPhil or PhD screening test, their knowledge of research is still underdeveloped.           
	When the UGC demands professional commitment from scholars it should also provide them with practical help in return. It needs to arrange campus recruitment programmes for scholars on submission of their dissertations for employment not only in colleges but also in publishing and media houses. It is consoling to know that the UGC is aspiring towards uniform academic protocols but it should get rid of the inconsistencies within its system first.           
	Yours faithfully,

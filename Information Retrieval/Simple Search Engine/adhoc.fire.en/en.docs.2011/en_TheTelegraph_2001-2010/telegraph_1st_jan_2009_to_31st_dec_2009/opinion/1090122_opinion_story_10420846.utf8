                                                                                                                 MAN FOR ALL                                                    
	One mans words have left people wordless. The few minutes after noon on January 20, 2009, in Washington DC, were imbued with so much history as to become almost ineffable. History was made not only because Barack Obama was the first Afro-American to become the president of the United States of America. But history was also made because the people of the US and in other parts of the world were made to listen to a man who spoke with a rare clarity, honesty and compassion. Mr Obama, even though he is an extraordinarily powerful orator, did not indulge in empty rhetoric and false promises. Instead, he chose to tell his countrymen of the crisis that faces the US and of the rough journey that lies ahead. Not for a moment did he make the claim that he alone could turn it around within a short time. Mr Obama spoke of collective responsibility; he gave no time frame for the completion of the tasks. But he conveyed the confidence that the task would be done. Underlying Mr Obamas inaugural speech was a critique of past policies and past incompetence. But this was never abrasive. He spoke from his heart to the heart of the people of America who got back their dignity from their new president.        
	What was significant and poignant about Mr Obamas address was its inclusive character. He excluded nobody and spoke of the patchwork nature of US society as its strength. He thus spoke to everyone, irrespective of race, religion and place of origin. The point is important. The US cannot meet the crisis that confronts it through divisiveness. The renewal of the American nation, which is Mr Obamas overarching project, can only succeed if all are called to work under its banner. This could not but strike a profound chord in the hearts of some of those who heard him in India. Here, divisions  caste against caste, religion against religion, faction against faction and party against party  undo and undermine the national agenda. Indias plurality is not seen as Indias strength but as a basis for further division. Mr Obama declared that the world had changed and it was time the US changed with it. Did any member of the political class in India pay heed to that timely, if self-evident, declaration? The message of change for which everyone is responsible often falls on deaf years in India, especially in West Bengal. Indians and Bengalis, except on rare occasions, prefer insularity to their rich patchwork of plurality.

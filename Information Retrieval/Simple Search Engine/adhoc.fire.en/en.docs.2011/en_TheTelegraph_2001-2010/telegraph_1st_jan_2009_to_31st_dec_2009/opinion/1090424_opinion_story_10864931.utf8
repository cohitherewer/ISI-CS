                                                                                                                 SECURE CORNER                                                    
	When it does happen, no lies and no posturing can disguise the fact that a state government has failed to govern. Had the arrangements for polling in Lalgarh not been embarrassing proof of the West Bengal governments failure to handle any protest that the police and the Communist Party of India (Marxist)s cadre cannot beat down, they would have just been ridiculous. The Lok Sabha elections will take place in Lalgarh in booths crowded into four areas close to one another. The tribal protest that has reached a steady level of resistance since last November will not allow the police into any other part of this 100-square-kilometre area in the Binpur I community development block of West Midnapore. It seems to be a blessing for the government that a part of the tribal leadership wants the people to vote, if only to teach the CPI(M) a lesson. Else, even this arrangement may not have been possible. Apparently, thousands of voters will be brought to the booths by pre-arranged transport. The security forces will have to leave once polling is over; they have been given 12 Cinderella hours.         
	It has been months since the allegedly Maoist bomb attack on the chief ministers convoy, the result of an indisputable failure of the police to sanitize the route. The polices explosion of anger upon tribal villagers resulted in a spreading tide of popular protest and a blocking of routes to the area. Out of the protest grew the Peoples Committee against Police Atrocities that is the visible face of the movement. The governments ceaseless allegations of Maoist management have not been able to stifle the villagers rage at police violence and general deprivation. The government has been compelled to admit the truth of the villagers charges. Its logic, however, is incomprehensible. By accusing villagers, including schoolboys and pregnant women, of being Maoists, and by beating them up, it seems to be willing the Maoists to action, if only to give its charges substance. Apparently, anything will do as long as the government does not have to face its responsibilities, that of addressing the villagers anger and rooting out its causes. The polling arrangements are not just the sign of a failure of governance: they signify the governments moral cowardice. Crying wolf all the time may or may not make bogeys of Maoists, but it certainly will not make the peoples implacable resistance go away.

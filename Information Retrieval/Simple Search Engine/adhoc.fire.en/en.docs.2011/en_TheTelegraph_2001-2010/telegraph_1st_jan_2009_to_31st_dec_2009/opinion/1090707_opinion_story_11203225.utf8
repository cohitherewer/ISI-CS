The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | With the best kind of continuity
                                                                                                                 WITH THE BEST KIND OF CONTINUITY                              No false promises have been made in this budget and no unrealistic pictures painted. But collective political will would be required to implement the decisions, writes Shubhashis Gangopadhyay                         Uncertain barometer				                                       
	My first response, immediately after the finance minister had finished his budget speech, was that it is a good budget. As I looked deeper into the budget papers, my gut feeling was confirmed and I now feel that it is better than good. At the beginning of his speech, Pranab Mukherjee mentioned that the current government has been given a political mandate to ensure continuity and inclusive growth. He also mentioned that the youth, who form the majority of the Indian population, want to engage in the development process and harbour great expectations for their and the countrys future. The obvious question is: how far does the current budget address the mandate and expectations referred to by the finance minister? As I said at the outset, I think he has done a very good job of it.        
	So first, let us consider stability. Given our performance since 2004, last year was a rude awakening to what could happen to us in an environment where our economy is getting more and more globally integrated. Hence, one was afraid that the old arguments against opening up and liberalization will become more prominent in the ministers speech.               
	Luckily, that did not happen. Instead, the budget promises to continue with some major initiatives that were started during the United Progressive Alliances previous regime  the national rural employment guarantee scheme, Bharat Nirman, Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojna, and so on. For the last many years there has been continual talk of the introduction of tax codes that, however, never happened for one reason or another. The present budget commits to put it up for public viewing and discussion in the next 45 days. The computerization of tax collection and simplification of tax forms were being undertaken by the previous government and they will be implemented by the current government. At a more general level, the minister reiterated that he still believes that growth is necessary to generate greater revenue and that will allow greater expenditure on social welfare, as well as improve social security and generate more human capital.               
	It is difficult to maintain continuity with the past in a year when the economy is slowing down after four years of never-before-seen growth. On the other hand, the clamour for boosting the economy and, at the same time, reducing the deficit could have translated into greater government expenditure with increased taxes. That did not happen. Instead, things like the fringe benefit tax and the commodity transaction tax were abolished. That was no continuity, especially when both were introduced by his immediate predecessor. In other words, the finance minister did not trivialize continuity by focusing on the processes in the budget; instead, he focused on the continuity of objectives of the present and previous governments. Not surprisingly, therefore, he increased the excise back to eight per cent of commodities whose rates had been reduced to tackle the inflationary episode last year. He continued with reducing custom duties and rationalized duties in many of the other sectors. For instance, he got rid of the differential taxes between small and large cars and reduced the excise on petrol-driven trucks.         
	Of special significance is his decision on the tax levied on services used by exporters like those provided by goods transport agents. It allows for no taxes in some cases and self-assessment in others. This has been a constant source of irritation to exporters who have had to wait to get refunds and, obviously, that led to corruption and harassment. So, starting from the tax code, through rationalization and self-assessment and, the assurance to introduce a goods and services tax by April 1 next year, the finance minister has shown his commitment to maintaining a transparent and rational tax structure. It was heartening to see that he did not use the current global recession and domestic slowdown to disrupt the process that was started after 1991.        
	One set of issues that was raised by some commentators and politicians once the budget speech was concluded is the lack of announcements on the reform agenda. I have always maintained that there was too much that was expected from budget speeches. So much so that one wondered why we need ministries other than finance. The finance minister is not supposed to implement education reforms, health reforms, changes in petroleum pricing, and to build roads. There are ministries to take care of each of these sectors and the finance minister is only supposed to make money available for them if and when programmes are devised by them. I find it very strange that people wait for budget day to hear from the finance minister what other ministers should be plotting and planning everyday to serve their particular sectors. It would have been so much better if the same people took out one day of the year for each of these other ministers and put them under the scanner the same way they do all finance ministers who get up to present the budget.               
	One cannot talk about the budget without referring to the fiscal deficit in particular, and fiscal prudence in general. The deficit in the coming year has been budgeted at very high levels. Combined with the states, the figure is estimated to be at 11 per cent next year. This figure could actually go up if growth continues to be below seven per cent. To keep growth up, the general level of confidence about the Indian economy has to go up. That will happen if various steps hinted at by the finance minister are implemented by the government  rationalizing petroleum prices, public shareholding of government run companies, reorienting petroleum subsidies on the basis of nutrients, financial sector reforms, and so on. These are all political decisions and require the collective political will of his colleagues. The finance minister should be able to achieve these as the prime minister himself does not seem to be averse to many, if not all, of these.               
	People have described the finance minister as a practical person. I think that in addition to that, this is the budget of an honest finance minister; also of one who is a mature political person. No false promises have been made and no unrealistic pictures have been painted. Lurking within the budget speech are enough hints about where the minister expects the country to be.         
	One final point: the stock market seemed to react negatively to the budget speech. Stock markets are supposed to reflect the future; a negative reaction to the budget is, therefore, to be interpreted as a thumbs down for what the market players expect to happen in the economy after the budget is implemented. My only problem is that last year, in October, when the government came out with its estimate of industry growth for August, the market responded negatively since the August 2008 growth was substantially lower than expected. Here was a market that was responding to what happened more than a month before. How can it be a harbinger of the future when it is a simple reflection of what happened in the past? It is high time we stopped looking at our stock markets as a barometer to what is in store for us.       The author is Research Director, India Development Foundation.

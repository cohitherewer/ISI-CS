The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | the new pm
                                                                                                                 THE NEW PM                                                    
	The idea of India is more than an idea. It gets body from the people. And people have voted in favour of the Congress to bring it back to power, decisively, for another five years. Manmohan Singh in his second term as prime minister has the kind of support that he could not even have dreamt of during his first term. He has the backing of India. He is free of the compulsions of coalition politics. He is also free of Prakash Karat. Mr Singh revealed, during the Indo-US nuclear deal and the crisis it created, that he likes being his own man. This election has given him the opportunity to match his actions to his views. The new government should bear the special Mr Singh stamp. Compromises should be the exception and commitment to India the rule. What distinguishes Mr Singh as prime minister is his selfless work to build an India that is economically and socially vibrant and inclusive. He should ensure when he chooses his council of ministers that members of his core team share his vision and his dedication. One of Mr Singhs strengths is that he is never short on innovative policies. What he needs are colleagues who will be able to implement policies in their various areas and deliver results. Through his handling of the Indo-US nuclear deal and earlier when he was finance minister and had pioneered the economic reforms, Mr Singh demonstrated that policies need not be bereft of results.        
	Mr Singh must be only too aware that his re-entry into South Block may be free of Left baggage but he carries a heavy load of expectation. The expectation is that he will free himself of all constraints when he chooses his team. That he will continue the good work he has begun in the economic realm and carry forward the programme of economic reforms without jeopardizing the interests of the downtrodden. Mr Singh knows that India is an oasis of peace and stability in a neighbourhood that is engulfed in violence and instability. The foreign policy of his government has to be fine-tuned to meet the demands of the region as well as of those further afield. India has been poised to be a big player, politically and economically. Mr Singh must ensure that India does not remain perpetually poised and never quite in there permanently. On Mr Singh has fallen the mantle of Indias greatness: he has greatness thrust upon him.

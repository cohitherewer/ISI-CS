	The Curious Case of 221B: The Secret Notebooks of John H WATSON, MD By Partha Basu, HarperCollins, Rs 299        
	It is an ambitious juggling trick, and Partha Basu nearly pulls it off. The Curious Case of 221B: The Secret Notebooks of John H Watson, MD draws the reader in with its promise of secrets hidden beneath the scintillating romance of the Great Detective, quietly documented by Watson in three notebooks that have taken years to come to light. The provenance of the diaries is in itself a strange romance. The narrator of Basus unusual tale is Jit, whose parents had grown close to the ailing old doctor when they were in England long ago. Jit finds two of the notebooks and a letter from Watson giving them to his parents in a curlicued walnut-wood box.        
	He discovers the box among their things when he comes to empty their house after they have been killed by extremists in the Seventies. For Jit, it is like coming to know his parents anew, and not knowing them in the process. The mystery of their silence about their closeness to Watson and to Emma Hudson, the daughter of Sherlock Holmess long-suffering housekeeper, Mrs Hudson, and about the notebooks, is one that is never quite solved in the course of Basus story. But he makes up for it by offering other solutions to other hitherto unrevealed puzzles  the relationship between Mrs Hudson and Dr Watson, for example  and by creating a brilliant and high-principled Emma to form a bridge between the era of Holmes and Watson and that of a young man in India in the Seventies. Her mid-word in Watsons narratives is the voice of logic and modernity, and she raises questions about Conan Doyles, and then Watsons, narratives that destroy neatness and deny closure.        
	Basus real achievement lies in recreating Watsons voice, personality and style in the notebooks; perhaps it is this that he found irresistible. He works creatively on the logical extension of hints that Conan Doyle, voluntarily or not, left strewn about in his many-layered texts. Watson grows in loyalty, discretion, an unassuming intelligence, and a deep and genuine admiration for Holmes that induces him to gloss over, even suppress, the mans self-absorbed blindnesses and his most glaring failures. Holmess biggest errors are regarding women. Basu gives the apparently chauvinistic detective the comeuppance he deserves through the secrets Watson reveals  about Irene Adler, for example, or Frances Carfax, Violet de Merville or Kitty Winter. With back-stories and forward stories addressing impossibilities, cryptic allusions and evident errors in Conan Doyles narratives, quite a few famous tales, such as The Speckled Band, take on new dimensions, not always unexpected perhaps, but still interesting. That is the fun bit.        
	But poor Jit remains wooden, a little too trite: the old Conan Doyle trick does not work for Basu. Of the many new characters that now people the Holmes history, Emma and her young Parsi companion, Sooni, both of whom Jit meets in Richmond midway in the novel, are lively enough, but their relationship with Jit remains enigmatic, a continuation of the cross-cultural closeness of Watson with Jits parents  suggestive, yet never quite hitting the mark.        
	Basu reimagines relationships in colonial times, attempting to create a human network unrecorded in history that reaches the present through Emmas gift to Jit of the third notebook  the most problematic and richest of the lot, and on which she had to work the hardest. And it is this notebook that shows Basu at his most daring. Part of this text is about Watsons admiration for Holmes the fighter for justice  natural justice that is often perverted by law. The detective appears at his best in his campaign against the racist miscarriage of justice against the young lawyer, George Edalji, in which he supports Arthur Conan Doyle. Creator and created apply their extraordinary skills to collaborate in a righteous battle that had once made Conan Doyle famous.        
	So many voices, so many hands, so many mysteries and planes of reality: it is as if Basu is dismantling a puzzle through the multiple frames of the tales, through history, memory, unusual encounters, and the wicked slipperiness of the written word  a puzzle whose many pieces can never quite fit. He fleshes out the Holmes canon with Victorian realities that Conan Doyle merely glances at  tantra in India, for example, or the slave and ivory trade in Zanzibar. It is really quite clever in parts. But does the post-modern format demand such thumping banality at the end?                    BHASWATI CHAKRAVORTY

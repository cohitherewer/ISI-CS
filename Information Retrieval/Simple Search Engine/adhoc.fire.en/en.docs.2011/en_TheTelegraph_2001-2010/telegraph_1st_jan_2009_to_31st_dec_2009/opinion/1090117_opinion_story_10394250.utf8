	Crooks fall from the sky                  
	Sir  Many Indian millionaires own private aircraft, and after Satyam, some of them may also be investigated. I am worried that they may learn from Marcus Schrenker, the American businessman who faked his death by crashing his plane to escape charges of fraud (Pilot fakes own death, Jan 14). A deserted plane may fall on my house or on my head; it cannot be expected to crash into swamps all the time, especially since water-bodies are being filled up by realtors. Will insurance people pay up in such an eventuality?                    
	Yours faithfully,         Tapan Pal, Batanagar 
        
	Not in safe hands          
	Sir  The public interest litigation filed by former attorney-general and a Mumbai resident, Soli J. Sorabjee, has exposed the inadequacies of our security systems and the unpreparedness of the police in the face of terrorism (Glare on cops outdated guns, Dec 13). Citizens have a right to know why the police still use obsolete .303 rifles that were used in World War II, while the terrorists arsenal and networking systems rely on high-end technology. India is believed to have become a powerful nation and an economic giant, but ironically, its security forces must remain content with weapons dating back to 1950. The government should inform the citizens about the steps it is taking for their safety.          
	Even after the Mumbai attack, I find that major public places in Calcutta, such as metro stations and railway platforms, are manned by unarmed policemen, with a few .303-wielding personnel. Such lax surveillance offers no hope of preventing a repetition of the CST carnage. Perhaps no one expects a terror attack on Calcutta since it is deemed to be the terrorists haven and transit point.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Painful rides          
	Sir  On December 30, 2008, I travelled from New Delhi to Calcutta by the Howrah-Rajdhani Express. I boarded the Rajdhani for the first time with high expectations. But the ride turned out to be disheartening. The railways authority had issued a huge number of reservation against cancellation tickets. The coaches remained cramped with RAC passengers, more so because it was the holiday season. As a result, it became difficult for the passengers with confirmed reservations to find a place to sit during daytime.           
	Also, not a single security officer could be spotted throughout the journey. This was shocking, considering the repeated terrorist attacks in the country. Besides, the train was not cleaned even once.           
	I hope that the railway authorities would take note of these issues, since we pay a heavy sum for a comfortable ride on the Rajdhani.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Nimai Chatterjee, Calcutta

                
	Sir  A number of passengers from the northern and southern suburbs of Calcutta travel everyday from Howrah to Purulia. One needs at least two to three hours to reach Howrah station by train or bus from these areas even when transport movement is normal. To lessen the commuters hassle and delay, the railway authorities should introduce a direct fast passenger train between Sealdah and Purulia via Naihati, Bandel, Burdwan, Asansol and Adra. The route of the Sealdah-Burdwan local may also be extended up to Purulia. The electric multiple unit coaches should be replaced by the ones with toilets attached for long-distance passengers. Between Naihati and Asansol, the train may halt only at some important stations.          
	It will be a great help if more such inter-city trains run from morning till night everyday on other routes as well.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Anupam Ray, Calcutta

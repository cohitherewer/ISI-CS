The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Out in the Cold
                                                                            Wednesday , November 18 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                              OUT IN THE COLD                                  Sumanta Sen                              
	Marxists should have learnt from their experience in Assam and partly in Tripura that ethnic consolidation stands in the way of bringing together the masses along class lines. But they did not, apparently, and there were a few smiles in Calcutta when tribals in the Dooars stood up against the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha as it sought to extend its influence in their homeland. The smiles should now disappear as the Kalchini bypoll results show that the tribals, under the umbrella of the Akhil Bharatiya Adivasi Vikas Parishad, have an agenda of their own which does not include coming to the aid of the Left Front. By winning, the Parishad has spoilt the party for the Front constituent, the Revolutionary Socialist Party, and helped the GJM to emerge as a surprise winner. So in this particular constituency, it was tribal consolidation versus Nepalese consolidation, and class considerations did not feature in the minds of the people.        
	Tribal consolidation is a new feature in the states political life. There has always been the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, but it could never cut much ice and, at present, it is a divided house. In the Dooars, however, it is clear that tribals have come together in a much more meaningful manner and it will be very surprising if the idea does not catch on in the districts of Purulia, Bankura and West Midnapur. Right now, these are Maoist lands but an outfit like the Adivasi Vikas Parishad can always attract notice as it talks of tribal rights without any call for armed action. The ruling Leftists may well say they are all for tribal rights but they do not really have much to show for their sincerity. Indeed, if the Adivasi Vikas Parishad does try to spread out, then the tribal population may have to choose be between it and the Communist Party of India (Maoist). Out in the cold will be the Communist Party of India (Marxist), as also the Congress and the Trinamul Congress at Kalchini, unless, of course, the latter can work out a deal with the tribal outfits.                
	Future trouble        
	The scenario in the Dooars brings Tripura to mind, not because of any similarity but because of dissimilarity. In that northeastern state also, ethnicity had reared its head but could not last because of the presence of the Ganamukti Parishad, the militant tribal body of the CPI(M) which, in its earlier avatar as the Upajati Mukti Parishad, had waged a guerrilla warfare in the late Forties against the rulers of Agartala. The West Bengal Marxists never fought any such battle, never thought of having any organization with ethnic overtones among tribals.         
	In north Bengal, tribal consolidation may not be restricted only to the tea garden labourers or to those living in the hamlets that dot the forests around. For long, there has been unrest among the Rajbansi and Koch tribals which has led to the birth of the Kamtapur Peoples Party, the outlawed Kamtapur Liberation Organization and the Greater Cooch Behar movement. The people involved are also adivasis and a larger coming together of tribals may well be in the offing. It is not without any significance that the GJM is in touch with the Kamtapuris.        
	The possibility of the emergence of such a scenario makes the Kalchini result that much more important. True, the GJM and the Adivasi Vikas Parishad have fought each other, but that dividing line may well disappear if the call is for a larger ethnic block. And Kalchini is not an isolated phenomenon. At Rajganj, the TMC was supported by the GJM with whatever support it enjoys there. So it is not as if the GJM is looking for a working relationship only with other ethnic groups. For the Opposition parties, the situation may be pleasing at the moment but should not allow any long-term solace. Ethnic unrest has never helped any country in the world.

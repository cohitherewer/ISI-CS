	Breasts are an obsession with women, and they find it important to present these organs appropriately to the world. Since the bra is a vital appurtenance of femininity, wearing it, or not wearing it, is not only a matter of comfort but is also a statement.        
	The garment, paradoxically, serves two purposes  of modest suppression and of unabashed revelation. In the West, the bra is placed more in an erotic context. But in India, the notion of sexuality it represents is either of a womans most private space hidden from the public gaze, or else of crude display. Rape scenes in Hindi films typically show the victim in a white bra, signifying the strict censorship of displays of nudity, while showing the next best thing to the breasts themselves. Somehow, the bra has never been quite simple. It once freed women from the restraints of the corset, but was later burnt in public as a symbol of oppression.        
	Funnily enough, the term, brassiere, comes from a military term meaning arm protector. A historic mention of the brassiere in the new sense in Vogue in 1909 changed its meaning forever. In 1910, a young girl bought a sheer evening gown. The corset stuck out, so the girl, as an emergency measure, used two hankies sewn together with ribbons to hold her breasts in place. She was Mary Phelps Jacob, the inventor of the backless brassiere, which she patented in 1914.         
	This was the first case of the over-the-shoulder boulder holder being patented. But even as far back as in 2,500 BC, Minoan warrior women in Crete wore a garment that shoved the breasts upward. It is hard to say whether it was meant to enhance beauty or to make a womans body lithe enough to fight battles.         
	From 450 BC onwards, Greek and Roman women started wearing a cloth-belt over their breasts to restrict or hide their growth. This changed into the chemise and then into the corset. Ultimately, the two world wars revolutionized the way women carried their breasts. During the first, women had to work in uniform in factories, prompting them to abandon the corset to gain greater flexibility. In the second, military women were required to wear bras and girdles for protection.        
	The first reference to the bra in India is found during King Harshavardhanas rule in Kashmir. References to a tight bodice known as the kanchuka are abundant in the literature of that period  in the Basavapurana, the Somnathacharita and the works of an ancient poet, Harihara. Although it is believed that stitched fabrics came to India with the Mughals, the 10th-century Leelavati Prabandha refers to tailored brassieres as a popular trend.         
	But the bra was never a compulsory garment for Indian women even 50 years back. British women in India always wore it, but Indian women saw it only as another article of clothing. It seems that our grandmothers had the choice that we never had. I have never seen my maternal grandmother wear it, whereas my paternal grandma would always wear it, but out of choice, not compulsion. Yet my mother and I always had to wear a bra, for, by then, wearing the garment and concealing it had become compulsory. I remember my teacher writing a note to my mother about my growing up. In a world without choice, that could mean only one thing.                    ADHEESHA SARKAR

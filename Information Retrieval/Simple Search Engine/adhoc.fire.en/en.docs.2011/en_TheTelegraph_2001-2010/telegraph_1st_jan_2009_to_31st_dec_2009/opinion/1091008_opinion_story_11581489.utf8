The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A deadly and bitter hatred
                                                                                                                 A DEADLY AND BITTER HATRED                                                                  
	In 1801, Coleridge added to the mystery of his mystifying poem, Christabel, which he had been composing over the last two or three years, by putting in a conclusion that, at first glance, had hardly anything to do with what had come before in the poem. The Conclusion to Part II speaks of A little child, a limber elf who so overwhelms his fathers heart with love that the latter at last/ Must needs express his loves excess/ With words of unmeant bitterness. Although it is difficult to be sure about the significance of these lines for the terrible tale of Christabels seduction by the succubus-like Geraldine, it might just hint at the tendency of innocence to attract evil by its very state of being. It is precisely the purity of Christabel that may have tempted Geraldine to indelibly mark the girls body and mind with the seal of [her] sorrow.         
	The Victorian Age was the first to see Londons underbelly of thieves, pickpockets, murderers and kidnappers come alive in the national press. Relentless media scrutiny meant that not only were the rookeries exposed to the public gaze but also that the middle-class home, hitherto the sanctified private sphere, was thrown open for peoples delectation. A number of child criminals came to light as a result. For the first time, people were forced to acknowledge that children could be much more than the embodiment of sweetness and light they were often made out to be. Even Dickens, who had made readers shed copious tears over the sorrows of the poor and helpless Oliver, created the devious brother-sister duo of Neville and Helena Landless in The Mystery of Edwin Drood (1870). The two run away repeatedly from their unhappy home, and Neville says, I have had, sir, from my earliest remembrance, to suppress a deadly and bitter hatred. This has made me secret and vengeful.         
	In his Introductory Lectures on Psycho-Analysis (1915-1917), Freud actually uses the term, evil, to describe the workings of childrens minds. This frightful evil is simply the initial, primitive, infantile part of mental life, which we can find in actual operation in children, but which, in part, we overlook in them on account of their small size, and which in part we do not take seriously since we do not expect any high ethical standard from children. In Freuds reading, the process of growing up involves the suppression of certain primitive impulses in order to gain acceptance into civil society. The wayward older Catherine in Bronts Wuthering Heights (1847) can be said, in this sense, never to have grown up because the child who had asked her father to bring back a whip for her from his trip abroad could, as a young woman, heedlessly fling the baby Hareton from her lap to run after Heathcliff in Chapter IX. But then, living on a windswept heath, cut off from human society, has certain advantages.         
	One has to consider, of course, the fact that Catherines story is narrated by the redoubtable Nelly Dean, and so is coloured by her sympathies and disapprovals. The uncertainties brought into the text by the narrative voice assume centre stage in Jamess The Turn of the Screw (1898), which might be a horror story about two sinister children or the hallucinatory ravings of a sexually repressed governess. The reader is exhorted, again and again, to look at Miles and Flora because, in the household servants eyes, their angelic beauty cancels out, as it were, the ominous hints about their pasts. But unlike a detective story where observation can lead the investigator to the truth, in The Turn of the Screw, no amount of analysis can help the readers unravel the secrets of the childrens hearts.         
	My friend recently told me how her little niece had broken into tears at the end of the reading of a fairy tale in which the prince survives terrible ordeals (which include being thrown into a boiling cauldron) to marry the princess. When the child was asked why she was crying since the hero had escaped unhurt, she sobbed and said, that is why. Apparently, she wanted the prince to die at least once to make the story worthwhile. Her niece has grown wicked, my friend concluded. I was reminded of the scene in Wuthering Heights where Catherine sits at the feet of her father, and glad that she is subdued for a while, Mr Earnshaw remarks, Why canst thou not always be a good lass, Cathy? At this, Catherine laughs and answers, Why cannot you always be a good man, father?                          ANUSUA MUKHERJEE

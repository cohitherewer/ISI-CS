The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | In the gallery of illusions
                                                                                                                 IN THE GALLERY OF ILLUSIONS                              Anusua Mukherjee      VISUAL ARTS                                                
	The exhibition, Rare Glimpse of Rare Art (Aug 3-12), at Chitrakoot Art Gallery was confounding, as exhibitions of old paintings at that gallery tend to be. Rare paintings by the likes of Nandalal Bose, Jamini Roy, Gaganendranath Tagore and Atul Bose were there all right. But precisely because the paintings were hitherto unseen works by such legendary painters, the viewer would have expected a little more information on them  their dates, for instance  than just the names of the painters for captions. This is more so because artists like Abanindranath Tagore (1871-1951) or Nicholas Roerich (1874-1947) shared space with Somnath Hore (1921-2006) and Anjolie Ela Menon (born 1940). When I asked the attendants at the gallery about the dates, I was instructed to look at the paintings closely to find out whether the artists have left the dates along with their signatures.         
	So I squinted at the canvases to get some idea of their age. Some paintings, like that of a man planting a sapling by Mukul Dey, had a date  1943  along with a dedication  Bina ke Mukul. The flesh tones in the watercolour looked surprisingly fresh for a painting over 60 years old. The ink-sketch of a nude with a bird by Menon was probably marked N.Y,89.         
	Lodged among the paintings was a signed photograph of Rabindranath Tagore sitting pensively on a chair on what looked like a stage, with a huge bouquet in front of him. There was a couplet in the poets hand describing the photograph as an image (protichhaya) of the body, which itself is a product of illusion (maya).        
	Equally fascinating was a beautiful sketch in ink of Calcuttas Armenian Church on a Sunday by Abanindranath Tagore. It formed a part of a letter, the text of which was below the sketch. Dated March 23, 1949, this piece of history recorded Abanindranaths mild exasperation at being asked to deliver a series of lectures on art at Calcutta University. He says that he does not like weighty (gaalbhora) titles such as D. Lit, which, presumably, had been conferred upon him by the university.        
	The two full-length portraits of courtesans by anonymous painters from the Company School made interesting comments on the sartorial style of women of that class in the 19th century. One of the pretty maids wore something like a dhoti matched with a blouse, keeping the midriff bare (picture). The male devotee of Kali in the oil painting from the Early Bengal School, with his red cap, looked like a Company soldier while the woman on the other side wore a corset under her sari. It is a pity that such valuable paintings were presented in a slipshod manner by the gallery.

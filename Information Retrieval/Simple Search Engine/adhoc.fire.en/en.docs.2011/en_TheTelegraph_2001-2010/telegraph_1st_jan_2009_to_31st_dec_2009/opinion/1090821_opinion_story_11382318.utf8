The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | From despair to hope
                                                                                                                 FROM DESPAIR TO HOPE                                  BONA FIDE - MALVIKA SINGH                              
	When Amartya Sen says, If we generate more public resources and use them with a better identification of the prevailing injustices in India, we could make a big change, everyone hails him for his words of wisdom, salutes his intellect, claps heartily. When Rahul Gandhi says exactly the same thing with a marginally different turn of phrase, and goes one step further by experiencing the ground reality, talking with the victims of injustice as he attempts to actually create a delivery system corresponding to the same idea, he is ridiculed by the press. Why? Because he is a young Congressman who happens to be a Gandhi, and the press have made up their mind to be sarcastic of his intentions on the basis of their personal political predilections. Sadly, they keep missing the real story.        
	It bothers me when erstwhile but recent cabinet ministers talk about empowering the people and keeping the bureaucracy from getting in the way of inclusive governance and growth. They should have made a strong issue of the lack of inclusive governance, and restructured the rigid and archaic bureaucracy when they were in power. Out of power, the best among them feel liberated to speak out in a way they never did when they were in the gaddi.         
	We are told that in critical Congress fora, debate is non-existent. If issues are raised and questions asked, devious and manipulating general secretaries, wanting only the status quo to live on, ask members to raise those questions and issues later, somewhere else, on some other occasion. Most interventions, whether positive or negative, are discouraged and the younger lot of people are shushed and asked to sit down. Senior leaders do not counter the put- down by general secretaries, giving the impression that they too are in agreement with zero dialogue. The general secretaries then feel empowered to strut about, doing everything in the name of the leader concerned.                
	Sticky hive        
	Meetings that have been reduced to an assembly roll-call where nothing of truth, importance or consequence is allowed to be raised by the very individuals who have destroyed the once energetic ethos of the Congress, need to be democratized urgently. The practice of keeping active members of the party away from interactions with the Congress president and the prime minister needs to be disallowed by the top brass. As long as this closed and exclusive access to the leadership continues, the various levels of corrupt practices  ranging from untrue reports, faulty and personalized distribution of tickets, placing stooges in critical positions to keep the cover, interference in government appointments, use of half -truths as sound information, to whips on differing opinions  the party will fossilize.        
	In this insidious atmosphere, ministers who do not have easy access to their bosses tend to fall prey to the seduction of the alter ego. Once in the loop, it is difficult for them to extricate themselves from the sticky hive that promises to be productive, to improve their careergraph. Coteries form, and a comfortable corruption falls into a familiar pattern. You scratch my back and I will yours becomes the main idea behind most political activities.        
	Will Rahul Gandhi and his generation sweep the place clean of all the old manipulating men and women who cannot win an election out there, the exclusive babus of the party who have held it to ransom by preventing all interaction? Will Rahul Gandhi bring back a democratic vitality to the Congress? Hope will replace despair only when that restructuring happens, and the space is cleared to house the ideas and aspirations of the thousands of young men and women who have recently joined the Youth Congress.

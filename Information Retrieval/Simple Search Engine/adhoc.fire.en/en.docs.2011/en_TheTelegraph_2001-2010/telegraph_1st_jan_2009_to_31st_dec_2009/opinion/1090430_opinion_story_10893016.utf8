The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Games Barney played with George
                                                                                                                 GAMES BARNEY PLAYED WITH GEORGE                                  While the former First Dog recalls his past, edgy pets reign in childhood homes and untamed animals rule the night                                            
	In the last couple of years of his presidency, George W. Bush usually went around with a defiant smirk on his face. By this time, this expression had become his armour against those who were not with him in the war on terror. Human rights activists ambushed him; journalists berated him; and his allies, though they behaved impeccably, were largely cynical. The ghost of a smile that hovered on his lips made him look like a ruin, and a very ignoble one at that.         
	Life with his family was not much better. For a good part of her career as the First Lady, his wife had looked inscrutable, with a fixed plastic smile that gave close competition to Cherie Blair. His twin daughters were in disgrace, charged with using a fake ID card to buy margaritas in a Texan bar even though they were under the legal drinking age of 21. At the end of hectic foreign tours, he had very little to look forward to. The tedious press conferences bored him; he had realized, to his embarrassment, that he was no good with names (having once mistaken the Taliban for an all-girl pop band), and grammar and syntax had never been his strong points. So, from the moment his chopper touched land, he would set his jaw firmly, and brace himself for the flashlights, the frenzied questions, his own defence of the indefensible...        
	The only noise that turned his face wobbly with delight was the divine woof of Barney and Miss Beazley, his Scottish terriers. As the two little black balls of fur raced to greet their master, the world would witness a very different Bush: warm, effusive, but as usual a little silly even at his most tender and affectionate. Later, he would also cuddle India, the cat, but unlike the excited yelping of Barney and Miss Beazley, India would behave with typical feline disdain.         
	Few understood him better than dear old Barney. He deeply loved this bundle of fur, even though his political strategist had once described the creature as a lump. Even Vladimir Putin, his rather temperamental friend who owned a black Labrador, considered Barney too small a dog for a world leader. But Barney was special; he had a website devoted to him. He even took to Spot, who had been born to Millie, the Senior Bushs favourite dog, whose autobiography had outsold her masters.        
	Like his master, Barney too felt the burden of history. So he wisely made no demands on his master, pranced and played with him with mindless joy when the two of them had a little time out together, and took him away for a few moments from dreadful terrorists, irascible heads of state and irate reporters. As he frolicked along the corridors of the White House or dozed on a rug next to Miss Beazley, he overheard bits of gossip, and trusted no one. He always felt protective towards his master. Barney had heard from whispered confidences that before him there had been Buddy, Bill Clintons brown Labrador, who, unfortunately did not get along with Socks, Bills daughters cat. So Socks Clinton had to go. Barney was not surprised. Although he had cordial relations with India, he remained aloof towards her. Barney could empathize with Buddy. No cat can ever be a mans best friend. Nor can cows, sheep, birds, donkey, alligators, opossums, hippopotami, guinea pigs, badgers, rams and silkworms  creatures who have enjoyed the distinction of being the First Pet in the history of the White House. If you want a friend in Washington, President Truman had said, get a dog.         
	When he was a puppy, Spot had told him how a dog had once saved the day for President Nixon. Spot had not been around then, but had picked up the story from the First Pet lore during his time at the White House. In 1952, Nixon made the famous Checkers Speech (named after his cocker spaniel) to defend himself over accusations of misusing political funds. The only campaign donation he resolutely refused to return was Checkers. His passion won the hearts of the people. Earlier, Franklin Roosevelt had rescued his Scottish terrier, Fala, from the Aleutian Islands at great expense. When criticized for wasteful expenditure, Roosevelt hit back by saying that Falas Scottish soul was furious.        
	In his final days at the White House, Barney would get dewy-eyed imagining these historic canine moments. Sometimes he quietly marvelled at Falas statue (the only one of a First Pet) in DC. He was tired of hearing his master being called a bad man; he didnt want to leave Washington for the dreary ranch in Texas; eight years at the Oval had made a big-city dog out of him. So, one day, he had had just enough. When a TV journalist bent down to stroke him as he was taking his siesta in the front parlour, Barney bit him. Days later, he drew blood from another PR woman. He was done with the paparazzi.        
	Now, in his retirement in Texan pastoral, he kept hearing the name Bo. The first time Barney saw Bo on TV, rolling over the green pastures that were once so close to his fur, he could not conceal his scorn for the bundle of cuteness with large love-me-do eyes. The little pups bounding energy filled him with cynical mirth. Four years (or, luck permitting, double that time) at the White House, and Bo would, in all likelihood, start baring his teeth at unsuspecting scribes as well. Being the most important dog in the world is not an easy job.                          SOMAK GHOSHAL

	The news that is filtering in from across our western border is sad and potentially treacherous for the subcontinent in particular, and for the world in general. It is clear that the monster, created over many decades by the Inter-Services Intelligence and the army in Pakistan (along with other international powers) to intervene illegally and amorally in troubled parts of our region in a determined effort to unnaturally aggravate realities on the ground, is today, in a changed world, out of control and has let loose unparalleled brutality and agony. It has disrupted growth and development, caused poverty and suffering, and prevented an intrinsically entrepreneurial people from competing and winning in a faltering world.        
	Rumours abound and the signs are ominous. We hear no sane or clear voices; we see impending chaos and confusion that will undoubtedly lead Pakistan into army rule, a form of governance it is used to and seems to be comfortable with. India is surrounded by brutalized and failed nations in which terror and force rule, and where ordinary people are unable to lead dignified lives.         
	India has internal problems of great magnitude that have not been addressed, and have therefore led to militant protests, resulting in a vast number of citizens demanding their rights. The region is in turmoil, governance is virtually non-existent, the lines that define right from wrong have blurred, good and the bad have merged, and values and ethics have diluted. South Asia has become a nesting ground for illegitimate activities used to blackmail, extort and terrorize. Societies that were plural and civilized are now being forced into polarized situations, and liberty and freedom are in peril.        
	It suits the slumping Western world to ensure that India and the other South Asian nations wallow in this political mess at this point in time. Economic growth here, despite the worldwide downturn, may have reduced by some percentage points, but our domestic needs and cultural characteristics of being able to live with shortages would have seen us through the tough period with far greater ease than what most other extravagant nations of the world would have to face and deal with.                
	Not for the people        
	It could have been a period of opportunity for us, a time to improve our weak infrastructure, make the correctives in our exclusive development policies and set the parameters correctly to absorb our traditional information technologies and skills into the mainstream economic process, employ people in nation-building activities and prepare to take on the world three to five years from now.        
	Instead, we have allowed devious manipulations and great games to overtake our needs. This is the right moment for us to assert ourselves as a regional power. We need some clear thinking that is free from the baggages of the past  Partition and its horrors, religious divisions, colonial elements that did not connect with our traditional cultural ethos, our intellectual framework and our plurality. India needs a leader who can restore and recreate the fundamentals that should ideally guide governance and civil society. But there seems to be no coming together as a strong and formidable group to take on other similar formations in the world.        
	Why are we allowing other world powers to ensure that we are defeated in our purpose to achieve growth? Why are the leaders in this region myopic and limited in their drive and passion to build a force to reckon with? Not that long ago, Gandhiji had electrified India. In 1947, we integrated feudal, princely states into a federal union, but the politician and the bureaucrat replaced the ruler and his wazir. Rulers nurtured their kingdoms but exploited their subjects. The present-day rulers exploit both the kingdom, which does not belong to them, and the people.

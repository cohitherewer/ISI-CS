	Lessons from history                  
	Sir  Krishnan Srinivasan has highlighted a problematic facet of the Indian psyche by pointing out that the attitude of Indians toward history is Manichean, insofar as it turns upon a rigid opposition of good and evil (The book and the BJP, Sept 9). Apart from Jaswant Singhs expulsion from the Bharatiya Janata Party for writing a book on Mohammad Ali Jinnah, he cites the example of the Maharashtra governments decision to spend crores on erecting a statue of Shivaji taller than the Statue of Liberty. A more amusing example, to my mind, is the recent renaming of Metro stations in Calcutta after icons such as Uttam Kumar.           
	The State finds it easy to enthrall people by appealing to history in support of its ideological practices. But in a democracy, even though every political party or establishment has its set ideology, it should be dynamic enough to adjust its policies and positions according to the economic and political issues.           
	The real problem is not the peoples propensity to interpret historical events to draw lessons for the present but the States use of history as an instrument to establish its political agenda. History has been turned into an vehicle of political opportunism by dishonest politicians. Unfortunately, the less educated are being influenced in their electoral choices by misguiding theories propagated by political forces. Under the circumstances, the real challenge for the media is to educate the people who are being exploited by the political class.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Krishnan Srinivasans article deserves praise. It was Jinnahs call of Direct Action Day that led to thousands of people being butchered. His dream of Pakistan was fulfilled at the expense of countless lives. Having achieved his goal of founding a nation for Muslims, Jinnah could act pious and declare that all Pakistanis, irrespective of their religious affiliation, are equals; but such a rhetoric is not enough to absolve him of responsibility for the riots prior to Partition          
	Being a citizen of a democratic country, Jaswant Singh has every right to express his opinion on Jinnah. By expelling Singh from the party and attempting to ban his book, the BJP and Narendra Modi, respectively, have violated the principle of freedom of expression. Srinivasan has rightly said that Indians are a far from tolerant people. It is a shame that a country which swears by democracy and liberality has seen to it that M.F. Husain feels unwelcome in his homeland and Taslima Nasreen is unable stay in Calcutta as a guest. Not the rule of law, but that of muscle seems to be reigning supreme in this land. It is time Indians learnt to appreciate and put into practice the maxim commonly attributed to Voltaire: I may not agree with what you say, but I will die fighting for your right to say it.          
	Yours faithfully,

	In cold blood          
	Sir  Mukul Kesavans article, Ishrat Jahans death (Sept 10), was thought-provoking and provided a good analysis of how fake encounters have evolved as a weapon in the coercive armoury of the State over the years. The police account of the killing of Ishrat Jahan, along with three others, has raised many doubts. The heinous act has not only resulted in several deaths but also caused untold misery to the victims families. The murders are a stark reminder of police brutality in the name of combating terrorism. It seems that nothing less than a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation will be able to throw light not only on Ishrats death, but also on similar cases of alleged fake encounters. Unless the people, the administration, and the police imbibe ethical values and act on them, such practices will continue in one form or the other.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Extra-judicial methods like encounter killings are often carried out by the police and these need to be curbed. Though at times it is difficult for the police to build up a watertight case against suspects on the basis of which they can be prosecuted, bumping terrorists off in encounters is not the ultimate solution. Public opinion may sway in favour of such episodes, especially after a terror attack, and against them during quieter periods. One feels sympathy for Ishrat Jahans family. It is unfortunate that she found herself at the wrong place at the wrong time.          
	Yours faithfully,        Ashok Kumar Ghosh,Calcutta                    
	Sir  A magisterial inquiry has termed Ishrat Jahans killing a fake encounter in a metropolitan court. (Gujarat cops killed girl for raise, Sept 8). Although the Gujarat High Court has stayed the ruling (Ishrat report, Sept 10), the verdict does not come as a surprise. Such killings have been taking place in Gujarat under the present dispensation in the last decade. The state also witnessed a pogrom against Muslims in 2002.           
	Ishrat Jahan and the three others killed with her were officially described as Lashkar-e-Toiba terrorists plotting to assassinate the chief minister, Narendra Modi. But the magisterial report says that they were killed by Gujarat police in a cold-blooded, pre-planned way for petty gains. It appears that for some Hindu zealots, every Muslim is a potential terrorist, and the idea of India propagated by some outfits such as the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh is that of a Hindurashtra in which only Hindus are patriotic and all others anti-India.                     
	Yours faithfully,

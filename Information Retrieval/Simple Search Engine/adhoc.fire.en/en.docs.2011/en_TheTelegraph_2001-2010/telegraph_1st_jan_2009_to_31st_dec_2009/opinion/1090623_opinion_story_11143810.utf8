The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | No forms to fill and nothing to get
                                                                                                                 NO FORMS TO FILL AND NOTHING TO GET                                  MIND THE GAP      The poor are often unlettered or too unexposed to avail themselves of State benefits                                                  
	For those who earn less than Rs 500, especially those who travel daily because they live in the village and work in the city, the Union railways minister has announced a scheme of monthly railway passes at Rs 20. This could free many from the daily terror of being caught travelling without a ticket. For women domestic workers (WDW) coming into the city everyday by train, this would be a great relief. A similar scheme had helped some of them earlier, although many could not afford to be away from work for all the days it took to collect the necessary official signatures.        
	But there is a stranger problem. All such schemes are tied in with the BPL card. In a recent survey of WDWs in a few districts of West Bengal, it was found that more than 50 per cent of the women did not have one. There was a certain apathy among those who knew about the card but did not have it. Others did not know about its existence and purpose. The new scheme of railway passes, too, requires a statement of income. Who is going to tell the beneficiaries that they have a right to concessions? Is that not part of the delivery process?        
	Today, the government of India is bristling with schemes to help the poor. Widows over 40, pregnant women over 19, old people over 60, baby girls and their mothers, poor people wishing to build houses  the government is willing to help them all if they have BPL cards and, in some cases, if they are from the scheduled castes or scheduled tribes. But the best intentions can go to waste here. The really poor are also most often unlettered and unexposed to the channels of communication through which a government might access them. Little penetrates their consciousness , because each of their days is crowded with activity that barely allows them to cling on to the means of life. If there is a scheme they might benefit from, it must be brought to them. It is the government that must find ways to inform them of what is available, and also find ways to minimize red tape.        
	That is almost unimaginable in a state like West Bengal. The state government and its local representatives seem to feel that the money allotted to each scheme is meant to be locked up, and those who dare claim it should not have known about it in the first place. If they have come to know about it by some untoward chance, they must come a-begging to the offices, and also run after political parties to get it.         
	In a small cluster of villages of a block in Birbhum district, a group of young men had taken it upon themselves to go from door to door informing villagers of what they could get. That was a few years ago. The young men kept visiting the gram panchayat and block development offices for the necessary forms, for they had identified the applicants. They were usually told there were not enough forms  the forms were just about to arrive, always  or that there was not enough money. Discovering that they were making enemies of their own people by, for example, being able to get the promised Rs 500 for one newborn girl when two girls had been born, and disability support for none, they withdrew. They are faced with pleas even today. In that area, the widow pension has reached less than two per cent of the target; only five people, of whom two are a couple, have received the old age pension, pregnant mothers do not receive the promised support, and girls grow up unaided by the State. The only scheme that has done some good is the Indira Awas Yojana, but it has also been around the longest. No one is accountable for the failure to deliver, except for volunteers who try to make things work. They are born to be scapegoats.                          BHASWATI CHAKRAVORTY

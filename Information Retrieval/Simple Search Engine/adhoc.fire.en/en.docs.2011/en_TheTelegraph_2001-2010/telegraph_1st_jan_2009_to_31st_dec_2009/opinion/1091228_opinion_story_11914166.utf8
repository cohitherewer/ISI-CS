                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        ONE YEAR ON                                                    
	A year ago, Israels catastrophic escalation of military action in Gaza had killed 1,400 Palestinians, which led to the collapse of one of the countless ceasefire agreements between the two neighbours. Under severe international pressure, Israel made a truce of sorts, brokered by Egypt and France. However, the terms set by Israel were utterly preposterous  to stop the demolition of Gaza for three hours every day to allow a humanitarian corridor to carry aid into the devastated strip of land. Meanwhile, the regime change in the United States of America raised hopes of peace, especially after Barack Obamas magnanimous overtures of friendship to the Muslim world. In September this year, Mr Obama met Binyamin Netanyahu, the ultra-nationalist Israeli prime minister, and Mahmoud Abbas, the equally uncompromising Palestinian president. They exchanged pleasantries, smiled for the press photographers, shook hands, then went home. That meeting, like the scores of joint discussions preceding it, proved to be the usual exercise in futility.        
	So, the killing of six Palestinians by Israelis last Saturday was something that was waiting to happen. Twelve months of relative stability must have felt unbearably long for Israel, which fell out of favour with many of its Western patrons, notably with Britain, for its intransigence last year. Emboldened by the mandate given to the rightwing parties in the general elections early this year, Mr Netanyahus government has unleashed a rule of terror with impunity. Israeli human rights activists, who are opposed to the war in Gaza, have been cruelly suppressed by the State. Now, with the fresh outbreak of violence instigated by Israel, Palestine may retaliate in kind  and that would put Middle East back to Square One.

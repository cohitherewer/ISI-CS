	Sri Lanka continues to be in a state of war months after its historic win over the Tamil Tigers. The war, this time, is being fought in the glass house of Sri Lankas establishment, and its effect is proving to be quite shattering. Sarath Fonseka, the army general who led the operation against the Tigers and was part of the war cabinet together with the president of Sri Lanka during that momentous period, has retired. His parting gift is a letter addressed to the president, Mahinda Rajapaksa, that levels serious charges against him. Apart from indicating how the president has tripped on the issues of human rights and media freedom, the letter deals, and in large parts, with how Mr Rajapaksa undermined the trust Mr Fonseka placed in him by sidelining the latter in the months following the war. The presidents betrayal of the war-hero is expected to be interpreted as his betrayal of the nation itself. The letter bears an undeniable mark of Mr Fonsekas self-importance, but this in itself is a reflection of the inordinate importance the Sinhala-predominant nation has come to attach to the war, which is perceived to have vanquished and subdued a troublesome minority. It is on the credit of waging this successful war that Mr Rajapaksa wagers his second coming as president. The Rajapaksa administration, quite naturally, has been rather ungenerous about sharing the victory with an army general, who is supposed to be a tool of the State. Unfortunately, Mr Fonseka thinks otherwise. So does the Opposition, which has now found in Mr Fonsekas rebellion a way not only to needle an overconfident government but also to overcome rancour and ego clashes. The United National Front, an alliance formed recently by the major Opposition parties, may now be dependent on Mr Fonseka to queer the pitch of the ruling combine by dividing its votes and, thereby, strengthening the hands of the United National Party leader, Ranil Wickremesinghe, who is waiting in the wings.        
	Mr Rajapaksa may not be frightened of Mr Fonseka yet. But he is aware of the threat Mr Fonseka poses. The announcement of the presidential elections, which were to have taken place at the summit of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party last Sunday, has suddenly been withheld. Were they to take place before the parliamentary polls in April, Mr Rajapaksa would have to contend with a number of spoilers in the game that has been so meticulously planned for him to win.

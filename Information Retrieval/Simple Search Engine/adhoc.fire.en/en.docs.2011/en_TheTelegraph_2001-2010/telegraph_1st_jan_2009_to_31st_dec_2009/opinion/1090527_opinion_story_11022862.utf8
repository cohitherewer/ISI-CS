The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Back to reforms
                                                                                                                 BACK TO REFORMS                                                    
	The last government of the present prime minister was not known for vision or activity. As if aware of this, the prime minister has announced a programme for the first hundred days of his new government. It is striking how much of the Congresss manifesto is missing from the programme. That is not unreasonable; the more urgent problems, such as the plight of the vehicle and airline industries, are bound to be tackled first. But it is difficult to miss the fact that all the populist promises that found a prominent place in the manifesto, such as empowerment of the weaker sections, welfare of farmers families and health security for all, have been put on the back burner. If, therefore, a sceptic were to conclude that the Congresss populism was just a way of selling itself to voters, he would be justified. This may upset someone who believes that parties should keep their word; but it would come as no surprise to those who understand the difference between politics and policy.        
	The other difference is that whereas costs and finance did not make an appearance at all in the manifesto, they form the warp and weft of the hundred days programme. This too is not surprising. Before stepping down, the government spent as if there was no tomorrow. At a time when revenues were booming, it exceeded them and incurred ever bigger deficits every year. When oil prices went up, it forced its oil companies to give ruinous subsidies to consumers. In short, it bought votes with public money. Now, as it returns to office, it finds the bills on the table. So it wants to sell 3G frequencies. It wants to call for bids for oil exploration licences. It wants its enterprises to make public issues. It wants to sell off the enormous stocks of foodgrains it built up in order to reward farmers with high prices. None of this is surprising. Last year it was preparing to shed responsibility, and so found irresponsibility profitable. Now that it is back in power, it cannot run away from responsibility.         
	When a party that has made mistakes begins to correct them, it should be welcomed and encouraged. But the mistakes it proposes to correct are a fraction of the mistakes it made. Every one of the first four years budgets of the last government was a portfolio full of errors. What the prime minister needs to do is not to reverse or clean up a few of his previous policies, but to rethink his entire previous policy framework. He needs to resume the mantle of a reformer.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | leave a monument alone
                                                                                                                 LEAVE A MONUMENT ALONE                                                          
	It is a shame that the Calcutta High Court has to point out what should have occurred to administrators and politicians in the first place. The Victoria Memorial Hall stands in the heart of Calcutta as a magnificent monument to the British raj. It should not be tampered with or extended in any manner. This sounds like common sense to most people, but not to those who are responsible for running the Victoria Memorial and to those who form the Calcutta Tercentenary Trust. The then governor of West Bengal and the chief minister of the state should never have given their consent to the project to build an extension to the Victoria Memorial within its grounds. The high court has stopped the project on environmental grounds. There are, however, other equally serious reasons for banning such a project.        
	The Victoria Memorial Hall is not just a museum. It is also a historical monument that commemorates a particular era of modern Indian history. Therefore, it cannot be treated as any other museum building. It is itself a part of history. This statement pertains not just to the building itself but to the grounds as well. It relates to the entire complex. The building, the garden, the water bodies, the trees form a complete whole and were planned as such. To replace or to add to any of these would be an act of vandalism since it would be tantamount to tampering with a piece of history. Lord Curzon conceived the Victoria Memorial as a tribute to Queen Victoria after her death. It stands today, even in independent India, not just as a memorial to Curzons queen but as a monument to, and of, the British raj. (It is significant that during the 30 years of Left rule in West Bengal when so many traces of British rule  from the very name of the city to street names to statues  have been erased or removed, there has been no proposal to rename the Victoria Memorial Hall.)        
	The Victoria Memorial Hall should retain its original character and stick to its original charter of being a historical museum that houses pictures and statues of men who played a prominent part in the making of the British empire in India. Visitors to the Hall have commented that it does not fulfil this purpose in the most efficient manner possible. The building itself needs repair and maintenance; the garden and the water bodies are not properly looked after; and many of its paintings are in dire need of preservation. This is not to deny that some work in preservation has been done. But this is not enough. More resources need to be used for this purpose and not for building an extension. The argument that more space is required to house and display the holdings is spurious. The Victoria Memorial in recent years has acquired a lot of stuff that is irrelevant to its original charter. Its purpose is not to serve as a museum of contemporary Indian art. The Victoria Memorial was built for the British raj. That should be what is today called its core competence. Let it show effectively that bit of Indian history for which it was made.

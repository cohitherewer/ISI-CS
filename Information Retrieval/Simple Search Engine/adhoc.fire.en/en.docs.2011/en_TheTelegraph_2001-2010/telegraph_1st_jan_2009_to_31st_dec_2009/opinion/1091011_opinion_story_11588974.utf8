	Keep it down                  
	Sir  Sound pollution reaches alarming levels during the Pujas, and the administration remains a silent spectator on most occasions. I am over 60 years old and suffer from a heart ailment. I genuinely fear for my life when the loudspeakers roar at full volume during the festive season. Not just old men and women but the health of the young is also adversely affected by such loud noise. I hope the administration takes note of this and introduces stringent measures to curb sound pollution during Kali Puja.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Sunil Biswas, Kanchrapara 

  Perfect melody            
	Sir  It is heartening to know that the renowned playback singer, Manna Dey, has been awarded the prestigious Dadasaheb Phalke award for 2007 for his outstanding contribution to Indian cinema. The singer, who is 90 years old, is one of the more deserving recipients of this award. Dey ruled Indian film music from 1950 to 1970. An immensely talented singer with a classical touch in his voice, Dey is the 11th person to win the award under the singer, musician or lyricist category. Music lovers will be delighted with the information and broadcasting ministrys decision to select Dey for an award which is considered to be the highest honour in Indian cinema.           
	Dey, one of the greatest playback singers in the Indian film industry, has sung more than 3,500 songs in his six-decade-long career. He has a golden voice and has belted out evergreen songs like Aye mere watan ke logon which are still a craze among people of all ages. Dey is undoubtedly a living legend who continues to inspire younger, talented, musicians.          
	Yours faithfully,        Suman Kukal,Chandigarh    
	Sir  Indian music- lovers are overjoyed that Manna Dey, the immortal voice behind songs such as Poochho na kaise and Zindagi kaisi hai paheli, has won the Dadasaheb Phalke award. Dey is a perfectionist, and whenever his flawless voice touched a song it went on to become a classic. He truly deserves the honour for his life-long achievement. He will receive the award, which comprises a Swarna Kamal, 10 lakh rupees as cash prize and a shawl, from the president, Pratibha Patil, at the National Film Awards function on October 21. Dey started his playback career with the film, Tamanna, in 1943. A recipient of both the Padma Shri and the Padma Bhushan, the popular films to which he lent his voice include Awaara, Do Bigha Zamin, Mera Naam Joker, Bobby, Zanjeer, Padosan and Sholay. Proof of his greatness and humility lies in his proclamation that the old must give way to the new.   
	Yours faithfully,

	Fair pay  
	Sir  Salman Khursheeds advice to corporates to refrain from paying vulgar salaries is uncalled for (Vulgar? But now within limits, Oct 7). Corporate companies pay high salaries to retain the best talents in the specific industry. Such employees play a critical role in helping companies earn profit, and the government, in turn, earns huge taxes and duties. Instead of advising corporates to cut down on salaries, the government should try to improve its own performance. It should not interfere in the functioning of corporate houses, which abide by the rules and seldom seek assistance from the public exchequer.          
	Yours faithfully,      
H.L. Chakraborty, Calcutta

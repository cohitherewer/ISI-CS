                                                                                                                 Troubled Periphery         Fifth Column - Gwynne Dyer                              
	The incidents in China are, simply put, a genocide. Theres no point in interpreting this otherwise, said Turkeys prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan recently. He was talking about the deaths of at least 184 people in the recent street violence in Xinjiang, the province that occupies the north-western corner of China.        
	A majority of Xinjiangs people are Uighurs who are Muslims and speak a language closely related to Turkish. So Erdogans comments were bound to appeal to his audience in Turkey. The Chinese government, predictably, condemned his charges as irresponsible and groundless. The Chinese government was right  but also terribly wrong.        
	It wasnt a genocide. The deaths of 184 people, for whatever reason, do not constitute a genocide. Erdogan was claiming that there had been a genocide against the Uighurs, but three-quarters of the people killed in the riots were Han Chinese. Genocide is a word that should only be used very precisely, and Erdogan owes Beijing an apology.        
	Even if the Chinese authorities exaggerated the number of Han dead and understated the Uighur death-toll, as Uighur nationalists abroad claim, there is no doubt that this violence started as an Uighur attack on Chinese immigrants. However, Beijing owes the Uighurs more than just an apology, for it is Chinese policy that drove them to such desperate measures.        
	The Chinese authorities genuinely believe that the development they have brought to Xinjiang has been for the Uighurs own good, even if it has also brought huge numbers of Han Chinese immigrants to the province. But they are certainly not distressed to see this sensitive frontier province become a place where a majority of the residents are instinctively loyal Han Chinese.                
	Bleak future        
	More importantly, they lack the cultural imagination to see that this process will be profoundly alienating for the Uighurs. It may sound preposterous, but most of the men who rule China simply could not come up with an answer to the question: Why dont they want to be Chinese? So if there are anti-Chinese riots in Xinjiang, it must be outside agitators stirring up our Uighurs. That is how Beijing explained the riots to itself and to the nation. Beijing had explained the even bloodier anti-Chinese riots in Tibet last year in the same way. Except that the outside agitator, on this occasion, was the Dalai Lama.        
	Whats more, most Chinese believe it. They have been schooled to believe that Xinjiang and Tibet have been integral parts of their country since time immemorial. They also believe the Uighurs and Tibetans who live in those places should be grateful for the development that has come to their provinces as a result of their membership in the Chinese nation.        
	The truth is that the Chinese empire first took effective control of Tibet and Xinjiang in the same period when the Russian empire was conquering the other Central Asian countries. Whatever vague claims to suzerainty Beijing can dredge up from the more distant past, they do not convince the Uighurs and the Tibetans themselves. They would cut loose from China instantly if they got the chance.        
	Its called decolonization, and China is the last hold-out. The only way it can ensure a different final outcome from that of the other empires is to swamp the local people with Han Chinese immigrants  and that, oddly enough, is the principal result of its development policies. The development creates an economy that the local people are not qualified to work in, and Chinese immigrants come in to fill those jobs instead. It is already ugly, and its probably going to get uglier. The repression needed to hold down Xinjiang and Tibet may lead to increased repression in China in general, and it will certainly lead to more violence in the colonies.

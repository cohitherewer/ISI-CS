	Keep up the good work                  
	Sir  The professionalism and efficiency shown by the Calcutta Police during the Durga Puja deserves appreciation. The entire force was out in full strength, with a clear focus on traffic and crowd management. The fact that there were no major untoward incidents proves the competence with which the police officers worked. Calcuttans would now only hope that the force continues the good work throughout the year and not just during the festive season; that no corruption prevails within the ranks, and the state police, too, discipline themselves.          
	Yours faithfully,         Sujan Bhattacharjee, Calcutta
        
	Crisis mismanaged          
	Sir  Andhra Pradesh is facing one of the worst floods ever (Swamped, after prayer for water, Oct 7). The country expects the government to protect the people there. But the administration has no disaster mitigation plan in place. There is no awareness among the people of what to do in an emergency. The floodwaters were rising, but people were not evacuated to safer locations. The officials have been reviewing the situation and issuing statements from Hyderabad. But ministers should be in the affected districts, rehabilitating the displaced and offering them relief. The state machinery must automatically swing into action. The administration sleeps all year and wakes up only when calamity strikes. The government must ask specialized teams to submit a detailed proposal for implementation.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
M.M. Kale, Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh 

                          
	Roadblock          
	Sir  If one travels around in India, one is bound to come across several illegal shrines on public paths, railway stations and bus stops. These obstruct the movement of traffic and pedestrians. They also hinder the setting up of new projects at those sites, as their removal often causes social conflict. The court has taken a positive step by curbing further construction of such places of worship (Bar on new shrines of all religions on roads, Sept 30). The court order has confirmed that the judiciary is all set to play a meaningful role in shaping a new and emerging India.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Md. Badruddin Ahmed, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  It has been a practice among some people to grab land for religious purposes and later to convert it into private property. Not only this, but government buildings, railway stations and airports often have various religious shrines built on their premises. This is not a very healthy sign, as construction of such structures often leads to communal tension. So the Supreme Court has passed a landmark judgment by enforcing a ban on unauthorized construction of places of worship in public places.           
	The Centre had earlier stalled the reviewing of existing structures till the Supreme Court took a final decision. But now the real test is whether or not the authorities will be able to ensure that this order is strictly implemented.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
B.K. Chatterjee, Faridabad

                
	Sir  The Supreme Court has rightly banned the construction of illegal places of worship. But I doubt if it will be enforced by the state governments, as religion is a very touchy subject. During the construction of the Metro in Delhi, religious places were spared even though they were obstacles to the project and needed to be demolished. The sole motive behind the construction of shrines is to grab public land for free. The only solution is to make it compulsory to register all existing religious places, for which a deadline may be issued, failing which the shrines must be removed.                    
	Yours faithfully,

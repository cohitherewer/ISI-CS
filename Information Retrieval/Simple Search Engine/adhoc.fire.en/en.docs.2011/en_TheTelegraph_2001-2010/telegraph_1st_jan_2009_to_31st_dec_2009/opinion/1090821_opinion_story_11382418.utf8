The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | On a legendary trail
                                                                                                                 ON A LEGENDARY TRAIL                                                      True genius                            
	Sunil Gavaskar: Crickets Little Master By Debashish Datta, Niyogi, Rs 995        
	Sunil Gavaskar: Crickets Little Master is another addition to the paeans of glory that trails the living legend. The man of phenomenal achievements has climbed numerous peaks on and off the field. He has plundered records, chastened bowlers, head-butted administrators and even criticized spectators. His exploits have been well documented over the years. But this coffee-table edition of about 300 pages is different.        
	Here the reader learns about their hero first-hand. From people who were with him when the actual incidents occurred. Milind Rege, Hemant Waingankar and Pradeep Vijayakar, former school and college mates, take the reader through Gavaskars passion for wrestling, the bunking of classes to attend the shooting of a film as an extra, the days of samosa and chai. Gavaskars early mentor, Vasu Paranjpe, speaks of his mimicry and innate simplicity. All these, and more, are narrated by the very people Gavaskar was with at various times.        
	There are innumerable might-have-beens in Gavaskars life: he could have easily become a fisher-womans son; nearly made his first-class debut for Bengal; a septic finger may have finished his career even before it had started. Kenia Jayantilal relates how Sir Gary took a blinder from him and dropped sitters from Gavaskar in their debut matches. Jayanta Chatterji and Raju Mehta, both close friends, have told anecdotes that underline Gavaskars modesty, integrity and popularity. Accounts of parents, friends and relatives, add authenticity to this commemorative volume.        
	Indian cricketers of all hues and habits have paid high tributes to a man who took Indian cricket and cricketers to hitherto unreachable heights. Cricketers from across the globe, such as Brearley, Botham, Ian Chappell, Glen Turner, John Wright, Arjuna Ranatunga and Dilip Mendis, have also paid homage to Gavaskar. Cricketers who paid tribute to Gavaskar from West Indies, apart from Gary Sobers, are Clive Lloyd, Viv Richards and Andy Roberts. From Pakistan, Hanif Mohammed, the original little master, Wasim Akram, Asif Iqbal, Zaheer Abbas, and Javed Miandad have shown their respect for Gavaskar in the pages of this book. One regret though. Why does this list not include Rohan Kanhai, the person whom Gavaskar idolized and after whom he named his son?        
	Milkha Singh, P. K. Banerjee, Vijay Amritraj, Prakash Padukone, Dibyendu Barua and Geet Sethi, among others, have also felt the urge to pen their tributes to the legend. Lata Mangeshkar and Manna Dey relate that they are big fans of his. While Manna Dey is yet to meet him, Lataji maintains that he sang very well when he lent his voice to a chorus. Mithun Chakrabarty takes pride in opening the bowling for Gavaskars team in Toronto, while Rajdeep Sardesai conveys that he actually led a club side that included Gavaskar. Cricket administrators, too, have contributed wholeheartedly, as have eminent sports columnists like Rajan Bala, John Woodcock, Tony Cozier and Ramchandra Guha.        
	The compiler of this volume is Debasish Dutta, whom Geoff Boycott describes as Sunils Shadow in the foreword. Dutta is a familiar name as a journalist and a popular man in the cricketing world. He deserves to be complimented for the Herculean task of getting 100 people to write their tributes to the legendary Sunil Gavaskar on his 60th birth anniversary. A mammoth task, but well conceived. True cricket fans should get hold of a copy of this book.                    RAJU MUKHERJI

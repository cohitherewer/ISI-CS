                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Forgotten stars                  
	Sir  P.T. Usha, the sprint queen, reportedly burst into tears in front of the media and alleged that she had been humiliated by the shabby treatment meted out to her in Bhopal during the 49th National Open Athletics Meet (Insulted, Usha breaks down, Oct 7). There is no denying the fact that sport lovers in India have been upset by the way Usha was treated. The Sports Authority of India and the Madhya Pradesh Athletics Federation, the organizers of the event, are to be blamed for the unfortunate episode.           
	A blame game has now begun as to who is responsible for Ushas ill treatment. The Union sports minister, M.S. Gill, has given a clean chit to SAI, but one cannot agree with him. Can a room that is shared with five other girls at the SAI hostel be considered as the best of accommodation? If so, he should make our ministers, S.M. Krishna and Shashi Tharoor, see this point as well. The Madhya Pradesh government has remained a mute spectator in this entire controversy. This only exposes the apathy of the authorities who are indifferent to sportsmen other than cricketers. Cricket players are accommodated in five-star hotels and paid huge money irrespective of their performance. Except the world cup win 26 years ago, and the triumph in the Twenty20 championship, Indian cricketers have accomplished very little. It is a pity that the country cannot see beyond cricket. Serious attention is not paid to other sports, nor are athletes properly cared for. The apathy towards Usha, who has put in a lifetime of effort to bring glory to the country, shows how little we care about athletes.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The manner in which P.T. Usha was treated in Bhopal can be considered as yet another blemish on Indian sports. If someone like Usha can be treated shabbily, one shudders to think how lesser athletes are treated in this country. For instance, there have been numerous reports in the past of hockey players having to put up with poor training facilities at the national camps.           
	But what took place in Bhopal was truly unprecedented, and the incident indicates the sorry state of affairs in certain kinds of sport in India. Gymnasts or athletes are not provided with minimal support in terms of equipment. The fact that they receive no media attention further reduces their level of motivation. Other sporting nations such as China or the United States of America provide their sportspersons with the most modern training and nutrition. Worse, very few in India are aware that the country has made it to the world group stage of the Davis Cup after 11 years, or Gaganjeet Bhullar, a young golfer, had registered a historic win at the Indonesian Open. Our hopes have been raised by the attention that is being given to the boxer, Vijender Singh, and the shuttler, Saina Nehwal, but this can be termed as an exception rather than the rule.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Old problem          
	Sir  Ragging is now very much a trend among senior students in colleges. They think it is their right to inflict excruciating pain on their juniors (Ragged fresher hangs himself, Oct 10). Nayan Adak, unable to forget the humiliation he suffered at the hands of his seniors, ended his life by hanging himself. Adak had tried to end his life earlier as well, but he recovered after being admitted to a hospital. However, he did not quite recover from the mental shock, and killed himself when he knew that he would have to rejoin college.          
	The director of the institute where Adak was a student, Rabindra Debnath, had stated that the charge of ragging was baseless. Debnaths reaction is proof of the nonchalance with which the authorities treat a serious matter such as ragging. Ragging is a culpable crime, and this cruel practice should be curbed at the earliest. Merely implementing rules will not change things. Rather, students who rag juniors should be sent for counselling.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Oindrila Thakur, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  It was distressing to learn that Nayan Adak committed suicide after being ragged in college. It appears that stringent measures that have been introduced to stop ragging in educational institutions are not having the desired effect. The human resource development minister must pass a law whereby ragging should fetch at least 10 years of imprisonment. This would stop the scourge that continues unabated.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  I was surprised to read about a reality show where celebrity couples try to play parents to toddlers who have been kept away from their real-life parents (Kid abuse glare on Rakhi show, Oct 3). The channel has responded to charges of neglect by stating that it will take appropriate steps to protect its broadcast rights. This is yet another example of channels stooping low to increase their TRPs.           
	The Convention on the Rights of the Child, adopted in the general assembly of the United Nations in 1989, is the first legally binding international instrument that considers rights of children as human rights. Article 9 of this document says, States Parties shall ensure that a child shall not be separated from his or her parents. But it is the biological parents, rather than the channel or the actors, who should be blamed for exploiting their newborns for money.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Tapan Pal, Batanagar

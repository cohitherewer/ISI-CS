The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A good divorce 
                                                                                                                 A GOOD DIVORCE                                                     
	Last year saw the high drama of Tata Nano in which West Bengal came out looking bedraggled. This summer sees the annual drama of people being deprived of electricity by their government precisely when they are tormented by heat and humidity. In the former case, the government was given a perfect alibi by its favourite enemy, Mamata Banerjee. In the latter case, it has only itself to blame, but has found an excuse  lack of suitable land on which to build power stations. That is actually the same excuse as for Nano, where there was lack of suitable land to build the factory. Any official process of land acquisition runs against opposition from heroic peasants according to some, enemies of the people according to others. This debate will go on forever into the future; both sides will win according to themselves and the people will lose each time.        
	But constructive solutions must be looked for, however unpalatable they may be to political contenders. One way would be for the two polar parties to sit down and work out a deal. It is impossible to predict what bribe the opposing party will settle for, but at least it is worth putting a figure on it. However, even after it is paid, there is no certainty that heroic peasants or workers will not sabotage land acquisition on their own. At that point, perfidy will be suspected on the part of the Opposition, and the trust required for any deal will evaporate.        
	That still leaves one other way for the government, namely to buy or lease the land by auction. Land in other states is being sold for non-agricultural use at extraordinary prices; a farmer with an acre or two can comfortably retire on the money. In other words, farmers are being paid to stop working and play games instead. Even though they elected communists time after time, the people of West Bengal are neither irrational nor unobservant. They can see that development betters the lot of people; what they want is a guarantee that it will better their own lot. So what the government may try is to put out a tender for land. It may set whatever conditions it likes  that there should be a certain minimum contiguous area, that it should be rectangular, that it should be in particular districts and not more than a certain distance from a main road, and so on. It should specify that the offer should come with the agreement of all involved, whether they own some of the land or not. But amongst the plots offered, it should buy the one offered at the lowest price, without fear or favour. No politics should enter the decision at that point  or any other for that matter. Bengals problems are due to the inextricable mixing of politics and economics; the faster they are divorced, the better.

	BURNING BRIGHT: IROM SHARMILA AND THE STRUGGLE FOR PEACE IN MANIPUR (Penguin, Rs 275) by Deepti Priya Mehrotra is an account of the life of Irom Sharmila Chanu, the indomitable crusader who stood up against the draconian Armed Forces Special Powers Act in Manipur. The AFSPA gives military and paramilitary forces the right to arrest, shoot and kill anyone suspected of untoward activities. The Act was most grievously misused in 2000 when ten citizens were killed by security forces in a village near Imphal. To protest against this merciless attack, Sharmila began an indefinite hunger-strike that continues till date. Although repeatedly arrested by the State and force-fed, she is resolved to carry on with her fast until the AFSPA is repealed. Deepti Priya Mehrotras excellent work puts Sharmilas valiant resolution in a social and political context. The author has documented various voices of dissent emanating from the Northeast in detail  from several underground groups to the Meira Paibis (a womens movement against all forms of violence) nothing escapes her sharp analysis. Several close portraits of important figures in Sharmilas life  the most striking being her centenarian grandmother, Irom Tonsija Devi  enhances the value of this work.                                
	CHILDREN OF OTHER WORLDS: EXPLOITATION IN THE GLOBAL MARKET (Earthcare, Rs 225) by Jeremy Seabrook begins by revisiting a familiar thesis that the satanic mills of the early industrial era in Britain have been relocated in the Third World. To study this claim, Seabrook chose to compare the lives of child workers in 19th-century Britain with those in 21st-century Bangladesh. Only the brilliant mind and luminous prose of Seabrook can do justice to the polemical import of such a survey. Not only does this book attest to Seabrooks prodigious reading on the subject, it is also based on a great deal of travelling and interviewing in the real world.                        
	BAD THINGS (HarperCollins, Rs 250) by Michael Marshall has a rather bland title for a well-written thriller. The novel is full of unexpected twists and turns. As John Henderson spends a lovely summer afternoon with his family in Black Ridge, Washington, tragedy strikes out of the blue. Johns little son, Scott, walks out onto the jetty over a lake and is seen no more. Three years go by before John gets an email from a stranger who claims to know what exactly happened to Scott. As John pursues the trail, a series of utterly bizarre and terrifying events take over his life.

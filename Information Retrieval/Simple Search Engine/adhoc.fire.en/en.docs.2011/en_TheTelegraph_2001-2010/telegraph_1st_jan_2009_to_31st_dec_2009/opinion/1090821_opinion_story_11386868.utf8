	Politicians are generally reluctant to admit failures and mistakes, not realizing that their unwillingness to face the truth only makes things worse. It was reassuring, therefore, that the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, was honest in expressing his worries over the security situation in the Northeast during his meeting with chief ministers earlier this week. His candour is striking for another reason. Two of the three states, where he thought the situation was problematic, are ruled by the Congress. But the fact did nothing to stop him from criticizing the governments in Assam and Manipur for their failures in dealing with violent insurgencies. It is public knowledge that anti-insurgency operations in the region often fail because of the pressures of party politics. Many political leaders in these states are known to be more interested in using insurgent groups than in defeating them. It is an old problem that counter-insurgency operations in the Northeast have had to deal with for a long time. Governments change, but the unholy alliance between parties and militants continues. Mr Singhs remarks should remind ruling parties in these states that national security cannot be bargained for small political gains.        
	The other point Mr Singh made about these states is equally significant. It has been a common complaint that the governments in the region fail to properly use Central funds for development. But Mr Singhs reference to the issue clearly had a wider significance. These state governments have routinely argued that insurgency in the region is directly linked to the lack of economic development. It is a valid argument, but it should have made the governments take development more seriously than they usually do. The prime minister cited Assams poor record in using Central funds obviously because it is the worst example, but other states in the region hardly do any better. Whether Mr Singhs plainspeaking will change the ways of these governments is another matter.

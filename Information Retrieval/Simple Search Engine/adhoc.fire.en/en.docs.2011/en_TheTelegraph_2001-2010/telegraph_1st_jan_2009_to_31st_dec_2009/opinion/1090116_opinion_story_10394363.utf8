	India loves its laws, but not necessarily lawfulness. Its love of laws is reflected in the multiple legislations under the same head. This time the National Law Commission has proposed a law for the registration of marriages and divorces that should override all other laws regarding marriage registration. Even if the law ministry follows this up, it is difficult to feel chirpy about the proposal  divorce registration is the only novel, and rather inexplicable, element in it  because the issue of compulsory registration of marriages in all religions is becoming jaded. The Supreme Court has been directing the administration repeatedly since 2006 to make registration compulsory for all marriages, but nothing has changed yet.         
	The problems are political as well as practical. The old story that no Indian politician is willing to risk the ire of voters from the minority community still holds true; they are too lazy to find out about the changes that may be taking place in the different communities. The practical problems are overwhelming too. For the poor in India, registering marriages is rather less important than eating twice a day. And even for the less poor, the fee would seem steep, while the penalty for not registering is far lower. The infrastructure for registration is pitifully inadequate, and there is absolutely no monitoring and no attempt to inculcate awareness. All this can be done with political will and planning  and the new proposal does suggest a fairly practical method  but the will is yet to be visible. It is understandable that the court should insist on marriage registration, since many of the cases it deals with could not have come to trial had a marriage been registered in the first place. But the evils that might be prevented with registration  minor marriage, bigamy or trafficking, to name a few  have independent laws against them, as inadequately implemented as those of registration. The fundamental question behind the registration of marriages is hardly religious or even practical; it is a question of the extent to which the State should enter the private lives of citizens. The philosophy behind registering marriages must be fully worked out before citizens can be persuaded of its necessity. And the rights accruing from a legally proven marriage need to be understood and seen as available too. That is still some distance away.

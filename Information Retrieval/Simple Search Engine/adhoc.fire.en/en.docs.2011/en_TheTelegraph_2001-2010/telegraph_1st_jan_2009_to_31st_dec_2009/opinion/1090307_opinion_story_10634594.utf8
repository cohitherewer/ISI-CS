	Appearances are often very deceptive. When Pratibha Patil became the president of India, her critics were unanimous in writing her off as a lightweight without a mind of her own. Ms Patils presence in public life, even as the head of the Indian State, has so far not been noteworthy. But with her very first salvo she can claim to have hit at the heart of a bizarre feature of the Indian university system. She has questioned the validity of certain honorary degrees being awarded by Jamia Millia Islamia. She objected to the universitys suggestion that she should serve as a post-facto sanctioning authority. By the statutes, her prior approval is required. This was not taken by the university, which went ahead and conferred the degrees at its convocation on October 31, 2008, and subsequently sought the approval of the President. Not only is there a violation of rules involved here, but it also shows contempt towards the office of the President. Ms Patil is entirely justified in her objections.        
	The matter, however, is a little more complex than transgression of rules and protocol. The global practice of awarding degrees honoris causa has been badly abused in India. The great universities of the world select certain individuals to honour every year by bestowing on them a degree and thus making them a part of the university concerned. Often the individuals selected are those who are otherwise not eligible for university degrees  the conductor, Herbert von Karajan, was made doctor of music honoris causa by the University of Oxford. By doing this, universities not only bestow honour on certain individuals but also bring honour upon themselves by having such individuals associated with them. Universities thus take special care to select individuals of real eminence. This is one reason why universities across the world are chasing the Nobel laureate, Amartya Sen, to award him an honoris causa degree.        
	In India, the principle of real eminence is followed only in its breach. University authorities and bureaucrats sitting in the human resource development ministry select individuals to make political points, to offer patronage and, sometimes, as a gesture towards a donor. An honoris causa doctorate from an Indian university has less acceptance than a forged currency note. Industrialists and film-stars have been given doctorates by universities and some of the recipients, in violation of all convention, use the title doctor before their names, even though the degree was conferred on them honoris causa.        
	The president of India has taken a step in the right direction. She has also shown that the head of the Indian State need not always play a passive role. Her representatives in the provinces  the governors of the various states who are also chancellors and visitors of universities  should follow suit and refuse to act as rubber stamps of university administrations. Ms Patil deserves support and praise for her action.

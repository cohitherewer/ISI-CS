	On a high                  
	Sir  The Indian cricket team executed a clinical victory at Hamilton, beating New Zealand convincingly in the first Test (Sachin and Bhajji were special, says Dhoni, March 22). It was a treat to watch the batting maestro, Sachin Tendulkar, play some magical strokes. The Indian captain, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, has done it again in style, this time winning a Test match for his country in New Zealand after 33 years. Dhonis captaincy has been exceptional, and he was in control of things right through the match in Hamilton. The victory notwithstanding, the Indian team needs to improve its bowling and fielding. The players were good in patches in these two areas, but they failed to maintain the pressure after picking up early wickets in the first innings. The support staff, especially the coach, Gary Kirsten, should be praised for their wonderful support. Congratulations to Team India for this great victory. Hopefully, the players will be able to keep up their winning habit.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The Indian cricket team may not yet be the Number 1 side in Test cricket right now, but the players have performed brilliantly under Mahendra Singh Dhoni. Consequently, the team has been registering one unprecedented victory after another, and the day is not far when it will be crowned the best team in the world. It all started with the Twenty20 World Cup win, which was followed by the tri-series win in Australia. Then the Sri Lankans were beaten in their own backyard, and the Kiwis defeated in the one-dayers. One couldnt agree more with Sachin Tendulkar when he said that this is one of the best one-day teams ever. Hopefully, the crowning glory will come in the form of the World Cup win in 2011: every Indian fan is looking forward to it and wishing the team the very best for the same.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  With the run-up to the elections gathering momentum in the country, the call for projecting Sharad Pawar as the prime ministerial candidate is getting more strident (The tail wags the once-mighty head, March 14). However, the realization of his dream is totally dependent on the number of seats his Nationalist Congress Party is able to secure in the new Lok Sabha. In case of any shortfall in numbers, the saffron party from Maharashtra is ready to provide the required crutches to help Pawar out. In the 1999 polls, he had succeeded in returning more members of Parliament belonging to the then undivided Congress than from any other state in the country. But his lack of administrative experience at the Central level at that time tilted the scales in favour of P.V. Narasimha Rao. Let us hope that this time, the shrewd tactician in Pawar will be able to hit the decisive stroke to score the goal of a lifetime.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Sharad Pawar asking for the prime minister to be from Maharashtra is nothing but an openly expressed desire to head the next government at the Centre. But since the president, Pratibha Patil, is also from Maharashtra, will Indias president and prime minister both be from Maharashtra? Our politicians are always enacting Mungerilal ke hasin sapne with their dreams of being the prime minister of the worlds largest democracy. Is it at all democratic for parties mired in factionalism to snatch the right of the new Lok Sabha to select its leader? Such ambitions could be checked by imposing an upper age limit of, say, 65 years for ministers at the Centre or in the states. The best remedy is to elect the prime minister through secret and compulsory voting in the Lok Sabha, using electronic voting machines on nominations signed by at least a third of the members. A prime minister elected this way may be removed by the same process, but an alternative leader must be named in the motion. The Speaker and Deputy-Speaker should be elected with the prime minister in the same way.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  A national daily has named the poll circus as the Dance of Democracy. Perhaps it should be called tandav, the dance of destruction that is attributed to Shiva. The tandav in this context signifies the obliteration of Indian democracy. Time and again, Indian citizens have been betrayed by corrupt politicians. The call-back option should be made available by a law so that non-performing MPs can be recalled by citizens in their constituencies. This is the only way to reform the election process in this country.           
	Yours faithfully,

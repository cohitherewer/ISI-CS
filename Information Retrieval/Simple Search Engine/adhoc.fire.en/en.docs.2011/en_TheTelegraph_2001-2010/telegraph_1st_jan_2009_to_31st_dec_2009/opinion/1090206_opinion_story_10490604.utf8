                                                                                                                 FEAR FACTOR                                                    
	Khaki trousers and guns have had more than their usual share of significance in Jammu and Kashmir. Through the years of turmoil, the men in uniform have come to be perceived as symbols of State repression. The association of the armed forces with arrests, disappearances and violence has created a fear psychosis among the people that has become fused with their sense of unfreedom. It was to this unfreedom that the leaders of the Hurriyat Conference alluded when they cited the presence of the para-military forces as the reason for the heavy voter turnout in the assembly elections. They would now stand corrected. It was, rather, the peoples overwhelming desire to be free of this fear, as well as the craving for a better life after years of bloodshed and violence, that lay behind the voting percentage. The chief minister, Omar Abdullah, seems to have grasped this fact. His administration has initiated a phased withdrawal of the Central Reserve Police Force and has plans to supplement that with the re-induction of the states police force in the management of law and order. The measure, if properly carried out, would allow Jammu and Kashmir to be seen as less of an anomaly. More important, the deployment of men of the same region and culture could go a long way towards a healthier interaction between the people and the administration and remove the distrust that complicates politics in the state.         
	However, the presence of the para-military in Jammu and Kashmir is the symbol of a larger problem. It is intrinsically connected with the states uncertain relations with the Centre, and that cannot be resolved by troop removal alone. Insurgency has not died a sudden death in the valley, and it will continue to demand greater finesse in operations than the states forces can manage. Whether the duty of the para-military forces remains restricted to counter-insurgency operations will depend on Mr Abdullahs efficiency in managing the administration of the state, as also its politics. Crucial to both is his ability to implement the recommendations of the working groups that include ways to build confidence through revocation of laws that impinge on fundamental rights, through amnesty, rehabilitation and good governance. Also, Mr Abdullah has to explore ways to sort out the stalemate over Centre-state relations among political groupings in the state.

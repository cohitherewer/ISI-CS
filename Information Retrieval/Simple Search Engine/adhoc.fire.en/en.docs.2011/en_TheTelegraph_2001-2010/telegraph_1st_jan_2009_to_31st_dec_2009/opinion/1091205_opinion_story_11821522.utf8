	The extravaganza quotient of Alumnorum Societass tribute, A Shanti, was quite high, though the same cannot be said of the quality of the music. Perhaps one should take account of the fact that a huge open space like the St Xaviers School ground is not a sound systems best friend. Add to this the winter evening chill and it becomes easier to understand why neither Pramita Mallick nor Sounak Chattopadhyay was at their comfortable best. In Borisho dhora-majhe shantiro baari, Mallick gave the impression that she was stopping short of shouting to get on top of the loud keyboard. Her version of Blowin in the wind was too rhythmic for comfort. However, she was in her elements in Jodi tor daak shune keu na ashe, reminding the listeners of Suchitra Mitra in her prime. Sounak was most impressive in Sarfaroshi ki tamanna, but Ekdin jara merechhilo taare giye lacked verve in the high notes. The best musical offering of the evening high on Tagore and Indian classical components was, however, the cover of Stings Fragile, performed by Neel Adhikari with able support from Allan Ao (guitar) and Sayak (Hindustani classical fusion).

	The impromptu quality of The Art of Improvisation, presented by Arupa and Kendraka on November 24, demanded an unceremonious setting. The longish exhibition hall at the Weavers Studio Centre for the Arts, with little to separate the performers from the audience, and the absence of special lighting in the performance area were only two of the challenges faced by the Bharatnatyam dancer, Arupa, and the experimental jazz outfit, Kendraka. But that was the whole point of the exercise  working imaginatively around such adversities and still putting up a lively show. A gifted and mature dancer, Arupa began with an invocation to Ganesha and followed it with a truncated varnam to offer a glimpse of the pure dance and abhinaya elements of her form. Selecting a childrens story about animals in a deep jungle, she delighted the audience with her evocative descriptions of the animals. I am sure the all-adult audience wanted her to go on till the end of the story, but it was already time for Kendraka to take over. Choosing compositions such as one in the raga, Marwah, a couple of jazz standards  My Favourite Things from The Sound of Music and an original number inspired by the falling rain  Kendraka made sure that the audience was with it throughout the gig.

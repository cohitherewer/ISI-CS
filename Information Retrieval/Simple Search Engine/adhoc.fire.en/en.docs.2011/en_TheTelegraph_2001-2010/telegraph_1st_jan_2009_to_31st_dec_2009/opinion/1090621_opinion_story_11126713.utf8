                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Women are men too                  
	Sir  It may be helpful to consider that women can also commit crimes such as child abuse, spousal abuse or domestic violence. Hence, one may suggest to the lawmakers of the country that they find a counterpart to Section 498a of the Dowry Prohibition Act to protect men, and make the law against domestic violence and the Income Tax Act gender-neutral in order to usher in gender equality. Feminism can be dangerous for society if it turns into a fanatical practice. And one should not equate the criticism of feminism with misogyny.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Amartya Talukdar, Calcutta 

      
	Not an easy divorce          
	Sir  The editorial, A good divorce (June 15), refers to the need of industries for development and of invitations to more power-generating agencies to end the monopoly of the Calcutta Electric Supply Corporation in the city. This is also necessary to create a rational balance in the ever-increasing gap between the demand and supply of power. At the same time, the suggestion that a land bank should be created for the building of new power plants through an amicable settlement between the ruling party and the Opposition seems too simplistic to implement, if not utopian.          
	Anybody who has some experience of establishing an industrial unit in West Bengal would confirm that such an enterprise involves dealing with countless government departments and law enforcement agencies. There are the various ministries, such as those of rural or urban development, industries, power, land revenue, labour, finance, and also the police. Then there are clearances to be obtained from the pollution control boards. There is practically no coordination between any two departments.           
	Then there are the local members of parliament and members of the legislative assembly, local leaders and panchayats, not to forget the local antisocial elements, all of whom have to be satisfied. Each individual, even if only remotely connected with the process, would demand a cut from the project money as his legitimate claim.           
	A recent experience of registering a gift deed may be shared in this connection. The department concerned enhanced the valuation of the properties fourfold, particularly of the land, and this held true of even faraway places in remote villages, to calculate the stamp duty and court fees.           
	When the government itself is looting, who would wish to miss the bus?                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Asit Kumar Mitra, Calcutta               
	Sir  If the editorial suggests that Bengals problems are due to the inextricable mixing of politics and economics, then the complexity implicit in the state of being inextricable should be rectified. Why should politics and economics be divorced?           
	An Amartya Sen, a Pranab Bardhan or an Amlan Dutta may prescribe many theories, but who will implement and execute them? Bengals agrarian demography needs balance that requires the functioning of politics and economics together.           
	Democracy is the life-force of the State that works with the two arms of politics and the economy. The two cannot be divorced. The government is the visible structure of the State that draws its strength from democracy and works through the coordination of the bureaucrats, technocrats and legislators.          
	There is unrest all over the state now. These violent forces are attacking the structure of the government. If the Opposition becomes the ruling party in West Bengal, it may face the same situation. Development that the common people hope for will suffer because of that. In that case, a divorce between politics and economics is not the solution.          
	Yours faithfully,       
R. Subhranshu, Chandernagore, Hooghly

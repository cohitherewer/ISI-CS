	There are very few who would agree that the just concluded presidential elections in Afghanistan are going to take the country anywhere closer to real democracy. However, most should concede that this was the best thing that could happen in a bad, if not the worst, situation. Afghanistan has travelled almost half the full circle to pre-2004 conditions before the fall of the Taliban, and the journey is not what its people had set themselves upon when they elected Hamid Karzai with an overwhelming mandate. The countrys current predicament has a lot to do with Mr Karzais bad politics and governance and his backers  particularly, the United States of Americas  confused goals. The 2009 elections could take place only after the fog in the US mind about its role in Afghanistan had finally cleared. These elections are the first move in the exit strategy that the US has framed for itself and the allied forces, and the last step in Mr Karzais strategy to dig in his heels in office. Of course, the upheaval it has set off in the country  in terms of the popular interest generated in the democratic process and in bringing together a formidable number of challengers to the regime  is a collateral effect that has spruced up the image of both the US and Mr Karzai. Unfortunately, the complex scenario in Afghanistan may not easily provide the simple solution that both are looking for.        
	For one, Mr Karzai may not, ultimately, win the decisive 51 per cent of the vote. And this notwithstanding his nod to gender-discriminatory legislation, the placating of the opium lobby, the wooing of Opposition members, the welcoming home of supportive former warlords or the extra mile that he walked to talk to the Taliban. If such is the outcome of the polls, then there would have to be a second round of polling and further delay. There is little guarantee that a run-up would provide a definite verdict for either Mr Karzai or his main opponent, Abdullah Abdullah, given the stepped up voter-intimidation by the Taliban. But even if the results are in favour of Mr Karzai, he may not have much reason to rejoice. Too many fingers have been pointed at his integrity. Mr Karzai may still retain substantial support among the Pashtuns and win the loyalty of other ethnic groups, but he is likely to reap a bitter harvest if he does not dig up the seeds of discord and disquiet he has sown in the past few years.

                                                                                                                 FORCES THAT SHAPE BOOKS AND NATIONS                                Bookwise                        What lies ahead				                           
	All successful publishers have an impeccable sense of timing and generate literature with an eye on the news of our times. So now we have a stream of books on the ups and downs of the American stock market, on Islamic terrorism and so on. What this means is that books which were divisible into two classes  the books of the hour and the books for all times  are limited to the here-and-now.        
	All these books of contemporary interest are essentially anecdotal, with a little theory thrown in to explain the underlying causes as blurb-writers put it. Many are a little more sophisticated versions of the old Penguin Specials of the late Forties and Fifties but with two additional features. First, they are part of a continuing series and hence, mainstream publishing. Second, most of the authors are columnists in leading journals and newspapers, as distinct from academics and researchers. Given the prevailing philosophy, we can expect a flood of books on post-election analyses by journalists and psephologists who have already been commissioned to deliver the copy by mid-June so that the books hit the market by early July.        
	There are two reasons for the shift from the highbrow to the serious common reader. Firstly, there are few takers for academic writing that tends to be ponderous, making a subject either boring or incomprehensible or both. Readers want it straight and simple. This also explains why columnists are preferred over academics. The former write in the language of everyday life. Second, academics, at least in India, tend to be notoriously unreliable in keeping deadlines, while columnists, given their daily pressures of work, are not so.         
	 From the grapevine it is clear that both micro-and macro-analyses have been commissioned. Micro studies concentrate on the Hindi belt  Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan  and the southern states. The two Left states  Kerala and West Bengal  have come under special investigation and each will probably have in-depth analyses. These studies would take some time to come out  may be, before the end of the year.        
	What would be out soon are the macro studies, which would follow the election results. They would concern themselves with the fate of the two main contenders  the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party  the regional players, and analyse what the future holds for them. Who are the historians who have been commissioned to write the histories-in-the-making? They are not professional historians but columnists who would be writing the copy.         
	For instance, on the prospects of the Left and what the future formation at the Centre might turn out to be, leading Leftist historians such as Irfan Habib or Sumit Sarkar have already given their tentative opinions, and these have been quoted in sections of the national press. This collaboration between the journalist and the professional had always been there but is on a larger scale now because the publisher knows that the columnist will deliver the copy while the academic may not  at least, in time. And timing is all that matters in political books of this kind.

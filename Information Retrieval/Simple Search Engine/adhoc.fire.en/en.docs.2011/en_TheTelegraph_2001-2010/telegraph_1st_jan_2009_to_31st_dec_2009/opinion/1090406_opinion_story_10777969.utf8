                                                                                                                 MEET THE WORLD                                                    
	Watching them on television may have given people the impression that the prime minister had arranged to meet President Barack Obama and thrown in a meeting of G20 on the sidelines so as not to appear frivolous. Actually, the Group of 20 meets once, sometimes twice a year, and does serious business when it does. It has been an important forum for discussions on global warming. The G20 meeting last week in London was significant because it met at the outset of a global recession of a severity not seen since the Thirties; the crisis created high expectations from the heads of government. A preliminary meeting in Washington last November had drawn up a plan of action which concentrated on the crisis. A good deal of that action was envisaged to be taken by the end of March. Four working groups on financial regulation, international cooperation, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank met during March to review progress. Their reports were the main item of discussion in the London summit. Thus the summit was not just an occasion to give leaders a chance to be photographed together. It was meant to do serious business.        
	The decisions the leaders took at the summit are particularly far-reaching in three areas. First, they decided to extend national financial regulation to institutions beyond banks and to instruments beyond stocks and bonds. In recent years, there has been a considerable flowering of financial institutions other than banks, and of hybrid financial instruments and their derivatives. Both had much to do with the unfolding of the current crisis, and both obviously need regulation and reform. Second, government institutions alone cannot do all the regulation; trade associations of practitioners are equally important as rule-makers, especially in business audit. They will be recruited into the drive for stricter accounting and auditing standards. And finally, the heads of governments are annoyed at the revenue they have been losing to tax havens, and like to think that tax havens are lax in their financial regulation. So they hope to exert pressure on the tax havens and to force them to join the regulatory efforts they are organizing. If, on the side, they manage to capture some of the revenue they are losing to tax havens, they will not be unhappy.        
	These are ambitious targets, and will keep many future meetings of G20 busy. The hard work will be accompanied by many fine parties and dinners, so it will not be entirely arduous. Meanwhile, the campaign to harmonize international regulatory standards must give Indian regulators sleepless nights. For the action programmes prepared by the working parties of G20 show how far Indian regulation lags behind the world  how little it achieves with how much intrusion. But they also give Indian regulators a golden chance to learn international best practice. They should grab the opportunity with both hands.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Tour of Chopsticks Asia
                                                                                                                 TOUR OF CHOPSTICKS ASIA                          - The US might one day find India a better Asian option than China         Sunanda K. Datta-Ray                            To Beijing                                              
	Hillary Clintons presence in Beijing today is a reminder of the vicissitudes of Indias relations with the United States of America. There was good reason in the past to worry about the American balancing act between India and Pakistan. Now that Pakistan is out of the reckoning in one sense, though its nuisance value makes it a claimant on US attention in another, the main competition is from China. Even Japan, Americas closest Asian ally and the first stop on the secretary of states four-nation tour, fears being upstaged.        
	When running for president last year, Hillary Clinton announced that the US-China relationship would be the most important bilateral relationship in the world in this century. She virtually repeated that last weekend on the eve of her first trip abroad as head of President Barack Obamas foreign office. Rejecting warnings that rising China is, by definition, an adversary, she told the Asia Society that both countries can benefit from and contribute to each others successes. It is in our interests to work harder to build on areas of common concern and shared opportunities.        
	That summarizes Indias position too. India cannot afford not to work with China. Unlike the India-Pakistan equation, there is no conflict in American engagement with the two Asian powers. But with political and commercial positions to guard, India must ensure that Obamas commitment to Afghanistan and need for China do not push it too far down the ladder of American priorities. This is best guaranteed by highlighting the role that India can play in reinvigorated US efforts to restore sanity in Afghanistan. Indias economic growth rate even now and its assets as a stable, secular democracy are just the qualities the US needs most in an Asian ally after Pakistans surrender to the Taliban.               
	That also explains Indonesias inclusion in Hillary Clintons tour of what is really Chopsticks Asia. Obama may not have converted to Islam, attended mosques or worn sarongs as his detractors allege, but he is conscious of the symbolism of his second name, Hussein, and that he has Muslim relatives and has lived in Muslim countries. Hoping to turn those connections to good use, he says his job is to convince the Muslim world that Americans are not their enemy. He believes the worlds most populous Muslim country, its Islam tempered by its Hindu past and Sufi heritage, can help him do just that and combat the Talibans influence.         
	China, which chairs the six-nation conference on North Koreas nuclear programme and holds substantial US investment, is important for other reasons. While strategy explains Hillary Clintons visits to Japan and South Korea, the present Sino-American agenda centres on climate change and the economy. Chinese emission of greenhouse gas is now even higher than Americas which is why Todd Stern, US special envoy for climate change, is accompanying the secretary of state. There are also fears that China can use the nearly $700 billion in US treasury securities it holds as lever against the US if relations deteriorate.         
	David Shambaugh, the director of George Washington Universitys China policy programme, says Obama has inherited the best relationship we have had with China in 20 years with a high degree of understanding, professionalism and trust and deep interdependence between the two countries. This is one of the Bush administrations few successful foreign policy legacies. As Chinas low-key reaction to the conclusion of a long-pending US arms deal with Taiwan testified, early tensions had almost disappeared by the time George W. Bush attended the Beijing Olympics.         
	Even during the campaign, the Chinese expected greater continuity from Obama than from the Republican, John McCain, who mooted an alliance of democracies. Obama wrote to Taiwans president, Ma Ying-jeou, upholding the one China policy and various US agreements with Beijing on relations with Taiwan. He also welcomed his predecessors Strategic Economic Dialogue with China. Even if this is enlarged, as Hillary Clinton wants, to what she calls a comprehensive dialogue and a broader agenda, economics will remain the focus of the connection.         
	Japan is still Americas closest Asian partner but Taro Asos weak and unpopular government has been further damaged by the finance ministers exit. The yen has soared to a 13-year high against the dollar, largely because Japanese investors are liquidating their overseas accounts while there is little demand abroad for Japanese assets, thus pushing the country deeper into recession. In contrast, and notwithstanding distress reports from Guangdong province which underpinned Chinas economic miracle, Chinas leaders seem confident of riding the storm. Will Chinas economy continue to grow fast and steadily? The premier, Wen Jiabao, asked rhetorically at Davos last month before answering, Yes, it will! The International Monetary Fund rates Chinas $586 billion stimulus as the second-largest in terms of gross domestic product and the second-greatest impact among the Group of 20 nations managing the economic crisis.         
	But though the Obama administration feels the time is right for serious bilateral discussions, not everyone thinks it prudent to put all Americas eggs in one basket or to restrict diplomacy to only the current salvage operation. Even if the lone superpowers global supremacy is reduced, the US will emerge from the present recession again to give a lead to the rest of the world. It must think of tomorrow. As Michael J. Green, formerly Bushs principal adviser on Asia, puts it, despite the financial crisis and the turmoil in West Asia, In the longer sweep of history, historians will judge this administration and our generation on how we managed the shift of power from the West to the East and the rise of China and India.         
	That long-term challenge cannot be reduced to an either/or situation. Hillary Clinton captured the essence of Obamas multilateral approach to international issues when she said, America cannot solve the problems of the world alone, and the world cannot solve them without America. There is no doubt of Chinas importance for immediate US interests but Chinese power can also be overestimated. With 20 million unemployed rural workers, China is a poorer country in per capita terms than usually imagined. Harsh family planning means the Chinese will age before they become wealthy. Economic inequality, pollution, corruption, disregard for the rule of law and other social ills (many of them manifest in India too!) must be balanced against dizzy economic growth and spectacular military might. No country in the world wants to emulate Chinas political-economic system. If some side with China, its partly because of abundant largesse and partly because they want to counter American supremacism. Similarly, Chinas heavy trade and diplomatic inroads in Southeast Asia prompt some members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to look to India to save them from being engulfed into Chinas economic backyard.              
	As first lady and as presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton sharply criticized Chinas human rights record. In a year that marks the 50th anniversary of the Dalai Lamas flight and the 20th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre, she promises to work to expand human rights and create a world that respects those rights... where Tibetans and all Chinese people can enjoy religious freedom without fear of prosecution. Its a signal that economic need is not the only driving force of US foreign policy. It also encourages the hope that Obama is far-sighted enough to avoid a repetition of 1971 when Richard Nixons engagement with China made him ride roughshod over Indian, Bangladeshi and humanitarian concerns. Finally, the Obama administration must be convinced that with Japan out of the count, Indias mix of democracy with growth presents the US with its best Asian option in the long term.        
	But India cannot take any of this for granted.

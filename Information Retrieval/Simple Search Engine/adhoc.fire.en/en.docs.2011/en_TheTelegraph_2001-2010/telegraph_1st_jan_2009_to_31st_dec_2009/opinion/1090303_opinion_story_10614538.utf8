                                                                                                                 GAME OF PATIENCE                                                    
	India is still far from proving that its diplomacy has prevailed over Pakistan. No one should know this better than Pranab Mukherjee, the minister of external affairs, whose belief in the power of Indian diplomacy has been unwavering. The recent statements of Pakistans navy chief, contradicting his own governments admission about the involvement of some Pakistan nationals in the Mumbai terror attack, must have made this fact painfully clear to Mr Mukherjee. But a canny awareness and acceptance of the deep rifts in Pakistans polity are inherent to Indias approach in this case. Mr Mukherjees insistence that he continued to believe in the Pakistan presidents sincerity about following up the terror probe (on the same day that the navy chief made his statement) points to this diplomatic cornerstone. If India is to elicit any credible response from Pakistan, it cannot isolate the civilian establishment. It is only by holding the Pakistan government to its promise of cooperation that India can make its pressure work. It was this strategy that helped India manage the turnaround  that is, Pakistans admission of the involvement of its nationals. It is this same strategy that has perhaps forced the navy chief to retract his statement.        
	Undoubtedly, the Mumbai investigations are taking place under peculiar circumstances. Of the 10 who allegedly carried out the massacre, only one has survived, and the majority of those named in the chargesheets filed in the Mumbai court are in Pakistan. Indian law does not allow trial in absentia, and there is no extradition treaty to force Pakistan to deport them to India. Besides, India has been unable to identify the Lashkar-e-Toiba commanders who supposedly directed the operations. Much of the investigations hinge solely on Mohammed Ajmal Kasabs confessions, and these cannot be verified without Pakistans help. Pakistan has steadfastly prevented India, as also the Federal Bureau of Investigation, from interrogating suspects. Obviously, Pakistan is unwilling to allow inquiries that could raise questions about some of its army officials. By supposing that its sustained pressure on the Pakistan government will work, India also presumes that the civilian authority in Pakistan can persuade the army to come round to its view about politic concessions. But given the recent turmoil in the country, such a promising state of things is likely to be delayed.

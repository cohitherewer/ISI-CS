	Though riddled with undemocratic forces and frequently predicted to be on the verge of extinction, the worlds largest democratic exercise is under way. Its very existence, warts and all, defies expectations and poses the question, why does Indian democracy survive? By allowing undemocratic and tribal loyalties that predate democracy to thrive, and by incorporating them, Indian democracy offers a new set of freedoms, which democracy as it developed in the West does not. These possibilities not only ensure the survival of democracy, but also provide undemocratic states with a new route to democratization and make Indian democracy an example to the apathetic inventors of democracy  the West.        
	Even the first black presidential candidate could not motivate voters in the worlds oldest democracy to cast their ballot in greater numbers than that in 1960. Since then voter turnout in the United States of America has been in a steady decline. In the United Kingdom, the tale is even sorrier. Turnout has fallen from the 1950 high of 85 per cent to around 60 per cent. Though of recent vintage in India and despite hurdles unimaginable to Westerners  Indians brave long treks to polling booths, intimidation and violence  the democratic exercise in India witnesses a greater turnout than in the West.         
	The grandest of political concepts, democracy, is under a dual threat. The developed world does not vote, while certain elites in the developing world deny their masses the vote. In the West, democracy developed as the means of conveying the peoples consent to a sovereign leader. The greatest theorists of Western democracy, Hobbes, Locke and Rousseau, proposed that the basis of a legitimate, democratic, government was consent. Hobbes linked consent to representation by a king; Locke advanced the idea by linking consent to elected representatives; Rousseau suggested that since people did not possess the sort of rationality required by a fully functioning democracy, they would be coerced into becoming the kind of people a democracy required.                 
	More freedom        
	The coercion implicit in creating the modern citizen loyal to the democratic State is the fundamental failing of Western democracy. The mistake of European theorists was that in trying to craft the modern citizen, loyal to the democratic State, they tried to wipe out older, undemocratic group loyalties. In Rousseaus style of democratic socialization, which continues today, older loyalties to class, religion and community remain perpetually locked in battle with democracy.         
	The innovation that Indian democratic practice brings to staid Western theory is that Indians do not assume all citizens are equal or expect the democratic State to enjoy the absolute loyalty of the people. In the West, democrats tried to mould traditional peoples into a democratic society. In India, democracy has been moulded to further the aims of a traditional people.         
	In practice, this means that Indian democracy frequently furthers narrow, sectarian, group interests. Here, caste and religion compete with the democratic State. Citizens are also guided by age-old concerns when they participate in modern democratic politics. Indian democracy was finished, predicted academics and analysts raised on Western theories, when democracy was briefly suspended in the 1970s. They were wrong because they dismissed the undemocratic forces that Indian democracy allowed to flourish. Indias experience demonstrates that democratization can simultaneously safeguard older, undemocratic interests. By developing a democracy which does not try to coerce people to become democratic citizens, and instead co-opts older undemocratic loyalties, India has shown the West that the answer to the problems of democracy is not coercion: it is more democracy.

                                                                                                                 CHANDNI CHOWK TO CHINA                                                          
	Corruption and ignorance have their own sleights of hand. The transport minister, Subhas Chakraborty, has now thought up  if he can at all be imagined thinking  something like a pseudo-loophole to prevent two-stroke autorickshaws being taken off the roads of Calcutta. He need not have bothered. His partys and his rival partys united muscle-power has managed to make the rule of law look like one great loophole in West Bengal, through which thousands of exultant law-breakers pass with impunity every day, with union flags fluttering high. But it is now possible to confront the minister and his bosses with a somewhat embarrassing contrast to this situation provided by the other communist capital, Beijing. In that city, 350,000 old and polluting cars have been effectively banished from the streets from January 1, 2009. A combination of phased restrictions, punishments, incentives, alternatives, rewards and subsidies had been planned, and is being executed, with an unrelenting precision that most modern democracies may find chilling in other spheres of free human activity, but, in this case, could only be held up for emulation. The impetus behind Beijings move is not pure concern for public health and the environment. Beijing has been cited, together with Delhi and Calcutta, as one of the worlds most polluted cities. But most of the drastic anti-pollution measures enforced in Beijing have been occasioned by the Olympics  by Chinas rigorous concern about its image to the world, the event itself a public relations gimmick on an awesome scale.        
	If a system of governance has to be founded on an all-powerful interlocking of party, police and government, then citizens who are desperate about their lungs and lives might end up preferring the Chinese model to the Bengali one. In Bengal, supreme indifference to how the world regards its benighted ways is combined with an identification of the police with the party. This makes it impossible for ordinary people to make sure that a whole range of laws made for their benefit are scrupulously implemented. Such a culture stops being merely political, and begins corrupting civil society as well, so that it is eventually impossible to distinguish among civic, partisan and commercial interests. The fortunes that are made in Calcutta from old autos and the fuel they use are cunningly distributed among the criminals, the police, the unions and the municipality. An entire community of lawbreakers is held together thus by money and by power, making it difficult to keep the State distinct from civil society.        
	Looking at the triumphant drivers, their devious leaders and the passive souls sitting inside the autos, the desperate Calcuttan might be tempted to wonder  but without shuddering, in this case  what would have happened to all these offenders in the law-abiding hands of the Chinese State.

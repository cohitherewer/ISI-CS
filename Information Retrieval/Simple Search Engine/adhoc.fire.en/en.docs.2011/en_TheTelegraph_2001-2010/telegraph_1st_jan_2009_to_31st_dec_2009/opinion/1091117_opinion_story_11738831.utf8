	Not above board   
	Sir  The vociferous agitation by lawyers of the Advocates Association of Bangalore to force P.D. Dinakaran, the chief justice of Karnataka High Court, to abandon a courtroom hearing is truly amazing (Protest forces chief justice to leave, locks up judges, Nov 10). There is little doubt that the sorry turn that events involving Justice Dinakaran have taken over the past several weeks has tarnished the image of the judiciary. While public opinion may support the reason behind the protest by the advocates group, the disruptive manner of the members of the legal profession would shock most people.          
	Public trust in the legal system has sharply declined in the recent years, with reports of judicial corruption making headlines at regular intervals. The present tussle between the lawyers groups and the collegium responsible for selecting judges has made the judiciary a potential target for ridicule. But who should be held responsible for this judicial chaos? The collegia that still follow an inherently flawed and outmoded system of selecting judges, the bar associations that clearly harbour a trade-union mentality or the media that perhaps hyped this incident way beyond proportion?          
	Dinakaran has allegedly encroached a vast amount of land using his influence. Apart from different legal groups, many eminent jurists have also raised strong objections to his selection to the apex court. Under pressure from the legal community, the Supreme Court collegium had backtracked and put his elevation on hold. While the assumption, innocent until proven guilty, is the accepted modus operandi inside a courtroom, such a principle may not be the ideal yard-stick to select judges with. If there is no evidence against Dinakaran of employing devious methods to accumulate excessive land, the Chief Justice of India should come out strongly against the protesting advocates and reinstate Dinakaran to the Supreme Court without further delay. On the other hand, Dinakaran should be removed from any list of candidates being considered for office in the apex court if there is an iota of evidence that he might have acted in a disreputable manner in the past. There can be no dispute that judges must maintain an absolutely unblemished moral character in their public as well as personal lives.          
	The advocates belonging to the AAB have claimed that they are raising a strong protest against Dinakarans elevation to the Supreme Court only because of his tainted character. While, on the face it, this appears to be a laudable attempt by this group of lawyers, one feels like asking why they kept silent when the same man was working as a judge in Tamil Nadu. One wonders why there no was agitation when he was made the chief justice of the Karnataka High Court, where he has been functioning for long. Do the legal eagles in the AAB believe that a corrupt judge may be allowed to function in the system as long as he is not elevated to the Supreme Court? Do these advocates believe that justice in India should only be available in the highest court of the land that is difficult for most ordinary citizens to access?           
	The media have been blamed for blowing up the present fiasco. However, it is the bounden duty of journalists to expose probable evidences of corruption or prejudice. Healthy criticism of the legal community can only help in eliminating shortcomings in the judiciary, and this can go a long way in restoring public trust in the legal system.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Winds of change          
	Sir  The bypoll results for West Bengal have gone in a predictable way for Mamata Banerjee (Friend amp; foe delight Didi, Nov 11). The Trinamul Congress must have been flattered though by the big margin of victory which it probably did not expect. The verdict of the electorate has been clear and this should make Banerjee feel more confident. A complete and unmistakable polarization has taken place in the state between the Leftists and their opponents. Banerjee surely knows that the road towards her wish to oust the Left and occupy the Writers Building is more or less clear of obstacles now. The results have also given rise to a few new political equations. In dealing with the Congress, Banerjee will henceforth have a greater say and will possibly make the bargaining for seat allocation in the assembly tougher.          
	It may not be too much to assume at this stage that the TMC, with or without the Congress, is in a position to end the almost 33 years of misrule by the leftists. The Congress does not seem to have any other choice than to humour Banerjee and remain happy to play the part of a lesser partner in the alliance. The Congress has always had a leadership problem in West Bengal. Their organizational base in the state is still rather weak and is not growing either.          
	What the ruling leftists are doing at present to combat the winds of change signalled by Banerjee is totally devoid of political wisdom. Personal vilification and cadre violence directed at their critics and political opponents are destined to be rejected by the people who have seen enough of such methods. For the past few decades, the Marxists have been facing stiff resistance. The scenario may alter either way by the time the assembly elections are held in 2011, but the polarization in the political scene of the state is not likely to change much.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  After repeated rejection by the people in different polls, senior Left Front members showed some willingness to consider the possibility of early elections (CPM agrees to Left meet on polls, Nov 15). Initially, most of the members had brushed aside the proposal of facing fresh elections. It was thought that the available two years time before the next assembly election would be sufficient for the Left to regain the peoples confidence by taking up a host of developmental projects for them. But to the few thinking members of the Left Front, this was not a credible proposition. The task, which could not be completed within a span of 32 years of continuous reign, is not possible to finish within a period of two years by any stretch of the imagination.          
	Other misdeeds are also, to some extent, responsible for the fast withering of support for the Left Front. Some front-ranking leaders of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), have used provocative expletives against members of the Opposition. This has antagonized not only the Opposition but also the saner few among the Front leaders. Unrest has been brewing among the Front members . The Left Front has enjoyed the privileges of being in power for 32 years. Now it may have to relinquish its powers. What remains to be seen is whether the Opposition, should it come to power, walks down the same path of misrule.          
	Yours faithfully,

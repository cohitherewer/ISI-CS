	A forgotten era revisited                
	Nautch Girls of the Raj (Penguin, Rs 250) by Pran Nevile deserves to be praised simply because of the effort the author has put in to explore a lost aspect of Indian culture. The nautch girls are worthy of a special place in the history of Indian performing arts. They were a unique class of courtesans  professional entertainers who had mastered the arts of dance and music. Society held them in great esteem as they were seen more as artists and less as objects of desire. Often, children from wealthy and upper-caste families would be trained in language and etiquette by these women. These beautiful women not only had refined manners, but also possessed a sharp mind and a profound knowledge of poetry. What a pity that nautch girls are extinct now, and with them, cities like Delhi and Lucknow have lost a certain flavour. In the pages of this book, these elegant figures once again come to life, the text resonates with the long-forgotten sound of their graceful ghungroos.                        
	Piercing the heart: Unheard voices of 26/11 (Rupa, Rs 95) by Simran Sodhi presents touching personal accounts of the victims of the Mumbai terror-attacks last November. The book attempts to document these shocking experiences in a sensitive and yet inquisitive manner. The stories reflect a tremendous urge to live on amid a deathly carnage. This is what makes the book unique. Mumbai is known to be a city that celebrates life. This spirit was cruelly disrupted by the rampage that killed many and traumatized many more. The 26/11 attacks shook the peoples belief in the normal flow of life. The book captures this feeling of helplessness within its pages. The stories reflect the fear that had seared the hearts of so many, and also the desire to get over the fear. Speaking about two lovers who survived the Mumbai attacks, the author rightly says, Just like Rajita and Ajay, the Taj too has survived as a proud reminder of our resilience.                        
	The impossible is possible (Orient, Rs 95) by John Mason is a self-help book that preaches the unconventional  Safety last, it says. The book encourages readers to know the limits and then ignore them. The intention of the book, like all self-help books, is to point out the silver line that shines on every cloud. Turning the impossible into possible is a dream as primal to mankind as its own existence. Developing strategies to achieve this may sometimes turn into a matter of selling old wine in a new bottle. In many of its pages, the book has just recycled age-old ideas and presented them in a smarter package. But certain observations hold the readers interest from time to time. For example, the idea that Man is the only creation that refuses to be what he is. Are these words just cleverly put together to amuse, or is there a deeper thought behind them?                                  
	A Taste of Life: The Last Days of U.G. Krishnamurti (Penguin, Rs 225) by Mahesh Bhatt is as much about the guru who preferred to call himself the anti-guru as about his celebrity acolyte, the author himself. If you are familiar with the preachings of Krishnamurti, or U.G., as he was called by his disciples, then it would not be difficult to guess why Bhatt was attracted to him. After all, Bhatt is a product of the Seventies when bermenschs of the Nietzschean model were the rage. Man is merely a biological being; there is no spiritual side to his nature, U.G. famously said. This is an intensely personal account of U.G.s death saga, which the godman, in his characteristic way, insisted on turning into a black comedy.

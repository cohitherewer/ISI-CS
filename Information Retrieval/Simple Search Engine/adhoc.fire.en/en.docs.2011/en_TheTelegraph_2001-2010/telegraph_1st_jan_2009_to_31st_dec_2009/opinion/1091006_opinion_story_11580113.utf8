The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A man out of his time
                                                                                                                 A MAN OUT OF HIS TIME                          - Manu Shroff was an ironist worth chuckling with					 					      Writing on the wall      Ashok V. Desai                                                      
	IG Patel is a legend. He was the chief economist in the finance ministry in the 1960s. He left, rather than serve, a corrupt minister Indira Gandhi appointed in the ministry. Later on, he became governor of the Reserve Bank and director of the London School of Economics. To cap it, he wrote some entertaining memoirs when he retired to his home town, Gujarat.        
	He had a friend who also retired to Baroda, and built a house within a stones throw from IGs. This friend too was an economist, and spent the best years of his life working in the finance ministry with IG. He did not receive accolades like IG; in fact, he was largely unknown except to aficionados of the finance ministry and of economic policy. After retiring from the finance ministry, he became editor of the Economic Times. Anyway, the liaison, not surprisingly, did not last long.        
	I knew Manu Shroff since I spent some time in the 1960s in Delhi. I was always impressed by his robust common sense and sound judgment, and thought it went well with his low-key, unassuming personality. Then I left for other parts of the world, and he for Bombay and Baroda, so I did not see much of him.        
	I had seen virtually nothing written by him, and had assumed that this refusal to express himself was a part of his modesty. But that was a misjudgment. A bureaucrat writes reams in his lifetime; it is just that it is buried in files and never sees the light of day. And there is a convention that it must stay in files and cannot be published. Thus it is that the wisdom of some highly intelligent people remains buried  amongst them, Amar Nath Verma, L.K. Jha and Manu Shroff.              
	It would be hard to retrieve the writings of such a retiring economist, but Deena Khatkhate has, in a labour of love, collected the writings of Manu Shroff (Indian Economy: A Retrospective View, Academic Foundation, 2009, Rs 295). It is disappointing but natural that it contains nothing from Manu Shroffs time as a bureaucrat. Khatkhate calls it a retrospective view, but what I found remarkable was the absence of the retrospective: there is nothing in this volume that would throw light on what Manu Shroff thought of his time in the finance ministry, of the economic problems he encountered while there, why the government did what it did then, and what he thought of the policies he helped sculpt.        
	That matters, not because the policies were much to boast about  I think the years from the 1950s to the 1970s were lost decades, and that stupid socialist dogma set India back thirty years. Nor would they be anything to write home about; if Manu Shroff was an architect of the disastrous policies of that time, then he might as well pass into oblivion with the lost decades.        
	But he was not. He was an intelligent liberal. He was devastatingly critical of the socialist era. This volume contains a response Manu Shroff wrote to Deepak Nayyars 1993 critique of the reforms. I was then in the finance ministry, and gave a hand in designing the reforms. Deepak Nayyar was chief economic advisor in the finance ministry during the 1980s. That does not mean that he was responsible for the payments crisis of 1989-91. But he was an important member of the team that made an ineffectual response to the crisis. Eventually, all those who dealt with the crisis and failed, from V.P. Singh and Chandra Shekhar down to Deepak Nayyar, were swept aside. Narasimha Rao came in together with Manmohan Singh and P. Chidambaram, jettisoned the hallowed policies of controls, and heralded the period of high growth and increasing openness that continues till today. Being in the government, I was gagged; but even if I had been able to, I could not have given a better response to Deepak Nayyar. Manu Shroff summarizes Nayyars attack in ten points and dissects them; in the end, nothing is left.        
	I have just been to the G20 summit in Pittsburgh and witnessed the deliberations that went on there about what to do with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank and how to give them more funds. I was disappointed but not surprised that Manu Shroff participated in the same debates 30 years earlier, as a paper from the 1970s shows. The idea was then, and still is, that developing countries are subject to peculiar balance of payments problems. Since they do not produce capital goods and goods in which there are important economies of scale, their growth is highly import-intensive. And since they export mostly primary goods, their exports are highly inelastic. So to develop, they need aid of two sorts. They need temporary loans to support their balance of payments, and they need aid for long-term investment to change their production profile. The International Monetary Fund was designed to give the first, and the World Bank to give the second. But giving money to developing countries is risky, so the IMF and the World Bank cannot easily raise money from the market. If they cannot, they must be given money by industrial countries. Developing countries like that idea; industrial countries do not. They meet every once in a while in nice places like Washington and Pittsburgh, argue and then go their own way. Manu Shroff took part in those civilized debates in the 1970s; I watched them from the sidelines in 2009. Some things will never change.              
	If economists have to think and talk about such serious issues for decades without reaching any solution, their lives must be depressing; one might wonder why they do not commit suicide. The remedy lies in a sense of humour. Manu Shroff had a distinctive line in irony. Take, for instance, what he has to say about Savak Tarapore, a grey eminence of the Reserve Bank of India: He has been generally conservative. Though one notices an occasional uncharacteristic boldness, which can perhaps be ascribed to the state of nivrutti, which he enjoys like many of us.        
	Manu Shroff is essential reading for understanding the economic history of our times; and more remarkably, it is entertaining reading. Reading his writings, I was often struck by how similarly we thought, and how he often put something better than I would. Then I thought, here is a man who could have done just the reforms we did in the 1990s; perhaps he could have done them better. He could have become a celebrity. It was just his misfortune that he was born at the wrong time, and served the wrong government.        
	But I doubt if he would have looked at it that way. He would have had no regrets. He might have taken some satisfaction in the fact that he did his job competently and conscientiously, he might have chuckled at some of the human follies he encountered. He does that often in this book, and he is worth chuckling with.

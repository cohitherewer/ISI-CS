	.but to say so at the time would have drawn insults ranging from fantasist to lunatic, enquiries would have poured forth as to what substances, legal or illegal, this writer had been ingesting and so on. However, life throws the craziest dice, wilder than anything I or anyone else could have predicted and so, here we are. One can now state it for the undeniable reality it was and is: the last-minute compromise on Singur, the so-called thieves pact between the Left Front, Mamata-mool and the then newest son of Bengal Roton de Tata led to a meltdown of power-structure as has never before been seen in independent India; it left the Left Front completely naked, clutching their greed; it terminally exposed Ms Banerjee for the shrill but cynical opportunist she has always been, and it was a (not that) early signal as to where Profiteers.Inc themselves were headed  about to drive off the cliff-edge at high speed with only shreds of rubber clinging to their tyre-rims; it drew a genuine protest from the people of Bengal, local at first, then in expanding pockets and then in a viral that went state-wide. I know I am repeating well-digested events but it still feels good to say it: if the collapse of the state government and its partys power-tentacles was satisfyingly startling, the disintegration of Trinamool and Iron Mashima was equally rewarding to witness; but the best, of course, was the emergence of a genuine third option  the rag-tag Coalition of the Unexpected that took oath a month after Barack Obama was sworn in  was thrown up out of the pressure-cooker Bengal had been for nearly a decade preceding, and nothing, not the 26/11 Bombay attacks, not the low-level Election War against Pakistan begun by the Congress, not the almost-implosion of Bangladesh, nothing, thankfully, came in the way of the new government treating the situation in Bengal for the very different and critical war it was, nothing stopped them from taking the people along with them for one of the biggest, quickest and most radical of social and political clean-ups the sub-continent has witnessed. At the time Id wanted to dub it the Spinning Wheel Revolution. Cautious good sense had stopped me then from publishing this coinage, but now the time for certain kinds of caution and certain kinds of good sense is past and I can say it out in loud print.

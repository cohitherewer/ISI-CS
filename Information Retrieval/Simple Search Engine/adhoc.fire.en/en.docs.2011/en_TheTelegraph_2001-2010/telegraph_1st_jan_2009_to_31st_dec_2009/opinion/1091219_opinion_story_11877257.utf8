	When the bubble bursts                  
	Sir  Abu Dhabis $10 billion aid to Dubai has been the lifeline that has made the stocks surge. The business world has turned into a bubble. All the industries have become increasingly vulnerable to economic cycles, frauds and political turmoils, which affect hundreds of creditors, customers, employees, investors and their families. But no one lays emphasis on the fundamentals that govern these economic processes. As a result, many end up losing money in the gamble, and only a few lucky ones gain.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Mohammed Sadullah Khan, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia 

                
	Free gifts          
	Sir  Some pharmaceutical companies have protested against the code that proposes to prohibit drug companies from giving away free gifts to doctors (Cracks in doctor freebies code, Dec 10). It would be nave to expect these companies to refrain from making such presents. To stop the practice, a law prohibiting it should be put in place.          
	The practice of pharma companies giving presents to doctors is, by far, unchecked. Drug firms do not limit themselves to distributing complimentary pens among doctors. Countless free meals, holidays that include stays at resorts, airfares  all are sponsored by such firms. Patients who pay through their noses for life sustaining drugs should be aware that the prescriptions which emptied their wallets may have been influenced by something other than medical concerns.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
H.N. Ramakrishna, Bangalore

                
	Sir  Considering the the sheer number of physicians and pharmaceutical companies, one wonders how the government can stop freebies from being doled out to doctors. It is unlikely that there would be any complaints from those who receive these presents. Since hardly any action is taken against bureaucrats who violate their professional codes, it remains to be seen whether drug firms, which do not follow rules, will be brought to book.           
	Yours faithfully,       
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

                          
	Earnest appeal          
	Sir  I do not remember any occasion in the past when an outgoing governor of a state has, in his farewell speech, appealed to political parties to eschew the path of bhangchur, bandhs and bomabaji (Parting message on hills, Dec 14). Gopal Krishna Gandhi, who discharged his constitutional duties more as a noble human being than as a mere State functionary, has detected the source of West Bengals ills accurately.          
	The politicians clever tactics to misguide people with the intent of exploiting them for selfish gains disturbed the outgoing governor. He could feel the desperation of the people who are suffocated in such a political scenario. Gandhis parting appeal is unlikely to drive much sense into the administration, which is sure to foment more trouble in the future, ignoring the interests of the state.          
	Yours faithfully,       
S. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

                          
	Losers but chasers          
	Sir  It is heartening that India won the match at Rajkot. But the Sri Lankans also deserve praise, as they chased a big total. Although Virender Sehwag was the man of the match, Tillakaratne Dilshan played a great innings and provided a solid foundation for his team. Besides improving its bowling, Team India needs to inculcate the fighting spirit that its Sri Lankan counterparts displayed  they looked determined to chase the 414 runs and maintained the required run rate till the last over, which is never an easy task.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Sudhir Pattnaik, Kalahandi, Odisha

	Joya Biswas (picture), the only woman sitar player of consequence to emerge since Independence, showed her mettle in the concluding recital at Sangeet Piyasis An evening with Maestros at Uttam Mancha on April 14. Holding the sitar at a slightly different angle than she did originally, the lady presented a serious and melody-packed alap and jod in the now rare raga, Sindhura, and followed up with equally good vilambit and drut teental gatkari in this raga. What was notable about the alap was that it did not meander repetitively since Sindhura, in its pure form, is a rather short-winded raga. After sketching the bold outlines, she moved to the jod in about six minutes. This was played with the perfect balance of rhythm and melody that characterized the sitar playing of her guru, Pandit Ravi Shankar, in his now distant heyday.         
	The vilambit teental gatkari, woven around a composition played on the violin by Ustad Alauddin Khan on a 78 rpm record, avoided all the virtuoso violin flourishes and concentrated fully on pure sitar material. There were brilliant tukras ending with tihais, both reminiscent of the original style of her guru to start with, and then taan-toda eight times the basic beat that was full of melodic contrasts and ended with appropriate tihais. The rapid bolkari session that came next was equally engrossing. Finally, raising the tempo a bit, she went in for a session that elaborated the characteristic da diri dara dara dara dar dar da patterns favoured by the Ustad. The treatment of the raga was so complete that it was really a surprise to discover that the whole thing was over in 26 minutes. The brief drut teental gatkari also centred on another Alauddin Khan composition, coming to the sam (first beat) on the upper rishabh, and was charming. The aochar and brief sitarkhani gatkari in Khammaj was played with exceptional artistry and musicianship. Excellent tabla accompaniment was provided by Samar Saha who kept his thunder under strict control.        
	The evening had begun with a vocal recital by Nihar Ranjan Roy that I missed. Then, Sandip Deb, the aristocrat pupil of the late Nanku Maharaj, showed his vintage Benarasi prowess in a teental tabla solo. Making known patterns take-off in unusual directions and playing unusual patterns with clarity and gusto, Deb kept the listeners engrossed. Later, Pandit Vijay Kichlu made a brave attempt to evoke the magnificence of the now virtually extinct Agra gharana. Singing his alap and khayals in Puria with clarity and a sense of proportion, he went on to sing brief, but delightful, khayals in Abhogi and Jhinjhoti. Even at his advanced age, he reduced the three-woman vocal support gang led by Subhra Guha to a window dressing.

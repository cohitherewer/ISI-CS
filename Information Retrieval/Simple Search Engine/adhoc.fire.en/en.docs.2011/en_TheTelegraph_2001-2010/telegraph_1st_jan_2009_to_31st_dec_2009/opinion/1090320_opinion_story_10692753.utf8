                                                                                                                 SERVING THE SELF                                  BONA FIDE - MALVIKA SINGH                              
	It was a very sad moment when the voice of Feroze Varun Gandhi, the grandson of Indira Gandhi, came across the footlights articulating the most unacceptable and illegitimate thoughts and ideas that defy all codes of civil behaviour. It is unbelievable that one can discredit and abuse one community to curry favour with another, and then deny having said all those dreadful things. To think that a young man belonging to the new generation, who has had the privilege of the best possible education and has grown up in a respectable family with strong middle class values, is able to even utter what he has been accused of in Pilibhit beats the imagination. It reveals the way in which desperation to win a seat can bring out the most horrific truths. Political rhetoric had reached an all-time low with Gandhis manic outburst. Will the Election Commission ensure that the rule of law prevails? Or will it merely reprimand the candidate and accept an apology?        
	Anything goes  this has become the mantra in India today. There is a breakdown of ethics, a deterioration of values, a constant crossing of the line that delineates good from evil, and it is the leaders, men and women in public life, who have no compunctions about breaking the law and behaving inappropriately. It is they who define the parameters of our societal crisis. The country has been let down, corrupted and abused by this breed of very important persons. Will there be a political cleansing? Are the cracks we are witnessing symbolic of a breakaway and the beginning of renewal? Is this the muck must rise to the surface syndrome, which becomes apparent before the restoration of dignity and a well-mannered intellectual discourse kicks in? What our leaders seem to have ignored is the massive impact of television on the people of India. Visuals speak, and gross words from the mouths of rulers radically reduce their social and political stature.                
	Farcical game        
	How live television coverage has affected the average Indian citizen will take some time to become apparent, and to manifest itself in the vote. First, there needs to be an alternative, a new face with clean values, simple thoughts and the capability of taking decisive action. Early hesitations to vote for an unknown entity will cease over the months, and chances are that in the election that follows this one, change, maybe even an overhaul, is bound to happen. There is a generation waiting and raring to go. It will not be stifled by incompetence and devious manipulation. When it asserts itself, it will knock the wind out of all the simplistic and obvious equations that have dominated the political narrative in India over the last few decades.        
	Present-day political rhetoric across all parties is predictable, repetitive and only proves that the politicians are in denial, wallowing in the comfort of their environment as long as the people permit them to continue their jig. We need a leader  an individual who can galvanize us to change course, who can lead with conviction, can promise change and can excite the majority of Indians. The country is yearning for an alternative. It is only a minority of musclemen who want the status quo to persist forever as they exploit and rule.        
	Our political players are stuck in a number game. The issues at hand are far larger and more substantial than they seem to be able to comprehend. Their Ring a Ring o Roses is farcical, an insult to India. Their personal desperation to either stay in power or to become the prime minister makes a complete mockery of the top job and other top jobs. Their self-importance is laughable. Their level of performance is abysmal. However, they have certain skills in common with one another. These are opportunism and political manipulation to serve the self and the loyal minions.

	It is odd that an exit strategy should be made up almost entirely of entrenchment. On the face of it, that is what Barack Obamas new policy in Afghanistan envisages. It entails a further surge in troops (4,000 in addition to 17,000), more investment in the region (through non-military aid to Pakistan and all possible aid to Afghanistan) and, surprisingly, a dramatic increase in civilian assistance to promote nation-building in Afghanistan. This embedding of the United States of America, and, by default, members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, is being carried out with the intention to get closer to the goal of finally quitting the region after having fulfilled the primary objective of defusing the threat posed by al Qaida. Mr Obama, in fact, has tried to clarify the American goal in Afghanistan. The surge in troops, money and human resources is to secure an exit, but a responsible one. So together with the defeat of al Qaida, what is being emphasized is the strengthening of civil institutions (through training), and of the security system, so that a condition conducive to withdrawal can be created and sustained. On the other side is the invariable emphasis on adding muscle to the Afghanistan army, coupled with the new strategy to wean the moderate Taliban away from the hardcore ones through dialogue.         
	Mr Obama is undoubtedly a pragmatist. He does not shrink from imbibing the lessons learnt by the previous US administration in the conduct of war, neither does he hesitate to add his own unique touch to a policy that has raised hackles within his own team. The success of the policy, however, hinges on factors other than Mr Obamas pious intentions. For one, conditions within Afghanistan are largely dependent on whether Hamid Karzai retains the presidency and whether the Americans are able to control him effectively (or as ineffectively as before). Two, the much celebrated objective of talking with the enemies is predicated less on USs willingness to talk and more on the formers unwillingness to engage in any conversation with infidels. There is also the problem of knowing whom to talk to. Three, the obduracy of Pakistan. Strangely, the new strategy seems to give more thought to Afghanistan than to dealing with Pakistan and its reluctance to engage in the war on terror more earnestly in the absence of the Kashmir factor. Four, the expectation that Russia, Iran and China will abide by their appointed roles instead of playing spoilers in the great game.        
	What is common to all these four factors is the shadow of uncertainty. Past certainties of American policy have evaporated. Mr Obamas realpolitik might become the maximization of the uncertain.

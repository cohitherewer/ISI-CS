	Unjust reward                  
	Sir  Elite, urban Indians still blindly follow some age-old customs. For instance, they offer tips or baksheesh to ensure that they are treated well. Employees at five-star hotels often receive generous tips, and credit card bills also have a space allocated to write down the tip amount. The government should acknowledge A.P.J. Abdul Kalams view that payments made with a hidden purpose degrades a persons integrity. The government should therefore impose a ban on the practice of paying and accepting tips.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

      
	Clear the roads          
	Sir  The Supreme Court judgment temporarily barring the building of places of worship on roads for all religions is historic and should be welcomed by all communities across religious lines (Bar on new shrines of all religions on roads, Sept 30). Such structures cause traffic snarls and are a hindrance to development work, if any. In most cases, the people who erect such unauthorized structures in the name of religion have nothing to do with piety. They use these shrines to grab land for a steady source of income. The state governments should now make sure that the existing shrines are removed or relocated.          
	Thousands of places of worship exist in India, and the people do not need to go to illegal shrines to pray. They can either pray at authorized places of worship or at home. The almighty will be pleased if the faithful stay clear of illegal shrines that inconvenience people.          
	Yours faithfully,       
S. Balakrishnan, Jamshedpur

      
	Sir  The Supreme Courts order on illegal places of worship is a step in the right direction. In India, there are plenty of shrines that have been built illegally on public places such as roads, parks and suchlike. This encroachment on public areas for worship creates problems for the common people. The administration turns a blind eye to such illegal constructions in the name of maintaining peace. But by doing so, it encourages the unlawful activities of local hoodlums or religious zealots who have the blessings of politicians. The government should take a cue from the apex courts orders and stop such violations. It should be kept in mind that religious freedom, although a fundamental right, cannot be allowed to disrupt normal life in a civilized society.                    
	Yours faithfully,        A. Roy Mukherjee,Calcutta                    
	Sir  The manner in which religious structures have been built indiscriminately on roads cannot be justified on any count. With the concerned authorities remaining silent on the issue, despite the power vested in them to stop such constructions, it was imperative that the Supreme Court intervened to solve the problem. Religious shrines built illegally often come in the way of development and is a matter of concern.           
	In our country, there is little coordination between religious bodies and the government, which only makes matters worse. For instance, in Bengal, an extension of a runway could not be built in the Calcutta airport as a mosque stood in the way. Unfortunately, neither the government nor any religious body came forward to solve this particular problem. Such issues are often guided by emotions rather than by logic, and they need to be handled responsibly. The government should appoint a special body to resolve the issue at the earliest.          
	Yours faithfully,         Jayanta Datta,Chinsurah, Hooghly

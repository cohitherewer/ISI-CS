The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Politics, good and bad
                                                                                                                 POLITICS, GOOD AND BAD                          - The Congress is either in denial or in Cloud-cuckoo-land        SWAPAN DASGUPTA                                                  
	It has become customary for an alienated intelligentsia and sanctimonious editorial class to berate the absence of real issues from the election campaign. Television anchors who go gush-gush over Priyanka Gandhis sombre pronouncements on brother Rahuls likely post-poll alliances have habitually snubbed bewildered party spokespersons for failing to rise above something called petty politics. Young op-ed writers, fresh out of some American college, have drawn unfavourable comparisons between the discordant din of rival candidates and the focused approach of their latest poster boy, President Barack Obama. Why cant we have leaders like Obama? is a question often encountered among those who measure success through the per capita distribution of modern shopping malls.        
	The articulation of dissatisfaction with the culture of politics may leave a lot to be desired. Yet, there is something to be said for those who genuinely believe that Indian democracy is dysfunctional because it is centred on what old-style Marxists loved to call false consciousness. The contention is that, unlike some more compact democracies, Indian voters exercise uninformed choice. The assumption is that issues of caste or religious identity and purely local issues have no place in the election of the government at the Centre.        
	In a strange sort of way, Bill Clintons famous jibe  Its the economy, stupid  has come to personify the ideal true consciousness voters are expected to display while voting. Deviations from this path of economism naturally invite the ire of those who have assumed the role of custodians of the national spirit. By this logic, it is good politics for parties and voters to be concerned with Singur and Nandigram but bad politics to be swayed the nativism of Raj Thackeray and the somewhat tasteless invocation of Hindu interests by Varun Gandhi. As the hoardings in Ranchi sponsored by a Hindi newspaper put it starkly, Do you want more IITs or more temples?              
	Assuming, for the sake of argument, that this definition of wholesome politics is accepted, it is instructive to assess the 2009 election campaign in terms of its ability to raise relevant issues, that is, those that have a direct bearing on the material wellbeing of voters.        
	On April 11, at a press conference in Bangalore, the chief economic adviser to the finance ministry, Arvind Virmani, asserted that it was absolutely essential to counter the worst recession in 60 years. Virmanis intervention was brutally candid: unlike others in the government, he used the dreaded R-word quite unequivocally. Hitherto, P. Chidambaram had fallen on the mantra that the fundamentals of the Indian economy are strong to brush away the dip in the Sensex and the ever-cautious Pranab Mukherjee had preferred meltdown to describe the present economic uncertainties.        
	Virmanis admission of a deep recession in India, quite predictably, never made it to the Breaking News of TV news channels. It was discreetly tucked away in the business pages of general newspapers. Likewise, the news that Indias most high-profile information technology company, Infosys, had issued pink slips to 2,100 permanent staff in April didnt become a big talking point  unlike the proposed dismissal of 1,900 Jet Airways staff last October. True, Infosys cited indifferent performance as the reason behind the dismissals but this looks like a piece of adroit spin. The fact is that all over India there has been a wave of unpublicized job losses and enforced pay cuts. It has generated a wave of fear, experienced by those who have lost jobs and those fearful of losing theirs.        
	There are no reliable estimates of the quantum of job losses in the past eight months or so. The estimates vary from the laughable government admission of five lakh redundancies to the figure of 1.5 crore put out by the Bharatiya Janata Party in its advertisements. The estimates also dont take into account the salary cuts and imposition of shorter working week by companies that have seen a loss in business. Nor does it take into account the load-shedding of manpower in the non-organized sectors such as retail and household services. A shopkeeper employing three helpers has quietly let go of one while the executive who was employing a chauffeur has been compelled to drive to work himself. And, finally, there is the sharp shrinkage of demand, both skilled and unskilled, in the construction industry.        
	The prime minister, Manmohan Singh, enjoys an exaggerated reputation as an economist but he has earned some brownie points for his constant invocation of inclusive development. It is, therefore, odd that he has chosen to conveniently gloss over this tragic human problem. The prime minister and his party, it would seem, is either living in denial or Cloud-cuckoo-land  trying to obfuscate the problem with ridiculous seven per cent growth projections. Indeed, the denial has merged with insensitivity. A new Congress TV appeal and outdoor publicity portrays a burst of energy (josh) as the aam admi celebrate the governments economic success. The misplaced bacchanalia is on par with Marie Antoinettes advice to eat cake.        
	Economists are known to be unappreciative of popular concerns. The prime minister, it would seem, is no exception. So enmeshed is he in the tax-and-spend culture of a statist party that he saw it fit to denounce, at last weeks interaction with women journalists in Delhi, the BJPs espousal of a low tax, low interest rate regime. With a fiscal deficit that has already touched more than 10 per cent of the gross domestic product and government debt at an unsustainable 80 per cent of the GDP, this was the clearest indication that a future Manmohan-led dispensation will have tax increases high on the agenda.        
	It is a measure of the Oppositions failure that it did not make this its the economy, stupid election. The BJP was right to hit at Manmohans weaknesses through its strong leader, decisive government campaign. Where the BJP faltered was in not anticipating that the Congress would cash its media IOUs and launch a full-scale assault on L.K. Advanis own credentials. At the time of the first phase of polling, a sustained offensive by the prime minister, the Congress president and the heir apparent has seen the focus shift to the challenger rather than the incumbent.              
	The Congress has done something quite interesting. On the plea that it is the only party that practises good politics, that is, dwell on development and economic matters, it has mounted an attack on its opponent that is exclusively centred on bad politics  the blame-game over Kandahar. It has quite deliberately tried to shift the agenda away from the economy, including Advanis campaign against loot in Swiss banks. For a man who was said to be most comfortable interacting with fellow economists and donnish leaders such as Gordon Brown, the sheer imperatives of political survival has forced Manmohan Singh to fall back on bad politics.        
	If the BJP succeeds in the coming weeks to invoke the subliminal fear of recession in the electorate and highlight its low tax promise, it could yet push the Congress to the back foot. The prime minister is innately not strong in political sparring  the reason he shied away from a debate with Advani  but he has been forced into this unlikely role because he is most vulnerable in his area of core competence.        
	India is suffering from a monumental loss of hope and a slide into pessimism. Quite inexplicably, the Opposition isnt even exploiting this dramatic mood shift.

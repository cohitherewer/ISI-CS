The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | deal and ideal
                                                                                                                 DEAL AND IDEAL                                                    
	The voice of idealism has disappeared from politics. It was thus refreshing to hear the president of the United States of America, Barack Obama, speak of a world that would be free of nuclear weapons. The idealism was, however, laced with realism, for Mr Obama admitted that his vision of a world beyond the bomb may not be realized in his lifetime. Cynics and sceptics will be quick to point out that Mr Obama added that as long as nuclear weapons exist, the US would hang on to some of its nuclear weapons as a deterrent. That Mr Obama is not playing to the gallery should be clear from the fact that he and his Russian counterpart, Dmitry Medvedev, have already agreed to cuts, albeit not drastic ones. What is equally significant is that both of them agreed to the establishment of new rules by the end of 2009 for the counting of nuclear weapons. A beginning has been made to match the rhetoric with the deed. Mr Obama is willing to take other steps. He said he will resubmit the comprehensive test ban treaty for ratification to the Senate and will begin negotiations to stop the prohibition of fissile material for military uses.        
	The Indian foreign policy establishment has not responded, one way or the other, to Mr Obamas speech. The election spirit has engendered a conspicuous conspiracy of silence. Yet what the US president articulated  universal nuclear disarmament  is something that India has always advocated. The point, apart from being profoundly important for reasons of humanity, has also some tactical relevance. Pakistan is nuclear-armed and is fast spinning out of political control. A call for universal nuclear disarmament can only benefit India even within the narrow confines of South Asian politics. India for its own reasons cannot remain isolated from the politics of global arms control. Mr Obamas speech was an occasion to make Indias position clear.        
	The dream of a world free of nuclear weapons immediately raises another issue. What happens to the huge stockpile of conventional weapons? After all, the nuclear bomb was only used twice; all the wars of the 20th century, big and small, have been fought on the basis of these weapons. Mr Obama, since he is dreaming, should think beyond the bomb of a world that is free from war and mindless destruction. He should push his idealism to its logical end.

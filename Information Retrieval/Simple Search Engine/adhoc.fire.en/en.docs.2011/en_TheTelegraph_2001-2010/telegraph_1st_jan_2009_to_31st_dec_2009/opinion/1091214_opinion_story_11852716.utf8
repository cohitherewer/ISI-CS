	Broken state                  
	Sir  The Centre agreeing to start the process of forming the state of Telangana is an instance of the government giving in to populism, the politics of blackmail and the fear of violence (Centre pledges Telengana starter, Dec 10). Given Indias diversity, linguistic, cultural, and, more recently, regionalistic discrimination has been on the rise, contributing to disunity and disintegration.          
	If there is discrimination and backwardness within a region, the responsibility to address and rectify such problems lies with the elected representatives of that region. As the Telangana region has 17 out of the 42 Lok Sabha seats in Andhra Pradesh, and no doubt a sizeable number of representatives in the state assembly, questions arise as to what these elected representatives were doing for the region, when coastal Andhra Pradesh and Rayalaseema have developed better. Carefully timed politicking and violent agitation, aided by the strong emotions aroused by a fast-unto-death, have resulted in the upcoming fragmentation of Andhra Pradesh.          
	Such surrender by New Delhi could encourage any other geographical region, community, or an ethnic or linguistic group to jump onto the bandwagon of separate statehood on some issue or the other, be it cultural identity or development.          
	Conceding to the popular sentiments of a region is not always good for the country. More and smaller states do not necessarily mean better administration and governance. It means more politicians, hence more corruption, more regional and linguistic chauvinism, and, in the long run, deepening secessionist feelings. Demand for a separate state, taken further, can translate into a state wanting to secede from the country. The violence-laden secessionist demand for Khalistan, in a very prosperous Punjab in the 1980s, had nothing to do with neglect or backwardness of that state.          
	New Delhi has given a very wrong signal to separatists. On the issue of Gorkhaland, the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha has already set up a voluntary body called the Gorkhaland personnel, and has tried to impose dress and conduct codes in the region. The GJM is sure to be encouraged by the Centres surrender on the Telangana issue. Escalated violence and disruption in the hills of West Bengal may just be a few steps away.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Amit Banerjee, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Separate statehood is not a panacea for underdevelopment. The crux of the problem in Andhra Pradesh is ineffective governance. Geographical dissection of existing states would merely result in political fiefdoms and perpetuate a dynastic system of politics. That, surely, is unacceptable in a federal democratic structure. More than a political audit, what is called for is a social audit which would ascertain what prevented resources from reaching the needy. The continuation of feudal social structures, a regressive mindset and corruption are largely to be blamed for the backwardness of many places in the country. These are administrative glitches that would not just vanish upon slicing states. On the contrary, they will be perpetuated.          
	The people who have been demonstrating on the streets for separate statehood could quiz their leaders as to why precious little has been delivered in the last few decades; why the peoples representatives, at both the state and the national levels, have not worked for the betterment of the people of the region.          
	This country has been betrayed by its political class. Leaders have failed to deliver, in Telangana and in other areas, and should be held accountable for the sorry state of affairs.          
	Yours faithfully,       
V.V. Sundar, Hyderabad 

                
	Sir  It is regrettable that the Centre, in its manner of acceding to the demand for Telangana, has sent out the message that political goals can be achieved through violent agitations. The state of Andhra Pradesh itself was brought into being by means of a fast-unto-death undertaken by Potti Sriramulu. Given this history, it is not surprising that K. Chandrasekhar Rao has followed a similar path. The Telangana movement started in the 1960s under the leadership of Marri Chenna Reddy. Some new states, such as Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Uttaranchal, have since been formed.          
	The Centre has acted pragmatically in agreeing to give statehood to Telangana, which has been a neglected and underdeveloped region. Outside of Hyderabad there has been no progress in the region. However, the agitation to give Union territory status to Hyderabad is fraught with danger, as this is likely to trigger similar agitations for granting Union territory status to other big cities. The Centre should not succumb to such demands, if they crop up.                    
	Yours faithfully,

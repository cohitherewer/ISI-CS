                                                                                                                 ZONE X                                                                  
	A city and its underworld charm a gamer. As a mafia don, the players assignments include shooting at police officers, sealing cocaine deals and robbery, among other things. While some of these activities may attract police attention and prove fatal to the player, good deeds such as getting people to hospital or extinguishing fires in his spare time (when not on an official assignment) can enhance the health of the player. These are some of the elements of the popular video game, GTA Vice City. The player actually need not do any of these things; he is free to just drive around the city and explore it. But most of those who play this game choose to take up the jobs that are considered unlawful.        
	It is the mindlessness of this game that attracts players. The player can just create chaos in the city whenever he is in a position to do so. The more classic games of the Eighties and early Nineties were not as mindless. Clear demarcation between good and evil was one of their features. So the player was either a super cop chasing criminals, the last man standing to save planet Earth from Martian attacks, or a hero rescuing people from Nazi camps. Even in a game like Max Payne, Max killed a lot of innocents during the course of events, but all in an attempt to avenge his murdered wife and child. Evil needed a reason to exist; in this case, a tragic back-story was supplied to justify it.        
	Video game developers place the average age of a gamer at about 30 years. Designers, therefore, do not conceptualize video games for children alone. Rating agencies expect parents to monitor the game consumption of the child, and see to it that an M-rated (M for mature) game does not fall into the hands of the young and the impressionable. At the design stage, the concern is never that there be no blood and gore present in ones gaming experience, but a vehement consensus that children most definitely be shielded from it.         
	The view that video games channelize violent behaviour (and even sexuality) in children assumes that children are inherently violent and that this streak needs curbing. This view is in direct conflict with another that says that children are violent because of their exposure to violence in the media. They emulate what they see, without discriminating between right and wrong. The case below may show how games are perceived by those who play them, and how the issue cannot be reduced to one or another of the arguments mentioned.        
	In The Sims, the player creates his own family, deciding on the kind of personality each member is to have, their professions, friends, and also their fate. It is a kind of a familial utopia. While examining torture in games, theorist Mark L. Sample studied a case where a user created a family of two persons, a couple. He locked them in a box without food, water or light source, leaving them to die. The player confessed he did this out of boredom. He tried to bend the rules without breaking them, a premise on which sportsmanship is based. Therefore, if a case is made against video games saying that they encourage violence, then why not against the more real-life sports like rugby or boxing? Shielding children from games that are grotesque does not deter them from twisting the plot devices of other more harmless games to express their darker instincts, if they are so inclined. In this, linking control of violence in children to a check imposed by adults seems a little nave.

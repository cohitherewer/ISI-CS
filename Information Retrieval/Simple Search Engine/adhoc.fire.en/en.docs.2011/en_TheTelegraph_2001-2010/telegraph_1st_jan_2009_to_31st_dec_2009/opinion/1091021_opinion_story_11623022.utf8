The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | For a cleaner state of affairs 
                                                                                                                 FOR A CLEANER STATE OF AFFAIRS                                   Sumanta Sen                              
	The external affairs minister, S.M. Krishna, and the government as a whole need not take pains to refer to maps and documents to establish the fact that Arunachal Pradesh is an integral part of India. The assembly elections, held recently in the state, should make it clear to all and sundry how deeply attached the state is to the countrys political culture. The attachment is evident not just because the state recorded the highest voter turnout, but also because money power was used during campaigning which is a feature of political life in most Indian states. The Chinese would certainly do well to take note of this. You cannot claim a region to be your own when people there are by and large hand in gloves with the supposed forcible occupiers.        
	There is no point in blaming the Congress for creating this situation just because it has been in office in Itanagar on most occasions. Other political forces have also imbibed the big money culture. Barring Tripura and Assam to some extent, the culture is also to be found in the other Northeastern states.         
	But, at the same time, there is also resistance to it. The latest evidence of such resistance could be had in Mizoram where the Church actively ensured that the election was not marred by the sight of big spenders buying votes. It was successful in this because of its widespread influence on the almost wholly Christian population. In Nagaland, where Christianity is also powerful, there is resistance building up against what is perceived by many as an alien culture.         
	Unfortunately, in Arunachal Pradesh, such an influence seems to be missing. The famed Buddhist monastery at Tawang is obviously less interested in things temporal. In the absence of a moral guardian, it is not uncommon to hear allegations of voters having been lured to the polling stations in Arunachal Pradesh.                 
	Faith matters        
	The Northeastern states are small, and have little industrial activity. So where do the politicians get this kind of money that can be spent at will? The answer lies in the strong politician-contractor nexus in the region. The shriller the cry for development, the wider is the smile on the faces of these two classes of people. Development means government spending, which, in turn, implies fatter individual purses. Such smiles will not disappear as long as development is seen as the best way of countering insurgency. Indeed, it is perceived by many that insurgency is actually kept alive by those who stand to gain from it.        
	Arunachal Pradesh has its share of the threat. The National Socialist Council of Nagaland (Isak-Muivah) as well as the Khaplang faction are active in the state. Both groups enjoy money power, which is bolstered by the earnings from opium smuggling from neighbouring Myanmar. In places near the border of that country, opium is manufactured in peace as the writ of the military junta does not run much beyond Yangon. It is doubtful if the trade in opium within Arunachal Pradesh could have continued had the political, bureaucratic and security establishments been more alert.         
	In such a context, the results of an election become irrelevant. What does it matter if a party or combination of parties rules in Itanagar for the next five years unless the basic issue of moral cleansing is addressed? The Church often comes under fire in the Northeast. In Tripura, for instance, it has been accused of encouraging fissiparous tendencies in the past. But in Mizoram, it played the vital role of a watchdog.         
	The Church and the other religious bodies will be rendering yeomen service by playing the same role elsewhere if the non-religious establishment fails to perform its tasks.

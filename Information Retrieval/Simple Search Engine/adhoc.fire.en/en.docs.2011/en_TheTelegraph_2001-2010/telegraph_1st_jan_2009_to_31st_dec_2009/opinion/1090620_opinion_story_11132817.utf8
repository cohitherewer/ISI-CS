The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | The truth about survival
                                                                                                                 THE TRUTH ABOUT SURVIVAL                                  Theatre - Ananda Lal                                                  
	Cricket crazies distraught over our T20 debacle must see Nat-rangas Gulbaj  The Man of the Match to restore their smiles. After Sohan Bandopadhyays last effort, Megapod, got unceremoniously castled by its utterly incredible sci-fi storyline, the dramatist-director hits back with this classical straight drive through Indians sporting passion into the audiences hearts.        
	Gulbaj  no relation of Umar Gul  is Jahar Das, a widower obsessed with cricket who has never done anything in life. But he remembers minutiae of cricketing history with statistical precision. He also recounts highly creative tall-tales of how he rubbed shoulders with various icons, from Gavaskar to Ganguly. For example, he claims to have advised Chandi Ganguly about an error in Souravs backlift, and Ganguly senior called his son abroad to bring it to his attention. Sourav acted upon it, rectified his technique, and immediately began scoring centuries. Such googlies delivered by Jahar with a straight face stun everyone.        
	He has a problem, however, with the neighbourhood television mechanic, Somnath. He cannot do without him because Somnath repairs the trouble-prone set on which he watches every variety of cricket, but he cannot do with him because his daughter loves Somnath, whom he does not consider good enough for her. To improve his financial condition, Somnath goes for broke, purchasing a large consignment of televisions wholesale to sell during the demand for the upcoming World Cup. Now, we all recall with sorrow what happened to India at the last Cup. So Somnath finds himself bankrupt, saddled with sets that nobody wants to buy. At this low point, Jahar comes to the rescue, reverse-swinging anecdotes like a pro, ethics be damned.        
	Bandopadhyay sustains our interest in the double plot, overcoming the middle-overs slack in which plays tend to get bogged down. The man of the match, Swapan Roy (shadowbatting in the picture), gives an inspired performance of lying as an art. He looks like Gundappa Vishwanath gatecrashing into todays Team India and single-handedly winning the T20 final. The supporting cast does well, particularly Subrata Bandyopadhyay as Jahars sceptical old friend, and Sandip Dey putting on a Punjabi accent as Somnaths Sikh acquaintance. The slog over proves the matchwinner where Jahar presents his philosophy: at that stage, he says, a man has no choice but to step out and hoist the remaining deliveries for sixers with all that he has got. The problematic message: survival is more important than truth.        
	If only Team India had taken motivating lessons from the Gulbaj before playing England and South Africa!

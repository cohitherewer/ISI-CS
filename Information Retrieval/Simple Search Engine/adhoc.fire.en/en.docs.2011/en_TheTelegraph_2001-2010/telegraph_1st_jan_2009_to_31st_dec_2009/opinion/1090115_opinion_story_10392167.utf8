The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | not in but out
                                                                                                                 NOT IN BUT OUT                                                                  
	For years, I watched a woman coming home from work, spitting with finality and satisfaction just before her doorstep as she entered. She would have created a gigantic blancmange of daily oral evacuations before her own door, had not spit been easy to trample or absorb. She seemed to be cleansing her system of the ugliness of the day, or just indulging a bad habit. But is there always a dividing line between the two? The enthusiastic tongue-cleaner  whose hawking roars and resounding thumps of spit assault the sleepy ears of less hygiene-minded mortals  is confident of his personal cleanliness. He is ejecting the sound and substance of his inner-body dirt into the shuddering environment in emulation of his forefathers, who lived in different surroundings among different community practices, followed rigid rules of personal purification in rituals, and had a different understanding of physical and environmental realities, of pollution and of cleanliness.        
	When we throw garbage out of the window, without a glance at the passers-by, we feel this same satisfaction. We have emptied our home of dirt; that little mound of garbage before our doors is not ours any more. Neither is the street ours, it is other peoples. The kitchen is clean as long as the person who cleans our bathroom does not enter it, and as long as the garbage is not in but out. The mix-up is basic. A culture that once insisted that those who had crossed the seas must ingest cowdung and the animals urine to be cleansed finds it too intellectually taxing to disentangle the crossovers of dirt and cleanliness, the symbolic and the real, the personal and the public. One man carrying a vessel full of excreta on his head to demonstrate what was clean and what was polluted had attacked the root of the mix-up: he was Vivekananda, he could be deified and safely put aside.        
	Calcutta is filthy not because there are more people than the city can accommodate, not because Calcuttans are tolerant of administrative failure, but because they are okay with it. We dont notice the garbage on the street because thats where it should be, we dont mind men urinating on walls because if cows urine is pure whats so wrong with mens? As long as they dont urinate on walls with pictures of Shiva, Kali or Christ. And it is only natural that drivers on Calcutta roads will spit every time they breathe in foul air; they are cleaning themselves.        
	But all the spitting in the world will not heal our lungs. Polluted air can yet do what nothing else has been able to: breach the comforting division between inner purity and outer dirt. The smoke I exhale from my cigarette creates an intimate physical bond with my neighbour, reaching the inmost niches of his lungs. By this logic, drivers of autos, buses and trucks are some of my most intimate friends. We are realizing with shock that dirt outside may actually matter. It is not a question of aesthetics or ethics, it is a matter of life and death. Perhaps in Calcutta, more than anywhere else in the world, the air we breathe is what we are. And what will happen to the cowdung?                    BHASWATI CHAKRAVORTY

                                                                                                                 BITTER HARVEST                                                    
	Swift turnarounds are now the trademark of the Pakistan government. After hedging for more than a month, it changed its mind overnight on Indias claims about the origins of the Mumbai terror attack. The change in Pakistans policy of combating terror within its own borders was as abrupt. Days after a high-level security meeting led to the decision to push on with the operation to free Swat of militants, the administration radically capitulated to extremist diktats. The provincial government has signed a deal with the Tehrik-e-Nifaz-e-Shariat-e-Mohammadi, a notorious militant group, promising to implement the sharia law. In return, the Taliban, whose Swat chapter the TNSM actually represents, has pledged ceasefire for a few days. The deal has been endorsed by the Pakistan president himself, and is likely to be used as a precedent to buy peace elsewhere in northwestern Pakistan.         
	It is obvious that neither Asif Ali Zardari nor his allies in the Awami National Party  for which the people of the region had voted overwhelmingly in defiance of the Islamists earlier this year  can see this as an abdication of their democratic and moral responsibility. As for the people, on whose behalf this decision has been taken, it is quite another story. It is unlikely to bring them peace. No measure taken by governments to promulgate sharia  be it in 1994 or 1999  has been enough to placate the Islamists. This time will be no exception, which means there can be no end to hostilities. Besides, the deal will cruelly deny the population the civil liberties that the ANP had promised. The gutted girls schools, the ban on singing, dancing, watching television, the daily beheadings for un-Islamic activities are evidence that a reign of terror is in place. Despite the assurance of the ANP government that the new order will be less severe than that in talibanized Afghanistan, it is unlikely that life will be kind. With the elected representatives on the run and the operations of the army severely compromised by the ethnic and religious loyalties of its personnel, there is even less chance of that happening. For the Pakistan government, which represents an Islamic State wedded to the principle of upholding the sharia, the concessions given to the TNSM might be a small price to pay. From the perspective of the people, it amounts to a sell-out.

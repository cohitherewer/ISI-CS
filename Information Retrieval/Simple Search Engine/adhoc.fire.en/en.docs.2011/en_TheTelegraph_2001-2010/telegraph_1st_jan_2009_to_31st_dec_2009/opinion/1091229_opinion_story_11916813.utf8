	Ramachandra Guhas Our atom state (The Telegraph, December 5) mixes up nuclear power generation in the country with multi-disciplinary research and development in the Central department of atomic energy. Indias first nuclear power station started operating in 1969 and no one could have visited the plants in operation in 1967. The technological development which the country has achieved, in a self-reliant manner, needs to be put in perspective.        
	Nuclear power generation commenced as a government activity and it entered the commercial domain in 1987 with the formation of the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited, a public-sector enterprise under the DAE. The activities of the NPCIL are examined regularly by parliamentary committees including the committee on public undertakings and the parliamentary standing committee on science and technology, environment and forests. The accounts of the NPCIL are subject to audit by the comptroller and auditor general of India, apart from internal and external audits in accordance with statutory provisions. The annual reports are on the website, www.npcil.nic.in.        
	Starting with six reactors in 1987, the company has 17 reactors today, five in advanced stages of construction. It has accumulated reserves of Rs 12,500 crore. The company is AAA-rated and has been executing projects without any budgetary support from the Government of India for the last five years. The NPCIL has to its credit more than 305 reactor-years of safe operation of nuclear power stations. It has been making profits and paying dividend regularly to the government.        
	The average tariff of nuclear power in 2008-09 at Rs 2.34/kWh amply demonstrates the competitiveness of nuclear power compared to thermal power stations away from coal mines, the only other mode for base load generation in the country. The completion of TAPP-4 and 3 and Kaiga-3 in 2005, 2006 and 2007 has also demonstrated NPCILs capability to set up new nuclear power projects in a period of about 5 years, maintaining international standards. The performance of power stations has been peer-reviewed by the World Association of Nuclear Operators, which evaluates performance indicators in operation and safety in most of the worlds nuclear power stations. The performance indicators of Indian nuclear power plants have been comparable to those elsewhere. The high Capacity Factors at which the fleet was operated in 2002, resulting in the NPCIL fleet of reactors leading the world CFs and one power station being declared the best operating station in the world, attest to the commercial maturity the NPCIL has reached. The international players recognized this and offered to cooperate as equals. India is one of the few countries in the world to have live nuclear technology and is poised to take full advantage of the supply chain for the global nuclear renaissance.        
	While the solar and wind options have immense potential, the demand for energy is huge. Nuclear power has a role in base load generation. Many ways of mixing energy can be developed for meeting the demand. But no scenario can be complete without nuclear power.

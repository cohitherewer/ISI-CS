The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | What the walls can never tell
                                                                                                                 WHAT THE WALLS CAN NEVER TELL                                  DIFFERENT PICTURE                                            
	Niranjan Chitrakar is filled with a strange trepidation every time he draws the hammer-and-sickle on a wall. Niranjan, a patua by profession, is also a graffiti artist taking part in Lakshman Seths electoral campaign in Tamluk. Niranjans unexplained fear has nothing to do with the quality of his work, which is faultless: the lines appear in perfect symmetry, the colour just the right tinge of red. His discomfort, he knows, lies with the changing nature of the party and its symbols which he holds close to his heart even after all these years.        
	In a passage in the essay, Photography and Electoral Appeal, Roland Barthes argues that electoral photography presupposes a kind of complicity. Niranjans art  his slogans, the pictures he has painted and the rhymes he has written  when used in the service of the electoral campaign, has so far also facilitated this kind of complicity between the electorate and the elected. But now, an unbridgeable distance separates him from what he creates through his art.        
	Even as he works, carefully dipping his brush in paint before he begins to write slogans, his brows knit together in concentration, Niranjans mind wanders to a different time: the days of the Tebhaga andolan and the heroic struggle of the undivided Communist Party workers against the exploitative landlords. Even now, in the silence of a village night, Niranjan seems to hear the fiery slogans and imagine the flushed faces of that past time. Langol jaar jomi tar (the land is his who holds the plough), he had heard a procession shout one morning. It had changed his life and his art forever.        
	But then he reminds himself that the times are different now. A party that had once promised an equal world has now divided up his own world. Niranjan has noticed that, in his village, the poor seldom get the benefits promised in the Antyodaya or the Janani Suraksha schemes. The artist community too has not been given the unemployment allowance, medical insurance and separate identity cards that the chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, had promised once. BPL cards are available, but the price for them is a discreet silence.        
	This silence weighs like a stone. Sometimes, it chokes Niranjan and other artists around him. He recounts the story of a baul who wanted to pen a song on the theft of Tagores Nobel. Hearing his plea, the local committee tersely reminded him that he should stick to devotional songs. Niranjan himself has been advised to give up on his pats and songs, and take up Madhubani painting. It is a more lucrative option, he has been told. It is also perhaps less threatening.        
	But the pats are his life, as is the hammer-and-sickle, even now. Niranjan cannot forget that the party had once freed him from bondage, and given him dignity  the dignity of an unfettered and uncompromising artist. He was told to paint the world and sing about it exactly as he saw it. The party has also helped the indigenous artists and craftsmen  the makers of beni putuls as well as tushu dancers  to survive, although Niranjan knows that it can do a lot more. For instance, they have limited access to the international market for their products.        
	Indebtedness exacts its own price. Niranjan travels across Tamluk, painting pictures and singing songs, urging people to vote for the party. But he knows that he would like to paint differently, and sing other songs.         
	He does that later, as he sits with his wife at home after a long, hard day, singing quietly by the flickering light; Kelenkarir onto nai rajnitir majhe, Koto kichhu ghote jachchhe desher bhetore (There is no end to the scandalous goings-on in politics, so many things are happening in the country). There is no one to hear him at that hour, he is assured, except his wife and the lamp.                          UDDALAK MUKHERJEE

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Boots are made for walking, but they talk too
                                                                                                                 BOOTS ARE MADE FOR WALKING, BUT THEY TALK TOO                                                                  
	A cat may look at a king. But can it play kingmaker? It can. The master cat can make a millers son a marquis. It can play cat and mouse with the big bad ogre, pounce on his property to emprince the pauper, and bring home a bonny bride to boot  all this, if it happens to be wearing the boots. And although the fabulist forgets to tell us what kind of boots they were, Ill bet my boot they were a charming 24-tip affair, a pair nonpareil, of princely pedigree; for you cannot wear clogs to court.         
	Once upon a time, when kings and queens had a life outside the fairytale, the French and the English had to wear their shoes like a badge. Princes could wear their tips 24 inches past their toes. Hoi polloi had a humbler ration of two inches. In between came the burghers and the burgomasters, all shod to size.         
	The natural history of footwear tells us that shoes were being worn in the New World, some 10,000 odd years from now, when the New World was nowhere on the map of the world. That was shoddy, for how could any sensible pair of shoes be expected to find its way in the world, when that world hasnt been found yet? Alas, the way of the worldis ever wayward. The notional history has been well narrated by Tagore: King Blockhead told Counsel Egghead./ Clean the streets, for my pretty feet. Brooms went swish swash./ Into his majestys eyes flew the dust./ The world was given a wash./ The kingly feet were sullied in slush./ Could cover the world in leather,/ but would it stand the weather?/ Up came a cobbler hobbling:/ Sire, film thy holy feet,/ and the world will beat a retreat./ And so the world goes round,/ our feet firmly on, and off the ground. (My adaptation)        
	Man was born free, but is everywhere tied in strings. Salvation is in untying the shoestrings. The streets of paradise were not dusty; yet they lighted two fools the way to dusty death. Footwear became a necessity only after the Fall. Man and woman slipped, and became slipshod.         
	I slip. I try to pick me up by the bootstraps, but buckle down; I wait for Godet Godot Godin to come and pick me up, but he neglects to come. It puts you out if you cant put off what youve put on. WEAR ME, it said. Now its worn me down. It pinches me so! But I cant tell where. The shoemakers on a holiday. The tramp trundles up to give me the time of day. a va, Charlie, sez I. He reeks of the romance of old clothes. Dipping his hat, twirling his moustache, swirling his cane he is his clothes. Funny fellow, that. The tramps heart beats in his boots. Im told he ate his shoes once, the same ones he wore when he went gold-digging. His friend tried to eat him. Thought he was a fowl. But he had himself. He had his shoes for supper. Twas great fun, he said, with my foot in my mouth  dont know if he said grace  and let his friend be. But his shoes found him back again. And their soles were one. They were twins. Thrown into the world. Who happened to be there, at that time, at that place, only just. I draw the blinds, and look. A pair of shoes looks back at me. A painted pair on a painted sky. A soiled sky. A canvas sky. The painter was a tramp too. His friend, the painter Paul, in whose room the painting hung before he trotted off to Tahiti, said Vincent was his shoes. But arent they a peasants shoes? Whatever. Whoever. No worry. The shoes are wise. They dont say wear me. They say.but let that be.                    ANIK SAMANTA

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A New Life for the Old Fat Cats
                                                                                                                 A NEW LIFE FOR THE OLD FAT CATS                                  Stephen Hugh-Jones                              
	Britains House of Commons does not include as many members with criminal records as the new Lok Sabha, if one is to believe some eagle-eyed Indian election-watchers. Well, not yet: if Britains voters got their way, many of its sitting MPs would soon be behind bars.        
	The London Telegraphs tales of MPs expenses reclaimed from public funds have shocked even cynics like me: luxuries  jacuzzis or top-range television sets, for instance  supposedly necessary for some shysters second home in his constituency (yet, often enough delivered, oddly, to his main home in London, or vice versa); interest costs on second-home mortgages that had already been paid off; and much, much more.        
	All of it aided by an economy with the *truth startling even from politicians. One high-level minister enjoyed a 50 per cent discount on the local property tax on his constituency house for its zero occupancy, even while telling the Commons it was his second home  and crowned this by mistakenly reclaiming from the Commons payments of 100 percent of that tax.                
	Nice touch        
	Still, our self-enriching MPs have enriched the language too. As they have for years. Terminological inexactitude was long the jokey parliamentary phrase for lying; being economical with the truth is a newer one. A recent minister minted unfit for purpose for the shambolic department he had inherited. However ungrammatical, it has joined the language. Now, error of accountancy will surely become a standard euphemism for cheating, and within the rules  as many of these expenses technically were  will mean stretching the rules to breaking point and beyond.        
	The nicest touch is a new meaning for the verb flip. Flipping long figured in colloquial British speech for a less seemly adjective also beginning with *f. America more recently gave us flip, suddenly to lose ones temper or common sense. Now theres a new flip: an MP flips his second home when he alters his designation of that expenses-allowable dwelling from house A to house B as suits his wallet. Flipping is the noun.        
	Some MPs have flipped from their London flat to their country mansion: refurnish the flat, reclaiming the costs; then flip, get your ancestral lawns mown and oaks pruned, and claim for that. Some have used flipping to finance property development: buy tatty house A as your second home (mortgage-interest costs paid by the taxpayer), swiftly tart it up (refurbishment costs ditto) and resell at a profit (kept by yourself  and free of capital gains tax if you tell the taxman it was actually your main home); then buy house B, and repeat the process; and so on.                
	Steaming ahead        
	As those examples show, the grammar of the new usage is still fluid. You can flip second homes, or flip house A for house B; or simply flip, the verb becoming intransitive; or flip from A to B, or between the two.        
	Novelties apart, the scandal, in reinforcing the old stereotype of politicians, has revived some old phrases that go with it. Just as bonus-bloated executives have recently given fresh life to the 80-year-old fat cats, so have our errant MPs to fingers in the till and snouts in the trough. Shenanigans and monkey business are back in print, and the gravy train is steaming ahead. To reflect the sheer scale of the looting, Ive proposed anglicizing that last, American-born, metaphor into the roast beef, two veg and gravy train. Not for use in India, of course  idioms must know their place  but I hope it catches on.

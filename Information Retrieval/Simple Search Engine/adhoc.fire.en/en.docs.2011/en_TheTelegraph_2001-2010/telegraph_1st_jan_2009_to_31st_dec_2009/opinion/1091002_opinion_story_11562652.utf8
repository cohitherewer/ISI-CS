The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Getting Real
                                                                                                                 GETTING REAL                                                    
	In politics there are no permanent enemies or friends; the game is only about permanent interest. It is good that the Congress has finally acted on this simple truth in order to take control of the just-elected Siliguri municipal corporation. Its critics may charge the party with deserting its ally, the Trinamul Congress, and winning power with the help of its Leftist enemies. For a rebuttal, the Congress has only to recall the historic handshake between the dogged anti-communist president of the United States of America, Richard Nixon, and Chinas chairman, Mao Zedong. The Congress-communist handshake in Siliguri may be a small affair in comparison. But it does reconfirm the unreality of seeing politics in absolutist terms. The Siliguri decision suggests that the Congress in West Bengal is at last getting its act together. Its abject surrender to Mamata Banerjee over the seat-sharing talks for the Lok Sabha polls, and the bypolls thereafter, demoralized its activists and supporters. The way Indias biggest national party was forced to accept humiliating terms set by a regional party did not augur well for the alliance between them. For the partys leaders and supporters in West Bengal, this was no recipe for reviving the Congress in the state. It cannot be in the Congresss interest to see the anti-Left alliance benefit only the Congress.        
	Predictably, Ms Banerjee has cried foul over the betrayal in Siliguri. The Siliguri episode may not be the beginning of the alliances end. But Ms Banerjee has only herself to blame for this rupture. Her peremptory ways apart, she seems to be as keen to fight the Marxists as to marginalize the Congress. After a long time, the Congress has an opportunity to rebuild the party in West Bengal. It would be suicidal for it to let that hope be smothered by a bullying alliance partner. Fortunately for its leaders, the assertiveness demonstrated in Siliguri has not come a day too soon. Next year, 82 municipalities, including the Calcutta municipal corporation, go to the polls. The assembly elections follow in 2011. Another surrender to the TMC in Siliguri would have left the Congress even weaker for the bargains over seats in these polls. But the realism shown in Siliguri can also help the Congress redraw its strategies in other states. It could rethink, for example, if Mulayam Singh Yadav should remain a permanent enemy in Uttar Pradesh.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Dearer than life 
                                                                                                                 DEARER THAN LIFE                                   Raju Mukherji                              
	Sport offers unalloyed joy. If you were to sit in front of your television and think that sport is not for you, you have become a cynic, a person who has lost the battle to regain his innocence. Innocence? Yes, that is the word. To enjoy sport, one needs innocence, the innocence of childhood when one would hero-worship sportsmen without thinking of the consequences; when one was loyal without any selfish reason; when one cried because ones favourite team had lost. In those tears lay ones freedom. This was a time when ones spirit soared to the skies. You cared for no one; nothing else mattered.        
	Sport has a purity that is its very own. It is impossible to derive such pure pleasure from anything else, not even from politics, films or business, where the performers are forever trying to be something that they are not. This isnt the case with sport. Here, Mahendra Singh Dhoni has no qualms in telling people about his humble background and in wielding the bat as he did on the streets of Ranchi. In sport, players cannot but show their real selves to the world.        
	No-hopers, too, have a chance in sport. Kapils Devils won the 1983 World Cup even though no one had thought that they would win. Persecuted people have a chance to turn the tables on their tormentors: Jack Johnson and Muhammad Ali did it for the Blacks in the United States of America. Abebe Bikila took the Ethiopians and the rest of Africa to glorious heights in long-distance running.                
	Inner contradictions        
	When one supports a team, one does so not because of any conceivable reason. People want Brazil to win every time they take the field in soccer. Similarly, one roots for Roger Federer even though he doesnt care whether one is dead or alive. Yet, we do lose sleep when our favourites fail. Why is this so? It is because we adore the freedom that sport offers. We marvel at the champions, and sympathize with those who keep trying their best but are never good enough to beat the best. Milkha Singh was loved even though he never won a single medal at the Olympics. So was Gundappa Vishwanath, as well as Mushtaq Ali, who belonged to an earlier generation.        
	Sport also has in it the fear of failure. The uncertainty in sport is what makes it exciting. The audience wants a contest, and does not want the favourite to have it easy. But, at the same time, it also wants the favourite to win. Herein lies the contradiction in sport. What is more important, the contest or the result? Whatever people may say, fans only want their favourites to win. Yet, there are times of reversal too, but people continue to support their favourites. This is not merely loyalty: it is an urge to identify oneself with sporting freedom.        
	Sport is reality: Mary Kom punching her way to world championships is the stark truth. Tendulkars rasping drive too is a statement of fact. But sport can also be an illusion. Sport is all-pervading: it even exists deep in the Amazon as well as in the heart of Sahara. The early hunters and the ancient mariners were sportsmen.        
	If sport were to lose its innocence or its mystery, it will lose its charm. It will become a business venture full of political overtones and filmi glamour. Shameless cricketers have been known to fix matches to earn hefty amounts. They were dancing to set tunes; minting money and selling their nation. They were traitors enacting a farce. Today, one can still find such people in politics, business and in films.        
	Sport, in a way, is about love and grief. Sport is camaraderie as well as a contest. Some people think sport is life and death. No, sport is much more important than those, as a renowned soccer manager had once said. Only when one is sad does one know that he or she is alive and aware. Sport makes one sad in order to keep one alive.

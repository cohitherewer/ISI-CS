                                                                                                                 SQUARE WHEEL                                                    
	The release of the United Nations Human Development Report 2009  and the accompanying human development index  on October 5 raises an interesting conundrum: are socio-economic development and human development the same thing? When the HDI was first introduced in 1990, many economists  including T.N. Srinivasan of Harvard University  had called it another redundant indicator measuring aspects of development that had already been extensively examined and studied. Consider this years HDI. If one looked at Indias ranking on the HDI in 1999 and compared it to that in 2009, nothing much seems to have changed. India was ranked 132 out of 177 countries then, and is ranked 134 out of 182 countries now. China was ranked 92 then, and is ranked 92 now. Yet these two countries have consistently  in Indias case over the last five years  been the drivers of global economic growth.        
	The HDI numbers seem to suggest that much of that growth has not translated into any improvement in human development outcomes. The HDI is a composite of three factors: per capita income or gross domestic product, educational attainment and life expectancy. In absolute terms, the numbers  essentially a score between zero and one  have improved, from about 0.563 to about 0.617 today for India. But what is disturbing is that the ranking has fallen from 128 in 2006 to the present 134. The decline evoked a variety of responses, from official dismissal of the HDI assessment as flawed methodology to claims by non-governmental organizations that policy failures have increased infant mortality dramatically.        
	The charge of flawed methodology has come from other quarters too. Bryan Caplan, economics professor at George Mason University, Virginia, has said that given the current methodology, even rich countries cannot improve their rankings despite the scope for economic growth and greater longevity (the United States of Americas rank dropped to 13). To quote: A country of immortals with infinite per-capita GDP would get a score of 0.666 (lower than South Africa and Tajikistan) if its population were illiterate and never went to school. The HDR has a theme: the benefits of migration (both within countries and between them) and the enabling policy environment that can maximize its benefits. Even here, some points in the report have raised the ire of Indian officials, notably that of the deputy chairman of the Planning Commission, Montek Singh Ahluwalia, who had issues with some of the data used. Many policy proposals are familiar, having been aired in other reports and papers, including many by World Bank economists. Migration is a very sensitive political issue in todays global environment, as the report also acknowledges. Most governments are likely to see it as just another reinvention of a square wheel: it wont go anywhere.

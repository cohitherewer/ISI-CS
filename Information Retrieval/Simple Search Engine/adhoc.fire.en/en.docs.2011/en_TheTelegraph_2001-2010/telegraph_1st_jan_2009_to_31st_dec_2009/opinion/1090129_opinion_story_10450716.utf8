The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | The nation with its various fragments
                                                                                                                 THE NATION WITH ITS VARIOUS FRAGMENTS                                  FINE BALANCE      Globalization can succeed only by creating a system that benefits all                          An area of darkness                                        
	A freshly sprayed graffito in New Delhis Khan Market reading, Whites and Rich Indians Only, came to mind as Jonathan Evans, director-general of Britains MI5, warned that the global recession might signal a watershed moment. Apart from a shift in the balance of power to Asia, it could result in the rise of a new generation of international terrorists targeting, as they did in Mumbai last November, the practitioners of globalization.        
	Sadly, inequality defines Indian society, making it a fertile breeding ground for a new generation of extremists. It is up to the Indian elite to take heed of Evanss warning, echoing what the Indian prime minister, Manmohan Singh, urged the greatest beneficiaries of the economic reforms to do: resist excessive remuneration and eschew conspicuous consumption. The Satyam scandal highlights the need for corporate ethics. Britains Nobel Group, a research organization, estimates that at least a fifth of Indias top 500 companies similarly resort to creative accounting.        
	Noting that there is no single path that leads people to violent extremism, Evans picked out social, foreign policy, economic and personal factors as contributing to radicalization. Another factor could be what the prime minister called the vulgar display of wealth (especially at weddings) which insults the poverty of the less privileged. Nor is this threat of radicalization confined to the cities, where the abject poverty of a vast underclass exists cheek-by-jowl with spectacular wealth.         
	Evidence that terrorists are targeting the globalized elite can be found in the Mumbai attack. Lost in the cathartic explosion of anguish, gushing emotionalism and finger-pointing at Pakistan in the wake of the atrocity, is the fact that the strike was first and foremost against the architects and beneficiaries of internationalism. The primary targets were two top hotels and a railway station. The Taj Mahal hotel serves only the most well-heeled of international visitors. The Oberoi stands on the Nariman Point, where the cost of land is higher than that in Manhattan. The railway station is the primary artery for the millions who work in the international trading houses and global financial houses that dominate Mumbais economy. In short, the targets were the global elite and the middle classes dependent on the flow of international trade.        
	Although the operation originated in Pakistan, it was only possible because of local aid and abetment. No one dares say it, but it is feared that local support was extended by Indian Muslims not because they are jihadists, but because they are economic Have-Nots constantly bombarded with images of their fellow citizens leading profligate lifestyles. Only locals with detailed knowledge of buildings, traffic conditions and police deployment could have provided the high-quality intelligence that the terrorists obviously enjoyed.         
	As the Khan Market graffito proclaimed, along with economic and social discontent, ethnicity also fuels resistance to globalization. Indias transformation into a globalized society is undoubtedly rewarding for the majority. No major political party opposes it. In the wake of the Mumbai attacks, the prime minister said that a strong sense of nationhood is needed to withstand the challenge posed by terror at social integrity. The challenge is to manage the flux of globalization by creating a social system that benefits all. India must be relevant to everyone. Not just to Whites and Rich Indians Only.                    DEEP K. DATTA-RAY

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Letters to Editor
                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Raised fingers                  
	Sir  I was shocked to read in The Telegraph that Shah Rukh Khan had asked critics, including Sunil Gavaskar, to mind your business after Gavaskar had criticized John Buchanan (SRK to critics: With due respect, mind your business, April 6). Someone needs to remind Khan that reel life is different from real life. In Chak De India, Khan is the super coach who turns his demoralized and hopeless women hockey players into world champions. But one cannot expect Buchanan to achieve what Kabir Khan (the name of Khans character in the film) did. Buchanan was a miserable failure when he coached Middlesex in the English county championship. He might have done better with the Australian national team but a side that boasts of players like Adam Gilchrist and Shane Warne does not really need a coach to succeed. What Gavaskar wrote in his column was absolutely correct and Khan, who knows next to nothing about cricket, should not have made a public statement like this against a veteran. Having a statue at the Madame Tussauds does not make Khan an international icon, especially when a young boy in remote Barbados knows not only Gavaskars name but also his record against the West Indies. My advice to Khan is that he should mind his own business and try and improve his acting skills.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Shah Rukh Khan has reportedly questioned Sunil Gavaskars knowledge about modern innovations such as the T20 cricket. The actor questioning the expertise of someone who is acknowledged to be an all-time great appears to be as ludicrous as the films we come across these days.           
	In a short story, Buddhadeb Guha had once written that Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth, is very often held to be greater than Saraswati, the goddess of learning. The incident involving Shah Rukh Khan and Gavaskar reminds me of Guhas story. Sourav Ganguly, too, should be disappointed with the actors comments. Ganguly had expressed his disapproval of John Buchanans concept of multiple-captains meekly, even though he was virtually insulted at a press conference. But he cannot dissociate himself from the Kolkata Knight Riders, perhaps because of the rewards promised by the goddess of wealth. Ganguly knows, deep in his heart, that he should have retired from cricket honourably like Gavaskar had done earlier.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Diptimoy De, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  It is painful to see Shah Rukh Khans war of words with a legend like Sunil Gavaskar. It only shows that his heart isnt in the game for if he were a true lover of cricket, he would not have criticized someone of Gavaskars stature. Gavaskar is the god of Indian cricket, and will remain one forever. It is a pity that the Bollywood star has the money to buy an entire team but does not seem to respect those who are considered to be experts.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Sudhir Mishra, Bhubaneswar 

                
	Sir  Shah Rukh Khan has rightly pointed out in no uncertain terms that since he owns the Kolkata Knight Riders, he does not want unsolicited advice from cricketing experts regarding the teams internal matters. Hopefully, the cricket gurus would take his advice and refrain from commenting on the IPL teams, which are owned by individual franchisees.           
	Yours faithfully,       
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  King Khans somewhat stern but pragmatic comment against Sunil Gavaskar is applicable to Sourav Gangulys fans who cry foul whenever they feel that their idol has been discriminated against. Ganguly set a poor example when he rushed to meet Shah Rukh Khan to save his captaincy. Ganguly should remember that it is always the prerogative of the employer to utilize the skills and services of an employee in the manner he thinks is best for the organization. Whether it was his fruitless meeting with Khan or his purported rift with John Buchanan, Ganguly is in the news for the wrong reasons these days.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Tapan Pal, Batanagar 

                
	Know the leaders          
	Sir  For the last 15 days or so, I have been watching Bengali news channels conducting programmes on the election fever. In these shows, candidates, political analysts and experts indulge in blame games shouting at the top of their voices, and put forward illogical arguments to support their myopic views. All this makes me wonder if an appraisal system can be put in place to judge the performance of electoral candidates. For instance, a new candidate should talk about his plans for the next five years, while those seeking to be re-elected should ask for votes after evaluating their own performance.           
	Some TV channels have tried to analyse how voters perceive particular candidates. But their analyses are often sketchy and biased. This sort of an attempt is futile because elections are determined by money and muscle power. Democracy in India will pass the acid test if voters are allowed to cast their votes without fear. I am yet to hear anything on crucial national issues such as the Indo-US nuclear deal, cross-border terrorism or poverty alleviation programmes. Questions are not often raised about elected parliamentarians deviating from their stated policies or statements. A lot needs to be done to instil discipline among participants, and to create transparent public opinion. The news channels should brief them about codes of conduct. They should also invite participants to speak their mind to enable the people understand their leaders better.                    
	Yours faithfully,

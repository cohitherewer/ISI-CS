The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Blame it on these men
                                                                                                                 BLAME IT ON THESE MEN                                  MALA FIDE -Malvika Singh                              
	We have been through a ridiculous farce about whether or not Valentines Day should be celebrated in India. So absurd and ludicrous have been the debate that it has left one completely dumbfounded. In a country where love of all manners, shapes and kinds has been manifest in temporal, religious and cultural traditions  ranging from sculpture and painting to music and dance  across the subcontinent and through the ages, it seems utterly illegitimate to have a band of self-appointed arbiters parading the streets of India, telling us what is morally right and wrong. The fact that there is silence from the national leadership on the issue is unacceptable, and it brings the reality of our soft, self-serving state into sharp focus, yet again.        
	Whether it is Diwali, Holi, Eid, Christmas, Easter, Mahavir Jayanti, Childrens Day, Mothers Day or Valentines Day, these are all symbolic of personal belief and celebration. The fact that these events have taken on national importance speaks of Indias plurality. The hooliganism directed at those who want to celebrate the occasion must be contained with firm resolve, and according to the law of the land. Because there is no purposeful, tough action against public offenders, and since no politician speaks out loud and clear damning these acts, miscreants continue to run amok. Maybe, it is time for India to christen one day as Rape Day, and mourn the rape of women, of the Constitution, of law and order, of probity in public life, of dignity and integrity. A day on which all Indians will wear white and black to mourn the death of civilized life and living.                 
	Keep out        
	The correctives must begin with the male species. Stop men from polluting the public space with their constant peeing, and fine them Rs 5,000 every time they pee. One never sees women peeing under a tree in urban India, though they too have bladders. Stop men from teasing, assaulting, raping and murdering sisters, mothers and daughters of India. Stop them from demanding dowry. Rectifying these three male horrors would be a great beginning towards cleansing the rot in the hugely diluted morality of India. Valentines Day is inconsequential when compared to this truth.        
	When a society is in transition, warts and bruises appear. Some turn septic, others burst forth oozing poison. India is going through a manthan, a churning and a metamorphosis. There will be all kinds of disruption, explosion, disillusionment and schism. Therefore, it is imperative for those at the helm of governance to ensure that there is absolutely no misuse of this vulnerability. Elected representatives are the protectors of society, and they must deal with social upheavals in a fair and inclusive manner, casting aside, with rigid determination, all attempts to create divisions. They must be held accountable to their oath of office.        
	We can well lead the way and show this rapidly shrinking, and insecure, world how to graciously accept diversity and honour its many strengths and the checks and balances it brings to a polarized world. When parochialism enters and imposes its limited intellectual demands on an ancient treasure house of great philosophies, learning and other fine traditions, by bullying and using crude force in place of balanced discourse and judgment, civil society and civilization itself stand endangered.        
	Much like the tiger that recently killed a trespasser for entering a prohibited area to chop wood illegally, the people of India will not tolerate this unruly, unauthorized and illicit intrusion into their private space and public domain. There is bound to be a series of social revolutions, for different reasons, in both rural and urban Bharat. We need mature, thinking leaders.

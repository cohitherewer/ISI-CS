The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Letters to Editor
                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Part of the process                  
	Sir  It is true, as the editorial, On the bench (Jan 7), points out that the Supreme Court decision of 1993 makes the appointment of high court judges an integrated participatory consultative process in which the opinion of the judiciary, symbolised by the view of the Chief Justice of India, formed in consultation with the two seniormost judges of the Supreme Court, would have supremacy. But later, on a reference by the president of India, under Article 143 (special reference of 1998), the apex court clarified that consultation with the CJI implies involving a number of judges in the process. This collegium makes the recommendation. The CJIs opinion alone does not constitute consultation.           
	Further, the collegium, while forming its views, should take into account the opinion of the chief justice of the high court concerned, and the views of other judges of the high court and the Supreme Court. Besides, the views of the judges of the Supreme Court, who were puisne judges of the high court or chief justice thereof, will also be obtained. These views shall be sent in writing to the government, along with the recommendations of the collegium. If the recommendations of the CJI do not conform to the norms of this process, they will not be binding upon the government. Judicial review will be available if the procedure is not followed or the appointee is found to lack eligibility.           
	So it is not appropriate to say that the closed shop attitude of the judiciary lacks transparency. The executive is not barred from vetoing a proposal that has failed to elicit collective wisdom as the Supreme Court advised in 1998. If cognizance is taken of the letter of the chief minister of West Bengal, it will create a dangerous precedent and tend to politicize the judiciary.                     
	Yours faithfully,         Debaki Nandan Mandal,Calcutta    
	Sir  It is a matter of concern that Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has chosen to interfere in the appointments of judges to the Calcutta High Court. The law ministry should take no cognizance of chief ministers views since, prima facie, this is a totally politically motivated move and he has no business to interfere in such appointments. If the law ministry gives in to his demands, the neutral functioning of the high court would be seriously compromised.           
	Yours faithfully,       
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The Soumitra Sen controversy revealed that the Calcutta High Courts verification of the antecedents of lawyers being elevated to judges leaves much to be desired. The process is so opaque that the possibility of error cannot be ruled out. The chief ministers letter may well have a point. The Constitution has given judges a lot of immunity. Any effort to check judicial misdemeanour should zero in on the point of entry. The judiciary in India is sensitive to public criticism, as we have seen in the contempt case against journalists of Mid Day, who had alleged that the ex-chief justice, Y.K. Sabharwal, had been involved in a real estate scam.           
	B.N. Agarwal, a justice of the Supreme Court, observed in a case that public officers should be flogged for inaction (Court therapy: Flog officials Aug 9, 2008). However, he termed the arguments of the senior counsel and former law minister, Shanti Bhusan, during the Ghaziabad provident fund case contemptuous, while they may have been, prima facie, true (Urchin and sanyasi in supreme fireworks, Aug 8, 2008). Instead of directly interrogating judges involved in that case, the police gave them questionnaires. Is not equality before law a basic tenet of the Constitution?           
	India should work out a transparent system for the induction of candidates into the judiciary. The lower judiciary, until a few years back, had the system of induction from the bar directly, but that system has since been dispensed with. If the lower judiciary can run well with lawyers recruited under the public service commission, why can the system not be followed in higher judiciary as well?                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Md. Motleb Ali, Calcutta                 
	Daily grind          
	Sir  Travelling from Garia to Baruipur has become a painful experience because of the chaotic traffic. The blame lies with hundreds of three-wheelers that run on this route every day. Most of the two-stroke autos that take this road are unregistered. The auto-drivers neither have a licence nor a road-permit. They, however, have the support of the trade unions, which, in turn, enjoy political patronage. Alongside the autos, there has also been an increase in the number of auto-stands. Local residents and passengers have to put up with rude drivers, and pollution has assumed an alarming scale.           
	A drive against two-stroke autos has been ordered all over Calcutta, but few vehicles have been seized in the citys fringes. Kamalgazi and Rajpur, two such areas, are notorious for traffic congestion. This is mostly caused by auto-drivers, who, during peak hours block the roads, causing a great deal of inconvenience. If this menace is tolerated for long, a time will come when no other public vehicle, save autorickshaws, will ply the roads.                     
	Yours faithfully,         Sarthak Ganguly,Uttarpara, Hooghly

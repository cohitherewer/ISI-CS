	The attributes of an influential power are never precise, but would certainly imply that Indias impact must spread beyond South Asia. Indias prominence in West Asia is impeded by the religious factor as well as the blocking abilities of Pakistan, Iran and Saudi Arabia. Southeast Asia is one of the few remaining areas for Indian cultural, soft-power and economic expansion, which could not materialize during the Cold War period. After India realigned its position with the post-Cold-War order, engagement with East and Southeast Asia had to be one of its priorities.         
	India had first to convince Asean that it had seen the light, and would befriend countries with which relations had been cool over previous decades. India had been perceived by Asean as close to the Soviet Union and neither really fully Western nor Asian, and Indias cultural uniqueness was not considered a positive element in facilitating its integration with Asean. The Asean way rests on personal relationships, gradual consensus-building and skirting contentious issues, whereas Indians are seen as legalistic, bureaucratic and impersonal. In other words, India was a very late starter, and had miles to go to catch up with the established presence of other big countries both from within and outside the region.         
	The Indian Look East policy accorded with the market model in place in Southeast Asia. Chinas involvement with those countries had already witnessed strong momentum, helped by people of Chinese origin who had long dominated business in at least half of the ten Asean countries. India had fallen far behind in the movement for regional integration, although the political and strategic situation on Indias southeast flank affected its security, even more so after the admission of Myanmar made Asean adjacent to Indias land border.               
	India had shown no inclination for political leadership in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, but paradoxically now wanted to go beyond South Asia and the Indian Ocean to extend its influence towards the Pacific. Indias new emphasis on the East was motivated by the China factor, its social, cultural, religious and linguistic links with Asean, and the persons of Indian origin who had a presence in the socio-political life of the region. As Indo-Asean ties increased, the role of these communities became more salient.         
	In general terms, compared with the caution of the early 1990s, India is now a reasonably confident participant in the Asia-Pacific political and strategic domain. However, in the economic sphere, India is yet to make any notable headway. The recent Indo-Asean free-trade agreement exceeded all time-lines and it remains to be seen how it will operate in practice. The leverage exercised by Indian protectionist lobbies on political circles in New Delhi should never be underestimated. In terms of intra-regional trade, in comparison with China, Korea, Japan and the Asean members, India has been insignificant. There are several shortcomings in the Indian economy, where the market is quite closed, the average tariff level high, investment environment poor, and the level of infrastructure development and external trade low, so that India is not a highly regarded commercial partner. Indias partnership with East Asia will crucially depend on its capacity for making a distinct contribution towards the progress of closer economic integration in the region.        
	While Indias economic and political contacts are formal rather than functional, its bilateral defence arrangements with individual Asean countries have assumed greater relevance. India has never clarified what genuine interests it has to defend in the region, but the Indian presence is appreciated and welcomed by Asean, an attitude based on balance of power. Asean welcomes all major powers to participate in the regional security architecture, but in its view no single power should be permitted to dominate the area. This is to Indias advantage. Because India has greater military resources to share with Asean than vice versa, defence cooperation has occurred to some degree with almost every Asean country  more so, in most cases, than with Indias neighbours in the Indian subcontinent. In contrast, there is little Chinese military involvement with Asean, other than Myanmar.         
	The Asean Regional Forum is the first multilateral security forum ever to be joined by India. It had been Indias traditional approach to keep security issues out of the scope of regional groups such as the Saarc and the Indian Ocean Rim Association, in both of whose formation it had played a key role. But with the ARF, the objective of containing China influenced India to reverse its historic position on such groupings. Competition between India and China in the region is predictable because the two countries do not enjoy mutual trust and there are overlapping perceptions of their historical spheres of influence and interest. They have made efforts to address bilateral problems with some progress recorded, but given the inherent rivalry and geopolitical interplay, the nature and degree of friction between them is a constant concern for the members of Asean.        
	There is, therefore, a competitive edge in Indias policy to achieve some kind of equal footing with China. But it will be necessary for India to draw China closer into discussions on cooperation and security in the Asia-Pacific region. The approach of containing China by aligning with some individual powers whose strategic goals and military practices do not necessarily complement ours, nor share the long-term vision of Indias relationship with its northern neighbour, will be most unwise. Indias strategic engagement with Asean should not be premised only on the China factor, and military means cannot be considered the preferred method of asserting a regional role in preference to the more valuable soft-power assets like culture, technology, IT, and trade and investment. India has taken the initial steps to being regarded as a serious partner in emerging Asia, but it has now to enhance its economic and strategic relevance that are both largely in the potential, rather than the actual, sphere.        
	India may already see itself as an influential factor in the Asean economic and security space, but this self-perception will not be shared by other major actors. Asean has differing levels of consensus on many issues including security, and many among its ten members regard India only as an Indian Ocean power and not an Asia Pacific one. Being part of the Asia Pacific is a necessity for Indias pursuit of world status and its friendly ties with the United States of America can boost that strategy. But in matters critical to Asean like the Korean peninsula, the Taiwan Straits and the South China Sea, it remains to be seen whether India has the capacity and will to be involved; for instance, it has given no significant opinion on Pyongyangs nuclear and missile experiments. In security conclaves like the six-power talks on the North Korean nuclear issue, India is not included, and if the six member ad hoc body eventually morphs into an embryonic Asian security construct, Indian relevance and participation might become a subject of contention.              
	India will be prepared to play a more energetic role, along with the West, in maintaining the security of international sea-lanes, and its ambitions may be on the right lines, but it has incrementally to enhance its economic integration with other Asian countries. India has to make much greater effort to make Asean an important stake-holder in Indian prosperity. India is still far from being an indispensable country, and the reality is that the gap between Chinas and Indias levels of engagement with Asean remains huge: no number of summit photo-opportunities for our prime minister with East Asian leaders will redress this imbalance.         
	Military contacts are not nearly as important as economic interdependence, because without such integration, it is premature to talk about any possible role for India in the security architecture in Asia. At this time, when the level of acrimony between India and China is disturbing and even reminiscent of the 1950s, it is sobering to keep in mind that in the unlikely event of a clash of arms, such international support as India receives will again come, as it did in 1962, mainly from the West, for the Wests own purposes, whereas the so-called non-aligned group of countries will at best sit on the fence or, far more likely, tilt towards our northern neighbour.

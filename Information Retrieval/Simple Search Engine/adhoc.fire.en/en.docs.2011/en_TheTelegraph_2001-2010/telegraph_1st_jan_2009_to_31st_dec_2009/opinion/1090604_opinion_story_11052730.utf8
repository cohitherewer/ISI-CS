	Each new incumbent who occupies the august chair of the minister of railways tries to leave behind a stamp of his or her genius by effecting changes for a more efficient organization.        
	The golden era of Madhavrao Scindia saw some pathbreaking innovations such as the introduction of the computerized passenger reservation system, which has grown into one of the largest such systems in the world with over 800,000 tickets being issued from its 7,000 computer terminals located all over the 64,000 kilometres of its network. The concept of superfast inter-city trains such as the Shatabdi was also evolved by Scindia. Now there are scores of them with variants such as the Jan Shatabdis connecting major cities and metros across the nation.        
	With the southern states in mind, C.K. Jaffer Sharief set in motion one of the most ambitious programmes of the century  converting over 27,000 kms of metre gauge lines to broad gauge, thereby eliminating bottlenecks during trans-shipment of goods. This task is still under way, and with limited available resources, it may take another couple of decades to get completed.        
	Nitish Kumar was perhaps the first minister to realize the enormity of the problem of haphazard planning and unbridled sanctioning of projects by successive ministers. He boldly placed on the floor of the Lok Sabha his now-famous report on railway projects that highlighted his concerns. Unfortunately, he also set about winning friends and influencing people, and in the process created seven new zones, thus increasing the tally from nine to 16 railway zones. This not only bloated the overhead costs but also disrupted the command and control structure carefully built up over the decades.        
	Mamata Banerjee, during her brief stint in office between 1999 and 2001, took the bold decision of opening up the railway network to private container train operators, although to Lalu Prasad goes the credit of actually implementing it. She also gave the green signal to the highly productive system of running double stack container trains on the non-electrified route of Jaipur-Ahmedabad-Pipavav and Bhuj.                 
	Varied challenges        
	Prasad hit upon a unique way of boosting freight-earnings by legalizing overloading of wagons way beyond the designated capacity. Although revenues skyrocketed as a result, overloaded wagons are beginning to show signs of stress and may soon start breaking down. Among Prasads chief legacies would be the six brand new production units, of which no less than five are being set up in Bihar.         
	Playing a vital role as an engine of economic growth, the Indian Railways will continue to perform a fine balancing act between being a commercial entity with revenues sufficient to maintain the required growth, and meeting its social obligation of providing the lowest possible unit cost of transport to the people.         
	The priority of the new railway minister should be the pending projects, which can be delayed but seldom deleted. She also has to make a judicious decision regarding how far passenger traffic is to be catered to, since each passenger train eats into valuable line capacity thus denying the high- revenue freights a fast passage.        
	The dedicated freight corridor, for which Prasad had the foundation stones laid for 1,483 kms in the western legs and 1,230 kms in the eastern legs, is yet to take off. Though construction work was started on a short 105 kms, the Kanpur-Aligarh section and parts of the Mughalsarai-Sonnagar route is still under tendering. The western sector has got nowhere.         
	Fortunately, the railways are not something new for Banerjee.Yet the challenges are unique and varied, and she should perhaps tackle only a few of them at a time for her efforts to be fruitful.

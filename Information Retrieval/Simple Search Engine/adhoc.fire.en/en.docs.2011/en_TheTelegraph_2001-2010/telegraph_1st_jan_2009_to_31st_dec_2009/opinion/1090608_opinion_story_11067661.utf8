The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Dont promise the earth
                                                                                                                 DONT PROMISE THE EARTH                          - An environmental agenda for Calcutta        BONANI amp; PRADEEP KAKKAR                                                  
	Going green has become quite fashionable. Politicians make speeches about it, civic agencies spend big budgets on it, company annual reports sigh with satisfaction over it and innocent schoolchildren spend eager weekends on it. And, as often happens with fashion, at the end of the day nothing much changes.         
	Calcutta cannot afford to be merely fashionable when it comes to going green. Our population and vehicular density is the highest in the country, our air quality is the worst and our noise level the highest among the major metros. Our land use planning is virtually non-existent because land has become a means for raising revenue rather than a means for delivering public good.         
	For political leaders and policymakers interested in going beyond the fashionable, Calcuttas environmental imperatives must surely be obvious. The citys need for cleaner air, for improved management of its natural assets, and for significantly higher citizen involvement in reducing carbon consumption are three areas demanding immediate and sustained attention. It is the manner in which these three areas are addressed that will determine the citys livability quotient for all, be they investors, intellectuals or itinerants.         
	The poor quality of air in our city is directly a result of vehicular emission. Owing to several steps taken over the past decade by the Central and West Bengal Pollution Control Boards, industrial pollution has lessened substantially. But the monitoring capacity and enforcement of laws for vehicular pollution have been non-existent on the facile argument that jobs are at stake.               
	But polluted air may well be driving out more jobs than are being saved by allowing substandard fuel and vehicles on our streets. We have seen it before: gheraos in the Seventies and power cuts in the Eighties may have allowed unionized workers or power-station engineers to retain their jobs but the net effect on total employment was overwhelmingly negative. The fact that deaths from cancer are almost 50 per cent higher in Calcutta compared to Delhi and that the increase in oxides of nitrogen is triggering infectious diseases in children cannot possibly be going unnoticed by businesses and families which have a choice as to where they are based.         
	Action on air quality will have to focus on qualitative and quantitative aspects of the problem. There are extreme and obvious polluters  three-wheeler tempos, battered old taxis and katatel-driven auto rickshaws  that can be easily identified and legally impounded. Tight enforcement of emission norms by contracted third parties and easier availability of cleaner fuels (principally liquid petroleum gas) are other qualitative steps that could be taken immediately.         
	The number of vehicles can be reduced by promoting car-pooling, restricting access, such as through a congestion tax or by allowing odd- and even-numbered cars to ply the streets only on alternate days. Incentives could be offered for mass transport options (such as air-conditioned micro buses) that encourage car owners to leave their vehicles at home.         
	The key point is that there are possible solutions  all these actions have produced results elsewhere  but they need to be implemented. With sincerity and sustained effort.        
	The management of Calcuttas natural assets would be the second item on the citys environmental agenda. Our water bodies, parks and open spaces, green cover and the riverside are assets that provide valuable services, such as groundwater recharging, decongestion and recreation, and preservation of biodiversity. Despite these quality-of-life enhancing benefits, their status has been marked by neglect.        
	Major public facilities such as Rawdon Square and Victoria Park have been literally locked for more than a decade on the pretext that ministers have projects in mind. The pond inside the Indian Museum was being built upon but was saved by NGOs taking legal action. Restoration, however, is not on anyones agenda. At considerable public expense, a peoples park was installed near the Victoria Memorial  but is shut for several hours of the day. A large chunk of the Maidan has been handed over to a business house that has imposed an entrance fee so that only good families can enter. The wetlands of east Calcutta have similarly been put on the block repeatedly despite their vital role in Calcuttas environmental health.        
	Our green cover has been handled in a very simplistic manner  plant more trees. There is little evidence of a master-plan that recognizes the relationship between species and location, between tree density and survival rates and between planting and subsequent care. Once planted, trees are at the mercy of hoarding and building contractors. Besides trees, shrubs and varieties of grass can play important functional and aesthetic roles in urban settings but we see little of this on our streets.         
	A shining example of public response to active management of our natural assets is the success of the Millenium Park. This 2.5 kilometre stretch on the riverside was opened in 2000 and, despite an entrance fee, has turned out to be one of the most popular and  for the Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority  profitable spots in the city.         
	Yes, manage assets well and revenue streams follow  true for business and true for the environment also.        
	The third item on the citys environmental agenda would be public involvement in reducing carbon consumption. Here, too, the fashionable buzzword is sustainability  the reduction of our dependence on carbon-based products and services so that the interests of future generations are not damaged by our life- and work-styles. Moving Calcutta towards becoming a sustainable city would call for changing our behaviour with respect to generation of solid waste, consumption of water, fuel and electricity, and production of emissions and effluents. The institution of Green Rating for Integrated Habitat Assessment in August 2006 gave Calcutta pole position in environmentally sound building practice. But not much happened after the ceremonies.         
	Calcuttas environmental future can take very different contours depending on the extent to which people are made aware of and encouraged to act on these issues. The lack of such awareness not only saddles the city with a population of bystanders and spectators, but also makes it convenient for public officials to abdicate their responsibility. And, in fact, why should any service provider improve delivery if the clients do not seem to care?        
	Fundamental to generating citizen involvement is focused and sustained communication. We have seen it work with immunization campaigns for polio and we have also seen it work for political candidates. But when it comes to public response to environmental issues, we expect awareness and involvement to just happen.               
	The feeble attempts to stop the use of plastic bags is an example. After the mayor had rushed around a few markets and launched several drives to ban these bags, it was status quo ante. Fruit-sellers and fish vendors are back to using thin sewer-choking bags with a vengeance. In contrast, a small-budget communication effort by People United for Better Living in Calcutta (PUBLIC) focusing on a few public spots, such as the Victoria Memorial, the Botanical Gardens, the Science City and the Zoo, created an understanding among staff and visitors that has had lasting impact.        
	Even if this simple, three-point environmental agenda were to be adopted for Calcutta, it does not mean that results will follow. There are implementation bottlenecks, such as the virtual unquestioned freedom with which multiple agencies go about impacting the citys environment. Besides the Kolkata Municipal Corporation, and the KMDA, departments such as transport, public works, forest and the police, take any action that they deem fit. Add to this the members of parliament who have their own funds and fiefdoms. A possible way to resolve this tangle would be for the KMC to coordinate a multi-agency consortium that is visible, responsible and accountable for Calcuttas environment.               
	This agenda requires neither huge investments nor major policy shifts. All it needs is leadership. Well after the speeches and the ceremonial planting this World Environment Day, there will be opportunity for a thoughtfully designed plan that can be implemented with sincerity and in a sustained manner.         
	Going green in Calcutta could yet move from being a fashion to becoming a long-term trend.

	Ever since the remarkable success of Umberto Ecos The Name of the Rose, the intellectual thriller has made a niche for itself. There have been books with Dante as the mystery solver; others that follow the philosophical premises of Immanuel Kant or Ludwig Wittgenstein for solving murders. In The Rule of Four, an obscure book of the 15th century provided vital clues to a mystery in contemporary Princeton. The Oxford Murders draws its solution from mathematics.        
	A mathematician from Buenos Aires arrives in Oxford on a years scholarship, ostensibly to extend his thesis in algebraic topology. His secret desire is to shift to philosophical logic. His supervisor fixes him up to stay in the house of Mrs Eagleton, the widow of a mathematics don.        
	On arrival, he discovers that Mrs Eagleton is a frail old lady who lives with her granddaughter, Beth, in a small but comfortable house in north Oxford. Beth is beautiful, and a cellist. Two weeks into his first term, the narrator becomes involved in the murder of Mrs Eagleton. In fact, he and Arthur Seldon, one of the leading minds in logic, discover Mrs Eagleton dead in her drawing room. She was killed while she was playing scrabble, right hand versus the left hand.        
	The only clue to the murder is a cryptic symbol and the words the first of a series.        
	Seldon is a close friend of the Eagletons. Mrs Eagletons late husband, Harry, was his supervisor, their son, Johnny, and his wife, Sarah, (Beths parents) were his friends. In fact, Johnny and Sarah died in the same car accident in which Seldon lost his wife. Seldon is the author of a famous book on philosophy which contains a chapter on serial killers.        
	While the police go about their business trying to track down the killer, Seldon convinces the narrator that the murder is one of a series, and the solution lies in working out the series. They proceed to do this using rules and axioms.        
	The murder of Mrs Eagleton does turn out to be the first of series. With the second and the third murders, the killer leaves behind two other symbols, as if challenging Seldon and his young collaborator from South America to complete the series and solve the murder.        
	The plot unfolds at a dramatic pace with the third murder occurring during an outdoor musical concert on the grounds of Blenheim Palace.        
	The solution, when it is arrived at, proves to be simple and water-tight, like mathematical proofs. Yet there is a hint of compassion and love for the killer in the manner of the unfolding. Unlike in mathematics, there is more to life than logic and proofs.        
	The charm of the book lies in the bringing together of murder and mathematics. But the latter does not detract from the attractions of the story for those who are not interested in mathematics. The writing is lucid and fast-paced. Guillermo Martnez does not fail to evoke the magic of the Oxford ambience. There is romance too. The book is nicely balanced like an equation.

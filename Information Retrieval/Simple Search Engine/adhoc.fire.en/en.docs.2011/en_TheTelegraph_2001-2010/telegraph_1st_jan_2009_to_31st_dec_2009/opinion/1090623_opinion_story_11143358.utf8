The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Far from a pretty picture
                                                                                                                 FAR FROM A PRETTY PICTURE                                  Malvika Singh                              
	Recent images showed Congress leaders of yore, who are not elected but hold many key posts in the party, seated on the ground, cross-legged, eating a meal with some Dalit acquaintances in a desperate attempt to celebrate the birthday of Rahul Gandhi by reaching out to those who have been kept out for decades. These performances, organized and rehearsed by Congress workers over the decades, have lost their resonance in the new world of another generation. They come across as examples of hypocrisy and sycophancy being played out and have no impact whatsoever.         
	The images jarred because when juxtaposed with Rahul Gandhis serious symbolic interventions of the past year, these visuals took us back in time and reminded us of the worst tokenisms characteristic of a slowly corroding, fading and corrupt Congress, one that many believed was in the process of renewal with a changed avatar.        
	It would be a waste of an opportunity to change in the immediate future that had come with the election results if the same old superficial gestures continue to be used as reference points to elaborate the Congresss policies by men who are fast becoming redundant. The people can see through this ploy and television helps in exposing the silliness of such events by just showing the scene. In fact, if one were to turn the television mute, one would be able to judge the truth for oneself by observing the reality, thereby separating the truth from the barrage of propaganda that keeps hitting the screen, depending on the channel that is being viewed.                
	Sad truth        
	Galvanizing party workers to perform mindless tasks such as organizing inter-caste eating sabhas to celebrate a birthday sharply diluted the efforts of Rahul Gandhi to ensure dignity and opportunities for Dalits and other economically marginalized communities who have had the rotten end of the stick for far too long. Older Congressmen should be asked to stay away from tampering with the new processes and action plans.         
	My generation failed to deliver on the basics and we have no right to intervene in the processes of change and growth. It was a generation that was unable to enforce the law and empower all castes equally. It had decades to do these things. It has no business therefore to jeopardize a new course of action and procedure in a desperate attempt to divert attention from its own incompetence and non-performance.        
	Instead of making a mockery of Rahul Gandhis stated commitment to address the problems Dalits face across India, young and old Congress workers could have been asked to do some real work for the community. Panchayats could have been mobilized to organize langars for all in a number of villages, followed by planting carefully selected indigenous trees on community land to create and nurture a sacred grove for all castes and communities living in the village as a dedication to the birthday of Rahul Gandhi. I am sure there are many such simple and uncluttered ideas that could be introduced in small hamlets and villages which would give them a better community space.        
	Other failed professionals are also rearing their heads and being appointed to positions in sanctums of governance, having scuttled their chances to qualify for the top job in their organizations or professions. Dropouts who have never made it to the excellence list are being hired to do what they failed to in the private sector. These silent manipulators, who are masters of intrigue, are looking earnestly for comfortable jobs and for platforms in the world of clout from which they can disperse largesse in kind. This is certainly sad. But alas, it is also true.

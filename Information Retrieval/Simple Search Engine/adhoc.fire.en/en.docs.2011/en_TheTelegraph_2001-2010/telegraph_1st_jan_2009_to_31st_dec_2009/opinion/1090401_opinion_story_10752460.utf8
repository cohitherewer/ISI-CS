The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | precise message
                                                                                                                 PRECISE MESSAGE                                                    
	The day-long siege in Manawan, a police academy on the outskirts of Lahore, followed a pattern that now seems to be a favourite among terror groups post-Mumbai. The reason for this is simple. It allows for the maximum possible impact. It is the adoption of this spectacular tactic and its timing, and not so much the target, the police, that set apart the Manawan attack from several other bombings and suicide attacks directed against State agencies (particularly the police in the northwest) and against the armed forces. The message contained in the days work in Manawan was precise. The Taliban will spare no one associated with the evil designs of the West, and that includes faithfuls as well as the hand that has fed the insurgents for so long  the State itself. It is not that this message has not hit home, coming as it did two days after the Pakistan president, together with his counterpart in Afghanistan, had given his polite nod to Barack Obamas new AfPak strategy. The interior minister of Pakistan, for example, has grasped that the choice before Pakistan is either to hand over the country to the Taliban or to fight them. The problem is that the interior ministry does not have any idea of exactly whom it should fight or how it should fight this adversary.         
	This befuddlement is the single reason behind the Taliban spreading so fast and so far into the heartland of Pakistan. While the State is willing to fight some rogue militants who threaten its authority, it is peculiarly defensive about some others whom it continues to see and use as strategic tools. This is clear in the way it has proceeded with the Mumbai investigation and in its so-called disciplining of the Lashkar-e-Toiba, which went on to launch the Kupwara offensive. Unless Pakistan sorts out this confusion, it will neither manage to keep the Taliban at bay, nor get the United States of America off its soil. Unfortunately, Pakistan is in no hurry to do either, never mind the USs ungodly hurry to make an exit.         
	The US does not seem too keen on sorting things out either. Its AfPak policy, for example, strangely falls short on the Pakistan account. No modus operandi of taking on the Taliban has been worked out, apart from increasing the unpopular and counter-productive drone attacks. This is bound to encourage more daredevilry among the Baitullah Mehsuds. Unlike in Afghanistan, where it has seized the initiative, the US has allowed for enough space in Pakistan for the double play to continue  between the Taliban and the government, within the government, and between the army and the government. Perhaps the US is waiting for Pakistan to name its price  Kashmir to end the game. There is no reason for India to feel comfortable at all.

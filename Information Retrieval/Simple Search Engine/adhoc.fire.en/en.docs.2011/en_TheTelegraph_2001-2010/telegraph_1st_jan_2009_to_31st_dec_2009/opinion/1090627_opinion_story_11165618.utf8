	Shatabdi Ballet troupe presented Aamar Ganer Swaralipi Lekha Robey, a programme to mark the 89th birth-anniversary of Hemanta Mukhopadhyay, at Madhusudan Mancha on June 16. During the evening, a number of renowned personalities from various walks of life paid tribute to Mukherjee. Among them were Ananto Roy, Anup Motilal, Arindam Sil, Chinmoy Roy and Sabyasachi Chakroborty, all of whom deserve praise for their presentations. A few melodious songs of the 1960s and 1970s were also presented on the occasion. Lopamudra Mitras Dinguli mor sonar khanchay, Sagnik Sens Moner janala diye, Monomoy Bhattacharyas Shono kono ek din, Saikat Mitras Jare ja, Indranil Sens Ei baluka belaye, Anushila Basus Aamaar bhitore bahire, Sriradha Banerjees Jodi bolte chao and Nir chhoto khoti nei, a duet by Shibaji Chatterjee and Arundhati Homchoudhury, were worth appreciating. Shatabdi Ballet troupe also presented a choreography which was a collage of 14 of Mukherjees songs. The performance of the musicians was exceptional on this occasion.

	Parampara, in association with Manipuri Nartanalaya, presented Suchitrar Shantiniketan at G.D. Birla Sabhagar on June 20. Suchitra Mitra, the grand old lady of Tagore songs, recounted the experience of her stay in Santiniketan  Tagores abode of peace, friendship, music and learning.         
	In her inimitable style, Mitra shared some of the unforgettable moments that she had spent with Indira Devi Chaudhurani and Shantideb Ghosh, two of the greatest exponents of Rabindrasangeet. The sharing of these anecdotes was interspersed with readings by Subir Mitra, along with the rendition of appropriate Tagore songs by Anita Pal, a senior disciple of Mitras. The students of Parampara also presented a few numbers. Hridayer e kul o kul by Pal was particularly impressive. But she should take care to develop an original style of singing instead of imitating her mentor. However, her clear diction and melodious rendition were indeed praiseworthy. Conceived by Amit Dasgupta, the programme featured Bimbabati Devi along with the students of Manipuri Nartanalaya exploring the rabindrik theme. Dressed in their aesthetically designed costumes, the troupe members danced gracefully and succeeded in highlighting the lyrical beauty of Tagore songs. The choreography of Nishithe ki koye gelo mon, inexplicably, fell short of the desired standards but the chorus songs were well executed.

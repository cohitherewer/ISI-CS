	A reason not to work                  
	Sir  Before any election, the Election Commission imposes a code of conduct, which remains in force till the results are declared. One such code is that the ruling government cannot announce any new scheme before the elections. It is a common practice of governments to halt work on the pretext of following the EC guidelines. This is bound to happen during the assembly elections in Maharashtra in October too. The EC must clearly state that the code of conduct applies only to new projects, and that there is no reason to stop ongoing work. To waste two months for elections is to impede the countrys development.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Rachana Vora, Mumbai 

      
	Telltale signs          
	Sir  I am not surprised that Arun Shourie has spoken against the Bharatiya Janata Party leadership (Shourie taunts and dares Humpty Dumpty Party, Aug 25). During the campaign for the Lok Sabha polls earlier this year, Shourie was one of the first people to recommend Narendra Modi as a prime ministerial nominee, at a time when the BJP was fielding only L.K. Advani as its candidate for the prime ministers post. A few members within the BJP, such as Shourie, have been quite firm against certain policies of the BJP, as a result of which they have neither received due appreciation, nor been asked to involve themselves in the partys key decision-making processes.           
	However, the way in which Shourie has asked the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh to bombard the party headquarters and replace its top leadership with about 10 to 15 members of the Sangh itself, is quite unacceptable. The BJP, in the present circumstances, needs to evolve a modern outlook and should not be haunted by the Hindutva ideology. If the BJP is to survive, it should not look to the RSS to perform the rectification surgery, as Shourie has recommended. Instead, it should revamp its leadership with a set of dynamic leaders with fresh outlook and philosophy. The party should project itself as being seriously concerned about the current problems of drought and recession, education, environment, terrorism, and so on.                    
	Yours faithfully, B.K. Chatterjee, Faridabad            
	Sir  That the BJP is going through a huge crisis has been reaffirmed by the fact that the party loyalist, Arun Shourie, has come out in public to criticize the the party. Even now, it seems as if the BJP has not figured out what the real trouble with the party is. All the top leaders are rather egoistical, putting themselves before the good of the party they belong to. Even the warnings issued by the RSS on a number of occasions to keep the BJP intact have not had any effect on the party. If this kind of disorganization continues, it will not be too long before the public loses all faith in the BJP.           
	Needless to say, the Congress will benefit from this. The BJP leadership should try to reconcile the differences among its members. It may also seek help from the RSS. Younger members must be encouraged to come to the front.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Shailesh Kumar, Delhi

                
	Sir  I am not amused on reading Arun Shouries Alice in blunderland comment. He also hinted that certain members of the BJP were Humpty Dumpty figures. These remarks were not in good taste. He has called the BJP a kati patang. However, he does not realize that handing over the ailing party to the RSS would surely make it a fati patang, that is, make its condition worse than what it already is. If the party acts in this way, it will sound its own death knell, and its adversary, the Congress, will get a few days rest from BJP-bashing.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
N. Nagarajan, Secunderabad

                                                                                                                 LEGAL FAQS                                  Advocate Nibedita Roye answers your queries                              
	Q:My husband is retired and I am a housewife. A few years back we bought a flat. My two sons also contributed to it. The flat is in my name. My elder son is now demanding that either we gift the flat to him or return his contribution along with interest. Is he legally right in claiming his money or in compelling me to make the flat over to his name? Can he object legally if I give the flat to my younger son or to any other third party before my death? We are frightened and worried. Please help.        
	Name withheld                
	A: Since the flat is in your name it is totally up to you to decide who you want to transfer or gift it to. Your son has no right whatsoever in making such unlawful demands.                
	Q:In 1998 I bought a flat in Behala in Calcutta under the Kolkata Municipal Corporation. I had registered the flat in my name the same year at Alipore court, Calcutta. A year later the annual property tax for the flat was fixed at Rs 1,600 per year. I have regularly paid the tax and hold receipts issued in my name. But till date I have not received a mutation certificate from the KMC. I have been told that a mutation certificate is unnecessary now. Is this true?         
	Name Withheld                
	A: Obtaining a mutation certificate is certainly necessary. You should apply to the KMC for a no-objection certificate with respect to the payment of property tax. You can then proceed by submitting the appropriate form/declaration along with the NOC of the KMC for mutation of your name in their records. The KMC will thereafter call upon you to submit all relevant property papers. Once it is satisfied about your title to the flat, it will issue a mutation certificate in your favour on payment of mutation fees.                 
	Q:I am over 60 years old. My husband, with whom, I have been married for 30 years, has abused me for years and has even threatened to throw me out of the house which is in both our names. Unable to take it anymore, I recently moved into my parents house. I do not want to run around and go to the courts at this age. If I let things be as they are, can he take legal action against me?        
	Name Withheld              
	A: You could, but you must lodge a general diary with your local police station, stating the facts. Then you will have a defence against whatever legal action your husband may take against you. He may file a suit against you for the restitution of conjugal rights or judicial separation or divorce.

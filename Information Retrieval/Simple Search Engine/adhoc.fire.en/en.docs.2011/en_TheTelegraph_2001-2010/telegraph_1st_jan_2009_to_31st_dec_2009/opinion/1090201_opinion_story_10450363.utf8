                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Identity crisis                  
	Sir  The Samajwadi Party should conduct a crash course on political correctness for those it wants to induct into its fold. Sanjay Dutts unsolicited and uncalled-for advice to married women (that was actually meant for his sister, Priya Dutt) to take their husbands surname after marriage reveals Dutt as an archetypal male chauvinist. But while slamming Priya, he should have spared a thought for poor Maanyata. How many times will she change her surname? Will it not lead to an identity crisis for her?          
	Yours faithfully,         Tapan Pal, Batanagar
        
	Pride and prejudice          
	Sir  Ashok Mitras revelations about the Swiss bank accounts of Indian nationals truly does India proud (India, be proud, Jan 16). However, certain things are confusing. Who is more anti-national, the economist or the politician? It is unlikely that politicians would have found their way to the banks had economists (even money-launderers must have a sound sense of economics) not shown them the way. Both the economist and the politician seem to have discovered the advantages of global currency at the same time. But money as capital cannot remain idle. Mitra should explore the ways in which the digital figures in the Swiss banks are getting transformed and warn us about possible future exploitation.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
R. Subhranshu, Chandernagore

                
	Sir  If Ashok Mitra is to be believed, international corporate giants, new-age politicians and unscrupulous civil servants are siphoning off huge amounts of money in post-liberalized India. It is indeed unfortunate that with all its Vedas, shastras, spiritual gurus, deities and Marxism, India has failed to ensure basic honesty in the people who count. This is as true of globalized India as of India during the licence-permit raj. Despite the all-pervasive control of the State, little could be done about the unprincipled trade unions, which sank State-run industries and paved the way for the entry of transnational corporations. Even then, politicians took their share of the dasturi. It may have been a smaller amount, but then, the overall volume of transaction had also been smaller than what it is now.           
	Mitra seems overly concerned about the corruption of international giants. What about our politicians? The ineptness of our ruling class has proved to be more costly for the nation. Ethics, morality and aesthetics have never bothered power-hungry politicians, and that includes the Marxists in Bengal as well. Despite all the financial honesty of the Left, Bengal today is no better than Bihar or Uttar Pradesh.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Prabir Kumar Ghosh, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Industrialists and businessmen have always been the pet hate of Marxists like Ashok Mitra. The addition of auditors to that list is a post-Satyam development. But no matter how much Mitra may try to convince the reader about this sinning triumvirate, politicians still beat them hands down.           
	Yours faithfully,      
M. Bagchi, Calcutta

                          
	Parting shot           
	Sir  Girish Park, which is part of ward number 26 of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, is used by hundreds of morning-walkers. To their surprise, the park was put under lock and key on January 15, 2009. They were informed that the park would remain closed for three or four days because of a flower show. The park remained inaccessible for days after the flower show. Why should the CMC treat the park as personal property and prevent people from enjoying the open space?          
	Yours faithfully,      
Raj K. Bagri, Calcutta

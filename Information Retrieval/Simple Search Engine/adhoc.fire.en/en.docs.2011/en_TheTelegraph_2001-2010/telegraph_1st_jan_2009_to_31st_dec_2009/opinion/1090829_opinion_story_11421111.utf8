	The Birla Academy of Art and Culture is holding an exhibition of the awardees of the annual exhibition 2009, titled Svikriti 09 (Aug 8-30), which features the works of young artists supposedly with a promise. Sad to say, after seeing the exhibition, one wondered whether this land is incapable of producing talent any longer. One hopes against hope that Bengals no-brainer syndrome is not that bad, and those in charge of selecting the works are in the wrong. Regrettably, one would not be surprised if either is the case. Manjushri Chakrobortys ceramic sculpture of a woman in the throes of desire was one thing, but her smaller pieces of one woman mounting another looked gross and vulgar. One would have thought that Anupam Dass colourful mixed media works had something exciting to offer, but one felt like a fool after going through the entire series. Why the man in a sombrero, why those beasts? Amlan Duttas paintings were bad imitations of Salvador Dali, while Debashree Dass feminine forms with various parts of a building visible through them looked like an imitation of an imitation. Dass installation with tiny paper bags inside a frame was equally vapid. Of Arijit Mukherjees watercolour and pen-and-ink works, only Indian Idol in the avatar of a giant red chilli was an arresting image. The problem with these young artists is that they are afraid of discovering new ways of expressing themselves. They love the beaten track.        
	Soumitra Das                
	THE RIGHT SPIRIT  
	Sursadhana presented Phire Dekha to mark the death anniversary of Rabindranath Tagore (Rabindrasadan, August 8). In the first half, Barshamangal was performed by the artists. The presentation was conceived by Sakti Mukhopadhyay who strung together a collection of Rabindrasangeets with a short script. The best thing about the performance was that there were very few jarring notes in the singing.         
	The second half featured performances by senior artists. Purabi Mukhopadhyay sang three songs in her fabulous voice. Pradyut Biswass performance was amateurish, while Sampa Kundu and Mohan Singh Khangura left the audience enthralled with their melody. Both Srikanta Acharya and Indrani Sen gave excellent performances, and Bratati Bandopadhyays recitation of two poems by different writers was near-perfect. The accompanying musicians did their best to brighten up the proceedings, and the entire programme managed to capture the inner spirit and brilliance of a departed genius.       Kaberi Mitra Sarkar

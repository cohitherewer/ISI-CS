	Voices in the head                
	Unbordered memories: Sindhi stories of partition (Penguin, Rs 250) edited and translated by Rita Kothari brings together two different worlds  of the Sindhi Hindus and the Sindhi Muslims. They shared a common feeling of homelessness after Partition. The stories reflect and dissect the dilemmas of these people, tormented, as they were, by numerous social and religious questions. In their crisis begins their search for an identity, a search that often transcends these questions to attain a larger, humane perspective. The stories try to capture the moments when the two communities cross each others paths, enter into each others psychological space. In those moments, the characters transcend the borders of custom, tradition and religion to communicate their innermost longing for stability and solidarity.                                  
	What did you ask at school today?: A handbook of child learning (Collins, Rs 199) by Kamala V. Mukunda is a wonderful guide in educational psychology for Indian teachers. In school, a child learns not only his or her lessons, but also the ways to deal with life and society. The method of a childs education is as important as the education itself. The author stresses the need for a child to ask the right questions, rather than just give the right answers. Her take on moral development is particularly interesting. She says that not all transgressions are moral. If this is true then it is not surprising that the childrens sense of morality gets confused, as the author says, when they end up being punished in the same way, say, for not tying their tie knots properly and for beating up a fellow student. The degree of seriousness of these offences is obviously different. The book offers many scopes for serious thought.                        
	The ultimate secrets of total self-confidence (HarperCollins, Rs 199) by Robert Anthony is a foolproof guide to scripting ones success story. The only problem is that the remedies to everyday woes that the author prescribes seem too good to be practicable. Anthony offers quick and easy solutions to problems like lack of self-esteem, fear of failure and so on. They sound good, and one would no doubt find solace in the belief that a step-by-step formula for a successful life actually works. However, when Anthony suggests that one can easily train the subconscious to perform according to the conscious mind, it is hard not to suspect that he is oversimplifying human nature.

	They say that the easiest way to defend yourself from an attacking tiger is to open an umbrella on its face. The shock unsettles the tiger and prevents it from saying the halum, which is the mantra it pronounces to desensitize its prey before gobbling it up. But this is only one of the few uses of the umbrella, which is actually one of the most wonderful contrivances ever invented by mankind. It protects you from rain and sun, serves as a walking stick, as a poker in case you are one of those romantics who keep sifting dirt-piles in search of the elusive philosophers stone, and, of course, keeps tigers at bay. And if you are light enough and the wind is strong, it can help you levitate, so that you can imagine yourself as a Bella in a Chagall painting, floating on the wings of love.         
	Umbrellas have always had that touch of the fantastic about them. In Mandevilles Travels, a popular Middle English text, the men of Ethiopia are described as having a single foot, which is so large that, like the umbrella, it shadoweth all the body against the sun, when they will lie and rest them. In the course of his peregrinations, Robinson Crusoe saw the men of the Brazils using umbrellas, and when left to his own resources on the island, he fashioned one using animal hide and sticks. I covered it with skins, the hair outwards, so that it cast off the rain like a penthouse, and kept off the sun so effectually, that I could walk out in the hottest of the weather with greater advantage than I could before in the coolest, says Crusoe. Trust Crusoe to unweave the rainbow, and reduce the umbrella, which in the 17th century still had an exotic appeal, to mere questions of use.        
	The frog of the tale sat under the natural umbrella  the toadstool  to train its vocal chords. Umbrellas seem to have a tendency to inspire songs, as the typical Bollywood film will prove. Given the umbrellas association with courtship (one recalls Amulya in Satyajit Rays Samapti going to meet his prospective bride wielding an umbrella and wearing shiny shoes), it is strange that at times it also becomes a symbol of power, or rather, of the lack of it. The practice of holding an umbrella over the heads of the high and mighty is one of the ancient practices that have continued unchanged to this day. If kings had slaves to hold bejewelled and tasselled canopies over their precious royal heads, modern-day politicians have toadies following them about with open umbrellas to shelter the leaders from sun and shower. One can start a Hegelian discourse on the implications of the shadow  the side-kick  casting a shadow (umbrella is derived from the Latin, umbra, meaning shade) on the masters head, but let not the shadow of sombre thoughts darken these musings.        
	If you drape some sheets over an open umbrella, you can have a Bedouin tent right in the middle of your room. I have spent countless hours in my childhood crouching with a book under such an umbrella, which used to move around the room, shifting from spoke to spoke, as I tried to manoeuvre my body into the most comfortable position inside. I have always envied the snails ability to disappear at will within its shell. I am thankful to the umbrella for letting me have a shell of my own whenever I needed it.

	The charcoal and crayon drawings of Safiuddin Ahmed, the artist from Bangladesh, had the texture of dreams. Gaunt faces peered from the dark, guts and eyes floated entangled with wires and leaves, gardens stood strangled in black knots of vine. There was an overwhelming presence of water  as river, as rain  in this exhibition entitled The Limitless Luminosity of Lines (March 23-April 4, Rabindranath Tagore Centre, ICCR). The series of paintings called Flood melted into the Black Series (1-20), as both depicted what looked like the churning waters of Lethe carrying the debris of lost human lives. It was probably the Padma, nurturer and destroyer, that took on the shape of Lethe. In Flood 3, the waters flowed over a brier encircled by ghostly visages. The life-giving aspect of the river seemed symbolized in the image of the fish, which were bandied about in the current like pieces of hope.        
	View of Santiniketan, in pen and ink, provided an immediate contrast to the gloom of the other paintings. Here was the glorious land of light as against the dark country of melancholy. The nude studies, in evoking lifes sordidness in the wrinkled flesh of the models, reminded one of Picassos sketches. Each of the paintings, by metamorphosing dejection and loss into something rich and strange, attested to the transforming power of art.

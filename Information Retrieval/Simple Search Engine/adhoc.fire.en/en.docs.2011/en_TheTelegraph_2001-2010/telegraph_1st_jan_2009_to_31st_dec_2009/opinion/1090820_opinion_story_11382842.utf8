The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | name is saffron
                                                                                                                 NAME IS SAFFRON                                                          
	Finally, the Bharatiya Janata Party stands without clothes to hide its own intolerance and its own Hindu identity. It needed no external enemies to strip it bare. The BJP did it all on its own when it decided to expel Jaswant Singh from the party. Mr Singh earned this from the party that he has served for three decades because he wrote a book with whose findings and conclusions the party is in complete disagreement. The subject of the book was none other than Mohammad Ali Jinnah whom Mr Singh refused to see as a cardboard demon-like figure. This raised the hackles of the wise men in the BJP; so Mr Singh has been forced to exit for the sin of writing a book. This shows that the BJP is incapable of coping with any opinion that does not fit with its own ideological position. The party was thus not satisfied with officially dissociating itself from the book and the views expressed in it. It had to expel the author for articulating what are his considered views on a historical subject. The BJP assumes that it has a monopoly over historical interpretation. This has been evident to many of its critics. The cause c eacute;l egrave;bre concerning Mr Singh only confirms the intolerance embedded within the BJP and its ideology.  
	The exaggerated response of the BJP is directly related to its Hindu identity. It is this identity that makes it impossible for the BJP to accept Jinnah as anything other than evil personified. Many apologists for the BJP have been known to argue that the party has begun to move away from its Hindu orientation. In these columns yesterday, The Telegraph commented that the BJP is genetically connected to the Hindu Mahasabha. It is impossible for it to break this link. The BJP is descended from the Hindu Mahasabha and is thus run, even today, by the Rashtriya Swyamsevak Sangh. The BJP is only the parliamentary wing of the RSS and therefore it is chained to Hindutva, to ideological intolerance and to bigotry. The consequence is the inability to engage in any kind of intellectual discussion. The sangh parivar is confined by a saffron curtain to a world within itself.  
	This condition of the BJP has an analogy with what prevails, and has prevailed, within Stalinist communist parties. These parties put forward a line on all matters  from ideology to history to politics to culture and even to science  and any deviation from this line is seen as anti-party and leads to expulsion. The history of the 20th century has many examples of figures who held independent views and were then thrown out by communist parties. The BJP has behaved exactly as a communist party would. The irony that it is behaving like one of its principal adversaries escapes the BJP leadership. For Mr Singh, the BJP is the god that failed. He cannot expect any sympathy from either loyal comrades or besotted sanghis. Intolerance breeds strange bedfellows.

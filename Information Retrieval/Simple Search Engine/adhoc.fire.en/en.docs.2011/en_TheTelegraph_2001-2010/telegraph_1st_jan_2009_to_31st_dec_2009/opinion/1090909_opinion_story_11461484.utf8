	Bitter harvest                  
	Sir  Sunanda K. Datta-Ray is known to take up the cudgels for the poor. However, in Sylvan joy diminished (Sept 5), Datta-Ray spares no thought for the people who have been disowned even by the ruling Left Front. Datta-Ray states that after the land prices around Rajarhat soared, the cultivators who sold their land for a pittance felt cheated. He also adds that the prices would not have increased had the farmers been allowed to be in peaceful possession of their fields, huts and arrack shops. The reference to the arrack shops was uncalled for. Does Datta-Ray think that the State has the right to take away the land, either by force or deception, of those farmers who drink ? Datta-Ray, who seems to have little regard for individual rights, should remember that only a farmer has the right to decide whether to sell or not to sell his land.          
	Datta-Rays comment that innocent buyers whose investment went up in flames deserve more sympathy than the supposedly dispossessed peasants comes as a bit of a shock. How are the buyers innocent, and why should they deserve our sympathy if they have invested in land without checking the ground realities? Datta-Ray is concerned that non-resident Indians are unlikely to put their money in a state that is periodically overrun by mobs. But the NRIs left the country in search of greener pastures. Now, sensing new opportunities in India, they have decided to return to the land that they had forsaken and hence deserve no empathy.           
	Datta-Ray also describes the lessons of Singur and Nandigram as bitter. Does he think that the people of Nandigram and Singur, who courageously voted against the Left and its faulty industrialization drive, are all idiots? Nandigram-Singur remains, till date, one of the biggest mass movements ever witnessed in Bengal. But people like Datta-Ray, who by his own admission has received plaintive appeals for help from the victims, are not ready to recognize this fact.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Chameli Pal, Batanagar 

                
	Sir  Sunanda K. Datta-Ray has analysed the massive land grabbing activities by the realtors lobby allegedly close to ruling communists quite brilliantly. Vedic Village is a classic example of this unholy alliance. Raj Modi, the jailed promoter of Vedic Village, forcibly took away the land of poor peasants with the help of politicians, bureaucrats and local criminals like Gaffar Mollah. It is now being alleged that Modi was gifted the vested land which is not permitted by law. The chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, must return the land to the farmers and punish the corrupt ministers. Else, as mentioned by Datta-Ray, the people will start perceiving the CPI(M) as CPI (Marwari).           
	Yours faithfully,

	True colours          
	Sir  Ratan Tatas comment that the land in Singur allotted for the small car project does not belong to Mamata Banerjee is in bad taste (If compensated, Tata to return (not her) land, Sept 2). Tata must accept the fact that he was forced out of Singur not by Banerjees opposition, but by angry farmers who felt cheated by the agreement between Tata Motors and the state government. That the agreement contained loopholes can be ascertained by Tatas statement on the eve of the companys decision to relocate the small car factory from Singur. Ratan Tata is reported to have said that since the project had been cancelled, the agreement stood null and void and hence there was no need to make the terms public. This clearly suggest that there was a need to conceal the inner content of the agreement.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Amit Ghosh, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The cat seems to be out of Ratan Tatas bag at last. The people of West Bengal have a right to know the content of the agreement between the government and Ratan Tata, which, supposedly, is a trade secret. A petition under the Right to Information Act was filed to make the details of the agreement public, but the Calcutta High Court overruled the request. Ultimately, Tata moved the Nano factory to Sanand in Gujarat, but he did not stop at that. With an eye on the polls, he inaugurated the official launch of the Nano amidst great fanfare just before the parliamentary elections. After Mamata Banerjee became the railways minister, she declared that if the Centre gave the 600 acres of the land to the railways, a production unit could come up with public-private participation. Ratan Tata has made it clear that he is willing to forego the land if the compensation is sufficient.This, undoubtedly, is an example of the benevolence of a great industrialist.          
	Yours faithfully,

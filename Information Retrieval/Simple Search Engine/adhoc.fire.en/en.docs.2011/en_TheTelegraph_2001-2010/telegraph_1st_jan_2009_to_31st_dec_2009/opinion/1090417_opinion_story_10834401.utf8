	Picasso: Challenging The Past, National Gallery Company, 12.95        
	In the summer of 1947, when Picasso was in his mid-sixties, he agreed to what is now referred to as the Louvre test. He had donated some of his paintings to the French State. But the National Museum of Modern Art in Paris was closed and Picassos gifts were stored in the Louvre. So George Salle, the director of the museums, invited him to display his paintings, for a day, next to the great masters of his own choice in the main galleries of the Louvre. On the day of the hanging, Picasso was both exhilarated and edgy with nervousness at the prospect of publicly placing himself next to the French, Spanish and Italian masters. He was initially tense and silent, and then as the day progressed, he looked more and more excited, and was finally unable to restrain himself from exclaiming, You see its the same thing! Its the same thing!        
	Full of splendid illustrations, this book accompanies the exhibition, Picasso: Challenging the Past, at Londons National Gallery (until June 7), curated by Christopher Riopelle and Anne Robbins, both of whom have contributed lucidly illuminating essays. In his foreword, Nicholas Penny, director of the National Gallery, focuses on Picassos exceptional competitiveness. This exhibition tells the story of how the spirit of competition was more than just rivalry with contemporaries like his friend Matisse, and compelled Picasso to raid, all through his creative life, the art of the museums for ideas and motifs, even to use iconic masterpieces as templates for his own obsessive variations. What he forged, in the process, was a modernity that continually sought to write itself into the history of Western art. Rather than being humbled by the Great Tradition, Picasso occupied history through a supreme nonchalance towards its linear progress. He confounded past and present to re-create forebears like Velzquez and Manet in his own image, showing how they would have painted had they been influenced by him, rather than the other way round. This is how he stood on their heads the usual, respectfully self-effacing stories of influence, imitation and originality.        
	What Picasso felt was not only a sense of comradeship and equality with the masters, but also, quite often, the caricaturists irreverence. When he did not have access to the originals, he would work as effortlessly with postcards and photographs, or project slides on his studio walls. What he was most interested in, especially towards the end of his life, were composition and draughtsmanship, the quality of an artists line or his distortions of form, more than his use of colour. Perhaps the most meaningful parallel would be the Late Beethoven pillaging, without misgivings, the music of Haydn and of Mozart, reaching further backwards to Bach, to create a music of his own that is at once masterfully Classical and utterly new (and Wagner doing the same with Beethoven, and Mahler with Wagner).         
	Matisse died in 1954, and from the mid-Fifties until the early Sixties, Picasso went through the most obsessive phase of his engagement with the masters, writing himself into both the French and the Spanish lineages within the Great Tradition. In 1957, within four months, he made 45 variations in oil (top left), together with 13 related smaller works, on Velzquezs Las Meninas (1656). Then between 1959 and 1962, he made 27 paintings (bottom left), 140 drawings, three linogravures, and a number of cardboard maquettes for sculpture of Manets Luncheon on the Grass (1863). In his unabashed use of the originals, and in the freedom with which he appropriated Velzquez and Manet to his own structural and conceptual preoccupations (reducing their nuanced colouring to grisaille or near-monochrome), these late variations far surpass the liberties he had taken earlier with the European masters, like the 1949 imitation of Lucas Cranach the Elders David and Bathsheba (1526, top right) to create a series of lithographs (bottom right).        
	I paint against the canvases that are important to me, Picasso had said to Andr Malraux. This against imagines an important canvas as both an adversary with whom he must wrestle and a support against which he might lean while making his own art  perhaps even as an ever-present backdrop against which the drama of his own work unfolds. This book, together with the show it accompanies, is an exploration of this vital ambiguity.                    AVEEK SEN

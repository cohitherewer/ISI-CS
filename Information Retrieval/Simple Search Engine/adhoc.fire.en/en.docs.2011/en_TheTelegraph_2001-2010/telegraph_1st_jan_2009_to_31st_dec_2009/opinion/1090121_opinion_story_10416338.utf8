	Jharkhands slate has been only partially cleaned. Presidents rule, which has been imposed after a long time, may hold out the promise of a fresh start, but in the foggy world of Indian politics, that does not always happen. The United Progressive Alliance, which is no longer willing to indulge Shibu Sorens desires  the last was that his man, Champai Soren, be chief minister  has worked rapidly to declare the state under presidents rule. The UPA seems anxious to be seen as correct: if the chief minister who belongs to the ruling coalition fails to get elected, the coalition should no longer govern. The loss of credibility for Mr Sorens Jharkhand Mukti Morcha affects its allies too, and these include the Congress and the Rashtriya Janata Dal. The RJD chief, Lalu Prasad, had briefly toyed with the idea of putting an RJD leader, possibly the former chief minister, Madhu Koda, in Mr Sorens place, because Jharkhand has quite some time to go before its assembly elections. But Mr Prasad has baulked too, which is not very characteristic of him. No leader wants to lose face before the Lok Sabha elections by installing a fresh government that might fail anytime, and  sadly for Jharkhand  even Mr Prasad cannot believe that the present situation can throw up one that will last.        
	But to be correct, the UPA needed to go further. Presidents rule with the assembly in suspended animation is just not good enough. The Opposition is naturally demanding that the assembly be dissolved and fresh elections be announced, although the partners of the National Democratic Alliance, the Bharatiya Janata Party included, may not know quite what to do if such an announcement is made. An assembly in suspended animation is a seething arena of political bargaining as well as an irresponsible way of holding on to a position that is already lost. It is tragic for Jharkhand that its leaders and their parties are either hopeless at gaining the peoples trust or are quick to wash their hands of responsibility when nothing seems to work. The state does have the right to governance and development. With governments and chief ministers constantly falling by the wayside, there is no question of either. To regain credibility, the UPA should think first what is best for Jharkhand, not what is best for itself before the Lok Sabha elections.

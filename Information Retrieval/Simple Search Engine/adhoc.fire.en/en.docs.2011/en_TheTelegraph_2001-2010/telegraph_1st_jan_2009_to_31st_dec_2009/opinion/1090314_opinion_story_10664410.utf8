The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Politics as play
                                                                                                                 POLITICS AS PLAY                              THEATRE      Ananda Lal                                                
	Swapna-sandhani recently completed four years of unhindered, fulfilling existence at Sujata Sadan. Unlike most Bengali groups competing for infrequent bookings at their four or five regular auditoriums, since 2004 it has staged over 240 shows of its repertoire here. This freedom has also enabled director Kaushik Sen to mount new productions fast  as many as 13 in this period, counting the two latest.        
	Ostensibly for children, Sraban Haoya is commendably activist, given its anti-pollution, anti-smoking agenda and a state government that does zilch to stop vehicular pollution or smoking in public places. The asthmatic boy in Ujjwal Chattopadhyays play, like lakhs in Calcutta, suffers because of this official licence to kill. His friends father, like millions of inconsiderate adults, lights cigarettes wherever he goes. Luckily, Sraban Haoya has a happy ending, though reality tells a different tale. Educational institutions must support it as essential viewing for students: the only way to reach callous Calcuttans may be through their kids.        
	Sraban Haoya is more immediately political than Unishe June (picture), adapted from Biru Mukherjees Bishe June, itself translated for the Indian Peoples Theatre Association in 1955 from Loyalty, an obscure Hungarian play on the notorious trial of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, convicted as Soviet spies by the US and sent to the electric chair in Sing Sing on June 19, 1953 (wrongly dated as June 20 in the original). Earlier that year, indicting Senator McCarthys witchhunt of communists, Arthur Miller had named his lead couple in The Crucible, John and Elizabeth, adopting the Rosenbergs initials. Actually, The Crucible would have been a far superior drama to adapt on the same theme. Although Sen constructs Unishe June innovatively, going back in time scene by scene from the execution (like Pinters structure in Betrayal), it remains a dry and factual account of the inquisition. Sens other framing devices  two sutradhars commenting from a contemporary perspective, and film footage of the dismantling of Lenins statues after the fall of Communism  do not add complexity. Indeed, the latter may backfire, if our local party appropriates its nostalgic romanticism as a sign that Sen has returned to the leftist fold! However, the acting conveys the cruelty of the Rosenbergs (Shankar Malakar and Reshmi Sen) sentence through the frustrated federal emissary (Kaushik Sen) and sympathetic warden (Shankar Ghosh).

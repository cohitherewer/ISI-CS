The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Moving on crutches
                                                                                                                 MOVING ON CRUTCHES                                  Mala Fide - Malvika Singh                              
	As the vile words of hate spoken by Feroze Varun Gandhi and the venom spewed by him sink into the psyche of all those who have heard him, there is a sense of disbelief regarding how any human being, educated or illiterate, can think or speak in this manner. One always believed that it was the lunatic fringe  the rabid minority that is a part of any dispensation, the men and women holding polarized and untenable positions  who spoke such words, which were never a part of the political rhetoric of aspiring national leaders. The hectoring speeches by Narendra Modi and even Pravin Togadia are mild in comparison to the call by Varun Gandhi. The tape, in full, is far worse than what we have heard.        
	To consciously polarize the vote bank and pit communities against each other in an attempt to win an election is the singlemost criminal offence that can be inflicted upon an ancient and vibrant civilization. It will set India back and reduce it to being a failed modern republic, torn apart by violence and hatred, by inequity and intolerance. These painful contortions can trigger off one of these two things  a revolt against parochial, treacherous and divisive politics with ordinary citizens ensuring the protection of India and all that it represents, or a temporary mutilation and destruction of the diverse and multi-hued fabric of society that will profoundly damage us. A resurrection from such a man-made morass will be a herculean task, compelling this energetic young nation to lag behind in the many avenues of opportunity, growth and development that are there for the asking.                
	Young face        
	The other disturbing face of the political truth is the self-serving posturing and manipulation that have become the hallmark of regional and national politics. The Congress has decided, rightly, to break away from the regional satraps who have been growing powerful on the fertile back of the party, with the regional leaders demanding the pie in the states and the creamy cake at the Centre for nothing in return, thus killing off the Congress vote share across the country. The recent United Progressive Alliance coalition led by the Congress has had to take the flak for the many corrupt practices of some of the partners in government who had kept the false coalition alive. They have managed to discredit themselves even though much good has been done in Manmohan Singhs tenure. Jockeying for power has betrayed India and Bharat at a time when the country was ready to take off. Leaders have been small-minded and very selfish. We need change desperately.         
	Most commentators, on all sides of the spectrum, refer to the forthcoming elections as the semi-final. The possibility of a fractured mandate looms large. There seems to be a disconnect with the ground realities. Politicians have been so busy feathering their personal nests, ignoring the tasks for which they were elected, that they have become habitual evaders of the job at hand. In the process, they have lost their grip on politics. The disintegration of the logic of the political and public space, and the disregard for the people have led to a fracturing of the polity, which needs to break down before it can be restored. Today, it continues to move on crutches.        
	There has to be an enforced rite of passage for all parties except possibly, the Bahujan Samaj Party, which is a spanking new avatar of a caste-based entity. India has to be released from the bondage of corrupt and exclusive governance. We need a government at the Centre that can take strong decisions without having to cower under the pressure of opportunist partners. The young face of the Congress is Rahul Gandhi. Is Varun Gandhi the young face of the Bharatiya Janata Party?

	Mamata Banerjees railway budget must have caused nightmares to all sensible economists  it was such a blatant act of political opportunism. Was the railway budget a precursor of things to come? Would Pranab Mukherjees Union budget for 2009-10 tread the same populist path? Fortunately, the finance minister has given us a pleasant surprise by presenting a budget which  although completely devoid of any big-ticket reforms  is a concrete attempt to implement the United Progressive Alliances goal of growth with social justice.         
	Of course, the line separating policy interventions that are populist and those that are genuine attempts to promote social justice can sometimes be very thin. However, all the new policy initiatives targeting the poor are typically (with a caveat that I will come to soon) on schemes and programmes that are very basic and legitimate attempts to improve the living standards of the poor. Who can question the need to spend more on increasing rural employment via the national rural employment guarantee scheme, rural health and infrastructure? Similarly, surely the aam aadmi in the urban sector deserves more public support? Mukherjee has responded to these needs by very substantial increases in budgetary outlay  144 per cent for NREGS, 45 percent for Bharat Nirman, which is the unified programme for rural infrastructure, 87 per cent for the Jawaharlal Nehru Urban Renewal Mission.               
	But, now for the caveat. During the course of his budget speech, the finance minister has said that the government is committed to providing a real wage of Rs 100 a day as an entitlement under the NREGA. While this is a noble intention, its implications need to be examined carefully. Since market wages in many rural areas are far below this level, there will be an upward pressure on market wages. Employers responses are then quite predictable. They will cut back on employment and will also pass on the higher cost of production to final consumers. An obvious implication is that the price of food will also rise. This will, in turn, have an adverse effect on the well-being of the poor, both in urban and rural areas. The cutback in employment will, of course, be an additional negative effect as far as agricultural labourers are concerned. The bottom line is that the implications of interventions that distort market prices need to be analysed carefully before they are actually carried out.        
	The budget also shows that the finance minister has taken a very conscious decision to provide another fairly large stimulus package so as to coax the economy back to a high-growth path. Overall expenditure has been stepped up quite significantly. In addition, budgetary outlays in several key infrastructural areas have been stepped up quite significantly. For instance, the outlay for national highways goes up by 23 per cent, while railways also receives a substantial increase in budgetary support. The priority given to infrastructure is consistent with the prevalent feeling that highways, ports and power act as crucial constraints in impeding growth in India. An additional benefit is that spending in these sectors has a relatively large multiplier effect and so will provide a big boost to aggregate demand.        
	Mukherjee could have tried to raise additional resources in order to finance the increased expenditure. In fact, most people had expected that he would increase excise tax rates at least partially because this would simply reverse the steep cut in taxes that he had effected some time ago as part of an earlier stimulus package. That he has resisted the temptation to do so emphasizes his belief that the domestic economy continues to need large doses of support from the government before it can recover from the effects of the global slowdown  any increase in taxes would have had a dampening effect on aggregate demand and hence on the prospects for growth. This is a budget that leaves the tax system virtually unchanged. Most of the relatively small changes have been in favour of the tax payers. The corporate sector must have welcomed the removal of the controversial fringe benefit tax, while all tax payers will benefit since the surcharge on income tax has been abolished.         
	There is no such thing as a free lunch. The increased expenditure on the social sectors and infrastructure combined with the disinclination to raise tax revenues will increase the fiscal deficit. The Central governments fiscal deficit is estimated to be 6.8 per cent of gross domestic product. Since state governments have also been allowed to resort to market borrowings, the combined deficit of the Central and state governments will be massive  almost 11 per cent of GDP. One does not require a rocket scientist to point out that this level of fiscal deficit cannot be sustained in the long run. Clearly, the current priority is to steer the economy back to the high-growth phase as well as finance all the promised programmes in the social sectors. Mukherjee must be planning to change track and practise fiscal prudence within a year or so after the short-term goal has been achieved.               
	However, fiscal deficits of this magnitude can pose problems even in the short term. The government will have to resort to market borrowings of a gigantic scale to cover the deficit. This must inevitably result in an upward pressure on interest rates since there will be an excess demand for credit at current interest rates. If interest rates increase, then the private sector will tend to borrow less as a response to the higher cost of borrowing. In economists jargon, private entrepreneurs will be crowded out of the credit market. Of course, this will tend to offset the positive effects of the stimulus package.        
	This leads me to the aspect of the budget that I find the most deplorable. The budget speech states that the disinvestment target during the course of the year is a minuscule Rs 1,000 crore. Compare this to the figure of Rs 25,000 crore mentioned in the Economic Survey, released just a couple of days before the budget and by the same ministry! Why did the finance minister develop cold feet about selling off shares in public-sector enterprises at a time when there was an overwhelming economic argument to use the proceeds from these sales to reduce the size of the fiscal deficit? Was there political pressure from the other partners of the UPA? Perhaps, we must wait for Mukherjees memoirs to find out the answer.

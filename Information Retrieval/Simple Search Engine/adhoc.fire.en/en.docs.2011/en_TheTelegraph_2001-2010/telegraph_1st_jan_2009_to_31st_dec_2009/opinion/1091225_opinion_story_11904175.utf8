	The Bharatiya Janata Party may be the biggest loser in Jharkhand, but it is the Congress that faces the toughest challenge over the formation of the next government. That the Congress does not have the numbers to form a government on its own or even with its allies is not its major problem. The bigger challenge that the party faces is one of political morality. The election results make it obvious that the party has little option but to play kingmaker to Shibu Soren of the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha. Mr Soren was forced to resign from the United Progressive Alliance government following his conviction in a murder case in 2006. Although he was acquitted on appeal a year later, he was not reinstated in the Union cabinet. If the Congress now supports a government led by Mr Soren, its claim to clean politics will be seriously dented. While it lost the JMM as an ally before the polls, the Congress gained a new one in the Jharkhand Vikas Manch, the party that the former chief minister, Babulal Marandi, floated after quitting the BJP. Mr Marandi has a clean image, but his party has fewer numbers than Mr Sorens. And that makes it difficult for the Congress to choose Mr Marandi over Mr Soren.        
	However, despite the uncertainty that the fragmented verdict threatens, the one thing Jharkhand needs most is a stable government. Political instability over the past few years may have benefited some of the states unscrupulous politicians, but it has had a ruinous effect on peoples lives. Jharkhand is one of the states that are worst hit by Maoist violence. A political vacuum and a paralyzed administration have together made the states fight against the Maoists largely ineffective. Another spell of political instability will cause irreparable damage to whatever little of the rule of law exists in the state. Checking the Maoist menace, therefore, has to be the first priority for the next chief minister. Fighting the rebels successfully is also a pre-condition for the states economic uplift. Despite its abundant natural resources, Jharkhand remains one of the poorest states in the country. And the grinding poverty in which most of its tribal people live makes the state a breeding ground for Maoist rebels. Jharkhands politicians have dashed its peoples hopes regarding the creation of the new state. The price of their failure is already proving too high.

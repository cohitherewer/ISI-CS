	Baulsphere: My travels with the wandering bards of Bengal By Mimlu Sen, Random House, Rs 395        
	This book deals with the lives of the bauls of Bengal. It leads us into the mysterious nomadic lives of these wandering minstrels who see life as a divine pilgrimage. For the first time, it informs us about a world so close to our own, and yet so strange. Our initial reaction to this captivating account can be nothing but unanticipated satisfaction.        
	The ancient bauls had become a part of the landscape of Bengal. It was only during the 1970s that the bauls attracted the attention of eminent theatrical personalities of Europe, who were inspired by these ordinary people and considered them divine. They patronized the bauls and helped them create a recognition for themselves in Europe, making their music globally known. Jerzy Grotowski, Peter Brook and Andre Gregory were among many who found in the bauls something that Western philosophy was frantically looking for. If this helped the wandering singers, it also somewhat changed their ways of life, which were earlier limited only to religious devotion.         
	In ancient times, the bauls used to be associated with temples and sang devotional songs during festivals. They were patronized by the villagers. But the changes in social attitude in the modern times transformed the bauls into nomads living a hazardous life. They even started begging in suburban trains for survival. Mimlu Sens fascinating account of these people and their bizarre ways of life is knitted so closely into the texture of her narrative that it makes the reader become a part of their weird and wonderful world.         
	The narrative starts from Paris where Sen lived before she met three bauls who mesmerized the people of Paris with their performance. She left home to follow one of them, Paban Das Baul, into the heart of Bengal. There she discovered the real lives of these people, what she calls Baulsphere.         
	The book is a journey that takes us through important baul routes  from Durgapur to Santiniketan, Ghoshpara to Agradwip and Boral and finally to Paris  to explore a world that is as beautiful as it is strange and hazardous.         
	But the book is also a succinct account of Sens own life, which is no less stranger than fiction, and adds to the narratives captivating flavour. If the lives of the bauls move us, Sens risky venture into their world and the bohemian style of her life also fascinate us. The real interest of the book, however, lies in the lives of the bauls, who try to find truth in many ways like singing songs and practicing asanas and sexual rituals through yoga. What is remarkable about some of the baul gurus is that they sometimes challenge the stereotypes of conventional religious beliefs in their quest for truth. While Sen wanders deeper into this strange world of songs and rituals, we meet tantriks, sadhus and tribals, poor and middle-class men and certain outlandish characters who inspire awe.        
	Sen does not enter this world as an outsider but gets deeply involved with the beauty of the lush Bengal countryside and the bizarre ways of the bauls. She even falls in love with one of them and finally becomes a part of the baul world. The book contains innumerable translations of known and less-known baul songs that are difficult to find elsewhere. It also contains photographs of bauls in different fairs and akharas. Written in a language that resonates with the cadence of music, Baulsphere adds significantly to the available literature about the bauls.

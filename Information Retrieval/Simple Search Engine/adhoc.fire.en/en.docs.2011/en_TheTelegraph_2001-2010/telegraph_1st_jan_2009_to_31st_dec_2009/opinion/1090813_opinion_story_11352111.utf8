The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A tale of two bus rides
                                                                                                                 A TALE OF TWO BUS RIDES                          - No bagpipes on the road to Haldwani					 					      Anuradha Roy                                                      
	The eight-lane National Highway 24 changes to two lanes at the mouth of the interstate bus terminal at Anand Vihar in East Delhi, funnelling dust-caked buses from Bareilly, Lucknow, Bulandshahr and Kashipur into their final traffic jam. At the entrance were rickshaws, men hefting bundles, sleepy-eyed, feet-dragging children who had slept the night on the bus, and a woman in a red and gold sari seated on the pavement, plaiting her daughters hair with single-minded brutality. The girl winced but said nothing as her far-eyed mother tugged and pulled. Inside the vast terminal with bays marked A, B, C and D, the cement and tarmac breathed out visible currents of heat.        
	I cannot remember the last time I travelled by a state roadways bus to anywhere but Jaipur, and Jaipur doesnt count. Its buses are cool and smooth, the highway to Jaipur is silken, the Rajasthan Roadways bus stop in Delhi is a green lawn in the best part of town. It has a caf that sells milkshakes and espressos. Here, apart from the newspaper boys, there were boys selling plastic pouches of water and touts enticing customers with promises of cheaper tickets. At the legitimate ticket counter, there were two queues: the law-abiding had huddled in front, hunched over the tiny hole in the glass that barricaded off the ticket man. The lawless entered through the door at the back. This was what I did, sidestepping the large, very scarred and odoriferous feet of a man asleep on a bench in one half of the two-foot by two-foot ticket booth. The other man in the ticket booth was awake, just. A bus to Haldwani, I said to the back of his head. He didnt look up, he waved somewhere to the right and mumbled, then applied himself once more to the hole in the glass window. My illegal turn was over.              
	We stood on our marks, in sprinter crouches by the bus door, ready to pounce on the seats we had demarcated for ourselves in our minds. Tickets would be sold on the bus, for the seat you had grabbed: from now on only the fittest would survive. A man arrived with a broom and, oblivious of our anxiety, shooed us some distance away. Inside, the bus was ankle-deep with the detritus of its previous occupants: we heard sounds of sweeping and the broom pushed discarded water bottles, bags of rotted food, empty chips packets towards the door. Nearby, a tea-stall played a succession of shrill songs. A eunuch in a shimmery green and gold sari did a round, saw the bus was not ready for her yet, and slouched away shaking her long gilt earrings. People paced, then rushed off in confused obedience towards unseen drivers shouting the departures of other buses. The sweeping sound from inside our bus  now we felt a sense of ownership towards the puke-stained vehicle before us  came closer and closer to the door. The sweeper reached the door, paused and told us to stand back. He positioned himself on the top stair of the bus and flung the rubbish onto the ground. When he had finished, we waded into the bus through the freshly-strewn garbage and grabbed the best, early-bird seats.         
	The curtains were pale blue, so were the seats, both blues darkened to navy by grime. Generations of old passengers had left their dandruff, DNA and sweat on those seats. The shaded window-glass and smell of old hair-oil gave the interior the feel of a quacks seedy clinic. Newspaper and cardboard had been used to block up warped or missing window panes. The eunuch reappeared, flirted, wheedled, and then commanded in a contralto. She thumped my shoulder in exasperation when she saw I was too distracted by my phone to fish money out for her. Her earrings jangled, her bangles clinked, and a thin dark shadow of stubble doomed her upper lip and chin to early-morning malehood. A buck-toothed grandmother had been deposited next to me by her children, who clearly did not want her spoiling their fun further back in the bus. She wore a pink sari dotted all over with white heart-shapes, and talked of long-ago holidays with her father and sisters in Nainital. Are you married, do you have children? she asked, and then said, I have children but these days every one is so busy. They have no time for anyone else.        
	The bus revved and then charged forward. The driver had a wild, feverish air, a cadaverous face, and he flung his shoulders this way and that as he wrestled with his hoop of a wheel. He thrust his head out of the window to yell questions to truckers coming down the opposite way: Arre ustad, is there a jam ahead? Or to a bus driver: Is the bridge open, should I go ahead? The bush telegraph of the Indian highways. The curtains around him billowed in the scorching air that charged through his glassed-off part of the bus: the only section not air-conditioned. So he wore a singlet and trousers, no more, and at times doused his head with water from a bottle he stowed under his seat. He had nothing but caustic contempt for our prim, bathed and T-shirted conductor who sought refuge in the air-conditioned, passenger section of the bus. The driver revelled in the exclusivity of his fiery ride. He was tough, we were ninnies. He swabbed himself with a wet rag, he laughed and sang. When it was folksongs, his voice was swaggering and loud. With romantic film-songs, it dropped to a self-conscious, piping falsetto from which he emerged at abrupt intervals to yell curses at cars in his way: Arre saala, Privaaate! He swerved towards them to give them a fright. Cars were the enemy. In the rear-view mirror, his eyes gleamed. Bushes of black hair exploded from his underarms.              
	The last time I was in a bus, as it happened, had been four days before, on a three-day trip through Scotland. The driver looked like Mel Gibson in a resplendent kilt. He murmured to us to put on our seat belts. He gave us a passionate history of the Jacobites and Bonnie Prince Charlie via a microphone clipped into his shirt, and at times he interrupted his narrative with recordings of bagpipes or mournful, melodic Scottish ballads. Mel MacGibsons voice had the grainy edge expected of movie stars. He refused our offers of lunch with courteous disdain, making it clear that we were Duty, while lunchtime was Pleasure, to be savoured in solitude. But he walked us to a hill above Loch Lomond, and at the top, he played his own bagpipes, staring into the water as if we were passing shadows on the sunlit days of his mind. His part of the bus was air-conditioned just as ours was, and his seat was better than ours.       The author rsquo;s novel, An Atlas of Impossible Longing, was published last year

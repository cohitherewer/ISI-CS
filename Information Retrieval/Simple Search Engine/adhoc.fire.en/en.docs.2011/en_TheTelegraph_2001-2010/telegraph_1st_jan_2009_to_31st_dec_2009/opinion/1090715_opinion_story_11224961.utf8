	Criminal waste                  
	Sir  Over the last six decades, the Indian defence establishment has turned itself into an institution that splurges public money without any accountability under the euphemism of operational secrecy (Art of waging war in golf cart July 11).While high-ranking officials in the army merrily waste public money, their subordinates have gained notoriety for their misdemeanour in public places. These two factors have become trademarks of the defence forces. As a tax-payer, I cannot help worrying as to how much of Rs 141,703 crore  the amount allocated for defence in this years Budget  will actually be used in securing the borders. Perhaps a sizeable amount will be spent on buying duds.           
	The new system of vesting financial power in army commanders is a red herring. These officials are professionally trained to fight and win wars and lack experience when it comes to handling public funds. Besides, what is the logic of burdening armymen with nitty-gritty of defence purchases? There are already men to do this job on their behalf. The Comptroller and Auditor General should be thanked for keeping a watchful eye on the spending of public money. The nation is eager to know what action will be taken against those who have been named in the CAG report.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Chameli Pal, Batanagar

                
	Sir  One wonders whether there was any coordination within the armed forces for the purchase of expensive equipment such as the Advanced Light Helicopter, Dhruv. The authorities did not enquire whether the army actually required such equipment, nor did they censure those who had clearly violated the government-guidelines. There is no way in which such pilfering of tax-payers money can be justified, and the government should take steps to penalize the offenders. India should alter its policy concerning defence procurements. To weed out the discrepancies in defence expenditure, the government should introduce a separate defence budget every two years so that expenditure by the armed forces can be scrutinized and kept in check.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Jayant Datta, Hooghly

                
	Sir  The CAG report has exposed the ineptitude and corruption in the armed forces when it comes to defence expenditure. The Dhruv helicopter is useless with regard to the requirements because it fails to meet the service ceiling by as much as 1,500 metres. The stretchers  without provisions of intravenous fluid bottles or wheels  are not suited for use during war. Yet, the Northern Command went ahead with its plan of buying such obsolete equipment. What takes the cake though is the purchase of golf carts as recce vehicles. The CAG report has exposed the lapses that have cost the people a huge amount of money. Some are of the opinion that army commanders are above corruption as they are supposedly a disciplined lot. People tend to forget that army officials are just like other professionals. They are susceptible to greed and crave power and elevated status. Some cases of corruption within the ranks have come to light, but several others have gone unreported. The authorities will have to examine whether the irregularities cited by the CAG report are instances of corrupt dealings involving kickbacks. Tax-payers in India have a right to know the course of action that has been decided upon on the basis of the CAG report.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Amit Banerjee, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The lapses in defence spending is a serious matter. The purchases must be investigated thoroughly and the guilty punished severely irrespective of their rank. Measures should be taken to avoid the recurrence of such incidents in the future.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Ranjit Sinha, Deolali

                
	Poor planning          
	Sir  If 6,000 people bought not more than 2 kilos of potatoes at Rs 13 per kg, each buyer must have saved Rs 6, considering the market price of potatoes is Rs 16 per kg. This was not a great incentive for those who had to spend about 30 minutes to be served (Babus turn potato seller, July 12). A hundred babus with full police protection were employed by the government to carry out this job. Apart from the fact that it was a waste of time and money, the plan flopped miserably. Instead of deploying babus for the task,the state government should act on its proposal to sell potatoes and some other necessary products at subsidized rates from fair-price shops till the rising prices are controlled.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Asim Dasgupta, the zero-deficit finance minister, has found a new occupation. But why is he selling his ware only in Calcutta? Is he not aware that in no way does Calcutta represent the poverty that is afflicting a large section of West Bengal? It would do him and his government a world of good if they were to shun such populist strategies and concentrate on some real social work.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Tusar Kanti Kar, Howrah

                
	Sir  The decision to sell potatoes at subsidized rates is a revolutionary one. The proposal to sell potatoes, cooking oil and sugar at lower rates from fair-price shops is also welcome. Potatoes are an important ingredient in Bengals culinary culture. At a time when the prices of most vegetables have risen, the message from the government is that people should now live on potatoes only.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Timir Dev Sharmana, Calcutta              
	Sir  Asim Dasgupta is right in stating that the government cannot sit back and relax as the prices of essentials go up. However, the minister should also consider selling vegetables and fish at special rates, considering the fact that tomatoes are now selling at 50 rupees per kg and hilsa costs Rs 500. The public distribution system should also be strengthened to prevent black-marketing.          
	Yours faithfully,

	I am not sure mythology respects national boundaries. There are common motifs linking myths and tales from entirely different parts of the world. Perhaps some societies have remained more in touch with their myths  its certainly true that myth operates in almost all spheres of life in India, including the commercial.         
	Myths are constantly being reinterpreted to create new, more relevant myths. And there are opposing streams of myths. There is the official body of myths promoted by those in power: the prescriptive myths that may perpetuate divisions based on class, caste or gender. These myths usually claim sanction by religion or tradition. Then there is the evolving and layered body of myths with room enough for point and counterpoint, classical and folk traditions. This great and inclusive storehouse has continued to serve as a bank for writers, artists and filmmakers as they try to understand the world.        
	In my case, both The Thousand Faces of Night and When Dreams Travel focus on womens lives and dreams. So, they turn to myths that contain chaste, self-effacing women as well as the more ambiguous figures of women who offer resistance to the ideal model. Myths help to locate certain irrational parts of our existence. They always seem to contain subversive elements, which leak into the more straightforward moral stories in unexpected and revealing ways. In When Dreams Travel, I used the Scheherazade story  of a bride telling stories to hold the bloodthirsty sultans interest. The story is like the stage of the novel. And onstage we get to see some of the many faces of female chastity and male power.              
	My use of mythology was not a conscious decision. The heart of the novel came first, then the mythology as strategy to make a small space spacious. When I was writing my first novel, The Thousand Faces of Night, I was genuinely puzzled by the apparent thinness of my main characters lives. Then I realized that if I was to do their individual voices justice, I would have to fill in the background with a thousand voices  of all the real and mythical heroines whose life stories tell these three women how to live, in both normative and subversive ways.         
	In retrospect, I see that I owe a huge debt to A.K. Ramanujan, who was one of the finest curators of Indian tales. I am also a great admirer of Calvino and Borges. But most of all, I was influenced by the timeless and sophisticated Indian storytelling traditions of texts such as the Kathasaritsagara and the Jataka tales, and the written and oral versions of the Panchatantra and the Mahabharata. In at least three of my novels, stories are essential to the central characters quest. In The Thousand Faces of Night, stories help young Devi learn what is expected of her as a woman and also how she can twist and turn these expectations to survive. In The Ghosts of Vasu Master, an old man learns what it is to teach and heal by telling a mute child invented fables about their lives. In When Dreams Travel, the same story mutates in all kinds of ways to look at love, power and sexuality from different vantage points.        
	I see my business as a writer as a planned, structured way of presenting my subject, dissecting it, linking it with other related themes. In The Thousand Faces of Night, for example, I use this approach to enlarge the limited space of womens lives. The background of mythical figures, from Sita to Kali, can help us understand Indian womens lives, instead of just seeing that they are hemmed in. But while the central narrative persona in both The Thousand Faces of Night and When Dreams Travel is female, mens lives, especially in When Dreams Travel, are also viewed through the prism of enabling and handicapping myths. Myth shows us that both men and women are trapped in the sexual power game; that all their tales should elicit irony as well as compassion.        
	What in particular about the tales of the Arabian Nights attracted me? Its inclusive nature; what Borges calls its labyrinthine quality. The story-within-a-story format allowed me to take a theme, in this case power and sexuality, and construct a series of Chinese boxes. I could open one box to find another till my narrative penetrated to the smallest box, the kernel of the matter. The Arabian Nights also has all kinds of stories  the fabulous, the moral, the bawdy and the childlike. The challenge was to take parts of the framework story as a starting point without losing my way in the extravagance of design or language you find in the Arabian Nights. I wanted my novel to acknowledge the Arabian Nights as an ancestor, not as a model. All the stories in When Dreams Travel are my inventions and they have very real links with contemporary lives. Finally, what I wanted to do was create modern myths with the Arabian Nights as my point of departure.        
	In When Dreams Travel, female sexuality is a source of power, but it is also the source of death. This is a theme I have fashioned out of what I see in the real world. It is not just in the Arabian Nights or in the remote past that the space or setting of sexuality is darkness. And the space of death is, again, darkness. In When Dreams Travel, darkness almost comes to be a character, a character who is gradually stripped of different layers, to reveal what some of the complicated links among power, sexuality and survival look like. And this applies to both male and female sexuality in the novel.              
	Jean Rhys in Wide Sargasso Sea created a prequel and corrective to Jane Eyre from the point of view of the underdog, Mrs Rochester. Wide Sargasso Sea completes our picture of the Rochesters by taking us to another world altogether, to another, equally valid and important, point of view. In a sense, this is what I try to do with the Scheherazade myth. I take something apparently dated and remote from our present-day lives and connect it to the contemporary world through fictional narrative. There is a resemblance between Mrs Rochester, Antoinette, in Rhyss novel and Dunyazad in When Dreams Travel in the sense that both women are more or less silent in the original work in which they make their appearance. Their bodies are there, but not their voices or their stories. But I do not really see Dunyazad as an underdog figure in the Arabian Nights story, nor do I see When Dreams Travel as an updating of or corrective to the Arabian Nights.        
	I think it would be more accurate to say that while Scheherazade is centre stage, as woman or storyteller or saviour, Dunyazad, the silent accomplice, occupies a part of the stage that is almost unlit. It is always this mysterious, unknown corner of a story that sets the writer going. It was Dunyazads position as the unheard younger sister, the yearning, questioning follower, which allowed me to step into the story as a writer.

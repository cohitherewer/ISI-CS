                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Under a cloud                  
	Sir  The arrest of Buta Singhs son, Sarobjit, who has been accused of blackmailing a Nashik-based businessman, is another nail in the coffin of Buta Singhs political career (CBI quiz and case loom on Buta, Aug 3). The episode is also likely to bring the attention back to the questionable transparency of the National Commission for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, which is headed by Singh.           
	The seriousness of Sarobjits arrest lies in the fact that he is the son of a VIP. Moreover, it is alleged that he had taken a bribe for settling a case pending with the NCSCST itself. This episode comes close on the heels of the arrest of the member-secretary of the All India Council for Technical Education whose chairman is also undergoing a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (AICTE wings clipped, July 25). This makes it evident that such organizations are increasingly becoming dens of corruption. As expected, Singh has claimed that his sons arrest is nothing but a plot to malign him, and his refusal to resign from his constitutional post shows his impudence and lust for power.           
	It would be advisable for the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government to take prompt action by dismissing the NCSCST chairman who has proven to be a liability to the government.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Dilbag Rai, Chandigarh 

                
	Sir  It is not for the first time that Buta Singh is under fire. Similar allegations had been hurled at him during his tenure as the governor of Bihar. Singh has claimed his sons arrest to be a conspiracy of his political opponents. If that is the case, Buta Singh should end such controversies for good by exposing these conspirators, failing which he should be removed from the responsible post that he now holds. It is difficult to understand how influential people such as Singh are allowed to keep their posts even while facing repeated charges of corruption.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

                
	Sir  The arrest of Sarobjit Singh by the Indias premier investigating agency on charges of corruption is one of the most damaging assaults on the idea of social justice that the country has seen. That unlicensed pistols were apparently seized in a CBI raid at his residence makes matters worse for him.           
	What is more, Sarobjit has reportedly told CBI officials that his father, Buta Singh, the chairman of the NCSCST, knew of the bribe he had demanded of a businessman to quash a case against him that was pending with the NCSCST. That puts a question mark over the functioning of the commission that was formed to safeguard the interests of persons belonging to the less privileged sections of society. This is indicative of kleptocracy, where the ruling class stoops so low as to hold its own citizenry hostage.           
	Given the enormity of the accusations, it would be fitting to not only remove Buta from the chairmanship of the commission but also to re-examine the process by which bodies like the NCSCST receive and handle complaints.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	For the people          
	Sir  The passing away of Subhas Chakraborty will sadden his admirers as well as his critics (Chakraborty passes away, Aug 4). The state transport minister had proven himself to be a great asset to his party, the Communist Party of India (Marxist). He was an excellent organizer, especially of large rallies, even at short notice. Although he was not that efficient in fulfilling his ministerial responsibilities, he will be remembered as an able and colourful political leader.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Kalyan Ghosh, Singapore

                
	Sir  The death of Subhas Chakraborty was a blow not only to the members of the Left Front government but also to a section of the Bengali community. Chakraborty was a dedicated Marxist. Marxism never forces anyone to forsake his or her own beliefs, and this was exactly the quality he embodied. Often misunderstood owing to his outspokenness, he was a forthright individual. Although it is a truism that man is mortal, men like Subhas Chakraborty will be sorely missed.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Sambuddha Sengupta, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Subhas Chakrabortys death came as a shock to the people at large. With his death the people of West Bengal have lost the man who was a link between the people and the government. Chakrabortys biggest strength was that he was accessible to all sections of society. Unlike Chakraborty, most other communist leaders enjoy a formal relationship with the public. In this respect, Chakraborty was indeed an exception. But at the same time, we must not go overboard in our praises of his achievements as a minister. In fact, he failed miserably in discharging his ministerial duties and was notorious for courting controversy. He did precious little to solve the problems that afflict the ministries of transport, tourism and sport and youth affairs. For instance, despite his proclamations, nothing much has been done to curb vehicular pollution in Calcutta. There is no doubt that Chakraborty was a mass leader and his death has robbed poor people of a man who stood by them in their troubles. But as a minister, his achievements left much to be desired and he will not be missed in this respect.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Deba Pratim Ghatak, Durgapur

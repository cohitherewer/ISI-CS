	It is not difficult to see why the Chinese communists fret over the Dalai Lamas freedom of movement and speech. By keeping alive the Tibetan question, he exposes the nature of the Chinese rule in Tibet. Beijings embarrassment over this is understandable, but that is no reason why any government should restrict the Dalai Lamas freedoms. Beijings objections to his visit to Arunachal Pradesh were thus both morally and politically untenable. New Delhi could respond to these in only one way  by ignoring them and refusing to interfere with the Tibetan leaders freedoms. And, given his responsibility to guide the destiny of the Tibetan people, it is entirely upto him to decide how he would do it. China may see a political conspiracy in everything he says about the condition of the people in Tibet, but neither New Delhi nor any other government needs to be unnecessarily upset about the Chinese view. In fact, the Indian prime minister, Manmohan Singh, showed admirable statesmanship by refusing to be bullied by Beijing on the Dalai Lamas visit to the state on the India-China border. That huge crowds attended his teachings at Tawang and elsewhere in the state was also a clear rejection of Beijings attempted blackmail.        
	In hindsight, the controversy over the visit seems to be utterly irrelevant to the real issues of India-China relationship. The war of words between the two countries, however, gave the false impression that the visit would have serious repercussions on ties between them. The geopolitical compulsions today make it absolutely necessary for the two countries to make common cause on many important issues. Whether it is on poverty reduction, fair trade or climate change, both New Delhi and Beijing have more to gain by joining hands than by stirring conflicts. True, there are unsettled issues between the two, especially on the border and regarding Beijings help to Pakistans military build-up. Neither side expects these disputes to be settled very soon. But disputes are not all in the India-China relationship. The recent surge in bilateral trade shows that the two can do business even before the disputes are settled. The unnecessary heat generated over the Dalai Lamas visit, however, poses a warning. Jingoistic sentiments can sometimes derail mature diplomacy. Both India and China can do without small games of one-upmanship.

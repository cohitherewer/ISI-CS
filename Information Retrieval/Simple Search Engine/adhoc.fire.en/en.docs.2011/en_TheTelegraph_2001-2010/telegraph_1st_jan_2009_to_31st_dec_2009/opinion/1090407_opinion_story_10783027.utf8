                                                                                                                 EMPTY PROMISES                                                    
	Election manifestos in India represent populism and promises never intended to be kept. This is true of all political parties, irrespective of their ideological orientation. A reading of the manifestos of the two main parties that have some sort of an all-India aspiration  the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party  will prove the validity of this claim. The manifestos are nothing more than attempts to fool and bribe the electorate. At one level, they display the contempt political parties have for those who elect them. Thus, political parties are willing to promise anything and everything. The manifesto of the BJP asserts that if the party comes to power it will remove the income tax on the armed forces. The party is deliberately ignoring the problematic nature of such a move. Its sole concern is to woo the vote of those who serve in the armed forces and of their family members. And the only way it can think of doing this is by making false promises. By the same logic, poverty is transformed into a platform for wooing voters. Populism is the instrument for doing this: there is thus a rice war between the BJP and the Congress. Both want to provide rice and wheat at cheap prices to those living below the poverty line. The assumption is that this will lure the poor voter to press the button next to the hand or the lotus.        
	The premise of both parties, in spite of their other differences, is that the people will not vote for them unless they are lured with some material offering to do so. Reasoned arguments have no place in election manifestos, only promise after promise. History shows that once the elections are over, no political party remembers the promises it had made. Governance and performance (in the case of the incumbent government) are not issues that come up during the elections and the campaign leading up to them. Elections thus pander to some of the baser instincts of human beings, whereas democracy is supposed to represent a high and noble ideal. Inherent in this odd contradiction is perhaps the immaturity of Indian democracy. In the developed world, false promises and populism are seldom key factors in elections. The debates there are about policies that embody contending visions. Elections in India are dominated by three ps  personalities, populism and promises. These may serve to make elections into a great pan-Indian carnival, but they do not add body and substance to democracy in India.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A precious world mindlessly destroyed
                                                                                                                 A PRECIOUS WORLD MINDLESSLY DESTROYED                              The adjunct professor scheme is not going to solve any of the problems that beset Presidency College today. The attitude towards higher education needs to be changed first, writes Dipankar Dasgupta                        Golden past				                                       
	Criticisms aimed at the government of West Bengal at this juncture might sound particularly harsh. They could even be misread as adducing support to Sergius Saranoffs deeply cynical observation in George Bernard Shaws play, Arms and the Man: Soldiering, my dear madam, is the cowards art of attacking mercilessly when you are strong, and keeping out of harms way when you are weak.        
	On the other hand, following its recent misfortunes at the polls and the devastation wreaked by Aila, the government has hopefully shifted gear from arrogance to introspection and it is a plausible hypothesis that it will view critical appraisals more constructively than in the past. It is in this context that one needs to take a look at a report published in the Metro pages of The Telegraph (Wanted: Alumni A-Team, June 8).         
	According to the report, Presidency College is considering an overhaul of its teaching resources through the introduction of an adjunct professor scheme. The principal of the college says, The departments will suggest the names of experts, who could be retired professors of Presidency College, retired professors of other colleges, IIT teachers, ex-students of the college whoever they think will enhance the quality of education at the institution.        
	The motive underlying the colleges decision would have been commendable, to say the least, had the report not concluded with a paradoxical piece of information: A teacher of the college said, The general feeling was that the quality of teaching in the college had gone down. To address that a fund was sanctioned to hire adjunct professors... In other words, the names of the experts will be recommended by the faculties of the very departments in which the quality of teaching is sub-standard! Indeed, while it stands to reason that an authority in a field is well-equipped to identify qualified peers, does it sound convincing that the poorer personnel, who, according to a general feeling, are responsible for the downfall of the institution, are competent enough to judge what constitutes excellence?        
	To drive home the point, a capable academician will have published in anonymously refereed, internationally reputed journals pertaining to his field of specialization. Does it stand to reason that such a person can be judged or even identified by the faculty of a college that has spurned academic excellence during the entire span of the present governments term as an instance of elitism? Quite clearly, the plan belongs to the realm of the absurd, and a profoundly ridiculous one at that, given the further assurance that the departmental lists will be screened by a university-appointed body. As the report clarifies, [Sanjib] Ghosh [the principal] explained that the names suggested by the departments would be rigorously scrutinized by a search committee comprising two external subject experts, two government nominees and the principal. The question that stares one in the face is: Who appoints the committee itself? One suspects that the state government will be the final authority in the matter (covering its face under a veil known as the university), given especially the tell tale signal that the committee will include two government nominees. And one doesnt know, of course, who would be in charge of selecting the external experts.              
	Ones back to square one it would seem. It is a common perception that the state government itself is solely responsible for the degeneration of Presidency College from an institution whose faculty included some of the best professors in their respective disciplines to one which houses a large number of teachers who would probably have been denied admission to the college even as students. If this assessment contains even the minutest grain of truth, then the adjunct professor proposal could well turn into a farce, especially so, since the government is likely to ensure through its nominees that it will enjoy substantial clout in the search process. And, in any case, there is little reason to believe that all departments will succeed in preparing lists of competent persons.         
	While this author is not adequately informed to make observations on the state of affairs prevailing in the entire college, he does possess enough information about parts of the institution to conclude that something is rotten about the manner in which it has been running for several years now. Assuming that high scores in the West Bengal Higher Secondary board examination reflect true merit, the college admits only the best applicants from the state. It attracts bright students from outside the state too. However, in certain departments at least, these very students undergo a metamorphosis of sorts almost within a month since joining. Needless to say, the metamorphosis does not involve their intrinsic abilities. What changes is their perception of the purpose underlying their entry into the college. Except for a small number of highly motivated students (around 5 to 6 in a class of 40 or so), the rest begin to consider classroom lectures to be pointless exercises at best and a waste of time at worst. Students whose sincerity leaves little to be questioned admit that tutorial homes enjoy more importance than regular classes in their list of priorities, for these homes alone assure success in the final examinations.               
	These students interest in absorbing the same material in two forms  the tutorial and the non-tutorial  is limited, what with the second of these yielding little dividends under the present examination system. Also, since most young people cannot be expected to be engaged in all work and no play, smart students too prefer to shy away from most classes run by the college. And they do this with impunity since roll calls in some departments are a matter of formality. Absence from classes is a misdeed that can be easily rectified at the discretion of the departmental heads.         
	Given this scenario, what is the adjunct professor scheme expected to deliver? The principal declares that the college will pay Rs 1,000 for each lecture on par with what the IITs pay. One is not too sure if the size of the honorarium is either a necessary or a sufficient condition for attracting dedicated as well as accomplished teachers. The opportunity to interact with bright young minds is a pleasure that most committed teachers look forward to and, in a large number of cases, that pleasure itself is reward enough. Neither the monetary benefit, nor the availability of excellent teachers stands in the way of revitalizing the college. The problem lies elsewhere. Even if Nobel Laureates were to agree to deliver the 20 precious lectures a month, would the students have any incentive to attend them? There is little doubt that the best teachers will refrain from presenting their lectures in tutorial home formats. Consequently, under the non-elitist educational system, the lectures will fall on deaf ears. And this will happen even if (and this is a monumentally big if) the college authorities have sufficient control over the students to make it mandatory for them to attend the super-duper lectures.         
	Unless the very attitude towards undergraduate as well as postgraduate education undergoes a quantum transformation  and this means, amongst other things, that the government stops interfering in this sphere of social life  there is little hope of reviving ailing government-aided academic institutions in this state, leave alone Presidency College. It is doubtful indeed that Presidency College can ever be restored to its former glory. As was the case with the Bamiyan Buddhas, it was a work of art that was mindlessly destroyed by people who lacked the ability to appreciate its elegance.              
	Unlike many others, this author is not a sworn critic of the Left Front government. On the contrary, he believes that it has a large number of commendable achievements to its credit. The fact remains nonetheless that The evil that men do lives after them;/ The good is oft interred with their bones       The author is former professor of economics, Indian Statistical Institute, Calcutta

	Everything is Connected By Daniel Barenboim, Weidenfeld amp; Nicolson, Rs 895        
	The problem with very distinguished men  great conductors, Nobel laureates, celebrity academics  is that they often repeat themselves. This is alright when one is listening to them talk on different occasions: the repetitions become part of the public unfolding of their charisma. But if the speeches, lectures, conversations and articles are printed together as a book, then the ideas, images and anecdotes coming back over and over again, sometimes in exactly the same words, become tedious, and one starts skipping. The problem is twofold. First, if these repeated elements are edited out after first occurrence, then there is a risk of there being little left to make a book that is more than just a gathering of crumbs. Second, there are very few editors of Diana-Athill mettle left these days, who would be able to stand firm against the Olympian cussedness of great men and lop a few limbs off their little darlings. So one is often left with repetitive ramblings, though generously strewn with nuggets of indisputable greatness.         
	In this book, Elena Cheah has brought together some lectures, addresses and articles by the Jewish conductor and pianist, Daniel Barenboim (born 1942). The first part comprises the 2006 Charles Eliot Norton lectures delivered at Harvard, entitled The Power of Music. The title is unfortunate. The lectures frequently turn to musical analogies and practice for making sense of, and intervening in, the horrible political impasse between Israel and Palestine. But it doesnt help to invoke an aesthetics of power when one is taking a brave political stance against a superpower and its allies. This was, of course, Beethovens problem with Napoleon and the Romantic Sublime, for which he found, and suffered, his own musical and personal resolutions. Barenboim repeatedly runs up against this ambivalence with power at the heart of music (and of any great art, for that matter) without quite addressing it in so many words. It is not enough to say, as he does eloquently at the end (and a few more times earlier), that before a Beethoven symphony, Mozarts Don Giovanni or Wagners Tristan und Isolde, all human beings are equal. Barenboims own achievements on the piano and with the legendary orchestras of the world are purely musical articulations of this humanism, and that is what one goes to him for. But one finds oneself looking for something else (it would be silly to say something more) from the Norton lectures, in delivering which Barenboim is in the company of musicians like Stravinsky, Bernstein and Cage.         
	In these lectures on the parallels between music and life for the thinking ear, Barenboim places himself within a secular tradition of Jewish thought. This is represented principally by Baruch Spinoza (whom Barenboim read for the first time at 13 and carried around dog-eared ever since) and by Heinrich Heine, Martin Buber and Sigmund Freud. But here, too, Barenboim describes the unifying principle of this tradition, with a rather disappointing expansiveness, as a tendency to adhere to the universality of human experience. I do not recoil with postmodern righteousness and horror from the spectre of the Universal, but Id rather listen to Barenboim playing the complete well-tempered Bach or conducting Waltraud Meier singing Isolde than be served up such anodyne generalities about human experience. If I do feel like being made to think about the philosophical underpinnings of Wag- ners music, or Beethovens, then I could go to Bryan Magee or Bernard Williams instead. And if I am faced with a choice between listening to Barenboims music, reading his reflections on music and music-making, and reading Magee or Williams, then I wouldnt think twice before choosing simply to listen to the music and to let the thinking come from the listening, for great performances always come rich with thought.        
	If one goes to Barenboim for anything other than his music, then it would be for his remarkable life (from Buenos Aires to Jerusalem to Chicago to Berlin, the only Israeli in the world who can also show a Palestinian passport at an Israeli border crossing) and for whatever can be conveyed in words of that profound and intimate knowledge of music that a master acquires through years of practising the crafts of his genius (in this case, playing the piano and conducting). Although this book is premised on its authors firm belief that it is impossible to speak about music, there is a great deal in it that can be culled for glimpses into both the life and the genius, especially in the interviews and occasional pieces gathered together in the second part, rather predictably called Variations.        
	When I finish playing one of the books of The Well-Tempered Clavier in one evening, Barenboim writes in the first lecture, I have the feeling that this is actually much longer than my real life, that I have been on a journey through history, one that begins and ends in silence. Such moments are strewn everywhere in the book, and are its real gifts. This surreal moment of waking not only out of, but also into, the dream of somebody elses music with a heightened, yet alienating, sense of ones own existence, this confounding of historical time, musical time and lived time, and this compulsion to put such a mysterious experience into words even when one is tragically (or comically) aware of the inadequacy of words, are, for me, the stuff of those moments of recognition in the last plays of Shakespeare, in which the maestro freely shows his marvellous hand. Barenboims account of playing Bachs Old Testament of fugues reminds me of the words of Posthumus in Cymbeline, condemned to hang, yet waking up to read Jupiters riddling prophecy of how his life will be saved, a speaking such/ As sense cannot untie: Be what it is,/ The action of my life is like it, which/ Ill keep, if but for sympathy.         
	In the interviews on Schumann and Mozart, the reminiscences of Pierre Boulez, Edward Said and Wilhelm Furtwngler, or the short piece on being reared on Bach, Barenboim speaks or writes effortlessly and lucidly from a place that is inside the space of music. To be here is to inhabit not only the distinct musical universe of each composer, but also the peculiar space-time of music realized as audible harmony on the piano or with a symphony orchestra and singers. It is to feel the weight or vertical pressure of music as sonorous air, while seeing its larger sequences and structures unfold, elaborate and transform themselves horizontally in a kind of spatially visualized time. And, at every moment of such visionary listening, to be able to say, like Shakespeares Posthumus, The action of my life is like it. It is to begin to see the shape of ones life revealed in the music like the view of a distant shoreline on a clear day, and then to summon up the rare sympathy with which to hand that vision down to the listener or reader as a gift.                    AVEEK SEN

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | will to change
                                                                                                                 WILL TO CHANGE                                                    
	The desire for change continues to define the current spell of politics in West Bengal. The results of the civic polls in Siliguri show that the people in the state vote on political lines, irrespective of issues and areas. The big swing away from the Left that began with the rural polls last year has been confirmed in all subsequent polls. So strong is the popular mood for a change that it seems to override all other factors. The winners obviously attribute their victories to the many failings of the losers. But an overwhelming popular surge can make issues such as governance and development inconsequential for an electoral contest. Siliguri is one of the few towns in West Bengal that had seen steady improvement in civic facilities over the past two decades. Most people agree that much of the credit for this should go to Asok Bhattacharya, the minister for urban development who hails from the town. He, of course, is not the first champion of development to realize that elections are ultimately all about political perceptions. The Congress leader, Subrata Mukherjee, won the hearts of Calcuttans with his development work during his tenure as the citys mayor, but his party lost the civic board in the 2005 elections. And, for all his drive for development, the chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, now presides over a possible end to the Lefts long reign in the state in the 2011 assembly elections.        
	True, the alliance between the Congress and the Trinamul Congress provided a winning formula against the Left. But in striking and then nurturing the alliance, the two parties have only reflected the popular will. There have been other occasions when the Opposition parties in the state tried to unite against the Left. But, if those attempts did not work, it was mainly because the popular mood for change was not as strong as it is now. Mamata Banerjee has reasons to be particularly happy about the wind of change reaching north Bengal. The vote in Siliguri marks the first big foray by her party outside its area of influence in south Bengal. It is not as though her party did not have its presence in the northern parts of the state, but the Congress has always been the principal Opposition party there. But all small, partisan lines of control are obviously being redrawn by the dominant political sentiment in the state. The Left seems to be powerless to come up with any strategy to reverse the trend.

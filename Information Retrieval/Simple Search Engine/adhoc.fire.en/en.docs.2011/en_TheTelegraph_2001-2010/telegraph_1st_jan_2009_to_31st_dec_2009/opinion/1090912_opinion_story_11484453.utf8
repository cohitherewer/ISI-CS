                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Let there be new light                  
	Sir  The European Union has shown great foresight by ordering factories to stop producing incandescent bulbs (EU light bulb ban irks some, Sept 2). India can take a lesson from this move. Power shortage is something Indians have experienced for decades, and yet concrete steps have not been taken to reduce usage. Power consumption can be reduced to a great extent if everybody switches to compact fluorescent lamps. India must ban the production of incandescent bulbs so that consumers are compelled to use CFLs after the current stocks expire.          
	Yours faithfully,

	The party is over          
	Sir  It is heartening to know that the Darul Uloom of Deoband has issued a fatwa against iftars hosted by political parties (Fatwa against political iftar, Sept 8). This will discourage Muslims from attending such events. However, the fatwa should have extended to politicians who attend such events. Iftar  the breaking of the day-long fast  is an integral part of Islamic rituals that are practised in the sacred month of Ramazan. But iftar parties given by politicians are nothing but a show of their wealth and power. Even Muslim businessmen organize iftars with similar intentions.           
	To add the word, party, after iftar is to defile the sanctity of this religious custom. The best example of an individual observing the spirit of iftar was the former president, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam. During his years as the president, Kalam did not host a single iftar for politicians. Instead, like a true Muslim, he hosted iftars for children from orphanages. The Telegraph should also be thanked for publishing the excellent photograph that showed the Union minister, Farooq Abdullah, feeding sweets to the Mumbai Congress chief, Kripa Shankar Singh, and the chief minister of Goa, Digambar Kamat. The image exposes the real intent of politicians hosting iftars. The Darul Ulooms fatwa should be welcomed by all sections of Muslim society. However, given their lust for money and fame, one wonders whether our politicians will honour the Darul Ulooms directive.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
S. Balakrishnan, Jamshedpur

                
	 Sir  Islamic seminaries are notorious for issuing controversial fatwas. But the latest instance of the Darul Uloom forbidding iftars hosted by politicians deserves praise. Ramazan is the holiest month on the Muslim calendar. Unfortunately, the despicable behaviour of political leaders at iftars makes the holy month appear ugly.After gorging on delicacies, politicians join the common people for prayers to prove that they are devout souls. Conscientious people should support the fatwa issued by the Darul Uloom. Politicians have several other means at their disposal to appease the minority community. Why should they then go about debasing a holy practice?            
	Yours faithfully,

	Not for comfort          
	Sir  When the Metro Railway was extended up to Dumdum, some elitist Calcuttans had feared that unruly villagers would start availing themselves of the services. Now, after its extension to Garia, similar noises are being made about the rush on the trains, the paucity of ticket counters and the confusion arising from the stations new names. Such grievances are being aired on television as well as on the pages of newspapers. But the people making such complaints must be reminded that they should not expect the comfort of a Volvo bus inside Metro compartments, especially during peak hours. After all, there is no ignominy in being a commoner.           
	Yours faithfully,

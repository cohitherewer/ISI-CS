                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        CARE TO CARE                                                    
	People who are seriously ill and their carers are some of the most vulnerable in the market. The power that nursing homes, hospitals, clinics and laboratories wield on these hapless people can be absolute. In a poor country like India, the relationship between medical establishments and the people who put themselves at their mercy is often desperately unequal. So, it is reassuring to see the West Bengal government about to table a bill protecting patients and carers from negligence or exploitation in the private health sector. The bill promises a tribunal that would decide on inflated bills and compensation and forbids denial of life-saving treatment under any circumstances, among other things. The tribunal needs to be quick, efficient and free of bureaucracy, for inordinate delays and endless appeals are the chief causes of injustice in the current systems of redress. Doctors practising in their own chambers do not fall within the purview of the bill, which is somewhat alarming. But the effectiveness of such a bill would equally depend on the mindset of the people using these services. In Bengal, ordinary people are either in a sort of helpless awe of doctors and their world, unable to demand proper services when they are denied them, or the worst kind of violence breaks out in retaliation to any alleged injustice. The private health sector needs consumers who are aware of what they are entitled to in terms of the quality of what they are paying for.        
	Yet, the most helpless of Bengals medical consumers use the facilities provided by the government, and it is precisely these establishments, the state-run hospitals, that are exempted from this bill. The fact that the services they provide are free, or almost free, is no excuse for putting them outside the realm of the law. This would give an already hellish and anarchic set-up a better handle to remain a law unto itself, often inhumanly unmindful of its users needs. These hospitals also run on public money, and Swastha Bhavan has no reason to feel above accountability or ethics. The question of standards has to be rigorously brought back into the burgeoning healthcare industry in West Bengal. If the state government is going to be strict with the private sector, then it better get its own act together. Otherwise, it forfeits the right to monitor and to adjudicate, both of which are urgently necessary in this state.

                                                                                                                 PAY ATTENTION                                                    
	Contrary to the way most strikes go in India, this one promises to be both honourable and reasonable. If, and when, the faculty of the Indian Institutes of Technology go on a token, one-day hunger strike tomorrow, classes and other academic duties are not going to be abandoned. So the Union ministry of human resource development should pay serious attention to what some of the countrys finest academics are trying to get across to it. The ultimatum issued by the IITs has two elements, both of which touch upon the fundamentals of the HRD ministrys relationship with these premier institutions. First, the teachers have challenged the ministrys supposedly revised pay regime, which was drawn up after their first round of protests. If the HRD ministry is sincere about interfering as little as possible in the running of the IITs, then letting go of the purse strings would have to be the first important step towards that vision of what the ministry would like to call autonomy. Excellence in higher education is not simply a matter of academic achievement, but is also about the enabling of a certain kind of professionalism. The only way to draw the best minds to the IITs is to let the institutions themselves work out their own ways of dealing with the market. Salaries and perquisites should not be confined to the governments regulatory tendencies, and the Centre must think through the entire question of financial autonomy without giving in to its usual anxieties.        
	Second, the IITs want to remove the shadow of a new regulation regarding appointments from above their heads. To disallow the appointment of professors who have not taught for a certain period of time at institutions specified by the government is to allow essentially bureaucratic systems of control to come in the way of merit. A stipulation like this can only foster an ethos of inflexible red tape. To be tied to such externally and mechanically imposed regulations is precisely the sort of thing that hinders the free flow of excellence in an open world. Properly considered appointments should not be held to such mindless specifications, and each institution should be able to decide with each candidate the question of suitability. The fate of quality higher education in India depends on freedom from restrictions and not on more rules drawn up by politicians and bureaucrats.

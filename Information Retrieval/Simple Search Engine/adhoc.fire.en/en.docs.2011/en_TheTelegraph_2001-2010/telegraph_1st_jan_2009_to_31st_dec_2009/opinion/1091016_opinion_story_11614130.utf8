	WHY I AM A BELIEVER:   PERSONAL REFLECTIONS ON NINE WORLD RELIGIONS Edited by Arvind Sharma, Penguin, Rs 450
    
	Even in this age when technology has become a part of every mans life, religion commands the highest attention in communities across the world. Be it in the United States of America, Europe or in communist China, men have sought refuge in religion to seek peace, divinity, and to satisfy their thirst for knowledge. Students of comparative religion know the importance of different religions as assets that promote unity among mankind. It is only the narrow-minded individuals who propagate hatred between religious communities. Why I am a Believer attempts to dispel the parochial mindset of men who look down upon other mens beliefs. The book takes into consideration nine religions of the world, examines them from personal standpoints, and offers to the readers everything that they wanted to know about these faiths.   
	The editor, Arvind Sharma, has selected scholars from all nine religions, and made them explain why they follow their own religion. On the one hand, such an approach may result in the creation of skewed ideas about the religions of the contributors. On the other hand, it enables the readers to come face to face with the basic tenets of the different religions and helps them form their own opinions.         
	Sharma has dealt with all the major faiths of the world: Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism, Islam, Judaism, Christianity, Confucianism and Daoism. Sharmas introduction gives a holistic view of the methods of the writers who vary in their style and in the treatment of the subject. Arvind Sharma, Karma Lekshe Tsomo, Sandhya Jain, Kartar Singh Duggal, Vincent Shen, Bede Bidlack, Jacob Neusner, Harvey Cox and Amir Hussain are the nine writers who explicitly state what makes them stick to their own religion. It is not only the diversity of faiths but also the differences in their approach that catch the eye. Hussain advocates a dialogue between Islam and Christianity to resolve disputes, while Cox and Neusner think that Jesus and Torah are all that matters. For Duggal, the Sikh Gurus are supreme, while Sharma is irresistibly drawn to Hinduism. Tsomo, who was born a Christian, embraced Buddhism, while Bidlacks practise of Daoism brought him closer to Christ. Shen, too, understood Confucianism better because of his Christian background. Some of the writers narrate their experiences in a secular manner, making the book a pleasure to read.        
	The treatment of the subject by the scholars differs. If the essay on Judaism is analytical, the writing on the Confucian tradition is simple and explanatory. The first thing that attracts the reader to the book is the subjective approach. The second is the diverse angle from which each author tries to portray his or her own religion. Even if we were to think that we know everything about a particular religion, these essays will make us see something new about it. Most of the writers have also desisted from passing comments on each other.         
	All the contributors have one objective in mind: to make the readers think about religious ideals that they would not have bothered to know otherwise. Thus, the book helps us to understand what it means to be a Hindu, Muslim, Christian, Sikh, Jew and so on. This is a wonderful collection of scholarly pieces by writers who have delved deep into the complexities of their faiths so that non-believers as well as people from other religions can understand them. The book may also help people of different faiths to come close to each other.

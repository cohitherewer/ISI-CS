	Heavy price                  
	Sir  The two-stroke, heavily polluting autorickshaws of Calcutta are a hot topic of discussion today. The people are aware of the high court order, and are conscious of the after-effects of the fumes the autos let off. But if autos are banished, how will residents in my locality daily commute to Behala or the New Alipore crossing? Should they cough up more money and travel in rickshaws instead? As citizens, it is our duty to abide by the law. But at what price  our life or money?                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Krishna Das, Calcutta 

      
	Love hurts          
	Sir  The suicide attempt by Fiza, or Anuradha Bali, after her husband, Chand Mohammad, left her for his first wife should be an eye-opener for many, particularly the youth, who seek instant love (Enter death threats in marriage triangle, Feb 3). Needless to say, it is because of this love on the fast track that divorce cases are multiplying in India. Chand and Fiza have created a record of sorts by their reckless change of religion for the sake of love. The unhappiness in their ties is now for all to see. Marriage is a sacred contract for life between two consenting adults. It is based on mutual trust and respect, not lust, as it appears to have been in the case of Chand and Fiza.          
	Yours faithfully,       
S. Balakrishnan, Jamshedpur 

                
	Sir  We have had enough of Fiza and Chand Mohammad. Why are they being given so much publicity? They have made a mockery of religion, tradition and Indian culture. Muslim clerics cannot escape blame here for allowing them to convert in haste. But then, Fiza and Chand are not the only ones to have taken advantage of the clergy. Filmstars Dharmendra and Hema Malini too are alleged to have converted to Islam in order to get married.           
	Yours faithfully,       
N.S. Dua, Calcutta 

      
	Sir  The peccadillos of Chand Mohammad should not have been held against him, and deemed sufficient cause for accepting his resignation. After all, there is hardly any Central or state minister who has a clean slate. Some have corruption charges against them, while others have charges of murder, abduction or other crimes. If they can hold on to their positions despite their moral turpitude, why should the man not be given back his position, especially now that he has gone back to his father and his wife?                     
	Yours faithfully,       
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Had he not been rendered penniless and powerless by his father, Bhajan Lal, Chand Mohammads second marriage might have survived. Indians are a forgiving lot. They have forgiven Raj Babbar-Smita and Dharmendra-Hema Malini for escaping the law through religious conversion. Perhaps Chand should have waited a little longer for his fathers temper to cool down.           
	Yours faithfully,       
J. Mahanta, Calcutta 

                          
	Care more           
	Sir  A visit to any clinic for psychiatric care will convince everyone of the poor state of mental healthcare in Bengal. I was recently at one such clinic in north Calcutta, and the experience was horrible, to say the least.           
	I saw patients waiting endlessly for their turns, pleading with the receptionist to consider their case, while the doctor was nowhere in sight. This was, by the way, no run-of-the-mill clinic, but one of the poshest institutes to have come up recently. It is unfortunate that doctors, who rake up all the moolah, spare no thought either for the patients or the family members who suffer the long waits and the incessant trips to these care centres.           
	Yours faithfully,

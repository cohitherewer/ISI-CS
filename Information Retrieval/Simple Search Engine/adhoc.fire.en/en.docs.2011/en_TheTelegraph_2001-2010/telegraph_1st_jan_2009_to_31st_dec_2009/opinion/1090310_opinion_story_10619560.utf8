                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Over the top                  
	Sir  The world is going through an economic crisis. Since there is no tailor-made solution to the current problem, we must wake up to the reality and search for a solution. But what happens when we wake up to find that the people whom we had entrusted with the responsibility of leading us out of this catastrophe are corrupt and double-faced? It is unfortunate that most of our political leaders are untrustworthy. Both the government and the media have lost their focus, thus adding to our misery.          
	The stand-in finance minister, Pranab Mukherjee, discussed certain economic policies at a labour conference in Delhi. I could perfectly understand what he was getting at when he delivered the speech, and I appreciated his objectives. Mukherjee had asked the people to get ready for pay cuts since these are more bearable than loss of jobs (Pay cut advice to protect jobs, Feb 21). The workers of Hindustan Motors responded immediately and joined executives in accepting a pay cut.           
	Thus I felt shocked when the government declared a 6 per cent increase in the dearness allowance of government employees only a few days after Mukherjee gave the moving lecture on the present crisis (Inflation falls, DA rises, Feb 27). An increase in the salary of government employees at a time when the country is trying hard to cope with the effects of inflation can only mean one thing  the governments policy for the coming general elections is to look after its servants well so as to ensure their votes.          
	At a time of increasing inflation, from where will the government get the extra money to pay its workers? Obviously, it will augment its income by taxing the public more. A large percentage of the population works in the private and unorganized sector. These sectors will be hit the hardest if taxes are increased. The government often justifies DA hikes by saying that the extra money given to its employees ultimately boosts the market by getting circulated in it. But has anyone ever heard of a domestic help in the household of a government employee getting a pay hike when the salary or the DA of his master is increased? I myself have never heard of such a case, although I have seen government servants strongly resisting any proposal for a raise in the salaries of those working under them.           
	The government puts forward pay commission reports like a messiah out to deliver its workers from their woes. Favourable pay commission reports are supposed to prove how much the government cares for its employees. But there is always a hidden story behind the governments munificence. The price index is re-adjusted with every pay commission and this benefits the government in the long run.          
	Foodgrains like rice, lentils, and oil are some of the essential commodities we need in order to survive. In 2002-2003, rice cost around Rs 7-12 per kilogram. Now, rice of the same quantity would cost around Rs 15-22. This is the effect of inflation. The government raises DA at regular intervals to help its own working groups. But once the prices of essential goods are hiked, they are never brought down. Does the government ever think of the people working in the unorganized and private sectors who do not get the benefit of regular increments and have to cope with steep rises in price? Does the government want to reduce their diets to the bare minimum?           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  It is a matter of great concern that in order to woo voters, the Central government has announced a 6 per cent hike in the DA of its employees. The move will cost the government Rs 6,020 crore till March 2010. It seems that the government is blissfully unaware of the fact that millions of people in India are undernourished. According to the Global Index Hunger released by the International Food Policy Research Institute in October 2008, India ranks 66th among 88 countries in the index.           
	One hopes that at least the next government will pay more attention to this ground reality. It should fix the salaries of the bureaucrats who are underworked and overpaid, and introduce voluntary retirement schemes for them. This would help eliminate the unnecessary flab that has destroyed the health of the present system of governance.          
	Yours faithfully,       
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  It is regrettable that at a time when people throughout the world are threatened with pink slips and wage cuts because of the recession, the state government has hiked the salaries of its employees by a whopping 32 per cent (State govt announces 32 per cent pay hike, Feb 26). The common man will have no choice but to shell out higher taxes so that the fortunate few employed by the state government can lead a luxurious life. This is a perfect instance of the State tyrannizing the public. Little wonder then that everyone in India wants a government job, which seems the easiest way to live at someone elses expense.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Abhijit Guha, Toronto, Canada 

                
	Sir  The governments announcement of a reduction in service tax and excise duties, although well-intentioned, may not have the desired effect (Tax nipped in new stimulus shot, Feb 25). This is because one has to take into account the unscrupulous manufacturers who tend to raise the price of their products as soon as any increase in duties becomes operational. But they rarely display the same alacrity when it comes to passing on the benefits of any reduction in service tax or excise duties to the consumers.          
	Yours faithfully,

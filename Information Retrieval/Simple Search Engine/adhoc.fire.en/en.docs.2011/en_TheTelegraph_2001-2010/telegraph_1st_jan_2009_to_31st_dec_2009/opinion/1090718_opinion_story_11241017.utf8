	I was not sure how to react to the exhibition of paintings by Mizo artists held at Gaganendra Pradarsasala (From the Palette of Mizoram, July 9-12). Most of the paintings had the simplicity of drawings by children trying out mountainscapes in watercolours for the first time. As such, the paintings cannot but be described as immature. But then, their value perhaps lay more in what they said about the life and culture of Mizoram, a state that mainstream India cares to know little about, than in their aesthetic appeal. To look closely was to discover that what seemed like wooden huts nestled among hills in some of the paintings were actually desolate shacks perched on eroded mountain slopes. The typical Mizo village in V. Lalzawmkima (Zawma)s painting of that name appeared as if it had been hit by an earthquake, and the artist seemed to have been faithful to nature.        
	A few of the paintings managed to depict something other than brooks and forests. Issac Malsawmtluangas Breathe appeared to be a meditation on the medieval theme of memento mori in its juxtaposition of a crouching body bearing the head of a screaming skull with a voluptuous torso. Bishop Stephen Rotluangas life-sized canvases literally stood out in the exhibition. The taut muscular bodies and the scowling faces of the two naked men (one of them in a tweed cap) in Figure II reminded one of the working class heroes of the Angry Young Man films of the Sixties.

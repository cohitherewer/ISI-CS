	There it was: Any Premiership footballer has their own agent. Really? Not his? Do any women play in Britains top football league? Must we write Every mother loves their baby? In the past Ive lamented the follies born of the attempt, not foolish in itself, to make English gender-neutral. Yet how little gender it includes anyway.        
	We have he/him and his, she/her and her, it and its. A few nouns denote specifically female people or animals; but ever fewer, as words like authoress and poetess die off. Actress may follow, though few actresses could (or would) claim acting skill as their own charm. Princess and queen will surely survive, even if monarchies do not. So too lioness, vixen and the like.        
	We also have some issues of usage. A few people still call countries she, and more do so for ships. Its disputable up to what age one may use it for small children (never to their mothers, for sure, though new fathers can expect to be asked Is it a boy or a girl?). But think what English doesnt have, and other languages do  most Indian ones included.        
	Ancient Greek and Latin, two big sources of English, used to put every noun in one of three genders: masculine, feminine or neuter. Modern Greek still has three. So does German, the other big source, through the Anglo-Saxons. So too Sanskrit, close kin to still older influences (and among its Indian kin today, Kannada and Tamil, Gujarati and Marathi, for example, have three genders, Hindi, Punjabi and Urdu two. Bengali is an oddity, making no gender distinctions among nouns at all).        
	Latins direct descendants  Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Romanian and their lesser cousins  have two genders, after absorbing most of its neuter nouns into masculine. The Latin gender often survives. But the effect can be odd. Most Latin nouns ending in -us were masculine. So too their descendants, which in Italian and Spanish typically end in the masculine -o. But Latins manus, a hand, was feminine; so both languages have la mano. Italian muro, born of the Latin murus, a wall, has both a masculine and a feminine plural.        
	These linguistic genders have little to do with the real world. For a start, most nouns denote things that are sexless: stone or sorrow, for instance. Logically, they should be neuter. Yet few are. Again, the results can be odd. In Latin, the sea  mare  was neuter. To Italians, it is now masculine, il mare. The French have feminized it into la mer. In Spanish it can be either. And in German, whose See could have been neuter, it is, in fact, masculine.        
	With living things, you might think their sex decisive. Not so. Most plants anyway are bisexual. What gender should their names have? Nearly all animals are indeed either male or female. But their names dont always follow suit: in Tamil, both bull and cow are neuter (if one allows neuter for the Tamil grammarians irrational). Often one noun serves for both sexes: farmers talk of boars and sows, but to most of us any pig is just a pig.        
	As for the human animal, man and woman are indeed habitually masculine and feminine. It was they that led grammarians to apply the notion to language at all. But even here confusion can arise. Latins nauta and agricola, sailor and farmer, in typically male jobs, were both masculine, yet had typically feminine -a endings.         
	German is odder still. Sure, it has der Mann and die Frau, masculine and feminine. But make the frau a little woman with the German suffix -lein, and she is suddenly desexed into das Frulein, a neuter. Ditto for das Mdchen, a girl. In Konkani too, the word for a young woman is neuter. I doubt German or Goan feminists can end this linguistic slander.        
	English escapes nearly all this nonsense. Just as well. It has crazy spelling, many irregular plurals, countless irregular verbs, and several competing varieties, spread across the globe. Imagine gendermonium on top.

	Wage war        
	 When an establishment failed to repay a bank loan, the bank seized its mortgaged property and tried to auction it. But there were no buyers so the bank decided to close it. The workers union went to the Labour Court, contending that as per the Industrial Disputes Act, once an establishment was closed, with the prior permission of the government, the workers were entitled to compensation. It therefore demanded that the workers dues be deposited with the Labour Court. The bank submitted that it could not be made a party in this case. When the Labour Court rejected the banks application, the bank appealed before the Gujarat High Court. The high court held that the bank, which would have custody of the sale proceeds, must meet the workers dues along with its own dues.

	In person        
	 In a case of divorce by mutual consent, an additional district judge in Delhi directed both parties to appear in person. The husband, living in the UK, had signed a power of attorney in favour of another person for appearing in court on his behalf. But the judge insisted upon the presence of the husband. The latter approached the Delhi High Court. The court held that if a power of attorney holder was aware of the facts, he should be allowed to depose. In this case certain facts like the date of marriage, tenure of separation and so on, were known to the power of attorney holder. And so he was competent to appear on behalf of the husband.

	Whose house?        
	 A man and his wife began to live separately from the mans parents following a dispute. However, the wife forcibly tried to enter her in-laws house on the ground that her current place of residence was unsuitable. The in-laws took an injunction to stop the daughter-in-law from forcibly entering their house. The latter approached the Delhi High Court, contending that her right to reside in a shared household under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act could not be curtailed. The Delhi High Court held that shared household would mean either a joint family house or the house shared with the husband. A woman could assert her rights to her husbands property but could not thrust herself on her in-laws. (Neetu Mittal vs Kanta Mittal and Others)

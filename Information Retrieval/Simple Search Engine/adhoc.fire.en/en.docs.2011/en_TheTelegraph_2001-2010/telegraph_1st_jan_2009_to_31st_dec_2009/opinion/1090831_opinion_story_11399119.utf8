                                                                                                                 TRAGIC TWISTS AND TURNS                                  FIFTH COLUMN - GWYNNE DYER                               
	Abdel Basset al-Megrahi was an intelligence agent. Since he worked for the Libyan government, he probably did some bad things. But he probably did not do the specific bad thing for which he was sentenced to 27 years in prison in Scotland. He only served eight years. Recently, he was released on compassionate grounds, and flew home to Libya. He is dying of cancer, but his release outraged the Americans whose relatives died aboard Pan Am Flight 103 in December 1988. They believe that al-Megrahi is a mass murderer who should die in jail.        
	Back in 1 988-89, Western intelligence services saw the bombing of Pan Am 103 as an act of revenge. The US warship, Vincennes, had shot down an Iranian Airbus five months before, killing all 290 passengers, and the Iranians were getting even. There was some evidence for this Iranian revenge theory. In 1989, German police found the same kind of bomb that brought down Pan Am 103 in a house in Frankfurt used by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command. The PFLP-GC was based in Syria, and Syria and Iran were allies, so maybe....        
	But then, in 1990, Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait. The US needed Arab countries like Syria to join the war against Saddam so that the liberation of Kuwait looked like a truly international effort. Syrias price for sending troops was its removal from Americas most-wanted list. Suddenly, Syria was no longer the prime suspect in the Pan Am case  and if Syria was out, so was Iran.        
	Soon new evidence began to appear. It pointed to al-Megrahi, who had been working as a security officer for the Libyan Arab Airlines in Malta in 1988. A Maltese shopkeeper identified him as the man who had bought childrens clothing like the ones found in the suitcase that contained the bomb that brought down Pan Am 103. It was pretty flimsy evidence, but Muammar Gaddafi, Libyas ruler, was desperate to end the Western trade embargo against his country. He never admitted blame in the Pan Am affair, but handed al-Megrahi and his colleague over for trial in a Western court.                
	Miserable story        
	Al-Megrahis trial took place in 2001. His colleague was freed, but he was jailed for 27 years (in Scotland, because Pan Am 103 came down in Lockerbie). As time passed, however, the case began to unravel. The Maltese shopkeeper who had identified al-Megrahi turned out to be living in Australia, supported by several million dollars that the Americans had paid him for his evidence.        
	The allegation that the timer for the bomb had been supplied to Libya by the Swiss manufacturer, Mebo, turned out to be false. And this year it was revealed that Pan Ams baggage area at Heathrow airport was broken into 17 hours before Pan Am 103 took off on its last flight. (The police knew that 12 years ago, but kept it secret at al-Megrahis trial.) The theory that the fatal bag was put on a feeder flight from Malta became even less likely.        
	All of which explains why the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission announced in 2007 that it would refer al-Megrahis case to the Court of Criminal Appeal in Edinburgh because he may have suffered a miscarriage of justice.        
	The review commissions decision caused a crisis, because a new court hearing would reveal how shoddy the evidence at the first one was. Happily for London and Washington, al-Megrahi was now dying of cancer, so a deal was possible. He would give up his plea for a retrial, no dirty linen about the original trial would be aired in public, and he would be set free.        
	A miserable story, but hardly a unique one. A man, probably innocent of the charges against him, a loyal servant of the Libyan State framed by the West and hung out to dry by his own government, has been sent home to die.

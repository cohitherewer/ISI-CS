	With China damming the Brahmaputra and holding India to ransom, it is time the Indian government got proactive with other governments, including that of the United States of America, to ensure that this kind of rough-and-tough, old- fashioned way of bullying and threatening another sovereign nation is stopped. If China is sitting at the high table of the committee of world nations, it must be compelled to address international issues in a dignified and democratic fashion.         
	Strong-arm tactic and denials emanating from the Chinese government are completely unwarranted. Technological and scientific mappings of the world show the many intrusions and expose the many lies. Therefore, political and military tactics, too, must change with the times.        
	India and China should ideally work in tandem to secure and protect the region. Instead, there exists a deep lack of trust between the two. To exploit a population economically and politically because it is still not as empowered as those in other parts of the world is clearly unacceptable. Politically irresponsible dictatorships will not be able to restore the lost human values and ethics that inform mankind. This simplistic and aggressive attitude in a complex world where people are asserting their identity, and demanding dignity and justice can only aggravate an already volatile reality.        
	Because of its communist legacy, China still seems to carry the baggage of that political truth, is unable to abandon dictatorial positions, and is unwilling to come to the discussion table to find solutions. Grabbing territory is old hat, and it is time China undertakes a fresh approach towards its neighbours. Human beings cannot be suppressed beyond a point. The Americans were defeated by the Vietnamese who had no military might compared to their enemy, but the people routed that superpower and debilitated the US foreign policy.                 
	Empty seat        
	Gandhiji led Indians using the weapon of civil disobedience to vanquish a dominant colonial power. Hitler brutalized a people, Stalin and Mao Zedong repressed their own countrymen. This millennium must bring with it composite dialogue, appreciation and acceptance of differing views and ideologies. Nations and governments must try to reach a consensus and agree to disagree if there is a logjam, give in and adjust in an effort to maintain peace and enhance civil society. There is no other way to deliver the goods and services to all the people of the world at all levels of society.        
	China and India need to take the lead and set the example of dialogue and consensus, much like Jawaharlal Nehrus attempt at Panchsheel.Those notions of collective responsibility are now more valid than they were at the time they were enunciated. What is lacking today is solid leadership. Nasser, Tito, Nehru were intellectual comrades. Today, when one looks for similar relationships in the top echelons of international leadership, one is hardpressed to find such collective thinking. That is the primary problem. No one is pulling in the same direction with the same set of rules and similar goals of governance. People are united in the belief that their patience and goodwill are being exploited by all leaders everywhere. Someone from among them has to step out of the restrictive lakshman rekha and lead a collegium to change the trajectory collectively, retaining the many special identities that make the earth a diverse place.        
	India could take the lead and win over the countries of the East as its allies. China and India could come together to check other superpowers and their clumsy assertions. South Asia and Europe could lead the change and thrash out new mechanisms for equitable growth. The seat is empty and someone has to take up the challenge.

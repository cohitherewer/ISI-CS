The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Bordering on distress
                                                                                                                 BORDERING ON DISTRESS                                                                  
	If Kasab and his comrades hadnt attacked Bombay, Pakistan would have escaped the trauma brought on by Indias vicious response. President Zardari wouldnt have had to suffer the tedium of having to labour the obvious: that terror knows no nationality, terrorists are non-state actors, Pakistan is a State, therefore terrorists cant be Pakistani. The world would have been spared the vapourings of literal-minded Western newspapers, which established to their own stupid satisfaction that Kasab and his friends lived and trained in Pakistan. Their investigations merely proved the existence of dangerous non-state actors described in the census as resident non-Pakistanis (RNPs). Finally, the Indian cricket team would have toured Pakistan, played gripping Test matches in empty stadiums, and won the hearts of the millions of Pakistanis not watching them play. They would have had the pleasure of being hosted by the director general of Pakistani cricket (the protocol equal of the director general of the ISI), Javed Miandad, otherwise famous for having married his son to the daughter of that celebrated non-resident Indian, Dawood Ibrahim, who the Indian State insists lives in Karachi, but who, as every reasonable man knows, is a non-resident non-Pakistani (NRNP). To sum up, if India hadnt brought these terror attacks upon itself, Pakistan wouldnt have suffered.

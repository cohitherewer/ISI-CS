                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Smooth ride                  
	Sir  The railways minister, Lalu Prasad, should be credited for presenting yet another successful railway budget, and for improving the revenue count of the Indian Railways, which has now become self-reliant financially (Cheap-ticket ride to elections, Feb 14). Lalu Prasad has claimed that he has turned the Indian Railways from a white elephant to a leopard. Unfortunately, some of the rail projects lack the desired swiftness. For instance, the Calcutta-Murshidabad-Hazarduari Express, announced in last years railway budget, took almost a year to stage its first commerical run. Moreover, this tourist-special should be running daily, as there are fewer trains compared to the number of passengers in the much-deprived Krishnagar-Lalgola section under the Sealdah division. The construction of the railway bridge over Bhagirathi at Nasipur in Murshidabad is going on at a snails pace too. Bringing down passenger fares is of no use at a time when commuters woes are being compounded by an unpunctual railway system.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Lalu Prasads tenure as the Union railways minister has brought in significant technical and commercial changes to the railways. There has been tangible improvement on both fronts. The minister has helped his home state, Bihar, not only by introducing new trains, but also by announcing the creation of two manufacturing units for electric and diesel locomotives in the state. This move would certainly generate employment for technically qualified youth in Bihar. This is justified, and expected of an elected representative who occupies a senior position at the Centre.           
	Compare this with what happened when Mamata Banerjee became the railways minister during the National Democratic Alliance regime. Hers was the most disgraceful performance by a Union railways minister in the recent past. Nitish Kumar did a much better job and also did something for West Bengal. Now, Banerjee has driven the last nail in the hopes of a prosperous future for Bengals youth by driving out the Tatas to Gujarat. There is no doubt that she has spelt doom for the future of business and industry in Bengal.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Lalu Prasad reduced tariffs in the interim railway budget, not expecting that the sops that were announced would boomerang on him when the Coromandel Express derailed near the Jajpur-Keonjhar road station, killing some passengers and injuring many others. As the editorial, On a siding (Feb 16), suggested, the mishap clearly proved that adequate attention has not been paid either to the maintenance or the investment of new tracks, raising questions about safety. Perhaps in his eagerness to cut fares and introduce new trains, Lalu Prasad had neglected the aspect of passenger safety. As a senior citizen and regular rail passenger, I would like to know when train-travel will be made safe.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  This years rail budget is definitely an election budget; one that takes care of the peoples demands. More important than the concessions announced is the assurance that no one will be allowed to travel in reserved compartments without a valid ticket. But this is not enough. Passengers travelling on the roof of compartments must be penalized too.           
	A few other suggestions can be looked into as well. A Rajdhani or Shatabdi or even a Garib Rath  can be introduced from Delhi to Rajkot to boost tourism. The cleanliness drive launched by the railways still has a long way to go. Train toilets must be cleaned at every stop. Double tracks must be introduced across the country so that trains can travel faster. The number of airconditioned coaches needs to be increased. Rail Yatri Niwas should be able to accommodate a greater number of transit passengers. Finally, the number of luggages that can be carried by a person in reserved compartments needs to be specified. It would also be beneficial for passengers as well as for the public in general if the late arrival and departures of trains are announced on television channels, especially on news networks or Doordarshan. The railways will also be better off introducing its own taxi-service to ferry passengers in important destinations.           
	The railway budget can be called a success only if Lalu Prasad ensures that his words are followed by effective action. If railway officers remain their usual inactive selves while carrying out their duties, Lalu Prasads budget will fall flat on its face.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Old issue           
	Sir  The editorial, Knock on the right door (Feb 22), examines the critical issue of domestic and filial negligence that torments the lives of senior citizens. The state government has been indifferent to their plight for long, even though it is the moral responsibility of a concerned government to address this particular problem faced by the elderly. The responsibility of protecting senior citizens is vested on the department of social welfare. But the reality is far different, as is evident from the attitude of those who rule from the Writers Buildings.           
	Of late, we have seen that a number of elderly people, fed up with government indifference, have moved court to secure their rights. Unfortunately, only those lucky enough to pay a hefty fee to the advocate can take recourse to law. The recent trend of filing public interest litigations is on the rise, and this goes to show that the present government has been reluctant to redress the grievances of senior citizens, forcing them to approach the judiciary. At the same time, even though the government has now reportedly instructed the police to conduct house-to-house searches to solve this problem, it is difficult to believe that it is serious in its intent and will train the police to protect the elderly.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  I was delighted to read Rudrangshu Mukherjees article on Victor Kiernan (Illusion of an epoch, Feb 22) . He was a dear friend of my mother s brother, P.C.B. (Kanu) Mallik. He was 10 years older than me but spent time patiently explaining to me the implications of the civil war in Spain. I hope that this letter, as well as the article, will bring forth similar memories of an eclectic man committed to India from other readers of that generation.           
	Yours faithfully,

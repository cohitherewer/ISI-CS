The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Rules of engagement 
                                                                                                                 RULES OF ENGAGEMENT                                                           
	Chess and card games hold valuable clues to statecraft, especially in battles of attrition. The deal between the Bengal government and the Maoists over the release of the abducted police officer, Atindranath Dutta, would remind contract bridge enthusiasts of the trick called loser on loser. In simple terms, it is about discarding a losing card  the one that is to be given up anyway  on an opponents winner. The tribal activists, most of them women, who had to be released on bail by the government in exchange for Mr Duttas release, would probably have secured bail in any case. By conceding the Maoists demand for their release, the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government looked like playing the losing card and yet not losing the game. There is no denying that it lost some of its authority in the process. But, given the circumstances, the governments handling of the case appears to have been realistic and successful.         
	The Mossad of Israel and similar agencies in the world constantly engaged in fighting terrorists and other rebels would have approved of the effectiveness of the deal. While the world remembers the Mossads daring rescue of the hijacked passengers of an Air France flight at Entebbe airport in 1976, the top intelligence agencys deals with Palestinian groups to secure the release of hostages are less known. What is now known, though, is that the Mossad was consulted by the Indian government during the negotiations with the hijackers of the Indian Airlines flight, IC-814, at Kandahar airport in December 1999. New Delhi had to release from jail three top Pakistani militants, including Maulana Masood Azhar, the founder of Jaish-e-Mohammed, in order to get the passengers and crew of the flight released from the hijackers custody. Similar incidents in different parts of the world have one thing in common  they highlight the modern States dilemma in fighting unconventional battles with new kinds of adversaries. The problem gets far more complicated for a democratically elected government, which cannot afford to be seen as using force to the exclusion of all other options in such situations.        
	In fact, the first ever engagement between the Bengal government and the Maoists over Mr Duttas release should be an opportunity to probe other such options. There is much about the deal that is still unclear. Why, for instance, did the Maoists agree to any kind of a deal at all? Did some disagreements in their ranks over the use of tribal women in their movement act as a compulsion? It is nave to think of a sudden change of heart for the rebels who had shocked the country earlier this month by brutally killing another police officer in Jharkhand. Whatever the rebels reasons, the governments, both in New Delhi and Calcutta, have to seize the moment. For the Bengal government, fighting the Maoists has to go hand in hand with giving the tribal people the social and economic justice they have been denied for so long.

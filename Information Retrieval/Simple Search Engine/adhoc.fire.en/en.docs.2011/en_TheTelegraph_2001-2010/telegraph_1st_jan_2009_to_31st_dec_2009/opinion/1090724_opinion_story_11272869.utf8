	Self-publishing has pejorative connotations and for good reasons. If you check out the print ads in top-end American and British literary journals, you will come across tall claims, and many bear the names of vanity publishers. These publishers handle production and distribution for a fee, but they all take advantage of authors with unrealistic hopes for their poorly conceived and poorly written books. With desktop publishing, many authors are typesetting their books and selling the CDs to facilitate their printed editions. Is it worth the effort for the author, the publisher and finally the reader, for whom the book is being published?.        
	 For the author, who has been rejected by standard publishers, (which is the only reason why he is doing it on his own) it is nothing more than an ego trip to prove that he has been unfairly treated. Of course, there are exceptions where self-publication has been the first step toward literary recognition, (Walt Whitmans Leaves of Grass, James Joyces Ulysses, and Redfields The Celestine Prophecy spring to mind) but these are very rare cases that took place because publishers were unable to gauge the potential of these works. As authors have mistaken notions about the scope and originality of their works, they lose out in three ways because of their desperation to see themselves in print.         
	 First, they have to pay for production and marketing costs as determined by the publishers. Which means that the publisher slaps on at least 20 percent handling charges on an itemized breakdown of production and distribution costs. Therefore, the costs would increase from say Rs 20,000 to Rs 24,000. For an author who wants to see himself in print, money may not be an important factor, but what he is really interested in is the proper distribution and publicity of his book.         
	 And herein lies the rub. The publisher is not a stakeholder in the project, and therefore lets distribution and publicity take their own courses: an initial spurt of advertisement and circulation of publicity leaflets, and then it is left to the trade. There is no follow-up of field visits, without which there is no regular flow of orders. It might sound cynical, but the publishers interest is over soon after he has recovered the production and distribution costs.        
	 Many Indian authors have discovered that the hardest part of the publishing game is not production but sustained publicity and distribution; it cannot be done on ones own. More importantly, it is not just the merits of the work that matters; distribution involves a number of factors like trade discounts, credits and personal contacts with booksellers and librarians. This goes for all authors  it is the hard slog and experience of the market and its vagaries that bring in the results.         
	 The publisher who goes in for vanity publishing has nothing to lose: there is money to be made, usually payable in advance, with no risks involved. If it works, well and good; if it doesnt, the stock is returned and no questions are asked. And the reader has nothing much to fear too. He ends up getting a complimentary copy of the book from the author. The only sucker in this game is the author, who is taken for a ride because he hasnt been able to come to terms with his own limitations.

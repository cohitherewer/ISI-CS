The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Let the skies open
                                                                                                                 LET THE SKIES OPEN                                  Malvika Singh                              
	Early morning sounds of the koels plaintive plea to the rain god seems to have been ignored but the bird continues to sing without faltering, hoping against hope. Delhi is bathed in humidity  something it is not used to and therefore, unable to deal with. Water shortage, powercuts, seething irritation with this unpleasant reality are forcing people either to become belligerent or to stay at home and hope that the skies would open and the city saved from this torture. Sixty years and more since Independence and the infrastructure of the capital, even of the most privileged core areas, lacks the basics  uninterrupted water and electricity. The steady erosion of what had been put in place in the Twenties and Thirties by the British when they built New Delhi has led to this breakdown of urban infrastructure, which is a given anywhere else in the world. There is a complete disregard for maintenance and regular upgradation everywhere except in the homes and establishments of those very people who failed to deliver the simple necessities of life.         
	The business of taking illegitimate cuts for anything and everything that should be the right of the citizen has corroded our public space. It has filtered into our private sphere and corrupted the people mandated to deliver the goods. To know that every job required to be done  from building roads and the Metro to minor things like fixing the plumbing and a tripped electric meter  has to be accompanied by a bakshish is maddening, frustrating and embarrassing. For a nation that claims to be the future leader of the world, this truth is shameful.                
	Future plans        
	Added to this is the strange politics that has overwhelmed India. Anarchist, regional satraps polluting the landscape with inappropriate, high handed diktats compelling the bureaucracy and the law enforcement departments to act outside the law; national Opposition leaders using any excuse to walkout of the Parliament because they are incapable of intelligent debate on important national issues; the constant banal wrangling amongst parties  this reality is there for all to see. All this has made a mockery of India as a politically mature, responsible State.         
	The Opposition  rapacious, always ready to grab power instead of winning it, aided and abetted by the electronic media trying to sensationalize a non-story, and supported by a section of the intelligentsia  only helps to reinforce the public support for the present government at the Centre. The fact that a bungalow only a few furlongs away from a chief ministers residence can be set on fire is proof of the complete failure of governance, law and order. It is scary to imagine what the situation must be in less privileged localities. Equally, for a seasoned leader to speak the unspeakable, however angry and emotional she may have been, is unacceptable in a civilized democracy. But Rita Bahuguna had the grace to accept that she should not have said what she did, and apologized without any caveats.        
	If this is not bad enough, the complacent, colluding bureaucracy also seems to be getting away with illegal actions. It is interesting to watch how some of the proactive ministers of the Central cabinet, who had actively begun to unravel the legacy they had inherited, managed to stun the bureaucrats for the first few weeks. However, now in some of the ministries, the babus have tried to regroup, worked out plans to misguide their minister and cut him off from the professionals without vested interests. The babus who stand to be exposed are furiously politicking to save their skin. If the new political masters do not succumb to the old bureaucratic tricks, and enforce fresh and new agendas, there will be a glimmer of hope on the horizon and India will have a dynamic future.

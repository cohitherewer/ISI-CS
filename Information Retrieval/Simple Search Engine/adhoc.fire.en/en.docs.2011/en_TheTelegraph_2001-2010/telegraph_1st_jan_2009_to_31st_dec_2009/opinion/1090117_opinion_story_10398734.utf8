                                                                                                                 OVERFLOW OF POWERFUL FEELINGS                              This above all      Khushwant Singh                        Speak out				                                       
	Ghalib was well aware of what people said about him behind his back: Banaa hai Shah a Musaahib, phirey hai itraata        
	Varna shahr mein Ghalib kee aabroo        
	kya hai?                
	Since he became a companion of the        
	 king         
	He struts about (like a peacock)        
	Otherwise he is like everyone        
	And his worth is nothing.                
	During his lifetime he had many critics. They criticized him for being obscure and composing couplets which no one could comprehend. Normally his ghazals follow, as all ghazals should, a rigid pattern of rhyme and meter but no single theme. However, at times he also composed ghazals in which one couplet did have a bearing on the one that followed. I cite one instance where the second is an elucidation of the first:                
	Mehkashaan! Khumey meh munh        
	 say lagaaye hee baney        
	Ek din gar na hua bazm mein saki,        
	na sahee                
	Drinkers, it is only when your lips        
	touch the goblet of wine,        
	You know what is in it.        
	If there is no wine-server one day        
	What does it matter        
	So be it.                
	And then follows a couplet aimed at his critics:                
	Na sataish ki tamanna, na silay ki        
	 parvah        
	Gar nahin mere ashaar mein         
	maanee, na sahi                
	I desire not praise, for rewards I        
	dont care a bit         
	If my verses do not have meanings,        
	So be it.                
	The year that was                
	Kapil Sibal, Union cabinet minister, penned his thoughts on last years tragic events. He entitled his longish poem Retaliate. I reproduce it in full:                
	I feel entrapped/ just like you do/ you by your acts / and I by you// You target me/ yet you are blind/ Product of an/imprisoned mind// Your freedom comes/ with your last breath/ for me, when I/ escape from death// No questions asked/when you will die/ those mourning me/will question why// Evil triumphs/snuffs out the flame/ our answers are/ always the same// Have fortitude /need to be strong/ Well find out why/ and what went wrong// Engrossed in these / macabre thoughts/ Saw him fire / two lethal shots// My neighbour slumped/ limp by my side/awaited, winced /no where to hide//Closed my eyes tight /prayed silently/the next one might/ be meant for me/ Each moment/ held my destiny/ Amidst this dance/of savagery/ Get up and move,/ stand by the wall/ shaken by his/ rough rasping call// Felt death shuffle /with slothful moves/ we dragged ourselves/with bloodstained shoes// Lined ourselves up/ against the wall/ wanted to make/ just one last call// To tell you that/ all roads are blocked/ Ill miss you/ till my heartbeat stops// Tell kiddos that/ I wont be there/ to help them walk/ ahead with care // I never knew/ at death Ill face/ bullets, and not/ a warm embrace // Daring to look/ I saw him smirk/ knew that he soon/ would go berserk // They laughed as if/this was a game/ and mockingly/ gave it a name// Called it Nine-Pins/ ready to fall/their weapons aimed/ to make the call// From one side his/ comrade would shoot/ from the other end/ he would follow suit//        
	I heard the sound/ of gunshots when/ I fell, before the/ count of ten// Thought I was dead/ yet was surprised/ lay still, buried/ opened my eyes // The sounds of boots / peals of delight/ their trophy was/ this deathly sight// As I passed out / felt someone kick/ faintly remember/ a cameras click // Felt trapped in/ Satans vile embrace/ Confronted death/ right in the face.// Wondered if I/ was still alive/ no reason for/ me to survive.// He leaves this choice/ to those who kill/ comfort ourselves/as being Gods will// This terror strike/ was not His call/ Why then should those/ beside me fall.                
	Never fail                
	Banta came home drunken and asked his son, Ghanta, about his examinations.        
	Ghanta: Papa, Ill have to stay in this class for one more year.        
	Banta: Koi baat nahin, saal lagey ya teen saal, magar fail mat hona (You may spend two years or three in this class, but dont fail).

                                                                                                                 WORDS OF WAR                                  STEPHEN HUGH-JONES                              
	Truth, we are told, is the first casualty of war. And so it is. The very word fell casualty in the Israeli onslaught on Gaza, with an Israeli army spokeswoman averring that the important thing is to get the truth out, even as her government barred journalists from getting into Gaza to report it. For truth read half-truth  and thats being generous.        
	Not that this was anything especially Israeli. True, peace-seekers, Israels new word for its invading soldiery, would not be everyones. But, overt aggression having gone out of fashion, most modern wars are blamed on the other side. In the British version at the time, the Boer War was provoked by the Boers. In the Hitlerian version, it was a Polish attack on Germany that set off World War II. And dont blame war alone: politics and diplomacy usually do their best to strangle truth before a bullet is fired.         
	Still, while truth has suffered, language has been both debased and enriched. In 1914-18, British media suddenly gave a new lease to life to the rare word frightfulness, usually linked with the word Hun. Appeasement, an often wise practice, has generally meant abject surrender ever since Chamberlain tried it on Hitler. In 1945, the victorious Allied soldiers were forbidden to fraternize with the defeated Germans  not quite the relationship most of them hoped for outside barracks.        
	We all know that your aggression is my pre-emptive strike, that my terrorist may be your martyr or freedom fighter, that an Israelis Hamas base may be a Gazans mosque. And that such rival versions may both be true. Just as it may be that jihad is, at least in theory, a noble concept while crusade is wicked and wrong.                
	Whatever name        
	Theres less to justify, but more to admire  linguistically  in the ingenious vocabulary, largely invented in the Pentagon, that cloaks the realities of war. The free-fire zone often found in Vietnam was one where that meant if it moves, kill it. Surgical strike can be justified if you suppose surgeons to use meat-cleavers as well as scalpels. A newer term, targeted assassination, equally suggests precision, and sometimes means it, but can in practice amount to kill the man and and dont worry that you may kill a few children too. You can always say he was using them as a human screen.        
	Collateral damage is usually a cop-out: your missile was aimed at building A, but you well knew that, hit or miss, it would smash up buildings B, C and D and anyone inside them. And caught in the crossfire is almost always a sheer lie: you didnt give a damn whom you shot, and sometimes there wasnt even an enemy there to shoot at.        
	The United Nations has added its quota of euphemism, in the Balkans, and later in Africa. We know by now that a safe haven is a most dangerous place, that a rapid-reaction force may turn up one day, perhaps, and that peacekeepers are apt to vanish when peace most needs keeping. And just as commission in arms deals means bribery, foreign aid often aids few but one dictator and some Swiss banks.        
	Such mealy-mouthed verbiage plainly debases English. Can it simultaneously enrich it? Regretfully, I think it can. Language is not the private preserve of saints, but of liars and spin-doctors too. If they make it more colourful, with whatever ill intent, so be it.        
	Thats my feeling about the cloudiest neologism of modern warfare: extraordinary rendition. What craft went into its fabrication, what learning into the disinterment of a rare noun in a meaning, surrender, rarer still. Too bad those qualities werent used to tell the White House that torture still means torture, under whatever fancy name you drag the victim to it.

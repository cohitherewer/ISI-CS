	Flicker of hope                  
	Sir  The news of a new AIDS vaccine showing promise is undoubtedly heartening (AIDS vaccine breakthrough, Sept 25). But it would be foolish to imagine that this experimental vaccine is going to help solve the AIDS endemic, or that it would be available for public use any time soon. In fact, the Thai government, which has been conducting the clinical trials for several years, has claimed that the tests were only a limited success. Until a complete analysis of the data generated by the Thai study is done and the vaccine shows that it is effective among patients in other parts of the world, the real extent of its success would remain unclear.           
	HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, is a type of retrovirus, which, by its very nature, changes its own genetic structure through frequent mutations in the viral genes. The types of HIV prevalent in Asia, including Thailand and India, are different from those commonly found in Africa, Europe or North America. Therefore, the new vaccine that has yielded positive results in the Thai study may not be as effective when it is tested in Europe or America. This is why, despite spending a huge amount of money on HIV research for more than two decades across the world, a suitable vaccine against AIDS has remained elusive to scientists so far. However, the media often sensationalize stories about the discovery of new AIDS medicines. Unfortunately, these news items may mislead ordinary people to believe that a breakthrough against AIDS has been achieved.          
	Most HIV researchers agree that an AIDS vaccine is still many years away. Even if a new vaccine were to show encouraging results, as the present Thai study has apparently shown, it will still take some time for the authorities to approve of the findings and give their nod to bulk production. Moreover, the demand for approved vaccines against other viral infections often outstrips supply, as was evident during the recent outbreak of the H1N1 virus across the globe.           
	The spread of HIV and AIDS in India has been alarming for more than one reason. The first case of HIV infection in India was reported only in 1986. But India quickly became the second-most populous nation of HIV-infected people, after South Africa, in a few years. The lack of knowledge and the abysmal performance of the National AIDS Control Organization are responsible for the spread of HIV in India.           
	It will be difficult to contain the AIDS in India. By the time a useful vaccine against HIV is eventually developed for universal use, who knows what percentage of the Indian population may actually be infected by the deadly virus? A corrupt healthcare system and prevailing myths and social taboos concerning HIV have made the fight against AIDS a formidable challenge in India. Better awareness, elimination of corruption in the medical system and the provision of highly effective anti-retroviral medication for all HIV-infected people can go a long way in checking the spread of AIDS in this country.

	Firm stand          
	Sir  Jadavpur University needs to be applauded for expelling three students accused of ragging five freshers (Varsity expels ragging three, Sept 23). As per a report presented by the Coalition to Uproot Ragging from Education, in 2005 alone 64 ragging complaints had been registered of which 62 per cent was instances of physical abuse. Nearly 20 per cent of the incidents also involved some form of sexual abuse of junior students by their seniors. In 2001, the Supreme Court had banned ragging throughout the country but the menace could not be eliminated because most of the government and social organizations remained indifferent to the plight of ragging victims. Ragging can be stopped if the media take it upon themselves to generate awareness about its ill effects. Students unions across colleges and universities must also take strong measures to eliminate this problem from the campuses.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Learn to observe          
	Sir  Geologists have predicted that a major earthquake will hit the Northeastern states soon (Bhutan quake tremors in city, Sept 22). The five earthquakes of moderate intensity that have occurred within a month in this region are indicators of the big one that is supposedly on its way. Earthquakes cannot be predicted even with the help of modern technology although changes in animal behaviour before an earthquake may provide some clues.The government should therefore set up observation centres to study animal behaviour in the national parks. The observatories should be equipped to inform disaster management teams of any changes in animal behaviour at the earliest. These teams will in turn inform the people of an impending earthquake with the help of communication agencies such as radio and television stations, mobile phone networks and so on. This strategy can help the authorities to save many lives. The government and the citizens should take this matter up in all seriousness.                     
	Yours faithfully,

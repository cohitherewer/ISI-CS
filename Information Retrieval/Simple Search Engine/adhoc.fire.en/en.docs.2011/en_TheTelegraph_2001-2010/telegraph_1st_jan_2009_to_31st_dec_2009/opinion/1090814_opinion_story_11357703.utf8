The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | out of the way
                                                                                                                 OUT OF THE WAY                                                    
	The first information report filed against Pervez Musharraf at the order of a sessions court in Pakistan is intended to do more than strip the former president of the last vestiges of honour. The threat of arrest, which could lead to a three-year jail term, is bound to keep Mr Musharraf out of the country for a while. Similar threats and court cases have conveniently kept political rivals out of office and out of reckoning. The reason why the opening of a police file against Mr Musharraf became necessary two years after his presumed crime, and more than a year after his exit from office, has to do with the threat perceptions of the government. It is again under attack from the Opposition for allegedly ducking the trial of Mr Musharraf. Following last months supreme court decision to strike down the provisional constitutional order of Mr Musharraf, the Opposition sees no reason for the government to avoid proceeding against the former president for high treason. But it neither wants to dirty its hands in the process nor to lock horns with the army. In its calculations, the incumbent government, if pushed to act, would not only manage to do both, but would also tie itself up in knots. Trying Mr Musharraf for his actions of a specific period in 2007 is bound to raise questions about, and point fingers at, the current president as well. As expected, the government led by the Pakistan Peoples Party has sought to deflect pressure by insisting on a parliamentary debate on the matter. More predictably, it has ensured that the steps it takes against Mr Musharraf neither feed into the Oppositions allegations against it nor spoil its equations with the army. The army has made clear its unhappiness with the idea of putting a former general in the dock, together with his acolytes, who are now in important positions.         
	Like the supreme court order against the PCO, the FIR against Mr Musharraf does not immediately threaten the order of things in spite of being remarkable measures that add a shine to Pakistans fledgling democracy. The FIR would keep Mr Musharraf out of harms way in the United Kingdom, which is evidently delighted to have him as guest and is trying its best to smooth out his relations with his countrymen. The only trouble is that the Opposition leader, Nawaz Sharif, may not remain satisfied with merely making Mr Musharraf look like an ordinary criminal. Mr Sharif may want to march further ahead.

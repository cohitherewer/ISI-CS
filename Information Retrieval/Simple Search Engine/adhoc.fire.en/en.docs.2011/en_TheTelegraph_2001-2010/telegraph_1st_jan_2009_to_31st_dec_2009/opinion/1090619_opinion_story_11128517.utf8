The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | words of hope
                                                                                                                 WORDS OF HOPE                                                    
	A middle-aged woman will now be able to see her grandson wed because she had not been afraid of cancer. A young man can now dream of watching the 2038 World Cup because he had not been afraid of cancer. A man can now plan his post-retirement trip to Europe because he had not been afraid of cancer. The smiling faces of these men and women are in large hoardings all over Calcutta now, advertising a local oncology centre that is supposed to be an answer to cancer. These people are all described as winners, their victories rewarded by the various pleasures of life. Hence the because: they get to live because they are brave. The will to live can achieve a great deal in the face of grave illness, but a complex mix of constitution, care, circumstances and good fortune is usually behind every story of surviving cancer. So, profound insensitivity and some misinformation lurk behind the words of courage and hope that these hoardings offer to people living with cancer.         
	Is cure a reward for being unafraid? And is being unafraid a guarantee of cure? What about those who are afraid: are they afraid because they have failed to be brave? And is it only fearlessness that has cured these people? A certain kind of language is often unthinkingly used to talk about illnesses like cancer: the language of competitiveness, which, in consumerist societies, is always full of military metaphors  battles, losing and winning. Those who survive are the winners. And those who do not, are they then the losers? And does this language of heroism not shift, ever so subtly, the agency and therefore the responsibility for winning or losing the battle to the person who is ill? Commercially motivated campaigns that also want to raise medical awareness must sensitively think through the complex human dimensions of cancer. This is particularly important in a state like West Bengal where, for many, the quality of available and affordable healthcare demands quite another kind of bravery and resilience.

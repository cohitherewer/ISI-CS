The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | first to blink
                                                                                                                 FIRST TO BLINK                                                    
	In its stand-off with the Tamil Tigers, the Sri Lankan government has blinked first. It has finally relented to a two-day ceasefire to facilitate the movement of a massive population out of the narrow no-fire zone in the countrys northeast, which has also become the last sanctuary of the Tigers. Although the Indian government has immediately claimed it to be a major victory for its peace efforts, there is no doubt that Sri Lankas change of mind was caused by the enormous pressure building up on it following censure by the international community and the high-profile public protests throughout the world. India has certainly contributed to this pressure, but its efforts alone are unlikely to have motivated Sri Lanka to call for a temporary truce. Sri Lanka itself could not but have noticed the larger advantages of such a move. It has now deflected the pressure for the safe-keeping of civilians on to the Tigers, who have deflected it back with allegations that army firing continues. This, anyway, is bound to happen since the Tigers cannot be expected to deprive themselves suddenly of the security of the human cover or the pleasure of felling their adversaries. The ceasefire initiative, after all, is the governments and not their own. The government, on its part, has asked its troops to fire only when fired at. Since one can assume that to be happening frequently, one can also deduce that the ceasefire, at the end of two days, may not have achieved much, apart from the publicity drive it was intended to be on the eve of the Tamil new year.         
	The Sri Lankan government can, of course, be prevailed upon for an extension of the ceasefire. But a unilateral ceasefire has never delivered the goods. Equal pressure has to be exerted on the Tigers, and that would require the sincere effort of the international community, and of Sri Lankas immediate neighbours, some of whom are busy making political capital from the situation. It cannot be denied that the humanitarian crisis in Sri Lanka is affecting the poll dynamics in India, and this has necessitated the incumbent governments at the Centre and in Tamil Nadu to wear their affection for Sinhala Tamils on their sleeves. Their political opponents are doing much the same. The political underpinnings of the crisis are holding up a permanent solution to the Tamil question in Sri Lanka. An expression of goodwill is not enough to resolve the deadlock.

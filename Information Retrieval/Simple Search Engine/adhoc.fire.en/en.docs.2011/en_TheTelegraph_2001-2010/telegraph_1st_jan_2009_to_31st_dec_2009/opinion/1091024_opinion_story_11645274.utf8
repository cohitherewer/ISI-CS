                                                                                                                 THE DRINKERS DICTIONARY                                  THIS ABOVE ALL - KHUSHWANT SINGH                          Spiritual longing                                        
	English and other European languages have innumerable words for different levels of drunkenness. We have very few in our languages. The reason may be that Europeans and Americans consume a lot more alcohol than we Indians, and even those who drink, try to keep their identities under cover. Come to think of it, we dont have an equivalent for a hangover which follows excessive drinking or mixing different kinds of alcoholic beverages.        
	This brings me to the publication of what I can best describe as a drinking mans or womans dictionary, compiled by Bhaichand Patel, entitled Happy Hours: The Penguin Book of Cocktails. It deals methodically with different kinds of whiskeys, gins, rums, brandies, liquors, beers  you name them, he tells you about them. And about how to avoid or combat hangovers.        
	Bhaichand lives in a block next to mine. He is a Fijian Gujarati who I got to know during my years in Bombay. He held a good job in the UN and now gets a handsome dollar pension. He also has a valuable real estate in New Delhi  in short, he is never short of money. He is what the French call a bon viveur  a good-living man. He believes that money is meant to be spent, not hoarded. He travels round the globe at least once every year. When in Delhi, his top priority is partying. He throws the most lavish parties with vintage scotch, gourmet food and the best of wines. So he is well-qualified to write on liquor delights with authority. The most amusing part of his research is on the vast variety of cocktails with exotic names like Fine and Dandy, Kiss in the Dark, Knickerbocker, Maidens Blush, Pink Passport, Seventh Heaven, Suffering Bastard, Kiss and Tell, Sex on the Beach, and so on. You can get tipsy reading about them.                
	No offence meant                
	In northern India, there are different ways of addressing people depending on distances in a relationship. The commonest is bhai (brother) or, more formally, bhai sahib or bhaiya. However, care-takers of gurdwaras and raagis are also addressed as bhai sahibs more to express respect than friendship. Amongst friends, bhai is used as expression of kinship and when discussing serious matters of life and death.        
	Closer than bhai is dost (friend). It is warmer than bhai. We use it while talking about lighter matters or exchanging confidences. A grade higher and closer than dost is yaar (the closest English equivalent I can think of is comrade without its communist connotations). It is quite a light-hearted, open-armed kind of embrace of friendship. But beware! Yaar and yaaree are different. In Punjab, yaaree lagaana means having liaison with a member of the other sex.        
	Believe it or not, of all modes of addresses the warmest is to call your friend ulloo ka pattha  son of an owl. No offence is meant, only all barriers of formality are knocked down and you open up your hearts. One condition has to be kept in mind: there must be some laughter in calling a close friend, son of an owl. Without laughter, and said sternly, the same words become abusive, particularly if prefixed with oy, oy, oy. Addressing another with oy, oy, oy or abey ulloo key patthey becomes a war cry for a battle of abuses to begin.                
	Whats in a name?                
	A north Indian was working in Mumbai and did not meet his wife for four years while his wife was in Himachal. At the end of four years, he distributed sweets to his colleagues in office saying that his wife had delivered a son. His colleagues were shocked and asked how this happy event happened when he had not seen his wife for four years.        
	The man said it is common in his part of the country for neighbours to take care of the wives when their men are away. The colleagues asked him, What name will you give to your son? The man explained, If its the second neighbour who has taken care, then the name will be Dwivedi! If it is the third neighbour, then it will be Trivedi. If it is the fourth neighbour, then it will be Chaturvedi. If its the fifth neighbour, then it will be Pandey.        
	After listening to this, questions followed. What if it is a mixture of neighbours? Then the boy will be named Mishra. And what if the wife is too shy to tell the name of the neighbour? Then it would be Sharma. But what if she refuses to divulge the name of the neighbour? Then the name of the child would be Gupta. If she does not remember the name then? It would be Yaad-av.        
	But who knows whether the child resulted from a rape? Then it will be named Doshi. Finally, if the child happened because of wifes burning desire? Then it will be named Joshi. And if the whole country had made efforts for the happy arrival? Deshpandey.

	Anyone who says that within the next few years an agreement can be reached ending the conflict (between Israel and the Palestinians) simply doesnt understand the situation and spreads delusions, said the Israeli foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman recently. But Barack Obama does say that. In fact, they gave him the Nobel Prize for saying it, didnt they?         
	Speaking in a radio interview, Lieberman added: There are conflicts that have not been completely solved and people have learned to live with it.... We have to be realistic. We will not be able to reach agreement on core and emotional subjects like Jerusalem and the right of return of Palestinian refugees. He said all this just as Obamas point man for what we used to call the peace process, George Mitchell, arrived in Israel.        
	Undaunted by Liebermans comments, Mitchell gabbled the usual nonsense about how were going to continue our efforts to achieve an early relaunch of negotiations...because we believe that is an essential step toward achieving a comprehensive peace. Doesnt he understand that the peace process has been dead for years? The Palestinian Authority under Mahmoud Abbas also pretends that the peace process is still alive. Indeed, it did so even in the last years of Yasser Arafats life. It has to go on pretending, because if the PA admits that the peace process is dead, then it becomes no more than an Israeli instrument for indirect control of the Palestinians.         
	We had a vivid demonstration of this recently, when Judge Richard Goldstone submitted his report on last winters three-week war in the Gaza Strip to the United Nations Human Rights Council. The document reported that both Israeli forces and Palestinian militants had committed war crimes, and possible crimes against humanity, and a resolution was put before the council that could ultimately have led to prosecutions at the International Criminal Court.                 
	Hand in glove        
	Israel launched a propaganda blitz to discredit Goldstones report, and together with the United States of America it mounted a diplomatic campaign to postpone any formal consideration of the report until next March. By then, it would be old news. Standard tactic, but heres the bizarre bit: the Palestinian Authority also supported delaying the vote by six months.        
	Unsurprisingly, this public evidence of the PAs subjugation to American and Israeli policy caused a great outcry among Palestinians even in the West Bank, and Mahmoud Abbas ordered a probe into who had made such a wicked decision. The truth is that the Palestinian Authority is just as complicit in the charade of a continuing peace process as the Israeli or American governments, and cannot afford to abandon it. Only the radical Islamists of Hamas openly acknowledge the same reality that Lieberman describes (although from a very different perspective). So what it offers Israel is a long-term truce, but only if the Palestinians get their pre-1967 borders back now.         
	A long-term truce is all that Lieberman is offering, and even that is not going to happen because he has no intention of returning to Israels pre-1967 borders. Neither does his boss, Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, although he wraps his refusal in more diplomatic language. All of Obamas pleas have failed to extract from Netanyahu even a promise to freeze the expansion of Israeli settlements in the occupied territories, let alone to negotiate a withdrawal from them. Obama has not moved from pleas to actual pressure because the Israelis effectively control the US Congress on this issue, and he will not risk alienating the Congress over Israel while he is trying to get legislation through on health care, climate change, and other urgent issues. Still, there is no doubt that Obamas intentions are good. So are mine. Wheres my prize?

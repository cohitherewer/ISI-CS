The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A formidable spectre, and an act of true courage
                                                                                                                 A FORMIDABLE SPECTRE, AND AN ACT OF TRUE COURAGE                                                                  
	Vyasa rsquo;s Mahabharatam in Eighteen Parvas: The Great Epic of India in Summary Translation By Bharadvaja Sarma, Academic Publishers, Rs 1,000                
	There is something almost symbolic in undertaking the task of translating the Mahabharat. It is an act of true courage. For Bharadvaja Sarma, reading Vyasas epic in Sanskrit, then translating it into English and abridging it at the same time took 15 years. While it is his gift to a generation that may not have adequate Sanskrit or adequate time to read the epic, the act of translating is, for him, peculiarly imbued with the memory of inheritance. Bharadvaja Sarma is a pseudonym, the name of the legendary first father of the translators genealogical line. Besides the ironic aptness of this emphasis on genealogy, perhaps it is also the translators way of summoning up courage for the task.        
	With the aim of presenting the epic in a portable size (unfortunately indicated by the term summary translation in the subtitle), Sarma has attempted to follow the sequence of events in the original epic, while retaining its rich and complicated character as much as possible. As a result, he has included more episodes and ancillary stories than are present in the critical edition published by the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute of Pune, by reference to which he has marked the divisions and chapters in the translation. Ultimately, therefore, the size of the volume is not quite portable. The extra comes from the older Calcutta edition that the translator prefers because it is more inclusive. This is also very close to the Bombay edition with the commentary by Nilkantha. As support for his reading of the original, Sarma cites the edition by M.M. Haridas Siddhantavagis, and he has as his model of abridged translation Rajsekhar Basus classic rendering of the epic in Bengali.        
	But Rajsekhar Basus relationship to the Bengali language is rather different from Sarmas to English. The Bengali translation is an inspired abridgement: ruthless, consistent, faithful and enormously rich and entertaining. In the new English translation, the translator is torn between the contrary attractions of what he calls fashion-free English and the need to retain some flavour of the original poetry through sudden evocations of ornateness. That does not always work. It is difficult enough to translate Sanskrit into English if the avowed purpose is not to sound strange but smart enough to be read by young people of the 21st century. On top of that, Sarma does not seem certain where he should pitch the translation. Gently mocking the disheartened Arjuna just before the battle, Krishna deplores that the hero should be grieving over those he should not mourn while using wise expressions. Sarma puts the latter part of Krishnas admonition thus: And yet you talk like wisecracks. This is a crucial moment in the drama, irrespective of the possibility that the section is an interpolation. Sarma needed a good editor, one who would have also objected to Udyog Parva being translated as The Book of Brinkmanship.        
	Although the story is faithfully told  if rather long-windedly for todays young people  with the maximum excisions being made, inevitably, from the Santi Parva and the Anushashan Parva, Sarmas attempt at fashion-free English fails to get the registers right. Even in this tale of the most terrible violence, a disillusioned and grief-stricken Yudhisthira shouting, To hell with the Kshatriya code of conduct, to hell with Kshatriya prowess, to hell with anger and pride which has landed us in this catastrophy [sic] may startle the reader. Hell is a real place in the Mahabharat, and is tied up with the intricate issue of dharma.        
	Not that Sarma is unconscious of these intricacies. His notes on untranslatable concepts, on characters, places, and genealogies, are brief yet lucid, and the explanation of dharma is among the best. A greater intellectual poise when faced with the formidable spectre of tradition and a meticulous editors eye would have given Sarmas translation much of the appeal he had aimed at.                    BHASWATI CHAKRAVORTY

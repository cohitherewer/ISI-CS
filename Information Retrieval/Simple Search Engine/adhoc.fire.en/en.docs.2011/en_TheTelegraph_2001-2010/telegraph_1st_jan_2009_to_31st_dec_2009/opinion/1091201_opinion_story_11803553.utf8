The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | In disarray
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        IN DISARRAY                                                    
	It takes a lot to shock Calcutta. So the chaos and violence that gripped parts of the city on Monday may not have been such a novel experience. But the events showed once more how little the people can really expect of the state government. Even for a city that had long earned its notoriety as the cradle of the politics of bandhs, Mondays attempted shutdown was a bit of a surprise. Few had suspected that a bandh called by the Bharatiya Janata Party would have much of an impact in the state. It came less than a week after the bandh called by the Socialist Unity Centre of India, which passed without any major incident of violence or disruption to public life. The BJPs bandh call was thus expected to be a minor political event because the party has a small following in West Bengal. True, even a weak outfit can disrupt public life or cause violence, at least on a small scale. But if the saffron brigade lacked strength to force the shutdown, an inept administration moved in to help it. It would be ridiculously wrong to see the disruptions as a sign of the BJPs success; the ugly events of the day only reflect the rulers inability or unwillingness to exercise power in the public interest.        
	The trouble is that the governments failure to uphold the rule of law is becoming all too evident. It has become routine for Writers Buildings to cower in the face of every provocation, big or small. The biggest party of the ruling Left Front, the Communist Party of India (Marxist), has its own explanation for the failure. It is ever ready with conspiracy theories: its political opponents, it argues, are constantly plotting to break the law and incite violence. True, the erosion of the CPI(M)s support base, as reflected in all recent elections, has emboldened the Opposition parties to challenge the government and the CPI(M) in ways that they could not do in earlier years. However, this is a weak defence of the governments incompetence. Whether it is the bandh culture or the politics of violence, the CPI(M) has been the original sinner. But more important is the fact that the governing agenda is not a political matter. No matter what his partys agenda is, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is constitutionally bound to administer the state as long as he is the chief minister. Mondays bandh may not prove anything about the BJPs prospects in Bengal, but it serves as a ringing indictment of his government.

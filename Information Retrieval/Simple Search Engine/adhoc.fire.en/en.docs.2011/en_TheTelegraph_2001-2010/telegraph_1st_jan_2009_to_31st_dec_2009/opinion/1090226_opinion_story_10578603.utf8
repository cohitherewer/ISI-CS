                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Unusual courage                   
	Sir  The courage of Ratna, the 13-year-old unwed mother, as depicted by Bhaswati Chakravorty in the article, Out of the darkness (Feb 17), is commendable. It is difficult to say whether she was right in refusing to marry the person who had sexually assaulted her. Maybe he would have look after her reasonably. But, probably, a forced marriage resulting from the mans fear of prison would be an eyewash. The husband might satisfy the society and law-enforcers by giving the victim shelter through marriage, but it is most likely that she would be ill-treated.          
	The NGOs deserve praise for helping Ratna. Hundreds of such incidents must be taking place in our country even after 61 years of Independence. Given that Ratna comes from an underprivileged class, bringing up the baby will not be an easy task for her. But how many Ratnas have the courage to stand up and declare war against the men who have molested them?                    
	Yours faithfully,      
J.P. Moyalan, Ranchi

                
	Sir  The article on the unwed, teenage village girl who decided to keep her baby, was heart-wrenching. Because she declined to marry her alleged molester, Ratna has become a criminal in the eyes of her community. This is an interesting insight into our society. If marriage with the perpetrator is supposed to be the only solution for a raped woman, then this should become a law. All men should have the licence to rape women provided they marry the victims afterwards.           
	Why is the victim always blamed? Does any woman ask to be raped? People show false sympathy for rape victims, but do they ask why the police decline to register these cases? And why do so-called good families not want to accept such victims as their daughters-in-law? If a woman is sexually assaulted, she is blamed for provoking the attack. If she decides to keep her baby, she is blamed for setting a bad example. Is the man who assaulted her setting a great example for society?           
	Women keep quiet instead of raising their voices. We were happy when a woman became our president. But have things changed? Do we ask why there hasnt been a change? We women need to demand our rights and assert our views. Otherwise, we will always be forced to deal with male aggression outdoors and domestic violence indoors.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Shraddha Nidhi, Dhanbad 

                
	Sir  The lone battle fought by a young girl and her mother against their landlords as well as against unjust social pressures stands out as a striking example of courage in the face of injustice, money power and muscle power. When politicians hail the election of a woman president as a huge step in the direction of womens empowerment, I wonder if they understand what the term actually means. Rape and molestation are widespread in India even after 61 years of Independence.           
	In the Mangalore pub attack and the Valentines Day fiasco, the Sri Ram Sena and other such outfits justified their stance by saying that such festivals and incidents degrade women. Why dont these self-appointed moral apostles punish rapists and molesters instead? Whenever the time for real action comes, the moral police slip into hibernation or do the vanishing trick.           
	That Ratna was treated as an outcast by the villagers, the police and even by a city doctor when she refused to marry her alleged molester shows that even today, the victim is the guilty one in the eyes of our society. The NGO that came forward to help the girl deserves praise. Such organizations, and not the fat-pursed politicians and the moral brigade, are serving humanity and the nation in true sense.           
	I urge people to abandon evil social norms and ensure that the rich and the poor, the strong and the weak, irrespective of caste, creed and religion, can live a life of security and dignity.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Watershed time          
	Sir  The editorial, Grown up (Feb 11), was interesting. A democracy should have a liberal image and be secure enough to allow this openness. But there are numerous other facets of life where our democracy should show signs of maturity. Distinguishing adult content from pornography is important to ensure that the adult population is not treated like children in the nursery. However, it is up to the policymakers to define adult content. The amount of violence that we see everyday on television is damaging  both in film clips or in news footage. The latter spills over to the front pages of newspapers, with no care for the dignity of victims, as if to make the news more credible. News editors must show more maturity regarding the airing and repeating of such items.           
	Film songs often have a high amount of sexually provocative content that may not be suitable for young viewers. Producers have to consider the possible audience, which may not be the same as the target audience. Advertisers have a similar responsibility, since there are many advertisements more sexually suggestive than film clips. Should revenue-generation make these acceptable at any time of the day and night?          
	Adult content can take various forms, so it is important to define it. Contraceptive commercials may be educative, but are difficult to explain to an eight-year-old enjoying a cricket match. The information and broadcasting ministry should lay down proper guidelines. It may be possible to emulate the BBCs watershed time. That is a signpost that programmes and commercials after the marked out time are not expected to be suitable for the young. Even then, there are warnings when a programme contains violent scenes, even when the disturbing scenes are part of news, whatever the time of day.           
	A democracy is grown up when it shows maturity. We need more signs of maturity from the leaders before expecting the man on the street to be mature in his behaviour. A lot remains to be done by the administration and politicians to enable people to behave in a mature fashion regarding issues of everyday life.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Quite a lot for parking                  
	Sir  Do the laws of the land stand suspended on the parking stretch opposite the Grand Hotel? How else does one explain the fact that while in rest of the city one has to pay seven rupees an hour as parking fee, one has to shell out Rs 30 per hour to the roughnecks who call the shots in this parking lot? These men listen to no logic and do not issue receipts, just like members of the parking mafia who man the area in Kidderpore opposite Fancy Market. Will the police do something or is the government too weak-willed?           
	Yours faithfully,

	Justice denied           
	Sir  The stern rebuke of the chief justice of the Calcutta high court directed at lawyers and attorneys for seeking adjournments on one flimsy ground or another would come as a pleasant surprise to most (Chief justice rap for tardy lawyers, March 28). As he pointed out, adjournments slow down the process of justice and do no good to the hapless petitioner who is at the mercy of devious lawyers.          
	Justice delayed is justice denied. It is an unarguable fact that if a case is stalled for a decade or two in the legal quagmire, justice is not delivered. The entire legal community gets a bad name because of the actions of a few unprincipled professionals. Attorneys adopt delaying tactics to stall important public interest litigation cases that would benefit society if they are promptly disposed of.          
	But isnt the government supposed to be on the side of the public? It is interesting to note that the chief justice has asked that the state advocate-general be kept informed regarding the frequent and unnecessary adjournment motions brought by state attorneys. It remains to be seen whether the rebuke of the chief justice brings about a change in the attitude of the office of the state advocate-general.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Adjournments are not the only cause for delay. The following facts would make this clear. In 2005, a petition had been filed against a certain company under the ministry of heavy industries and the new management for the payment of arrears for a certain period between 1994 and 1995 to the petitioner. The writ application was disposed of with the observation that the petitioner was free to approach the appropriate forum within six weeks. A legal notice was eventually issued, asking the company to pay a sum of Rs 1,39,251, along with interest for the period of nine years, within a period of 21 days.           
	The company went for an appeal after depositing Rs 1,40,000 with the registrar of the high court and the matter dragged on. The petitioner was forced to file another petition before the Supreme Court in 2008. The company has gone for an appeal once again and seen to it that the notice to the other party reached sufficiently late so that there was little time to prepare the case.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Other healers           
	Sir  It was painful to read the two articles, Behind the invisible screen by Uddalak Mukherjee, and Cameras not allowed by Aveek Sen (March 31). The inmates of a mental hospital are not aware of what is happening around them. Only dedicated people can give solace to them, since they are shunned by their own relatives.           
	People who make a living out of taking care of mental patients should see their duties as a mission. And they should be appreciated for the work they are doing. Well-to-do people should come forward with monetary help, and others should also volunteer service.                    
	Yours faithfully,

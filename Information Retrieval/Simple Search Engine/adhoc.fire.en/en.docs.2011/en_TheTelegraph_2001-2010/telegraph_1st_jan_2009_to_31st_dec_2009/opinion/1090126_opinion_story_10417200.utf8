The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | SWISH WARNING
                                                                                                                 SWISH WARNING                                  FIFTH COLUMN - GWYNNE DYER                              
	President Barack Obamas inauguration increases the likelihood of a major terrorist attack in the United States of America. That was the stark message of the South Waziristan Institute for Strategic Hermeneutics (Swish), a think tank that offers strategic advice to some of the leading players in global politics.        
	Unfortunately, Swish only exists in the fertile brain of British academic and strategic analyst, Paul Rogers, who publishes its reports on the website of Open Democracy. Moreover, the Obama transition team did not ask for the report Swish sent it, although one devoutly hopes that they read it. Because the prediction is serious, as is all of Swishs work.        
	The Swish phenomenon began as a one-man attempt to educate Western analysts in the thinking of their Islamist enemies. The reports mimicked the format used by consultants in the various Washington think tanks that advise the US government and the Pentagon on strategic matters, but they came from the mythical Swish, which had supposedly been hired by the leadership of al Qaida to provide a similar service for them. In its first report to al Qaida in 2004, Swish advised Osama bin Ladens planners that the immediate requirement... is therefore to aid, in any way within the framework of your core values, the survival of the Bush administration. By invading Afghanistan and Iraq, by his policies of illegal detention and torture and rendition, and by his militaristic declaration of a war on terror, Bush was doing exactly what al Qaida wanted        
	So, the report continued, it could not recommend a further large terrorist attack on the US, since its impact on American public opinion was unpredictable. It might strengthen support for Bush in the November 2004 election, but equally it might turn American public opinion against him. On balance, Swish concluded, it was best not to risk an attack, since Bush was likely to win the re-election anyway.                
	Repeat act        
	You may wonder what all of this has to do with reality. The answer is: a great deal more than most of what passed for political analysis in Washington over the past eight years. While your average Beltway bandit treated the al Qaida leaders as a bunch of mad mullahs driven only by unreasoning hatred, Paul Rogers assumed (correctly) that they were intelligent people with coherent long-term strategies. In particular, he assumed that a primary purpose of the 9/11 attacks was to sucker the US into invading Afghanistan, as that would radicalize Muslim populations and generate waves of recruits for bin Ladens organization. Once Bush did that, he was al Qaidas man, and its main interest was keeping him in power. So, no more attacks on the US between September, 2001 and January, 2009. This is not rocket science. Readers of this column will recall that I have repeatedly predicted no further al Qaida attacks on the US on exactly the same logic.         
	American analysts are resistant to the notion that their country could be a pawn in somebody elses strategy, but gradually this perspective has been making headway. I shared a platform with former Homeland Security chief, Tom Ridge, a couple of years ago, and he was willing to concede that his success in preventing further al Qaida attacks after 9/11 might have been due to the fact that they werent actually planning any. But by the same token, Obamas arrival in power may make a new 9/11 desirable. While he is certainly not proposing a US military withdrawal from Afghanistan or from Iraq, he seems less persuaded than Bush that invading and occupying Muslim countries is a good idea.         
	So if there is any way that al Qaida can organize a major attack on US soil in the coming 12-18 months, they will do it. These are not stupid people; their main goal now must be to stampede the American public back into the fearful mindset that allowed Bush to launch his wars, and hope that Obama will be swept along by it.

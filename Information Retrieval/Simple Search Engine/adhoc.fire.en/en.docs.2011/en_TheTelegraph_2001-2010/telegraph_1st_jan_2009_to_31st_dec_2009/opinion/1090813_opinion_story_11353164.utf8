                                                                                                                 BREAK IN MIST                                                    
	Signs should not be taken for wonders. Thus the initiation of a process to restore normalcy in the hills of West Bengal should not be read as a quick-fix magic formula. The beginning that has been made should, however, please the West Bengal government since a consensus has been reached to abandon the idea of granting a separate state to the Gorkhas. There was an agreement that an interlocutor would be appointed to review the realities in the region and to look into the various demands. The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha seemed to be pleased at this outcome and promised to maintain peace. What this means is that the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council Act of 1988 is no longer valid. The Sixth Schedule Bill of the Constitution, which sought to grant autonomy, has also been dropped. In other words, negotiations will now proceed without any past baggage. The West Bengal government had bought peace with Subash Ghising, the former numero uno of the Gorkhaland agitation, with the promise of the DGHC and the Sixth Schedule. One gain has been the three-tier panchayat system to replace the single-tier system that now lies derelict.        
	What this truce essentially ensures is that during the peak tourist season, Darjeeling will be free from trouble. Tourists will be able to visit what was once called the queen of hill stations. This, however, has all the appearances of a temporary truce. The hills without the usual tourist traffic would be seriously strapped for resources and the people who live there would lose an irreplaceable source of income. From the point of view of the GJM, this is the best time to negotiate a tactical peace. The Central government and the West Bengal one may have achieved a truce, but by no means a permanent peace. There is no guarantee that the GJM or some other organization will not revive the demand for a separate state and unleash another round of bandhs and violence. The fragility of the situation was underlined by the statement of Amar Lama, a GJM leader. Mr Lama said that peace would be maintained unless provoked by the West Bengal government. The definition of what would constitute a provocation on the part of the West Bengal government was deliberately left vague. Embedded in the statement is also a deep-seated suspicion of the state government and its intentions. The hills may be free now of the mists of trouble but, like the weather, politics there can be unpredictable.

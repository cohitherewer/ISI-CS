	There is a good case to be made for replacing the word security in the appellation, National Security Advisor, with the word strategy. What the holder of that office does, whether in the United States of America, its place of origin since the Fifties, or in India, where it is of more recent vintage, is to advise the head of the government on matters of strategy. The NSA in the US is not responsible for internal security. This held true in India when Brajesh Mishra held that office under Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Mr Mishra was the first to hold that office, and it will be no distortion to suggest that the post was created to maintain prime ministerial control over foreign policy. In the US, the position came to acquire a special importance when it was held by Henry Kissinger, one of the modern masters of foreign policy. For a time, Mr Kissinger was also the secretary of state. In India, under the present dispensation, the job has been given to M.K. Narayanan, a former police office who served in the highest echelons of his service. There can be no questions about Mr Narayanans expertise in handling matters relating to security. At the same time, it could be asked with a great deal of justification, if making a former high-ranking police officer the NSA is not taking too literal a view of the post.        
	Security, under certain circumstances, can be a subset of strategy. The critical factor that differentiates security from strategy is time. Strategy, by definition, looks at the medium-to long-term prospect and considers the countrys foreign policy in that context. Security, on the other hand, is concerned with the immediate threats to the country. This distinction is crucial to comprehend the role of the NSA in India. For the NSA, strategy must prevail over security. There exist other agencies to eliminate threats to Indias security, but there is no office, save perhaps that of the NSA, that concentrates on strategy. Under the circumstances, it may not perhaps be the best solution to have the same person thinking about security as well as strategy. Bifocal lenses are not always best suited to holders of all offices. Within the given structure of the government, the person responsible for advising the prime minister on strategy is the foreign secretary. It may not be a bad idea to merge the position of the NSA with that of the foreign secretary. The suggestion may ruffle a few feathers but may bring more eggs to hatch within the nest.

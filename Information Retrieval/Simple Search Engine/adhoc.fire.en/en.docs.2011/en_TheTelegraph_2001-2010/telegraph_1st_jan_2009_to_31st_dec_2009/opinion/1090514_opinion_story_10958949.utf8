                                                                                                                 CLOSE QUARTERS                                                    
	Numbers, not political loyalty or logic, make a coalition government survive or fall. Meghalayas new government, too, is born of a game of numbers. Obviously, there are no untouchables in this game and yesterdays enemy easily becomes todays friend. The Congress and the United Democratic Party are partners in the new ruling coalition simply because they managed to strike a bargain over the distribution of ministerial berths. The Nationalist Congress Party, which had ruled the state until recently with the UDP as its ally, lost out because of a bad bargain with the Congress. That the Congress and the NCP are allies in the United Progressive Alliance at the Centre did not stop the former from abandoning the latter in favour of the UDP. Coalition politics came to Indias Northeast much before it hit New Delhi. Political parties and their leaders in the region are thus no strangers to the number game. And they know that alliances can be short-lived and devoid of any political morality.         
	Yet, the formation of the new government is a welcome development for the state. Presidents rule keeps the democratic process in abeyance. It also militates against the peoples basic right to be ruled by their own elected representatives. Also, an unnecessarily long spell of Central rule worsens a political problem instead of solving it. It also leaves the field open for what is known as horse-trading. Worst of all, the political uncertainty that surrounds Presidents rule brings governance to a halt. Northeastern states are largely dependent on their governments for most of their economic activities. Industries or other private sector initiatives are far fewer here than in other parts of India because of topographical and other reasons. But the basic needs of the people  such as education, healthcare and jobs  are as important in the region as anywhere else. Even an unstable local government, therefore, is better than the rule from distant New Delhi.

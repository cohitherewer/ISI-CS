	Wise words from the cyber gods                
	Blogprint (Penguin, Rs 199) compiles the award-winning entries of the Sulekha.com-Penguin online writing contest. Originally published in blogs and written by amateur authors, these are refreshing works. There are short stories and anecdotes  reflective, sombre or humorous. Some of the authors radically experiment with conventional modes of story-telling. For instance, Rangachari Raghavan in What the stars foretell works with a series of fortune forecast. The diverse social and professional affiliations of these authors  including an architect, a lawyer and even a marketing executive  enrich the colourful world of facts and fiction that they capture in their eclectic pieces. These excellent blog entries, now put in print, may help dispel the old-school cynics prejudice about electronic texts or blogging.                        
	Strikes: How to avoid them (Resolution of industrial disputes through conciliation in India: an analysis of selected cases) (Sterling, Rs 400) by P.D. Shenoy bears a self-explanatory title. The work is based on the experiences of the author in labour administration and industrial relations, when he was the labour commissioner of Karnataka, and later, the chief labour commissioner at the Centre. Rich in legal references (the rights of ministers, of the factory-owners, of trade unions) and many case studies, the book may prove helpful for students of sociology, economics and human resource management. However, there is a distinct lack of detailed references that could have substantiated Shenoys thesis more effectively.                        
	God behind the firewall: A novel (Sparrow, Rs 250) by Anirban Ray tells the story of Arun, a software professional disillusioned with his job, seeking spiritual fulfilment. Eventually, he realizes that mystical messages are encrypted in the software codes he has used. With the help of his wife, Sampurna, and after a hectic travelling schedule, covering California, Calcutta, Bangalore, Las Vegas and the Lake District, Arun finally reaches the abstract Quantum Mind, Cyberspace. Then, at last, he realizes that science is nothing but a spiritual quest. Now, all he has to do to redeem the holy power of software and science is to fight a moral battle against hackers, the ungodly race. The novel ends with Aruns discovery of the Avatar  a collective spiritual being, a simulated aggregation of our quantum consciousness, a step closer to God than ordinary human beings (does it make any sense at all?). Strewn with quotes of Nietzsche, Einstein, Edgar Cayce and Oprah Winfrey, the novel, pretending to be a piece of sci-fi, can well be a technocrat-turned-spiritual-gurus tiresome twaddle.                                  
	Change your mind  Its all in your head: change your health (Macmillan, Rs 345) by Mark C. Pettus promises to make the reader addicted to health in just four weeks. But the book might disappoint aspiring health freaks if they, misled by these words, look for tips for trimming their waistline or toning their muscles. The book discusses in detail, sometimes to the extent of boring its readers, how the brain and the nervous system function under various conditions. Lifestyle, risks, stress, self-control, emotions are some of the keywords that turn up in every chapter like bad pennies. Gradually, it gets predictable that the closing chapters will dispense a spiritual guideline for surviving well by meditation, dancing or keeping pets at home.                        
	The liftman and other stories (Hindon, Rs 195) by Sheela Jaywant offers a bunch of short stories, most of which have been published in websites and newspapers before. The stories would have been readable had they focused on things beyond dull vignettes of middle-class existence.

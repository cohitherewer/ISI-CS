                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Man for the masses                  
	Sir  The country was stunned on September 3 when the media broke the news that the chief minister of Andhra Pradesh, Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy, and four other persons had died as their helicopter crashed in the Nallamala forests because of bad weather (Chopper flies into hillock, explodes, Sept 4).          
	Reddy was a true son of the soil. He will be remembered as a strong and dynamic leader who worked for the poor. His polite conduct had helped him win many friends. Reddys blend of populism and geniality made him unbeatable. The Congresss big win in Andhra Pradesh was largely to his credit. That win enabled Reddys government to launch a number of successful welfare schemes such as old-age pension, medical treatment for families below the poverty line, and the distribution of subsidized rice, as part of his development agenda for the state. Happy with his performance, the people of Andhra Pradesh elected him for another term.          
	While the welfare of the poor remained the focus of Reddys government, the states industrial progress, too, continued under his leadership. His irrigation programmes, though only partially effective, did succeed in making a mark. On the economic front, small towns became a part of the global market.          
	Reddys lifestyle was simple. Now that he is no more, the political vacuum created in Andhra Pradesh would be difficult to fill. Not only the state and the Congress, but the whole country has become poorer with his death.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Dilbag Rai, Chandigarh

                
	Sir  With the sudden death of Y.S.R. Reddy, the country has lost a brilliant member of the Congress. It was mainly due to his efforts that the Congress won more seats than before in the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, defeating the Telugu Desam Party. Now it seems that one will have to wait a long time for the details of the crash to be disclosed.          
	As is usual in such cases, the government will probably appoint a committee or a commission to probe the deaths that may take as long as a year to submit its report. It is likely that by that time both the people and the Congress will stop thinking about Reddy, since the country has a habit of forgetting its leaders who may have lost their lives trying to serve the nation.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
K.R. Prem Kumar, Bangalore

                
	Sir  It is unfortunate that an illustrious political career, devoted to the development of Andhra Pradesh, has come to an abrupt end. It is surprising that in spite of the inclement weather on the morning of September 2, and it being an over two-hours flight from Hyderabad to Chittoor, the chief minister was not advised against making the trip. The late YSR, as he was popularly known, will always be remembered for his yeoman service to the state, and especially for his schemes meant for the welfare of the downtrodden. The Centre should make an enquiry into the accident and take steps to ensure that such tragedies do not occur in future.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
R. Sekar, Visakhapatnam

                
	Sir  Y.S.R. Reddys 1,500 km padayatra across Andhra Pradesh in 2003 to understand the sufferings of the poor showed his good intentions, for this was not a political stunt performed in election-time. After he defeated N. Chandrababu Naidu of the TDP in the 2004 elections, Reddy had earnestly tried to implement various projects to create jobs for the poor. He had helped launch several irrigation and family welfare programmes. Such plans as the Indiramma low-cost housing scheme and the Arogyasri scheme made him the most charismatic and popular leader in the state. No one can replace him in the near future.           
	As to the manner of Reddys death, many of Indias high-profile leaders have had helicopter accidents. The government should frame a set of safety-rules regarding air travel by VIPs in future.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad 

                
	Sir  That it took nearly 20 hours to find the crashed helicopter carrying Y.S.R. Reddy and others says a lot about the inadequate infrastructure of the Indian administrative system. In the West, in a similar situation, it would probably not take even a couple of hours to locate the site of the crash, irrespective of whether the passenger was a VIP or not. The government of India should investigate the inordinate delay in locating the crash and should be prompt in taking action if such another accident occurs in future.          
	Yours faithfully,

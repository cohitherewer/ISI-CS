Notebook - Ian Jack                                                        
	Ive known a few writers who claim never to read reviews of their books or plays. This seems sensible: a laudatory review might derange a writer with vanity and a savage one destroy him with grief and self-doubt  not forever, but for a day, a week, or a month, depending on the thickness of his skin. But I do read reviews. I dont publish enough books not to, if you see what I mean. So far, fingers crossed for the future, those for my new anthology, The Country Formerly Known as Great Britain, have been kind and (I like to think) perceptive, and both those words certainly apply to the one in this newspaper by Sunanda K. Datta-Ray (October 30, 2009). It began with a sentence, however, that made my heart sink  that I first became known in India for a scurrilous comment on Indira Gandhi when it was open season on her.        
	I hesitate over what Im about to write next. The scurrilous comment is a sleeping dog Ive been happy to let lie for more than thirty years, but now that Mr Datta-Ray has prodded the dog  and the dog, as it were, has opened an eye  I might as well go further and get the beast to its feet.        
	It happened in early March, 1977. Mrs Gandhi had ended the Emergency a few weeks before and called an election. Id been in India since December  my first visit  and my paper, then the Sunday Times, asked me to write a big piece on Sanjay Gandhi, a controversial figure (no more need be said) whose essential role in the Emergency now continued into his mothers election campaign.              
	I followed Sanjay to Lucknow and then Amethi but couldnt get an interview. I talked to his associates  names such as Ambika Soni and Roxana Sultana come to mind. A strong element in the speculation about him concerned the hold he seemed to have over his mother. Why had she alienated so many of her allies by indulging and promoting him? Now we know a simple answer: that she trusted him as much as she distrusted almost everyone else. But that was too straightforward an explanation at a time when India was emerging from media censorship and gossip was a substitute for news. At the Emergencys start, an American reporter had published the rumour that Sanjay had slapped his mother across the face at a dinner party. Blackmail was sometimes mentioned  people said that Mrs Gandhi had conceded so much power to Sanjay because he had something on her. Then at a party in Delhi, a well-known film critic told me, You know what theyre saying in Calcutta? Theyre saying the mother is sleeping with the son!        
	When I came to write the piece I was, if anything, rather too fair to Sanjay, but I included a paragraph about the speculation, which seemed to me just as fantastical then as it does now. I mentioned the rumours that flew around Delhi parties and added the fateful words, the most bizarre and ludicrous of which are blackmail and incest. The Sunday Times published the piece with these words unchanged, and then republished the same words a week later to emphasize how obvious it was that neither the newspaper nor I gave any credence to the stories (thereby adding, as an editor on the paper later remarked, incest to injury).        
	All hell broke loose. The Indian high commissioner in London went to see the Foreign Office, the Foreign Office spoke to the Sunday Times, the Sunday Times obeyed the FOs advice and got me out of the country and on a plane to Karachi. Mrs Gandhi instructed London solicitors with a view to libel proceedings.        
	Let me be plain about this: I was an idiot. Id been a journalist long enough to know that a favourite technique of spreading a rumour is to deny it  and that denial of a damaging rumour, while at the same time publishing it, would be a fragile defence in the English libel courts. My forgetfulness of these facts came, I think, from a combination of circumstances. I was working for the first time in a culture different to my own; incest was then a buried subject in Britain and its reality not often acknowledged; and the sheer absurdity of the tittle-tattle seemed noteworthy, and in some way needed illustration.        
	Very few people, I have to say, believed in this explanation. In Pakistan, I was welcomed quite wrongly as someone who had spoken out daringly against Mrs Gandhis regime. Even when I returned to India the next year I discovered that what people remembered was that one word rather than the context of its dismissal. A couple of years later, when I got married by a magistrate in Delhi, I had to read the marriage forms long list of forbidden relationships before I could sign the certificate. Perhaps only then did I realize that what to me had seemed remote (and therefore fanciful) resonated differently among others.        
	I wrote an apology to Mrs Gandhi and later she was gracious enough to allow me an interview. Eventually, mercifully, people forgot. Mrs Gandhi, Sanjay, the Indian film critic: all are dead. As for Mr Datta-Ray, I make only two small points. One, it wasnt yet open season on Mrs Gandhi when the piece appeared. That came later, after she lost the election and the Shah Commission got going. Two, my comment was scurrilously interpreted rather than scurrilously intended. But in not anticipating its likely reception I have, of course, only myself to blame.              
	**************              
	According to its promoters, this months Copenhagen summit on climate change is our last chance to save humanity from a horrible future. I dont know if I quite believe this  last chances have a way of repeating themselves, like Rolling Stones tours  but it promotes a sense of urgency thats very necessary if you believe (as I do) that man-made global warming is one of the two biggest challenges humankind has ever faced, with unrestricted and unsustainable economic growth as its partner. If the two go uncurbed they seem certain to destroy or at the very least ruin the lives of our childrens children.        
	In terms of human history, the prognosis has arrived at lightning speed. Only twenty years ago in Dhaka, at a conference on sea-level rise, most of the Bengali audience left after the morning coffee and cake, which meant that only a very few of us were still there when the climatologist unveiled his ominous maps. That kind of sangfroid (Barisal under the sea? Another piece of cake?) is no longer so common, but it would be a mistake to think that even in Europe, where environmentalism makes most noise, the science that links carbon emissions to melting ice caps is generally accepted. According to recent opinion polls, more than half the British population either disbelieves in climate change completely or accepts that it exists but rejects human behaviour as the cause. At the intellectual heart of this denial is a small group of people, most visible as a few journalists published in the Mail and Telegraph newspapers, which was out to prove a conspiracy on the part of thousands of climate scientists, politicians, and the alarmist liberal elites of almost every country in the world (a group that would include the BBC).              
	For Peter Hitchens, writing in the Mail on Sunday, Copenhagen will be a festival of panic and exaggerated woe and yet another staging post in a frenzy that could end by bankrupting the West and leaving us sitting in the cold and the dark whistling for a wind to power our dead computers  while China and India surge on to growth and prosperity because they have had the sense to ignore the whole stupid thing.        
	Setting the many good scientific arguments aside, the main problem for the conspiracy theory of climate change is the lack of a motive. Why would so many governments want for no good reason to bankrupt their countries or introduce unpopular carbon taxes? Whats in it for them? The best answer Hitchens and his allies can supply is that they and most of the worlds scientific academy are in the grip of a semi-religious hysteria. Utterly unconvincing  but many people in Britain like to hear this kind of opinion because it gives them the perfect excuse to carry on as before. Anything, anything, to ignore the fear in our guts.

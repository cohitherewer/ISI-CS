The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | garden of neglect
                                                                                                                 GARDEN OF NEGLECT                                                          
	There is something juvenile about tokenism. When such tokenism assumes the proportions of a public and political gesture, it becomes annoying. The decision to rename the Indian Botanic Garden after Jagadish Chandra Bose falls in this category. The tokenism here is of two different kinds. The Indian Botanic Garden has been the victim of official neglect for decades. The rich botanical heritage there has not been tended to and properly recorded. The Roxburgh Building in the Garden is in a derelict state and many of the documents that were once kept there have been lost. Some of the documents and illustrations have been kept in the Central National Herbarium, and it is only recently that a project has been undertaken to properly catalogue the illustrations and documents that remain. Any visitor to the Garden can see the neglect from which it suffers: there is no reason to even compare it with the Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew in London. It is not just their geographical locations and the adjective, royal, that separate them. The difference is between attention and neglect. Renaming the Garden after an eminent Indian scientist will in no way improve matters.        
	The choice of Bose is also another feat of tokenism. Bose is the pioneer of modern science in India. In the 1890s, he did pathbreaking work on electromagnetic waves; he was an outstanding botanist with many original contributions; he was also a master of experiments with simple and unsophisticated equipment. Scientists across the world have acknowledged Boses contribution, and have admitted that his researches were many years ahead of his time. His college in Cambridge, Christs, has recently honoured him. In India, however, he remains unsung. The government of India, from ignorance or otherwise, has chosen to remain indifferent to, or oblivious of, Boses many-faceted scientific achievements. Now a Central minister has decided to bestow on Bose the singular honour of having a garden named after him. This in no way affects Boses accomplishments. It only reveals the insouciant manner in which Indian officialdom shows its respect to real pioneers who brought international recognition to India and to Indians.        
	The issue is more important than the indifference shown to Bose and to the garden now named after him. Indian politicians have a propensity to rename buildings, spaces and streets that have perfectly acceptable names. They think that through this act of renaming they are making a political or ideological point. This is a meaningless exercise. No one in Calcutta refers to Chowringhee after Indias first prime minister. And no one in Delhi calls Connaught Circus after Rajiv Gandhi. Ministers would do far better by looking after monuments and spaces than by trying to seek cheap popularity by giving them new names.

	This is the ultimate in outsourcing! A young woman hired someone to thwart the demolition squads that were to descend on their year-old eatery in Beijing. Ten persons responded to her advertisement for a human nail  so called because the homes of those who resist demolition stick out like nails in a bulldozed neighbourhood. Of the four who were interviewed, a 48-year-old was chosen because of his USP  he was a former construction contractor himself. So now for 1,000 yuan and 2 per cent of the compensation, he stands on duty 24/7 outside the eatery, and plans to set off gas cylinders if nothing else stops the bulldozers.        
	Demolition squads have had to face Molotov cocktails and gasoline bottles from desperate home-owners, one of whom set herself on fire on the terrace of her home as the bulldozers wrecked it below. That incident, reported in the last column, has shaken the country because it was telecast on CCTV. Five law professors of Peking University have written an open letter to lawmakers, calling for the abolition or at least a review of the Housing Demolition and Relocation Management Regulation that allows the government to raze down private property.        
	One legislator declared that after the law protecting private property came into force in 2007, all demolitions by governments have been illegal. But, he added, provincial governments were unlikely to stop using the demolition regulation because they make money by selling the land to developers, leaving the latter to deal with protests. Its not only the poor who have to face bulldozers. Take the NRI couple, US green-card holders, who came down to Beijing when they heard that their ancestral home was on the block. The demolition squad dragged out the husbands paralysed mother and his wife, clad in pyjamas. The husband poured gasoline on himself, threatening to light up if they went any further. Go ahead, the squad told him.                
	Cruel practice        
	Today, his 81-year-old mother lies in one hospital; he lies in another with 10 per cent burns; his documents, jewellery gone, along with his home. The Beijing municipal government plans to demolish 50 villages inside the city next year to solve so-called security and health problems in these areas, reports the official China Daily. Its not simply a question of compensation. The NRI couple was offered three apartments and 640,000 yuan in exchange; but they didnt want to give up their childhood home built by their parents. The woman who hired a nail spent 600,000 yuan on the eatery which opened only last year; much of this came from selling the flat which her parents had bought for her. The restaurant contains the savings from two generations of my family, she said. Besides, she had a three-year contract with the landlord. But he shrugged off his responsibility, saying his land had been acquired by the government.        
	Theres also the cruelty of the demolishers, who belong to demolition companies hired by builders. Last month, in Yunnan, a 29-year-old man rushed to defend his fiances mother who was being slapped by the demolition men when she protested. He was beaten so badly that he died 15 days later. In March, a similar sight  demolition men slapping his wife  so enraged a 27-year-old villager that he stabbed one of the men to death. After a year in jail, he was given probation. His home, like all the others in his village, was being razed to build villas.        
	Where earlier, such incidents were only reported on the internet, of late, the official media have been highlighting them. China Dailys year-end list of Top ten real estate debacles, has five incidents of individual protests against demolition squads. The government too has responded. The Beijing professors who wrote the open letter were called for a meeting. But, as an edit in China Daily asks, will this be the end of the matter?

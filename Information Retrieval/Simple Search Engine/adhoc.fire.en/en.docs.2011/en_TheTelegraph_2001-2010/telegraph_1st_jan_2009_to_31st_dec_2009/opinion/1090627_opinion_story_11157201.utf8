The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Art amidst clutter
                                                                                                                 ART AMIDST CLUTTER                              Visual Arts      Soumitra Das                                                
	Some galleries (if they deserve that name) like Idiyas Gallery on Dover Road can give the public very wrong ideas about what a gallery should be like. To begin with, it is almost impossible to locate this gallery as it is a tiny cubicle next to a garage inside a gated house. It is meant to be open up to 7 pm, but more often than not, it closes after 6 pm.        
	The gallerist makes no attempt at displaying the paintings in any particular order. Many of them are displayed on the floor, so it is more of a dump than anything else. The current exhibition, with the pretentious title, Sensorial Realities (June 3-July 31), is a clutter of paintings picked up at random. So there is a Prakash Karmakar landscape and a Radha Krishna, which are apparently melting, and imitations of the paintings of this Howrah-based artist, one work by Aditya Basak and yet another Buddha by Sanatan Dinda with a 3D rose petal painted on the frame itself. Those who are in love with Subrata Gangopadhyayas belles with satiny skin will have a lot to drool over. The fruity ladies emerge from a jungle of flowers or explode into ras garba and a riot of colours. Chandrima Roys Ramani (picture), with her head covered, is the only painting that comes close to anything like art work.

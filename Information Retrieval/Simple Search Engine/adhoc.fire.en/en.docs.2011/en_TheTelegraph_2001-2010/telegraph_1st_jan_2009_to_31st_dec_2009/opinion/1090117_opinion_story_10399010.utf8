The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A city and its stories
                                                                                                                 A CITY AND ITS STORIES                              Uddalak Mukherjee      Visual Arts                                                
	The word, Calcutta, with an exclamation mark after it, forming the title of a photography exhibition, fills the mind with trepidation, especially if the photographer happens to be a visitor from abroad. People passing through have often succumbed to Calcuttas wily charms  its resilience and effervescence in the face of poverty and hardship  and used the camera to record them. The Irishman, T.P. Kiernan, whose show, Calcutta!, is going on at the Earthcare Books and Resource Centre (till January 25) is no different, although he possesses a different kind of sensibility.        
	Many of Kiernans 42 black and-white images explore themes such as poverty and exclusion, the absurd as well as wistful beauty, which are central to Calcuttas iconography.         
	But some engage for different reasons. Balance between the objects is crucial here, and this is evident in the photograph showing a man about to step out on to the street. Above him, is a beautiful, tapering balustrade, which indicates the direction he will take. There is opposition too, between life and death, motion and stillness, in the rickshaw and the fish (picture). Finally, there are people and their unknown stories. A scruffy girl sits beside a half-sliced gourd, the fullness of the vegetable cruelly mocking the emaciated frame of the girl.

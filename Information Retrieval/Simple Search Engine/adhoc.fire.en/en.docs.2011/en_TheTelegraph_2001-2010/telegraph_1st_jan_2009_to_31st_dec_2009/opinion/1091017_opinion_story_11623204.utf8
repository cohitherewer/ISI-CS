	A school for percussionists, Rhythm celebrated its 28th year at the Birla Academy of Arts amp; Culture on October 10-11 with a programme of classical music. The first artist was the tabla-player, Sujit Saha, the founder of Rhythm. Ably accompanied by Sanatan Goswami on the harmonium, he demonstrated several kaaydas (self-composed, as well as one from the Farrukhabad gharana and one picked up from Keramatullah Khan), relas (from Kanai Dutta and Jnanprakash Ghosh), and wrapped up with a skilfully-executed chakradhaar and dhamaar. But it was the taal-bichitra presented by his students that got Saha bigger accolades. It was heartwarming to find participants only slightly bigger than their tabla not in the least intimidated by it. However, the Western drum-kit stood out as superfluous in an ensemble of Indian percussion instruments.        
	Of the four other performers, flautist Chetan Joshi impressed with his tonic variations and alankars. He played Behag and a drut in Yaman. Tarun Chakrabortys Puriya Kalyan on the violin was a good choice. Subhra Guha and Dinanath Mishra were both more at ease with thumris than khayals. But it seems unfair to pick faults where the artists have no time to do a proper exposition of a raga.

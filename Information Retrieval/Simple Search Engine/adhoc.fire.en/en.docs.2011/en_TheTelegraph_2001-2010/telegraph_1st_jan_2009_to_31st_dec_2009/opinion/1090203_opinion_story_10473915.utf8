                                                                                                                 TAKE CARE                                                    
	Middle America, as well as down-and-out America, are infuriated. Together with tens of thousands of jobs every day, trillions of dollars in health insurance, home equity, retirement and college savings are turning into nothing in front of their eyes in what is beginning to look like a grim recurrence of the Great Depression of the Thirties. Yet, in another sphere of the economy that is neither middle nor down-and- out, these zero-laden figures have just made a return  not as devastating loss but as fantastical gain. Wall Street bankers have decided to give themselves bonuses amounting to almost $20 billion. This is the sixth-largest haul on record, according to a report released by the New York State comptroller. This was in spite of the governments $700 bail-out programme, largely taxpayers money, of which many of the banks and investment firms will be, or already have been, the beneficiaries. The new president of the United States of America also sounds just as infuriated. He has publicly chastised this greed as shameful and irresponsible, resonating exactly, and with his usual facility, with the general outrage.        
	Yet, this orgy of bonus-giving could not have happened behind the governments back. Most Wall Street boards have in them representatives from the government who could have directly intervened when these prodigal sums of money were being thought up and handed out. Channels do exist through which the government can legitimately enforce restraint, transparency and accountability upon the Wall Street bingers without the president having to take it upon himself to scold and control. With his vision of a Strong America made out of a strong middle class, and his new taskforce to help middle-class working families, Barack Obamas admonishment risks charges of populism, of tapping into popular sentiments a little too rousingly in order to consolidate his standing among certain constituencies. It is perfectly natural that the point of the bail-out should be to revive the financial system so that credit gets flowing again into businesses (including small businesses) and working families, without bankers and CEOs draining funds that should advance this recovery. But instead of actively stoking popular emotions, this might be better ensured by mobilizing more firmly the checks and balances that already exist in his administration.

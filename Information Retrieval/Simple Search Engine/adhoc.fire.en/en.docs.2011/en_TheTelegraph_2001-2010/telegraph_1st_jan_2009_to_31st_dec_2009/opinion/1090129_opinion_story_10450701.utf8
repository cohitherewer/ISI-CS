	Fashioning an effective response to the terrorist assault on Mumbai poses one of the most complex problems facing India today. Its complexity arises from the fact that Pakistan is both a victim and protector of terrorism. Its attitudes towards terrorism reflect deep divisions and ambiguities.         
	On the one hand, terrorism today poses an existential threat to Pakistan. State control over the tribal borderlands with Afghanistan was always tenuous; today, control is virtually non-existent. Terrorist incidents are almost a daily occurrence in Pakistani cities. Sunni extremists launch terrorist attacks against the Shia minority and are paid back in the same coin. Pakistani leaders face regular death threats. Musharraf has survived more than one attempt on his life; Benazir Bhutto was not so lucky. There is growing realization among the public that terrorism poses a mortal threat to Pakistan.        
	On the other hand, influential elements, including many army and ISI officers, continue to maintain clandestine links with some terrorist groups, which they view as instruments of State policy vis--vis India and Afghanistan. These contradictions have their roots in the Faustian deal struck by Zia-ul-Haq and Washington with Islamic militants during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.              
	In exchange for several billion dollars in military and economic aid, as well as an implicit understanding that Washington would turn a blind eye to Pakistans nuclear weapon programme, Zia agreed to cooperate with the CIA in launching a massive clandestine operation against the Soviet forces, employing a multi-national mujahedin force. Both Washington and Islamabad were later to pay a heavy price for creating this Frankenstein. Al Qaida was born in Afghanistan.        
	With the end of the Cold War, sharp differences arose between American and Pakistani views on Islamic militancy. The United States of America now recognized them as terrorists posing a threat to global security. Pakistan, on the other hand, turned to the militants to promote its objectives of seizing control of Kashmir and gaining strategic depth in Afghanistan by setting up a client regime in Kabul. In 1993, Washington placed Pakistan on its watch list of states sponsoring terrorism.         
	After 9/11, the US declared a war on terror. Washington made it clear to Islamabad that in this conflict, Pakistan must choose between the roles of an ally or an enemy. Not without agonizing, General Musharraf declared himself an ally. At the same time, however, Islamabad sought to secretly shelter the terrorist groups it had nurtured for operations against India, such as the Lashkar-e-Toiba.        
	A number of factors have contributed to a certain limited evolution in Pakistani attitudes. These include the collapse of the Kashmir insurgency, the rising threat to the Pakistani state and society posed by Islamic militants and public outrage over mounting violence, apart from international pressure on Islamabad. However, despite these powerful compulsions, Pakistani agencies or officials continue to maintain shadowy connections with terrorist groups. Thus Washington discovered last year that operational plans shared with Islamabad were being leaked to the militants. It therefore decided to authorize US forces to launch strikes against terrorist groups operating on Pakistani soil, without prior information to Islamabad.        
	How should we respond to terrorist strikes launched by Pakistan-based militants? We have a number of options. Unfortunately, none of these is very satisfactory. A military response would be both ineffective and counter-productive. An air or missile strike cannot destroy significant terrorist assets, since training camps, etc, will already have been evacuated. Moreover, military action will inevitably cause collateral damage involving innocent lives and property. It will thus inflame anti-Indian passions, weaken moderate elements and engender wider support for the extremists. We would be playing into the hands of the terrorists if we were to exercise the military option. New Delhi has rightly ruled out this response.        
	Demands have been raised for approaching donors to cut off economic and military aid to Pakistan. Such approaches are unlikely to yield results. The principal donors  the US, Saudi Arabia and China  have important stakes in Pakistan that they are unlikely to jeopardize for the sake of accommodating India. Even the US, by far the most sympathetic of the trio, cannot be expected to take steps that are certain to disrupt its alliance with Pakistan in the operations against al Qaida and are likely to cause severe damage to the already fragile Pakistani state structure. The US will employ the aid lever only in connection with anti-militant operations in the Afghanistan-Pakistan borderlands. The most that we can realistically expect Washington to do for us is to limit its military aid to Pakistan to weapons that are essential for anti-insurgency operations in Pakistans western front and to refrain from supplying items intended primarily for offensive action against India.        
	The home minister, P. Chidambaram, has hinted at possible suspension of trade and cultural ties with Pakistan. This option will be entirely counter-productive. Like the military option, it would only strengthen the hostile elements in Pakistan that provide support and recruits for the terrorists. Economic interdependence, cultural interaction and freer movement of people across the border promote peace and goodwill. They help to strengthen the large section of the Pakistani population that seeks peace and recognizes that terrorism is a threat to both countries.               
	At this point of time, the only practical option is to bring international pressure to bear on Islamabad to take meaningful measures against Pakistan-based perpetrators of the terrorist attacks in India. Pakistan should be strongly urged to follow up on the leads provided by India in order to ensure that the guilty are brought to justice. As a result of Indias diplomatic initiatives, the UN security council has adopted a resolution outlawing the Jamaat-ud-Dawa. Pakistan has also announced  belatedly  some initial steps, including the detention of a number of individuals.         
	Islamabads previous record provides no ground for optimism regarding either the adequacy, or even the permanence, of its actions, and one can only hope against hope that the results will be more substantial on this occasion. While approaching a number of other influential countries, New Delhi has rightly paid special attention to the US, since no other power exercises the same influence in Islamabad. Nevertheless, as we noted earlier, we can rely on Washington only up to a certain point. We should clearly understand that the US will not pull all our chestnuts out of the Pakistani fire.         
	We must face the hard reality that none of the options currently available to us is likely to produce sufficient results. We, therefore, need to build up new capabilities. In the final analysis, if our dmarches with Islamabad, combined with international persuasion, fail to bring the guilty to justice, we shall have to consider ways of bringing justice to the guilty. We must build up assets that would enable us to neutralize the sinister ringleaders of the terrorist outfits on Pakistani soil.         
	Needless to say, such measures are justified only in extreme cases and they must satisfy rigorous requirements. Great care should be taken to ensure that the targets are guilty of heinous terrorist crimes beyond reasonable doubt. Significant collateral damage must be avoided in order to ensure that there are no innocent victims. There should be no proof of official involvement and it should be possible for our authorities to plausibly deny any connection.         
	We need to carefully study the procedures and methods employed by other democracies, such as the US and Israel, in conducting such covert operations. Prudence dictates that we build up a capacity for covert retaliation against terrorists operating from across our borders.

	 Section 45 of the Transfer of Property Act provides that when property is acquired under joint names and the payment is made from separate funds of the purchasers, their share in such property shall be appor-tioned accordingly. A property was bought under the joint names of a husband and wife. But the money was paid from the sale proceeds of the wifes ancestral property. The Family Court maintained that she held 50 per cent rights to the property. When the wife appealed to the Kerala High Court, it held that although the money was from one fund and not from separate funds the principles of fairness and justice underlying Section 45 should apply. Declaring that the wife was the absolute owner, the court said that the husbands name was included in view of the social perception of the weaker position of women.

	Duly compensated        
	 A road worker retired at the age of 60. It was later found that under a government order his retirement age was 58 years. The authorities initiated proceedings against him for recovery of the excess amount that had been paid to him. The Madras High Court held that a recovery could be ordered if the employee knew that the payment received was in excess. In this case the excess payment was not due to any misrepresentation on the part of the employee but due to a bona fide mistake by the authorities. In fact, during the said period, the employee had worked and earned his wages. Therefore, the question of recovery of excess payment did not arise. (K.

	Fair award        
	 The wife of a record clerk at the Public Works Department underwent a surgery in 1996. The clerk claimed medical reimbursement for it. When he did not get it despite several representations, he filed a writ petition in the Madras High Court. The court held that the right to life was a fundamental right. It also included the right to health and the government had a constitutional obligation to provide health facilities. The high court directed reimbursement with immediate effect plus 12 per cent interest from the date of the first representation till the date of payment. (A.

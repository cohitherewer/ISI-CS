	Q: My mother who was a postal family pensioner died on 27th July, 2009. Being her sole heir I applied for her pension for the period 1st-27th July, 2009, 60 per cent arrears as per the 6th Pay Commission till 27th July, 2009 and old age pensioners allowance (additional quantum of family pension as per the Sixth Pay Commission). Till date I have received no response from the senior postmaster of Barrackpore. What should I do?   
	Mohan Lal Verma, Barrackpore  
	A: You could send the postmaster a written notice by registered post with A/D, stating the aforesaid facts   and wait for a reply. If there is no response or the re  sponse is in the negative, then, depending on the rea  sons given by him, you could file a writ application be  fore the Calcutta High Court against the post office and   concerned departments, praying for an order to release   the pension arrears.																														  
	Q:I am a savings account holder of United Bank of India, Thakurpukur branch, Calcutta. I am an 80-year-old pensioner. My income being non-taxable, I submitted form 15H against term deposits, duly received by the bank. In June I noticed that on March 30, 2009, my passbook showed an entry of Rs 194 as opposed to the Rs 1206 that was due as quarterly interest on one of my investments. On enquiry I was told that the remaining Rs 1021 had been taken as tax deducted at source (TDS). But the bank could not indicate any error or lapse on my part that might have caused the alleged deduction. The bank also told me that the deducted amount had been transferred to the central government fund and hence no refund was possible. Even so, I applied to the bank, claiming immediate refund of the amount. But I have not received any refund or response so far. What should I do?        
	Amulya Ratan Giri,Calcutta  
	A: Since the Bank has already transferred the de  ducted amount to the central government you can do   little but wait and collect the TDS certificate and claim   the refund from the government. However, since the   TDS had been deducted by the bank because of a   lapse on their part, you could send the bank a legal no  tice, claiming compensation for their negligence and   deficiency of service.

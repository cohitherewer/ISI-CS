	Calcuttans routinely find themselves trapped in nightmares that in other parts of the civilized world used to happen more than two centuries ago. The manner in which a speeding minibus killed and critically injured many on Saturday would appear unreal to most people. Yet, a number of clearly identifiable, and avoidable, causes are behind this terrible accident. All of them involve the flouting of rules and systemic inefficiency, sloth and criminal negligence. First, the bus was disregarding the speed limit (it probably did not have the mandatory speed governor fitted in it). Then it was trying to overtake another bus on a flyover, which is against traffic rules, and doing so from the wrong side. Its fitness certificate had expired as well, as with most other buses with bad tyres and faulty breaks that repeatedly cause fatal accidents on Calcuttas roads. Such negligence and recklessness are caused, in turn, by the administrations unwillingness to punish errant drivers using existing laws. It is pressure from Citu, the labour arm of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), that stops the police from using harsher laws against the drivers. This, together with an archaic system of payment for drivers and conductors, fosters inhuman competitiveness among buses on the roads.         
	None of this is new. Everybody, from the bus-owners to ministers and the chief minister, knows about these connected factors that kill people every day in Calcutta. Besides, when the accident happened, the police kiosk near the site had nobody in it, and the government and railway hospitals treating the casualties were severely under-staffed. Hours after the accident, there were no casualty lists put up by them, making the situation doubly traumatic for the families of the dead and injured. Behind an incident like this, there is a chain of culpability that involves every level of the transport network, administration and political leadership. Calcuttas nightmares are the handiwork of an entire system of criminal indifference.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Saga of silence
                                                                                                                 SAGA OF SILENCE                                                                  
	Home By Marilynne Robinson, Virago, Rs 750         
	Dear unwary reader, if you were reading Marilynne Robinson for the first time, please do not bemusedly stop only a few pages into the book to ask yourself about the slowly unfolding work. Later, too, you might find yourself asking, why is everyone so very polite to each other? There is none of the sullen silence, the vicious revengefulness, and the shrieking accusations that crowded Indian families are familiar with.         
	But then, this is Gilead country  a forgotten parish town somewhere in central America. It is sometime in the 1950s, a time of imminent and drastic change, though not obviously so for the three members of the Boughton family who find themselves together at the family home in Gilead. There is the Reverend Robert Boughton, retired and aging Presbyterian preacher, his youngest daughter, Glory, and the family black sheep and prodigal son, Jack. A small setting, but a novel huge in its humanity, searing in its wisdom, as anyone familiar with Marilynne Robinson would know.         
	In Housekeeping, a strange friendship grew between a dreamy aunt and her two orphaned nieces. In Gilead, it is Robert Boughtons friend, the Congregationalist preacher, John Ames, who wishes to tell the story of his life to his young son, born after a late marriage. But Amess narrative is spoilt by the arrival of Jack Boughton. While Jacks return and his friendship with Amess much younger wife, Lila, cause the older man much unease, the effect of his return on Glory and her ailing old father makes up the subject of Home.         
	No one knows why Jack returns. Nor does he return on the day he promised. When he does turn up, he appears at the kitchen door, through which everyone who belonged would always enter. And yet Glory knows Jack has never felt at home. Their father remains troubled by this knowledge. As a preacher, who has lived by strict theological principles, he blames himself for not being a good enough father to Jack. Jack, on his part, is nervous, and tries to fit in. He does so hesitantly. But there remains a mystery about him, for all of Glorys initial stumbling attempts to understand him.         
	For Jack is the brother who left home 20 years ago after causing them considerable embarrassment. He also nurses an old sorrow  the death of a young, neglected daughter. Jack has come in search of redemption but is not sure how to go about it. It is to Glory he turns for help, in a somewhat gruff fashion. They are twin souls caught in their own sorrows, trying at the same time to be kind to their father. And to the house as well, so full of memories of the other Boughtons  the mother who has died, the many brothers and sisters who have left, who have always longed to leave and who only occasionally return. So, in a fashion, Jack takes it on himself to restore the house and the old car. Glory watches him; they have stilted conversations in the beginning, peppered with embarrassed laughter, and a careful desire not to hurt their father who wants them to get along.         
	As the days pass in an unmoving summer, the relationship between the brother and the sister, who had been a kid when he had left them, changes. This change is described in as beautiful and as heartbreaking a manner as only Robinson can. There is a point in every Robinson novel  and this happens fairly early  when the reader is reeled in suddenly, and in Home this happens when Glory understands the quality of silence that pervades every corner of the Boughton house. The silence that stretches between the brother and the sister, each trying to love, to understand, and hoping to be loved by, the other. The silence in the older mans hesitant movements, the way he observes his two children, the silence that underscores his dilemma as he tries hard to understand and forgive his son, who does not to him seem contrite enough. Then there are Jacks silences too. His hesitation, his uncertainty, his gentleness, the way he moves around the house doing his chores, his unexpected disappearances. Yet no one will ask him why he has chosen to return. Where was he all these 20 years when the family waited for him? They will not ask him hoping he will tell in his own time.         
	Theological doctrines rub themselves in here, not in too obtrusive a manner. But this is a novel set in the late 1950s, when truths long accepted are being overturned and the religious faith in gods goodness is a vital crutch, as it proves for Boughton and Glory. As for Jack, he strives to understand god but isnt sure if he will ever be forgiven or accepted. He can only yearn to be redeemed. Perhaps it is to Glory that this act of redemption reveals itself  the young Robert Boughton who turns up with his mother, Della, one morning. Della, to whom all of Jacks letters have come back unopened.        
	Home, then, is a novel of infinite grace; a tale of spiritual redemption and how it occurs in unexpected ways. Jack Boughton remains seemingly unreformed in the end, yet there is his wryness, his gentleness with his father, concern for his sister, his silence about himself, the affection he chooses to shower on a neighbours young son.         
	That Home won the Orange Prize this year will make it accessible to many. The novel insists you have a personal relationship with the characters. The hesitating courage Albert Camus Raymond Rambert displays as the plague strikes havoc in Oran; Tridips unmentioned, futile death in the riots of East Pakistan revealed to the narrator of The Shadow Lines; and now the image of Jack Boughton, walking out of the screen door, haggard and thin in his fathers old suit, lingers with us as well.

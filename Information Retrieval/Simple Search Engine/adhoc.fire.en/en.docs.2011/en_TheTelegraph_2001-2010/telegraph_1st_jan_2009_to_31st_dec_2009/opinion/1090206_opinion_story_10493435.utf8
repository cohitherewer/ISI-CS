The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | The Obama wannabes
                                                                                                                 THE OBAMA WANNABES                          - The US president had a message as well as a context        Swapan Dasgupta                                                  
	These are disconcerting times for the minuscule number of self-professed rightwing reactionaries  those who idolize Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, think that George W. Bush will be vindicated by history and dont believe that Narendra Modis rightful place is in the Gulag. The hype surrounding President Barack Obamas election and inauguration has cast a global shadow over sobriety and realism. A world devastated by what Vladimir Putin referred to in Davos last week as the perfect storm seems to have found solace in an energetic euphoria last witnessed during the youthful turbulence of 1968 or, more appropriately, the Beatles-mania of the mid-1960s.        
	A few examples will illustrate the magnitude of the epidemic. Commenting in The Spectator on the BBC coverage of Obamas coronation, the columnist, Lidle Britain, wrote, with only a sprinkle of exaggeration: Its a sort of cross between Princess Dianas funeral and a Live Aid concert, except happier and the black people arent covered in flies. At a television programme for Indias Republic Day, the panel (which included me, the token right-winger) was incessantly harangued by the youthful audience drawn from management institutes around Delhi with the question: Why cant we have an Obama? Ironically, I was asked the same question by some volunteers at L.K. Advanis sleek campaign office in Delhi  a question that left me convinced that this was the end of civilization as I know it.              
	Nor has this adoration of the new messiah left the literati unmoved. At the Jaipur Literary Festival last month, there were hard-nosed publishers who confessed to shedding tears over Obamas inaugural speech. Since, by Obamas exacting standards, the speech wasnt all that memorable, it may be safely assumed that it was the inspirational idea of Obama, rather than what he actually said, that was the clincher. Even the venerable historian, Simon Schama, who I expected to be economic with his emotions, seemed to imply that the election of the 44th American president was an act of collective penance by the Western world.        
	Following Mao Zedongs judgment on the French Revolution, it may be far too early to assess the impact of Obama on the collective mentality of the West-inspired world. It is possible that Obama will indeed be the symbol of an American renewal, which will show up the late Samuel Huntington as a false prophet. On the other hand, it is equally possible that the Obama-sceptics in Indias strategic community will have the last laugh, and cynical realpolitik will re-assert itself. It all depends on when the real Obama finally stands up and discards his campaign baggage.        
	The global discovery of the real Obama is unlikely to happen before millions of voters queue up in the summer to elect Indias next government. As such, whether we like it or not, the United States of Americas experiment with political change is certain to influence the strategic thinking of the political parties. The Opposition is likely to invoke change as a mantra and the Congress (the party has proclaimed that there will be no national United Progressive Alliance for the election) is likely to counter it by latching on to the youthful credentials of its undeclared heir-apparent. To arrest any possible anti-incumbency groundswell, a generational shift will be projected as a sort of change-without-change.        
	The groundwork for a C-grade remake of the American presidential campaign is already underway. The attack on a pub in Mangalore by ideologically-driven hooligans has been painted as an assault on the visible symbols of bling modernity: the glitzy malls, the free mingling of the sexes, cheap booze and call centres. The inalienable right of young people, particularly women, to drink freely has been contrasted to the puritanical assumptions of those who profess Bharatiya sanskriti and parampara. Carefully-chosen photographs of Rahul Gandhi, dressed in smart casuals, holding up the bar (but sans the mandatory glass) have been used to send out a politico-lifestyle statement. The cool Gandhi and his equally cool band of young Congress members of parliament who flaunt busy-looking mobile phones and are networked on Facebook are subtly painted as the upholders of the Obama tradition in India. The young inheritors, ranging from Rahulbaba to Omar Abdullah, are made out to be Indias literal answer to Obamas smart power. They are also complemented by a new (but as yet invisible) breed of Congress activists, handpicked by either Rahul or his associates, who are young, educated and committed to good works.        
	If the Indian election is going to be determined on the strength of lifestyles and corresponds to the perceived yearnings of that amorphous mass that goes by the name of Young India, the non-Congress parties may as well be reconciled to sitting in opposition for the next five years. If the same spiel and imagery used by advertising agencies to sell mobile phones, clothes and pizzas to the under-40s can shape the political preferences of the target group, the younger Gandhi should be shoo-in for the top job. Obama-mania, the baba-log strategists calculate, will reproduce itself in India as an endorsement of Rahul.        
	Since it is hazardous to predict the preferences of a volatile electorate, it is inadvisable to sneer at the Congresss Track-2 strategy. There is a visible exasperation with the political class that may yet translate into success for a party that has promised to dole out 30 per cent of tickets to the young. It is also possible that a respect for Advanis lifetime achievement will not be accompanied by box-office success. Yet, a caveat may not be out of place.              
	The success of Obama didnt owe exclusively to his relative youth and his outsider status. His appeal wasnt vacuously charismatic; it was held up by an ethos that was completely at variance with what the Bush order represented. Obama also articulated the compassionate, the multi-culturalist and the angry impulses of a section that was alienated from the power structure. It would be worth considering the possibility of Obama being such a monumental hit if he had been burdened by eight years of an incumbent Democratic president. This is not to deny the innovative campaign of a highly intelligent and focussed individual but to remind simple deductionists that Obama had both a message and a context.        
	It may be needlessly harsh but I am yet to come across a Rahul intervention that goes beyond the anecdotal and the pedestrian. At a time when the UPA government is flooding the TV channels with images of happy, smiling villagers relishing the brave new world of Bharat Nirman, how is Rahul connecting with those who are confronted by the ugly realities of high interest rates, job losses, shrinking opportunities and the steady erosion of a dream centred on a double-digit gross domestic product growth? Dining with a poor Dalit woman and taking David Miliband on a poverty tour of Amethi show the familys noblesse oblige; it has nothing to do with competence. How has Rahul demonstrated that his youthful impulses equip him to confront the monumental challenges to Indias national security? On the two issues that challenge India the most  the economy and security  the designated heirs thinking is virginal.        
	Obamas final election in November was preceded by a year of intensive campaigning and public scrutiny. The covert Rahul-for-PM campaign seems to have been transfixed by the outward image of Obama. To American voters, Obama was all about an idyllic change; to the wannabe Obamas in Delhi, it is all about his facility with the BlackBerry.

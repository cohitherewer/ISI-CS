                                                                                                                 UPS AND DOWNS                                                    
	Indian banks are normal in one respect  they pay their depositors interest rates below the central banks reference rates. This is as it should be, since the Reserve Bank of India is there to lend to banks in exceptional situations. A central bank concerned about the possibility of inflation or excessive demand would raise its reference rates, and signal that its assistance would be costly should banks need it; and without further ado, banks would raise their lending rates. Recently, however, the RBI has reduced its reference rates in the expectation that banks would reduce their lending rates. Banks have disappointed it; bank loans have not become cheaper. This is despite the fact that since last September, banks have been leaving money with the RBI. There has not been enough demand for their loans at the rates they charge; rather than reduce the rates, banks have chosen to lend to the RBI at low rates that have been getting lower. This is a commonsense way of saying what bankers would put more elaborately  that the transmission mechanism of the RBIs policy rates is not working.        
	Banks have many kinds of customers, and charge them varying rates. The governments favourites, such as farmers and small industrialists, pay specially low rates; banks make up by charging others more. So when the RBI wanted to know how well the transmission mechanism was working, it made every bank introduce what it calls a benchmark prime lending rate. Like most of the RBIs concepts, the name of this one was a mouthful, so it was shortened into BPLR. For the past eight years, all banks have been reporting their BPLRs to the RBI, which has been watching them to see how well banks were picking up its signals. Its general conclusion was that banks were being obedient and well-behaved. But then, the current slowdown arrived, and many complained to the RBI that banks had ignored its wish to bring interest rates down. Then it realized that banks have, all these years, been pulling the wool over its eyes: that they were giving many loans below the BPLR, and that their average lending rate was quite unrelated to their published BPLRs. It has now appointed a committee to find out why this is so  briefly, why its policies are so ineffective.        
	This committee will come up with a new benchmark  either a mean or a median for each bank. Banks will then be asked to report the new benchmark, and all will be quiet on the western front for another eight years. But the problem lies with the fact that banks do not respond rationally to market conditions. They are averse to taking risks, and competition does not force their rates down to a level where they would have to seek customers. The problem lies in government ownership of banks, not in their covert disobedience.

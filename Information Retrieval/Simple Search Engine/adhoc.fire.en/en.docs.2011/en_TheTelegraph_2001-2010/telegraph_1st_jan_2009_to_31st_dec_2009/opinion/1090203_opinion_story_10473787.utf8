                                                                                                                 LENDING FURTHER RICHNESS TO THE PICTURE                                  Do Indian writers in English have access to a secret that eludes others? asks Alexander McCall Smith                                          From top: Vikram Seth, Anita Desai, Vikram Chandra and Rohinton Mistry				                                 
	Anybody in the United Kingdom or the United States who is interested in fiction will be aware of the towering importance of Indian writers or writers of the Indian diaspora who, writing in English, have put their stamp on late 20-century and early 21st-century fiction. I need no more than mention a few of these  Vikram Seth, Vikram Chandra, Rohinton Mistry, Anita Desai  the list is a very long one. It is now true, I think, that readers in, say, the UK, will know that when a novel is published in London by an Indian writer then that is likely to be a very good read. And what is more important is the fact that such a novel is likely to be beautifully written.         
	These thoughts lead to a very interesting question: why are Indian writers, or writers who, although they may live elsewhere, are the products of an Indian background, winning all the prizes? Do Indian novelists have access to a secret that eludes others? In the course of answering this question, I would like to talk about a particular writer whose work I have long admired and whose influence has been considerable on my own writing.        
	But first, a preliminary matter, and that is the question of whether it makes sense to place writers in broad categories, and in particular, to place them in national categories. This tendency to pigeonhole authors is something that often irritates authors themselves. Now, the classification of fiction in genre terms can be very arbitrary, and indeed very limiting. People talk about literary fiction as a category  this is meant to embrace those novels which are marked by some higher purpose and deal with serious subjects. So there is literary fiction  and then there is the rest. In this view, crime fiction is more or less automatically excluded from the category of literary fiction. This means that novels that deal with crime can never be considered to have literary merit  which is complete nonsense. Dickens wrote about crime  did he not?  as did Dostoevsky. And what about Patricia Highsmith, whose novels are perfect studies of the psychopathic personality? Those, surely, are highly intelligent and well-wrought novels which just happen to focus on criminal activities.        
	So putting authors and their books into genres or categories is a difficult and controversial business. And yet some degree of categorization is necessary in fiction if we are to understand books in their context. A broad category, such as the 19th-century novel, is useful because it enables us to understand the novel in its historical setting. This allows us to understand some of the suppositions that the author accepted, which may explain why the story takes the form it does. In order to understand Jane Austen, for example, it is helpful to know that the reason she was so preoccupied with issues of marriage, including its property ramifications, is that this was a major preoccupation of the society in which she lived. Authors all come from somewhere and at a particular time: our understanding of their work is enhanced by our knowledge of the category from which they come.        
	And so it is with national categories. These can be helpful  particularly where an author works within a national tradition that affects his choice of literary form. That a particular author is writing within a particular tradition may affect his choice of meter if he is a poet. Or it may affect topic: in Greek and Roman literature, for example, there were strong traditions of generic composition. And the same could be said of Chinese poetry  the existence of numerous poems all on the same theme and all emanating from a particular time in China may be explained by the fact that these were written for poetry competitions.         
	To talk, then, of Indian writers writing in English as a category, is to risk being over-general, and the creating of the category may not tell us very much, just as to talk about American writers or British writers may be to say very little. At the same time, it seems to me that there are certain features that are quite frequently manifested in the striking and exceptional fiction that has come from the pen of Indian and Indian diaspora writers. What are these features?              
	I suppose that the best way of answering that question might be for me, as a writer, to say what I expect when I embark on a novel by such a writer. One of the most important things for me as a reader is writing style. I am one of those people who simply cannot persevere with a book if I judge it to be badly written.         
	I am usually struck by the beauty of the prose which Indian novelists writing in English tend to use. I am afraid that it is not uncommon now for novels written in English to use aggressively pedestrian English  a mechanistic, soulless prose that seems to have had all the beauty and subtlety extracted from it. I do not expect to find such prose in Indian fiction in English; I expect to find, and usually do, a clarity and euphony which remind me of how things used to be some decades ago, before prosody went out of fashion.         
	What is happening here? If the English language is coarsening in the mouths of those who use it in Britain and America, then why is it that those educated in India or coming from an Indian background are not showing a similar tendency? I have no answer for this, but I wonder whether one reason may not be an educational one. Is English grammar still taught in schools in India? I am told that it is. Do teachers still correct pupils in India when they write something that is grammatically incorrect? I suspect that they might, as they may well have avoided the remarkable situation in some schools in the UK, where teachers argue that they should not inhibit pupils wishing to express themselves in the language of the street. That is an ideological position of quite frightening implications: it suggests that the consensus which allows us to use language in such a way as to maximize the possibility of understanding each other has been abandoned. Language becomes subjective  something that you can use in whatever way suits you and without reference to agreed, standard rules.        
	The typical Indian novel published in the UK  if one can talk about such a thing  is written with attention to the requirements of clarity. The prose flows. I can think of many examples, but let me cite only one or two: the quite astonishing novel, Sacred Games, by Vikram Chandra. And of writers of the diaspora, I think of Rohinton Mistry, who now lives in Canada, and, of course, of the great V.S. Naipaul, whose early works such as Miguel Street or A House for Mr Biswas are delightful masterpieces.        
	Style is not the only thing that sets these novels aside  there is also something in the nature of the subject matter with which they deal. One of the reasons, I believe, why Indian novels have been so successful abroad, and particularly in Britain, is that people are hungering for the sort of subject with which many of these novels are concerned. And here we get to something rather interesting: many contemporary British novels seem inordinately concerned with dysfunction or with social pathology of one sort or another. The optimistic and the positive are less popular themes, and the idea of writing about the triumph of the individual over difficulty and adversity is not popular. By contrast, Indian novelists still do the family saga rather well, and they also do a very good account of family issues and marriage: subjects that do not feature prominently in the contemporary British novel. One might say, then, that there is a form of social engagement, an outward-looking attitude, which is a strong feature of the Indian novel and which explains why readers in Britain are so eager to devour them.        
	I would like to spend the brief time remaining to me in acknowledging a particular debt that I have to a remarkable novelist, R.K. Narayan.         
	One of the concomitants of being a novelist is that people often ask you about the influences on your work. There are some writers who might be able to claim  quite honestly  that they have not been influenced by anybody in particular, but for most of us there are literary influences that have played some role in our development as writers, even if the exact nature of that influence might be difficult to identify. Much literary influence is subtle: language lodges in the brain, laying down accretions of dimly-remembered turns of phrase, of cadences, or ideas or emotions not necessarily remembered but still there, somewhere in the unconscious. Literary influences are, I think, often of a subconscious nature  we may not even know that we are being influenced. This is something that I find rather interesting and upon which I should like to digress briefly.               
	Writers work in different ways. There are some writers who insist on a particular set of conditions before they can set pen to paper, or before they can type a word. They may need a particular sort of room, to face south, to have music from a particular composer playing in the background  the eccentric preferences of writers are many and egregious. Some writers need to make long and detailed notes before they write  they have chapter summaries setting out in detail what is to follow  then they sit down and follow a route that they have carefully mapped out in advance. Everything is thought through.        
	My modus scribendi is very different. I prepare only the briefest notes on what is to happen in a book  sometimes these notes are written on no more than the paper napkin provided by a restaurant somewhere; sometimes they are in the notebook that I try to remember to carry with me. But whatever their medium, they are not extensive notes  the content of the book comes to me once I sit down at the keyboard and begin to write. I then am in touch with my subconscious mind: I merely have to act as the amanuensis of that part of my mind where the story is unfolding  and that part, I think is the subconscious mind. That explains the phenomenon that many writers report of events occurring in the narrative that they had not anticipated. In one of my novels, Morality for Beautiful Girls, the third novel in the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency series, one of the characters, Mr J.L.B. Matekoni, suddenly develops the symptoms of depressive illness. Now I had not planned that this should happen  I had no idea that he would become ill in this way and I must say that I was extremely surprised when he suddenly started to behave in a way consistent with the brewing of depression.              
	What had happened, I assume, is that my subconscious mind had raised the question  a question not articulated in any way perceptible to my conscious mind: what would happen if Mr J.L.B. Matekoni were to become depressed? Where did this come from? Well, just as dreams can often be traced to the events of the preceding day, this occurrence of depression in a literary character can be attributed, I think, to the fact that I was at the time dealing with the affairs of a relative who had unfortunately become depressed. This obviously prompted my subconscious mind to write depression into the evolving story of Mr J.L.B. Matekoni. No surprises there  of course that must be the way it works. Writers write about the things that are preying on their minds. But I think that it is useful to be aware of this in the discussion of literary influences  lest we stress only those things that appear to be conscious influence rather than the more powerful tides of the subconscious mind. A Freudian would most certainly agree with that  psychoanalytical theories of literature would say that in his writing an author replays all the old familiar dramas and tensions. The male author looks for mother; he may disguise this quest in all sorts of ways, but that quest will always be there, working away in his subconscious, pointing him in a particular direction. I dont like to think about it too much, but my own case, I fear, is a gift for the adherent of psychoanalytical literary theory: here is an author who writes about a maternal African figure  a generous and loving woman who is reassuring in all her doings. Case closed, a Freudian may say.        
	That which one writes about is influenced by all sorts of factors, obvious and not so obvious, including, of course, the books one has read. It is not enough, though, merely to list the books one has read which may have been an influence  a full picture, a full understanding of the influence requires that one should say why one read such and such a book. What was the route that led you to an author, how did one get there? That can explain why it is that an author was chosen, thereby lending further richness to the picture.                    TO BE CONCLUDED

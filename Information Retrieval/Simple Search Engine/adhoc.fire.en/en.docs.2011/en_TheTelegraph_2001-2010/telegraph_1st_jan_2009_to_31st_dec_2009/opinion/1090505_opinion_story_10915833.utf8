                                                                                                                 CRUMBLING PEACE                                                    
	Only a shadow of the peace deal, concluded by the Pakistan government a month ago, now remains in Swat and its neighbourhood. The peace started crumbling with the Taliban expansion into Buner and lower Dir, and now, with the Pakistan military steadily gaining ground in the region and pushing the Taliban towards the defensive, it seems to have ended for all practical purposes. However, despite dire threats of dissolution from the militants, the Pakistan government is yet to give up on its flagship venture in containment. While the military offensive goes on, the government continues to placate the recalcitrant leaders with the setting up of qazi courts in Malakand. It is unlikely that such sops will work, and perhaps the government knows as much. But it does not want the deal to be seen as falling through for the lack of trying. For whose eyes has this deal been struck? As far as the militants are concerned, it is irrelevant. As for Pakistans principal ally in the war on terror  whose scathing comments seem to have prompted the military action  the deal is a non-starter. In spite of the zeal shown by the Pakistan government in recovering lost ground from the Taliban, the United States of America, and no less than its president, have declared the government fragile and incapable of delivering even the basic services to the population. The Obama administration had gone to the extent of setting a deadline of two weeks before recoiling in horror at the possible effects of this straight-talking on the fine group of men in Islamabad.        
	If anything has happened in the last ten days since Pakistan decided to flex its muscles, it is the Pakistan armys resumption of its dominant position in the hierarchy of power. It has done nothing to improve the image of the civilian government, be it in Pakistan (where the governments sudden activism is still misunderstood and unexplained) or abroad. The US has gone fairly close to admitting its change of preference by lauding the army, and the army itself is conscious of the subtle improvement in weather. The army had earlier blamed the Awami National Party government for sabotaging, with the peace deal, its advance in Swat. If the civilian government continues with its policy of appeasing the Taliban, it would further alienate the army, which will have the US and the rest of Pakistan by its side.

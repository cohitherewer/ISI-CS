	Art has always had an uneasy relationship with decoration. From the earliest times, images were created for the structures in which human beings live, eat, gather, work, worship and govern. Homes, restaurants, offices, churches, temples, museums, galleries, palaces and parliaments. In these spaces, Art cohabits with dcor  Constables with cushions, watercolours with wallpaper, Jamini Roys with jamdanis. But an entire hierarchy of making, looking and valuing maintains the shifting boundaries between the two. Artists create, and craftsmen make, according to very different relationships with beauty and use  and therefore with the market. Therein lies the sublime arrogance of Art and of its masters, their vital independence and remoteness from the acquisitive world that receives their works and makes them its own.        
	So, it bodes ill for a city planning its first Museum of Modern Art  and generally, for art in Bengal  when one of its iconic painters asks an iconic cricketer for a photograph of his drawing room before making two paintings for him. Not only is Jogen Chowdhury anxious that his paintings should go with the dcor of Sachin Tendulkars drawing room, but he also seems to have accepted Mr Tendulkars specifications about subject, colours and, most bizarrely, what the women will wear. Mr Chowdhury does not seem to mind being rushed to finish these jobs in time for Mr Tendulkars felicitation in Calcutta where he would be gifting his paintings to the cricketer. He is aware of the constraints this puts on his freedom as an artist. But he has spoken about it to the press in a tone of indulgence towards the nations favourite. In much the same tone, the local designer making Mr Tendulkars kurta for the event has spoken of the honour of making something for the man  also according to specifications sent to her in advance. Mr Chowdhurys eager compliance in decorating Mr Tendulkars drawing room is like Picasso gushing about his Blue Period being inspired by the blue of the chintz in his richest buyers home. When a painter and his market come into direct contact with each other, the anonymity of buyers and collectors ceases to exist. That is when the tyranny of drawing rooms and colour schemes takes over the making of art. A trivialized form of the feudal system of patronage pulls creativity into its comfortable arms as the artist starts enjoying the tamasha of celebrity, which has little to do with the inner life of his art and could even be inimical to it.        
	When Mark Rothko was paid $35,000 to decorate the walls of Manhattans swankiest new restaurant in the Fifties, he took his revenge by painting his greatest and grimmest murals. For Rothko, this was where the richest b*****s in New York will come to feed and show off. So, he created art that he hoped would ruin the appetite of every S.O.B. who ever eats in that room. And then, after a meal there, he suddenly returned all the money, withdrew the works and, a few years later, gave most of them as a gift to the Tate, where they arrived the day he killed himself in his studio.

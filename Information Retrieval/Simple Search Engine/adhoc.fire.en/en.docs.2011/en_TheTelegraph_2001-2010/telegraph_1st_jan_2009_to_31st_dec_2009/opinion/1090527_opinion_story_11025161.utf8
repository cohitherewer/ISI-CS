	Truth will out        
	 When a teacher in an Army Public School complained of sexual harassment by the vice-chairman of the school, she was terminated from service by the school authorities on the basis of two anonymous complaints against her. The teacher filed a writ petition in the Uttaranchal High Court challenging the order of termination. The court held that it was a clear case of sexual harassment, and a three member committee headed by a lady would review the progress of the disciplinary proceedings while the petition was pending. Subsequently, a report would be sent to the disciplinary committee for further action. (D.S. Grewal vs Vimmi Joshi)                          
	Enable the disabled        
	 The Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act provides for reservation for persons with certain disabilities. By a notification, admission to paramedical courses were restricted to those with loco-motor disability of the lower limbs. Some disabled persons challenged the notification. Holding the notification to be illegal, the Gauhati High Court held that the reservation should extend to all those with disabilities, including those with visual impairment. The Court also held that the power to modify such a restriction is to be decided by Parliament or a body which is duly authorised on its behalf. (Anju Talukdar vs State of Assam)                     
	Time tale        
	 An F.I.R. was lodged against a person for committing rape in Mandi, Himachal Pradesh. The accused pleaded that the complaint should not be entertained because it was lodged a long time after the alleged incident. The High Court acquitted the accused. Upon appeal, the Supreme Court held that delay in case of sexual assault could not be equated with other offences. In a tradition bound society, and particularly in rural areas, it was improper to throw out cases concerning sexual offences because several factors weigh on the mind of the victim and her family members before lodging a complaint.

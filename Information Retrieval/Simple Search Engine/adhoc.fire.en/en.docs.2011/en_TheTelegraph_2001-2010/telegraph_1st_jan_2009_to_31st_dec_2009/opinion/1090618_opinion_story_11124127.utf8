The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Hard Talk
                                                                                                                 HARD TALK                                                    
	Offence is the best defence. Although India is nowhere close to adopting this cardinal maxim of Pakistans good neighbourliness, the opening lines of the Indian prime minister during his meeting with the Pakistan president in Russia indicate that India knows how to rise to an occasion. In full view of the media, Manmohan Singh reminded a much discomfited Asif Ali Zardari that he ought to stop Pakistans territory from being used to launch terror attacks on India. If Pakistan had achieved a coup of sorts by leveraging the United States of America to pressure India into reopening bilateral talks without fulfilling the preconditions, Mr Singhs opener has put Pakistan back on the mat by firmly reiterating that the talks are still conditional.         
	There may be questions about the efficacy of this reminder, repeated every time India is cajoled back to the table. But it would be injudicious to conclude that by agreeing to go to the table this time, despite Pakistans apparent disinterest in following up the Mumbai case, India has given up its high moral ground. In fact, it would have done so had it refused to restart dialogue. That would have given Pakistan an opportunity to show Indias intransigence as reason for its failure to curb terrorism in the region. India has now put the ball back in Pakistans court, successfully evaded the possibility of being talked to by the US secretary of state when she comes visiting next month and retained the advantage of holding Pakistan to its word on cooperation till Mr Singh meets Mr Zardari again in Egypt sometime in July. In other words, till sufficient progress is made by the secretarial level talks that would powerfully focus on terror, India can hold itself back from the composite dialogue process which has been in limbo since it was thwarted successively by the Mumbai train blasts of 2006 and then the Mumbai attacks in 2008.        
	The fluid time-frame that India has set for the talks is important. It would give India and the world, particularly the US  which is suddenly keen to know the minds of the Kashmiri people after Pakistan kept its promise of going after the Taliban  time to gauge the determination of the Pakistan establishment in carrying out its pledge against terrorism. But if that promise ends in promoting a militant like Qari Zainuddin to undo a Baitullah Mehsud, the same way the pro-Talib Sufi Mohammad was anointed to undo Maulana Fazlullah in Swat, the grand initiative of Pakistan in Swat, Malakand and now South Waziristan may not amount to much. Nor would any round of talks with India  if anti-India social workers like the Jamaat-ud-Dawas Hafiz Sayeed are forgiven. Pakistan hopes to keep Kashmir in the eyes of the world through the resumption of talks with India. But if it keeps to its old ways, it will be able to achieve nothing more than that.

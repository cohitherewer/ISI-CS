	Gestures, and not so much words, have always decided the course of India-Pakistan dialogue. This is accepted on both sides of the border, and is the reason why the flagging-off of cross-border bus services and even forced handshakes have been given more than their expected share of significance in the annals of India-Pakistan amity. Given this history, it is expected that the Punjab governments decision to withdraw its appeal before the Pakistan supreme court against the release of Hafeez Saeed  the Jamaat-ud-Dawa chief, alleged by India to be the mastermind behind the Mumbai attacks  will have a rather unplesant impact on the resumption of talks. India has squarely tied up any progress of dialogue to a visible response from Pakistan to the Mumbai terror investigations. And Pakistan, so far, has had little to show in that regard other than an admission that the attack had been planned from within its borders and the rounding up of a couple of scores of suspects. But it has been peculiarly apathetic about the prime suspects. The trial of the Lashkar e-Toiba leader, Zaki-ur-Rehman, has been stalled innumerable times and that of Saeed made to end in a fiasco for the lack of sufficient evidence.        
	But since gestures are important, especially on the eve of a meet as significant as that in Sharm-el-Shiekh, Pakistan has made a few. It initiated an appeal against the release of the JuD chief, then promised the commencement of trials for the suspects, and dispatched a dossier about the Mumbai attack to India immediately before the foreign-secretary-level negotiations in France. This feel-good atmosphere, painstakingly created as much by Pakistan as by India, will have received a powerful jolt from the news of the developments in Pakistan. The appeal against Saeeds release fell through because of the Pakistan federal governments refusal to share secret evidence against the suspect with the Punjab government. This disclosure will definitely damage Pakistans efforts at quelling suspicion, Indias as also the international communitys, about its possible motives in sheltering anti-India persons like the JuD leader. The foreign secretaries have met, but under the looming shadow of resurgent doubts. It will now be difficult for Pakistan to push India towards composite dialogue. The inopportune development will also have diluted Manmohan Singhs optimism about meeting a reformed Pakistan halfway.

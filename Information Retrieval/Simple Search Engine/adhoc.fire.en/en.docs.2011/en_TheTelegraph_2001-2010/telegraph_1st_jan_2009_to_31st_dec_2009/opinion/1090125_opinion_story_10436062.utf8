	It is important to make a good impression on the first day at work, and nothing short of an outstanding performance is expected from one entrusted with the most important job in the world. Especially if the office he has assumed happens to be tainted by years of arrogant misgovernance. In the few days since he became the president of the United States of America, Barack Obama has changed the moral destiny of his country more profoundly than George W. Bush could do in the eight long years that he presided over the highest office in the world. If the Bush era became synonymous with the Reign of Terror, Mr Obama has begun on the high note of justice. The day after he delivered possibly one of the most compelling Inaugurals ever, Mr Obama set out to prove that he is as good as his oratorical skills. Not only has he announced the closure of the Guantanamo Bay camp by January 2010, he has also embarked on a major cleaning-up of the debris left behind by the Bush administration. In a strikingly bold move, Mr Obama has ordered the shutting down of the wide network of clandestine ghost prisons and black sites run by the Central Intelligence Agency. That this was not just political expediency but motivated by a deeper moral impulse is borne out by Mr Obamas further ban on torture and rendition, and his demand for a new set of rules for the detainees.         
	But noble intentions are not necessarily easy to execute. The challenge of Guantanamo goes beyond the simple question of dissolving the camp. In the next few months, Mr Obama and his team would have to sort out what exactly should be done with the 245 odd detainees left in the prison. Most have been held for years without trial and have complained of abuse. Four have hanged themselves in custody. Many are afraid of the persecution they would face if deported to their home countries. If the horrors of Abu Ghraib were shocking in their vividness, the mysteries of Guantanamo were hidden in a veil of sinister rhetoric. As Donald Rumsfeld, the former secretary of state, quibbled: We know there are some things we do not know, but there are also unknown unknowns  the ones we dont know we dont know.         
	We are not, Mr Obama emphatically said, going to continue with the false choice between our safety and our ideals. Nothing could be a clearer contrast to the twisted doublespeak of Mr Bush and his acolytes. The ideals Mr Obama has invoked demand not only a fair trial of the detainees but also ask that their tormentors, too, are tried under federal law. These practical matters have to be resolved over the next few months. Nonetheless, it must be admitted that Mr Obama has scored a resounding victory with his very first decree, and not just by salvaging the image of his country. He has refused to remain a pawn in the hands of terrorists, especially the al Qaida, which has revelled in every false step taken by Mr Bush, using each of his mistakes as an excuse to whip up anti-US sentiments.

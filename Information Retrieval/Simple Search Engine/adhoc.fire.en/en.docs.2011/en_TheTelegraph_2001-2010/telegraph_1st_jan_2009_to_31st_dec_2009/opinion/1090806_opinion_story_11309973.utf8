	Unequal treatment                  
	Sir  Ashok V. Desais article, The banks journey (July 28), was illuminating. It helped readers get a fair idea about the narrow practices prevalent in the Indian banking system. The Reserve Bank of Indias quarterly statistics on deposits and credit of scheduled commercial banks for March, 2009, revealed that 82 per cent of gross bank credit was lent to only 200 centres, which contributed 74.2 per cent of the aggregate deposits. It is unlikely for these 200 centres to be located in villages. This indicates the continuous flight of deposits from rural to urban centres. In this context, the role played by the RBI remains something of a puzzle for those who are concerned with the exclusion of the rural population from the banking and financial services system. It is quite clear that the RBI has pegged its role to that of a controller when it comes to banking and macro-fiscal management. The central bank does not seem to be interested in taking over the responsibility of implementing social development projects through its network of rural banks.           
	Finance is an important catalyst to the development of the Indian economy. Elections, too, have been fought and won based on the plank of development. It is time banks shifted their focus to rural India as Indias impoverished villages are simmering with discontent and have been witness to major upheavals. The only saving grace has been the phenomenal growth of micro-credit in these areas. Even then, the interest charged in villages is allegedly higher than what corporate and high net-worth clients are required to pay in the cities.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The banks journey, by Ashok V. Desai, does not take into account the fact that both economic and political factors have contributed to the nations progress. It is undeniable that the nationalization of banks played a part in the nations development. It brought about the notion of financial inclusion, which helped transform growth into development. But, in the era of the planned economy, weaker control led to the State incurring huge losses.           
	Desai correctly mentions that the disbursal of long-term credit to infrastructure by banks led to the accumulation of private capital through lucrative investments. But some of this unaccounted private wealth also made its way to the Swiss bank accounts of a few individuals.           
	The journey of Indias nationalized banks can be divided into three phases: expansion, consolidation and reformation. Reconstruction is inevitable in any enterprise, but some of the problems that beset national banks need to be mulled over. Today, nationalized banks have spread to nearly every nook and corner of the country. But despite their trustworthiness, the finance ministry is now under immense pressure to privatize or merge some of these public sector financial institutions. The global downturn has revealed the impending risks of such a move as government subsidies or bail-out packages have failed to rescue financial institutions in other countries. Under the circumstances, India should act in a prudent manner to save its nationalized banks.           
	Yours faithfully,        R. Subhranshu, Chandernagore, Hooghly              
	Divided house          
	Sir  A Hindu-dominated housing society in Pali Hill, Mumbai, has reportedly refused to sell a flat to the actor, Emraan Hashmi, because he is a Muslim. Apparently, this is the second time Hashmi has been denied a house in the same complex. It is true that many housing societies in the city follow an unwritten code to deny accommodation to Muslims. This is a reflection of a deeper collective bias against this community. Social and political organizations have propagated several myths about the minority community, and these faulty representations have gained currency over time. These stereotypes have been constructed with a communal agenda, and are based on a selective representation of history. The American media have contributed to this polarization with their coinage of the phrase, Islamic terrorism.           
	The discrimination by housing societies is an insult to the values enshrined in the Constitution. There is an urgent need to break the boundaries that have been erected to separate religious communities. That is the only way to strengthen national integration.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Ram Puniyani, Mumbai

                
	Sir  I was surprised at Emraan Hashmis allegation that he was denied a flat in Bandra on religious grounds. My personal experience in this regard is very different. Earlier, I lived in Ghatkopar, a Gujarati-dominated area. However, I can hardly complain of any discrimination at the hands of my neighbours who had no qualms about sharing shir-korma during Muslim festivals. Later, I shifted to another housing society in Pancham Nagar in Andheri, where I found quite a few Muslims living in harmony with people from other faiths. In my building, Hindus are a majority but I have never been prohibited from celebrating the Ganesh festival.          
	In a way, I am not surprised by what Hashmi has said. I have seen people allege that they have been discriminated on religious grounds to have their way a number of times. On receiving such complaints, others are only too keen to add fuel to the fire. Men and women, irrespective of their faith, should stop themselves from being exploited by those who get pleasure out of setting one religious community against another.          
	Yours faithfully,

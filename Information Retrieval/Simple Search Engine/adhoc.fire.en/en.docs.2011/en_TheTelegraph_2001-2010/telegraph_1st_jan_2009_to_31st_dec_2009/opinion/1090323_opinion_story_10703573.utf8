The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | good but hasty
                                                                                                                 GOOD BUT HASTY                                                    
	The times since World War II have been good. Although there were hiccups such as the oil crisis and the East Asian crisis, growth was resumed after a short interruption each time. This good fortune created an impression that the lessons of earlier macroeconomic errors had been learnt and that the major industrial countries at any rate had learnt to avoid crises.        
	This impression has been eroded in the past six months. Employment and production have deteriorated so markedly in industrial countries that policymakers have been looking frantically for the magic wand that was supposed to have banished the trade cycle. They have ended up with two basic types of instruments  increased government expenditure, and monetary easing. Both have been used, so far without much impact. That has unleashed debate on which types of expenditure are effective, and how far monetary policy should be supplemented by institutional measures, especially relating to banking systems. In this confusion over instruments, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development sees an opportunity. Being a collective of rich countries, the OECD has over the years been able to commission voluminous studies covering every aspect of economic and social policy. Nor is it the only one; every international organization has given voluminous advice to its member countries.        
	The OECD brought together five of them, besides itself, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the International Labour Organization and the World Trade Organization. Together they have prepared an inventory of advice given by them over the years. Most of it is such that countries should need no persuasion to accept it  it consists of agreements signed by the countries. A quick look at it is enough to show how seldom they have embodied the principles of those agreements in their domestic policies  for instance, the recommendations of the Tokyo statement on the strengthening of the role of small and medium enterprises in global value chains, or the International Finance Corporations extractive industry client revenue disclosure instrument. If they were so neglectful in good times, they are even more likely to be so in these bad times; for example, guidelines for earthquake safety in schools or the agreement on government procurement is unlikely to get top priority. While, therefore, the exercise hurriedly undertaken by the OECD and its comperes is unlikely to evoke much response, the idea itself is a good one. The last global crisis occurred 80 years ago; it was not too well handled, and the lessons learnt from it are not too relevant today. Governments are frantically clutching at solutions and trying them out regardless. They would find an inventory of anticyclical instruments helpful. But even more, they would like to have an assessment of what instruments would work and under what circumstances. But it must be an expert assessment, not just the anodyne judgment of an international organization.

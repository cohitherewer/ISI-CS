The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Caution without a game plan
                                                                                                                 CAUTION WITHOUT A GAME PLAN                                  Shorn of surprises, this budget has the signs of inadequate planning and is unlikely to create much growth, writes S.L. Rao                                            
	Pranab Mukherjee is a cautious man and he hates surprises. His budget displays both characteristics. He announced some desirable moves in the Economic Survey. He has done some of the things that the survey highlighted as important reforms. This is a balanced budget, which still has a few but major unknowns. The stock market does not think it is a good budget, and its immediate reaction was to go down.        
	Let us look at the budget in perspective. In 1991, India broke away from the command-and-control, State-investment-oriented and income-redistributive regime that, under Indira Gandhi, held back entrepreneurship and growth in India. The reforms since 1991, mainly led by two finance ministers, Manmohan Singh and P. Chidambaram, were focused on getting the fiscal situation in balance, and on freeing industry and finance from many of the constraints that held them back in earlier years. They neglected investments in infrastructure, agriculture, health and education and improving the targeting and efficiencies of expenditures, especially for the poor. The influence of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in the first United Progressive Alliance government and of the National Advisory Council (particularly its expert members like Jean Drze) led to a lot more emphasis on employment for the poor, education and health.        
	But fiscal discipline was ignored, and despite buoyant tax revenues, it went up beyond the discipline imposed by earlier finance ministers. The fiscal deficit figures were fudged, at least in the last two years of the UPA government. Food and fertilizer subsides were not fully accounted for, nor the bonds to oil companies that were forced to keep retail prices low. Possibly, the present budget is truly revealing the deficit, but it has no indication of how and when the deficit will be brought under control.         
	In this budget, the challenges, in the middle of an unprecedented global economic recession, were to bring the country back to the path of fiscal discipline, stimulate agriculture and its productivity, rapidly build urban and rural infrastructure, reduce volatility of foreign exchange inflows, substantially reduce the waste and inefficiency in government expenditures (especially on infrastructure, health, education, employment guarantee, subsides and so on), bring about greater accountability through administrative reform and reforms in election expenditure.         
	The budget abolishes the infuriating fringe benefit tax, the 10 per cent surcharge on corporate tax, raises the minimum alternate tax, introduces investment incentives for a few sectors to start with and has help for labour-intensive export industries. Social sector and infrastructure expenditures are to rise substantially, with Plan expenditures rising by 34 per cent over last year and by 37 per cent on non-Plan (mostly because of the pay commission recommendations being implemented). Expenditures will act as a further stimulus to the economy, over and above the three stimulus packages introduced in the last few months. There are also some schemes to simplify tax structures, balance out customs and excise duties and so on, and proposals for committees to look at the market orientation of prices of petroleum and oil products, introducing more information technology into employment exchanges and so on.        
	What is unclear is how the huge deficit of 6.8 per cent plus 3.5 per cent (after allowing this year a further 0.5 per cent of gross domestic product to be spent by state governments) is to be financed. We have never seen this level of deficit even at the worst of times in the past. Mukherjee has talked about getting back to the path of fiscal rectitude in time. But there should have been a roadmap so that the world knew that this government was serious about doing so. The deficit will obviously be financed from substantially increased borrowings. If the government is going to borrow this much, we must worry about where the private sector is going to find funds from. Can the Reserve Bank of India even consider any reduction in interest rates in this situation? Reduced interest rates are an important instrument for reviving industry. Are we then going back to the period when investment was mostly by government and not by the private sector? That is what this budget has provided. While there is mention of disinvestments, there are no plans announced. One indicator could be the rise in non-tax revenues by almost Rs 45,000 crore over last year. Such an increase can only be from substantial disinvestment revenues and spectrum sales. It is a measure of Mukherjees caution, and of the extent to which his is the mind of a Congressman trained under the first Mrs Gandhi, that there is no game plan mentioned.         
	As expected, the handouts are going to be much higher than ever before. The food subsidy is to rise by almost Rs 30,000 crore, the national rural employment guarantee scheme is to have an increase of 140 per cent. The fertilizer subsidy is to be revamped so that payments go to the farmer and there is a balanced use of different fertilizers. The new Rs 3 per kg scheme of rice and wheat will add substantially to subsidy expenditures. On other social expenditures and rural infrastructure there are big increases. There is, however, no mention of how these expenditures could be properly targeted and spent with minimum waste. As with past finance ministers, he talks of studying it. He also banked on the new national identity card scheme. It will not roll out for at least three years. So, for three years and probably more, we have to live with the huge waste in all government expenditures and especially on the social sector.        
	This budget is another huge stimulus with large additional expenditures by the government. The government will draw away a lot of funds from the market and therefore squeeze funds for the private sector and close any chances of interest rate reductions. This will hurt industrial growth. The ambitious target of 9 per cent GDP growth is a target with little chance of achievement. The major world economies will not improve significantly in the next year for them to buy a lot more from us than they are doing now. The export-oriented industries that have pulled us down in 2008 will not improve very much. That is also true of the IT and BPO sectors that account for a good part of major consumer spending.         
	The rural sector is to receive vast funds, a fair amount of which will leak into the bureaucracy and the politicians. But the monsoon may well be poor and that will hurt rural purchasing power. Without urban growth, the rural sector cannot make up the demand to the extent that will give us an overall 9 per cent growth. With possible liquidity squeeze and static interest rates, the chances are that the private sector will not do well. On top of all this is the refusal to address the problem of volatile foreign institutional investments, which have been largely speculative because of being exempt from short-term capital gains tax if they come from Mauritius. This has led to great volatility in our stock markets and frightened investors in India.        
	This budget has the signs of inadequate planning, and is unlikely to give us much growth.

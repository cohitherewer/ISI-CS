The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | One hundred days of headache
                                                                                                                 ONE HUNDRED DAYS OF HEADACHE                                  CHANGING TIMES      The new Indian government and Barack Obamas Afpak policy                          Fresh approach                                        
	Now that the first 100 days of Barack Obamas presidency are well over, the first 100 days of Manmohan Singhs second term as prime minister are about to begin. Obama faced three major challenges as he took office. The first was the economic crisis that had spread from the United States of America to the rest of the world. The second was Irans nuclear programme, and the third was what has come to be known as Americas Afpak initiative. Of the three, the first two are works-in-progress but the third has begun to unravel in a way which is likely to be a major headache to the government and the people of India.        
	Pakistan has been an ally of the US since it was born, and became a frontline state in the containment of the Soviet Union. The rise of the Pakistan army as an overarching force has all along been funded, nurtured and promoted by the US. This collaboration reached its peak when the Central Investigation Agency and the Inter-Services Intelligence were tasked to create the Taliban as a fighting force to drive out the Russians from Afghanistan. Following the 9/11 attacks, George Bush declared the war on terror, which Pervez Musharraf quickly joined in support. Over the last few decades, Pakistan has mastered the fine art of managing the US by transforming itself from a frontline Nato ally to a frontline defender against the Taliban and the al Qaida. In return, it has received a generous and continuous flow of arms and money, while persuading US that India was Pakistans biggest threat. This helped Pakistan give a different twist to its numerous state-sponsored jihadi groups spreading terrorism in Kashmir and other parts of India under the garb of freedom fighters.        
	Obama was the first to acknowledge the dubious game Pakistan was playing and started looking for a way to publicly call the bluff on Pakistans jihadi blackmail. His resolve was strengthened in the background of the November 2008 Pakistan-sponsored terrorist attacks in Mumbai, and the subsequent open rebellion by the Taliban in Swat, and the destabilizing of the Afpak policy.        
	To extract itself from Afghanistan, the US needs the help of the Pakistan army to contain the Taliban which, for a time, the army and the civilian government seemed unable or reluctant to do. Obama tried to persuade Pakistan to move its troops from its border with India to the battlefield of the Taliban. He went so far as to advise Pakistan that it was not India but the Taliban that was its real enemy. The Afpak initiative was expected to pour massive aid into Pakistan to fight the Taliban, but, for the first time, with strings attached.        
	Recently, the secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, announced that the US has made a complete U-turn. Clinton stated that since the US policy in Pakistan has been incoherent for the past 30 years, it would be unfair to impose preconditions by the US on its aid to Pakistan to fight the Taliban. How such a U-turn would create coherence remains unclear, except for providing a face-saver to the civilian government in Pakistan. Pakistan can continue to treat India as its prime threat and the Taliban a secondary, though an important, one. It will also enable Pakistan to continue expanding its nuclear arms production facilities and permit A.Q. Khan to re-launch his nuclear arms vending business.        
	These developments leave Manmohan Singhs government with little choice but to initiate measures that will send out a strong message to the US and Pakistan. India must protect its interests by taking such steps as may be required. The co-operation sought from India in the Afpak initiative should no longer be taken for granted. India must remain vigilant against Pakistan-based terrorists.

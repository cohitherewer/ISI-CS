	The Road Less Travelled: The Life and Writings of Vinodinee Neelkanth (Stree, Rs 375) contains a biographical sketch, and translations from the writings of one of the most remarkable Indian litterateurs of the twentieth century. Vinodinee Neelkanth had many firsts to her credit. She is probably the first Gujarati woman to win a post-graduate degree from an American university in the 1930s. After returning from the United States of America, she got involved in Gandhis Civil Disobedience movement. Subsequently, she became a teacher, writer, and social activist. Her Kadaleevan, published in 1946, is the first novel by a Gujarati woman. In her writings, Neelkanth spoke out against social evils such as dowry and female infanticide, the unequal treatment meted out to women, and stressed the need for a woman to have a room of her own. The translations from her journalistic writings and short stories, done by Jagdeep Parikh, Shailaja Karlekar Parikh, Rohini Patel, Ranjana Pendharkar, Sohan Nilkanth and Rita Kothari, give ample evidence of the way Neelkanth inspired, and continues to inspire readers to question prevalent gender stereotypes. Her writings are unique for the way they combine homely wisdom with astute observations and pithy comments.                         
	The Night of the Miraj (Little, Brown, Rs 295) by Zo Ferraris is a murder mystery set in Jeddah. When Nouf ash-Shrawi, the 16-year old daughter of one of the most affluent Saudi families, disappears before her marriage, the desert guide, Nayir, is requested by the girls brother to track her down. Nayirs search proves futile when Noufs mutilated body is discovered in a wadi a few days later. A broken Nayir goes to the morgue to collect the body for the family, and meets the forensic scientist, Katya Hijazi, who scandalizes and intrigues him at the same time. For the pious and diffident Nayir, Hijazi proves to be a problem in more ways than one. She forces him to revise his views on morality in general and women in particular as the two try to unravel the mystery behind Noufs death. The plot is gripping, and the social commentary delivered by the novel makes it more than a mere thriller.                                   
	Eat My Globe: One Mans Search for the Best Food in the World (John Murray, Rs 295) by Simon Majumdar takes the reader to a world where food is everything, but the right order of the family hierarchy comes first. So the author begins by paying his respects to The Great Salami, his elder brother, Robin, with whom he runs a blog on popular food in the internet. When Majumdar turns 40, he decides that in order to prevent mid-life crisis from eating him up, he must quit his stationary job, start travelling all over the world and eat everything it has to offer. So begins the eating odyssey from Britain to Melbourne to Mexico to India to Istanbul and so on. On his journey, Majumdar meets thousands of fanatics like him who swear by food and for whom cooking is a fine art. There is a useful list at the end documenting the best and the worst tastes Majumdar has come across in his travels. While the former includes, among others, tandoori chicken in New Delhi, the latter has such items as stir fried rat from Yangshuo, China, and rotten shark meat from Iceland.                         
	The Other Hand (Sceptre, Rs 295) by Chris Cleave begins promisingly enough but soon gets unbearably maudlin. The novels message  the need to grant illegal immigrants their basic human rights instead of treating them as just another figure in the government files  gets diluted once it is mixed with the melodrama of adultery, bereavement and filial devotion. Reading the The Other Hand would be no more than a waste of time.

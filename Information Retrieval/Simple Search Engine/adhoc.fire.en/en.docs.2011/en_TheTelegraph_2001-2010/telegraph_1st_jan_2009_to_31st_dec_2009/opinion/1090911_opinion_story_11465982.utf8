                                                                                                                 SQUEEZE CAPITALISM                          - Nanos failure hit the state government harder than the Tatas        Cutting Corners - Ashok Mitra                                                  
	Aftershock of a non-occurence: it still refuses to die down.              
	The supreme boss of the Tata Group of Industries was stopping in Calcutta. This was his first visit since his decision last year to abandon the small car project in Singur, West Bengal. The gentleman had a meeting with the state industries minister, which was followed by a joint press conference. The state minister was a feeble, very feeble, master of ceremonies at the press briefing. It was the Tata czar all over. He was in an expansive, even forgiving, mood; the fiasco over Nano notwithstanding, he had no animus towards West Bengal; the Tata Groups other involvements here will continue: why, a cancer hospital sponsored by the Tatas will be soon ready to open, it will have 50 free beds for poor people.         
	The Tata supremo made a further statement. No, he will not mind handing back the 1,000 acres of land the state government had given to the Tatas for setting up the small car plant at Singur in case it had any alternative scheme for using it, but Tata Motors must first be paid adequate compensation for the money it had spent to convert that vast stretch of agricultural land into an industrial site. The Tata boss had an almost a proprietorial air when he mentioned the Singur land.               
	There is legitimate reason to feel uneasy. The land in question is not Tata property. The state government had given that land to Tata Motors on long lease. The lease involved a commitment on the part of the Tatas to use the land to build a small car factory. Since the project has been given up, that underlying condition has not been fulfilled. At the time the Tata supremo announced the cancellation of the project, he did not blame the state government for the denouement; he blamed a third party. Therefore, the responsibility for the non-fulfilment of the project, and thus breaching the most crucial condition in the lease deed, technically devolves on Tata Motors. Such being the case, doubt can be raised over the justifiability of the Tatas continuing to occupy the land. In any event, the land was requisitioned by the state government in the public interest. It was explained to the judiciary that the specific public interest was the establishment of the car factory which was expected to create income and employment and contribute generally to the states economic development. Since the factory did not come up, the claim of public interest does not, as they say, hold water, and the acquisition has been rendered mala fide. A further point is worth mentioning. In terms of a proviso in the lease agreement, Tata Motors were to pay the state government a rental of only one crore rupees each year for the first 20 years of the lease period. One does not know whether the Tatas have paid even the first of such instalments. Even if they did, is it not a bit too much to claim proprietory rights over a lease in property  nearly one thousand acres of lush, rich arable land  by paying only one crore of rupees?         
	That apart, the ambit of public interest can be pretty open-ended. Suppose the Tatas are in a dog-in-the-manger mood and hold up the return of the land. The state government, according to one view, could then apply the same colonial law which was used to acquire the land for the Tatas to take it away from them by issuing a further notice of acquisition, again in the public interest. Yet another, somewhat breathtaking, suggestion is for the state government simply to move in and occupy the 1,000-acre tract. The Tatas might at best cry foul and go to court. The law would then take its own course.        
	Aside from issues of legality, there are of course other considerations. For example, why should there be no scope for a civil discourse? True, the Tatas did incur some expenditure to transform fertile agricultural land into an industrial site, including that for construction of sheds and buildings, laying of roads and sundry other necessary purposes. All this outlay has now become infructuous. The total sum involved cannot, however, but be peanuts to a global entity such as the Tatas. Since they do not propose to use the land any more, they could, without standing on ceremony, hand back the land to the state authorities. It could then have forwarded a quiet memorandum to the State Industrial Development Corporation, listing the expenses they had incurred and that have now gone to waste, leaving the matter of some compensation to the judgment of the state authorities.         
	For the state government, too, can have a point of view. Who is going to compensate it for either the financial losses and other sacrifices it has borne for the sake of ensuring the successful completion of the Nano project or for the discomfiture the abortion of the project has caused it? It had spent roughly Rs 150 crore to acquire the land for the Tatas. While acquiring the land, it had to face intense hostility from different quarters. A most difficult situation arose, which led to the deployment of the forces of law and order. This in turn led to yet more public outcry. The Tatas abandoned the project and the state government lost at both ends: it had no car factory to crow about and its support base shrunk ominously. The costliest damage has been political. The severely disappointing electoral reverses the parties constituting the state government have of late been experiencing one after another are  no question  partly the outcome of developments around the small car project.               
	This is where the aspect of civility and grace comes in. In a mature capitalist system, risk-bearing is one of the important functions an industrial entrepreneur is expected to perform. There is always an element of uncertainty in a given line of production or in the general economic climate. The entrepreneur is expected to take into account the risk factors attendant upon it while undertaking a new venture. The circumstances which induced the Tatas to give up the Singur project belong to the genre of such risks. These were in the nature of a force majeure which neither the Tata Motors nor the State government had anticipated. Given the fact that wounds inflicted by the slings and arrows of fortune have been immeasurably much more severe for the state government, the Tatas could have been gentlemanly enough not to make compensation of their losses a prior condition for returning the land over which their right of tenure is indeed tenuous. But it is a new breed of capitalism  squeeze capitalism  from where grace has departed. Civilization and squeeze capitalism obviously do not go together.         
	Finally, a query, with humility, for the West Bengal industries minister. Is the opening of a new cancer hospital such a giant stride in the states industrialization that he had to sit together with the Tata boss at the press briefing? Or was he there to be told that encroachment on state property will not end until some money is first forked out? A minister represents the sovereignty of the people; that sovereignty is diminished when a minister fails to guard the dignity of his position.

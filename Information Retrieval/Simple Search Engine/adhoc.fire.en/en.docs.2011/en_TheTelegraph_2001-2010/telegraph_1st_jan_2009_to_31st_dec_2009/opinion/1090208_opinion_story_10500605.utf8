	 The saffronites may scoff at Rahul Gandhis love for Dalits, but there are enough signs that some of them, especially the younger lot, are getting to see Rahuls point in promoting young blood in party affairs. The Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha, apparently, is already demanding the implementation of the Rahul formula that is allotting 30 per cent of the party tickets to the youth for elections. In fact, the BJYM has reportedly been brazen enough to point out in its communication to the party leadership that mere internet-chatting the dig at LK Advanis website was unmistakable  would not be enough to fetch votes from the people. Rahuls brainwaves are already creating major flutters in his own party. The Congress policy on pre-poll alliances is supposed to be largely Rahuls idea. And you thought babalogs would never grow up!                   
	 Not all of BJPs ideas are borrowed from others. One in Madhya Pradesh appears pretty original and useful in these times of economic slowdown. The Shivraj Singh Chauhan administration has decided to permit the employment of one family member as personal staff for state ministers. The move, which has the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sanghs approval, is believed to be an antidote to the mercenary tendencies of private assistants and aides that givethe government a bad name. The Congress, always a critic of saffron virtues, sees this as blatant nepotism.                             
	 A politician couple in the capital recently lost their dog. After a night-long search, the animal remained untraced. The police were called in and a closer scrutiny revealed that the theft was the handiwork of a disgruntled domestic aide. Apparently, the servant had sold the expensive pet for a song to settle his monthly wages that were, allegedly, not paid.                            
	 The Constitution Club at Rafi Marg is witnessing a major contest for the post of treasurer. As for the post of secretary, Rajiv Pratap Rudy is steadily emerging as a consensus candidate while the CPI(M)s Hannan Mollah is vying for the treasurers job along with the BJPs Vijay Goel. Rudy, however, is not too keen on having Goel by his side. He seemingly prefers representation from different political parties to packing his team with partymen. Whats more, Rudy has drafted in Sandeep Dikshit, son of the Delhi chief minister, Sheila Dikshit, in his panel. Goel is not sitting idle either. His panel includes the Bahujan Samaj Partys Shahid Siddiqui and Rudys party colleagues, Maya Singh and Bachchi Singh Rawat. Godspeed Goel!                             
	 With elections approaching, the Intelligence Bureau got busy with the obligatory pre-election survey for the ruling party bosses. According to IB insiders, the survey gives the Congress 155 seats, with the BJP lagging behind by a dozen-odd seats. Who then will form the next government? Given that the Samajwadi Party is in for a huge setback, the advantage would accrue to the Dalit queen who could bag up to 55 seats. If the survey is to be believed, Mayavati holds the key to the future. That wouldnt have made the IBs political bosses too happy.                             
	 For the youngest chief minister of the country, it must have been a surprise to have a 100-year-old visitor. So when Begum Beegun Bibi went to meet Omar Abdullah, he could not but personally walk up to her and ask her about the purpose of her visit. Beegun Bibi replied that she had been booked by the police for a crime she hadnt committed. Omar not only gave her a patient hearing but asked the cops to re-examine her case. A visibly emotional Omar then gave her some money and dropped her home in his own vehicle.                             
	 Margaret Alva was in for a mild shock when the gatekeeper at 24 Akbar Road signalled for her car to be parked outside the premises. Alva, whose Ambassador used to be ushered in on a priority basis even months ago, insisted that she be accorded the same treatment now. But the security guard responded politely, but firmly, that her car had to be parked outside after dropping her. And so it was.             
	 Prisoner number 882 of the Chanchalguda jail is said to be having a rollicking time. With a Satyam insider tipped to take over as CEO, the former Satyam boss, Ramalinga Raju, affectionately addressed as Scamalinga or Gurudev by some inmates, has even less to worry about his future. Local scribes recently asked the jail superintendent if Raju was indeed having as many as 20 idlis for breakfast, five plates of rice and a bucket of rasam for lunch, and 25 chapatis with two chickens for dinner. The jail official, we are told, could not help but confirm that these numbers were hugely inflated. He is said to have quipped, You see, the habit is so deeply ingrained in Raju that he automatically inflates all figures.       
	Another account claims that Raju has decided to teach accountancy to the inmates in order to bequeath his skills to a receptive jail audience. Hopefully, some of them will find their way into the Satyam (ghost) roster.

DIPANKAR DASGUPTA                                                      
	It appears that the railways ministry is poised now to lift West Bengal out of its industrial woes. While this is cause for rejoicing, one should at the same time study the proposed road map to development somewhat dispassionately.         
	As far as the guidance of West Bengals major opposition party to the railways ministry reveals, it has performed a turnaround of sorts by proposing the construction of a railway coach factory on the 600 acres of Singur land, which, immediately following the dismantling of the Nano factory, it had earmarked for potato cultivation. This suggests that the party now believes, somewhat along the lines of the Left Front government, that the fruits of industrialization are likely to be more attractive than farming in the demolished Nano factory area.        
	If so, the issue cannot be dissociated from the land acquisition policy either, since all the 600 acres belong to the acquired land category. The railways minister has taken a serious view of the proposals contained in the draft land acquisition bill and demanded that land be acquired by private industry through free markets alone. One must commend her party for its wisdom in this respect, since the market price determined by supply-demand laws is the fairest deal land sellers can expect. As the Singur imbroglio demonstrated, prices in the area adjoining the proposed Nano factory had shot up to mind-boggling levels while the factory was under construction. One even suspects that a large part of the controversy could have been averted if the farmers were compensated for the wedge between the government-offered lower price and the free-market price.               
	There is yet another reason why markets should be considered a fair device for land allocation. They offer a landowner the freedom of choice to dispose of his property. The obvious argument against this view would be that a nexus between middlemen and political goons would prevent the functioning of free markets. This possibility cannot be ignored, and it is exactly here that the question of governance comes up. It is the governments responsibility to ensure that transactions are free and fair. Indeed, the State can also play the role of an educator by computing on behalf of the land owners the correct market price of their land and, once that price is received, how they can best utilize the money.         
	In this connection, the party in question has also indicated that acquired land will need to be returned to the original seller if it is not used for the purpose for which it was purchased. This too is a fair demand, as long as the previous owner is willing to purchase back the land in the same coercion-free market where he had sold it. The market, in other words, should not be treated as a one-way instrument for land transfer. Whoever wishes to sell or buy will need to operate through markets, and the onus must lie on the government to ensure that all transactions occur, at least between private economic agents, at proper market prices.         
	Given the partys correct stance on market principles, one would expect that the railways ministry, too, is gearing itself up, wherever possible, towards applying the market test of efficiency for judging its own operations. Going back, therefore, to the railway coach factory in Singur, fairness demands that farmers who had to sell their plots at lower than market prices will now be compensated, either by the railways ministry or the state government.         
	Admittedly, this question may not arise at all in the present context, since the land was acquired under the old  that is, the still existing  law. Let us proceed then on the assumption that there will be no compensation, that a legal avenue will be found to return the 400 acres to the unwilling farmers and that the railways ministry will be able to build the coach factory on the remaining 600 acres if and when the Tatas return the land. Even in the absence of compensation, the railways minister will deserve accolades, to say the least, if this task is successfully accomplished. Of course, the railway coach factory will not give birth to an industrial township anywhere comparable in size to the mini-Tatanagar model. But it will probably provide industrial employment, and this means that a part of the Singur dream will be realized.        
	Having said so, one must not forget that the latest railways budget has also proposed a coach factory in Kanchrapara and a revival of the Burn-Standard wagon-making facilities. As far as the second proposal goes, informed sources claim that the exercise is likely to involve a debt waiver of Rs 1,200 crore and an injection of Rs 250 crore through sale of surplus land. Moreover, a pending wage revision plan could cost the government up to Rs 100 crore. In this context, an official has observed that While Burn-Standard is fully equipped to upgrade its production facilities to meet (the) Railways accent on new wagon technology, shortage of design engineers is an area of concern. In other words, market-efficiency principles will be sacrificed as far as the Burn-Standard revival is concerned, a plan that runs counter to the railways ministers market-driven land acquirement philosophy.         
	Be that as it may, once Singur is added to Kanchrapara and the ten Burn-Standard units spread across West Bengal, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, one suspects that the railways capacity for producing coaches and wagons will be substantially expanded. Indeed, according to the railways budget, the Kanchrapara factory will have a capacity for producing 500 EMU/ MEMU and Metro coaches per annum. As with any other industry, all the three production organizations will be constrained by demand and one does not know if the governments demand will be sufficiently large to generate employment comparable to what the Tatas, along with their associated downstream and upstream projects, could have ensured. If the governments own demand turns out to be insufficient, it is doubtful that the coach factories will stick to market principles even under the public-private partnership schemes. The question will assume added significance on account of the fact that Burn-Standards had failed to satisfy market norms, thereby gaining entry into the list of the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction.               
	One should not be unduly pessimistic, of course, but it would be unwise to rule out the need for bail-out packages from the railways ministry to keep the factories alive in future. According to the perception of the media, however, the railways ministers seat might fall vacant two years from now. If that vacancy is filled up by a minister of state and trusted colleague belonging to her own party, the railways-led revamp of West Bengals industry may well be sustainable for a while. If this does not happen though, the much publicized rail-driven industrialization may not come about.        
	The railways ministry has, of course, made further arrangements to revive the stalled development plans for Singur, including the flagging off of the Andolan Express. Given that the Ratanpur potato wholesale market lies right next to the Golden Quadrangle Roadway linking Singur to Calcutta, it is not clear if the new railway service will boost freight transport in any significant way. And this leaves only the assured investment on cold storages, the trading centres for farm produce and the face-lift of railway stations as vehicles for the market-cum-rail-borne industrialization programme.         
	As things stand, few industrialists, after witnessing the Nano disaster and the present political disturbances, are too enthusiastic to invest in this state. The induction of the Ficci president in an advisory capacity might revive confidence. In the meantime, there is little choice for the public except to keep on hoping that all will be for the best in the best of all possible worlds.

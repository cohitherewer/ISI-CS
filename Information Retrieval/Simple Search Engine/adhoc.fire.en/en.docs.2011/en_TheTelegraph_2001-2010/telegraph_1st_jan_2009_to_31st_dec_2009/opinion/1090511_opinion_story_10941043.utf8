The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Letters to Editor
                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Turbulent neighbours                  
	Sir  The editorial, Ring of unrest (May 6), points to Indias turbulent borders. This is not news, although the challenges may be different this time. Indias neighbours are going through internal turmoil. The instability of Nepals democracy is creating insecurities. Sri Lanka and Pakistan are fighting their internal enemies. None of this bodes well for India. But, as the editorial notes, India has been a regional bully in spite of its own internal problems that its vociferous democracy has not been able to solve.           
	Both Indias and Chinas economic development has thwarted the United States of Americas attempt to create a unipolar world. But unlike China, India has been unable to take advantage of the economic boom. China has used its economic prowess not only to sideline India, but also to browbeat other nations into switching sides.          
	India must make the right diplomatic moves and maintain a cohesive stand on different issues. It also needs to ensure that those in government have some ideological, and not merely financial, stake in power.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Adhip Agarwala, Delhi 

                
	Sir  The reason that national security has crept into election rhetoric is because India has never before witnessed so much chaos. Maoism and communalism are splitting the country, while the threat from countries like China and Pakistan is mounting.           
	Instead of trusting the United Nations to solve the Kashmir problem, India should have let Vallabhbhai Patel settle the Kashmir issue once and for all. Indias problems with China are the fallout of Jawaharlal Nehrus weak diplomacy and romantic idealism. The complexities in Indias relation with Sri Lanka and Bangladesh result from Indira Gandhis strategic errors.           
	At present, China is the greatest threat to India. Aware that Indias foreign policy is compromised by pressures from heterogeneous coalition partners in the government, China is pushing India into a corner and waging a psychological war. But a more direct threat comes from Pakistan, which remains the prime exporter of terror to India.          
	The key is to delink terror from Islam. Terrorists project themselves as soldiers of Islam to gain the support of society. India has to speak up against terrorism in one voice and be more diplomatic in handling its neighbours. India may not have been a regional bully. But that it is perceived to be one indicates the failure of Indian diplomacy.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Debaki Nandan Mandal, Calcutta

                
	Black is back          
	Sir  The Supreme Courts directive to the Centre to file cases against people suspected of parking black money abroad (Black money rap on government, May 6) is timely. India should take stern action against those stacking their Swiss accounts with black money. There is now global concern about funds in foreign banks being used to fund terror. The international community should step up pressure on banks for greater transparency.           
	Of the 160 developing nations facing capital flight through illicit channels, India is placed fifth. Not surprisingly, China, Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Russia are ahead with higher rates of tax evasion. The case of Hasan Ali Khan, a Pune businessman, who put huge sums in his Swiss bank account, is just the tip of the iceberg. Unless the government provides details of charges against individuals, banks will maintain secrecy as their professional norm.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Narayan B. Iyer, Mumbai 

                
	Sir  In Filters, wrong signs, back doors and black money (May 5), Dev Kar shows the channels through which black money is routed but does not elaborate the methods through which this money is generated and how it is controlled. Selling property and registering it under a different name is the main source of black money. If the government is serious about controlling the menace, it should stop this practice.           
	Elections cannot be fought without black money, so politicians cannot stop the generation of black money as their parties fates depend on it. This is probably why L.K. Advani could not tell Atal Bihari Vajpayee to do something about it when the Bharatiya Janata Party was in power.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Benu Kumar Bose, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Many political parties have made the return of black money into an election plank. This is a logical demand, but one doubts if it will ever be met since culpable politicians invariably go scot free.           
	Most election candidates have assets worth crores. Even a few years back, most of them had meagre holdings. This proves that politics is the best way to earn money, without the attendant burden of paying tax. If candidates paid their income taxes, India would have had enough money to fund all development projects.           
	Yours faithfully,       
M. Kumar, New Delhi

                                                                                                                 CRUSHED BY A CRASH                                  Abhijit Bhattacharyya                                    
	This is indeed a terrible blow, even to one who is not even remotely connected with the flying fighters of the IAF. The situation demands that one looks deeper into the saga of the Sukhoi-30, which was first inducted into the 24 Hunting Hawks squadron at Pune by the then-IAF chief, S.K. Sareen,who made it a parting gift to his parent squadron before demitting office.        
	In fact, the story of the present Sukhoi-30 began with the development of the Sukhoi-27 way back in 1969. Mikhail Simonov, designer general of the Sukhoi Design Bureau, said in 1999, it is exactly 30 years since the first outlines of a new fighter appeared on the drawing boards  the fighter destined to become part of world history as the Su-27. It, however, faced everything, included in which also were the bitter losses of lives and aircraft.        
	The Sukhoi-30 had to go through a thorny path as there developed serious differences of opinion between the designers and the then-Soviet government. In the end, however, the designers and manufacturers maintained [their] loyalty to the long-proven tradition of failing to supply mediocre aircraft to the Air Force inventory of Russia.                
	Heed the warning        
	Although the first series production of the Sukhoi-27 began in 1982, a lot of problems soon arose during its assembling and testing. In 1985 ,during a single flying shift, two aircraft suffered dangerous malfunctions-disintegration of the fuel pump and hydraulic pump, thereby resulting in the grounding of all Sukhoi-27s pending investigation of the reasons behind the failure. The official Russian chronicler of Su-27 Flanker story nevertheless candidly conceded that due to vigorous and mass operation of the Su-27 at the initial stage, there was a multitude of glitches revealed in the airborne equipment and airframe design, to deal with which in production and operation, emergency measures had to be taken and enormous efforts made. Reportedly, the complexity and debugging of the Sukhoi-27 during its series production over the first 10 years saw more than 100,000 modifications being introduced into its design.        
	 According to Janes All the Worlds Aircraft 2008-2009, each Indian Sukhoi-30 has been priced at $20 million, with $8 million extra per aircraft to integrate India-specific systems. Obviously, the IAF Sukhoi-30 fleet does not come cheap for the nation and its tax-payers. Hence it is important to examine whether any serious problem has suddenly cropped up in the aircrafts operation.        
	If media reports are to be believed, fly by wire fault may have had led to the bizarre Sukhoi crash. However, to be fair to the producer and users of the aircraft, one has to await the outcome of the experts findings and reports. It is important, nevertheless, to remember that creating fighter aircraft is a hugely complex and an inherently problematic venture that rarely gives peace of mind to the manufacturers during the gestation period. Thus even the mighty Northrop aviation company of the United States of America faced virtual extinction in the fighter aircraft market after two of its three aircraft crashed fatally during demonstration flights to potential foreign customers in the 1980s. The Sukhoi-30 crash could be a warning for the South Asian arms bazaar. Further adverse publicity may affect the future contract of 126 medium multi-role combat aircraft for the IAF.

                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Bold step                  
	Sir  The Parliament should be complimented for passing the right of children to free and compulsory education bill (Education right scales last big peak, Aug 6). If implemented in letter and spirit, millions of children from different sections of society would benefit from this law. Apart from increasing the number of children getting subsidized, elementary education, the government should also take steps to provide good teachers to schools. The provision for a stipulated teacher-student ratio can be easily exploited. For instance, in schools funded by the central government, the number of teachers is often fudged to cut costs by the school authorities even though it is impossible to maintain the standard of education without a healthy teacher-student ratio. The government should try and plug such loopholes in the system to guard against the possible misuse of the provisions in this radical piece of legislation.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
N. Nagarajan, Secunderabad

                
	Sir  The United Progressive Alliance government must be congratulated for passing a bill to ensure free and compulsory elementary education to a large number of children in India. Now, the government must introduce a deadline to implement the bill effectively.           
	In the past, a number of reputed educational institutions had allegedly acquired land from the government at concessional rates after promising to set up schools that would keep a certain percentage of seats reserved for the weaker sections of society.           
	But these schools did not keep their word. After the passage of the education bill, one hopes that the government will direct these institutions to fulfil their earlier promises.          
	Yours faithfully,       
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta 

                
	Cashless service          
	Sir  The two-day bank strike revealed, yet again, the sad state of affairs prevailing in West Bengal (Cash crunch after strike, Aug 7). During the strike, non-unionized banks operated freely in the other states, but the picture was totally different here. The striking body, the United Forum of Bank Union, forced private banks to close down their branches and ATMs, bringing untold misery on the common people. In a democracy, striking unions have no right to force others to follow their path. Moreover, private sector bank employees, who were willing to report to work, could not do so on account of an indifferent administration. The picketers who held vigil outside banks and ATMs should be punished. But given the present state of affairs in Bengal, this looks difficult to accomplish.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Debasish Chakraborty, Howrah 

                
	Sir  The strike called by a body of public sector bank unions inconvenienced the people, particularly members of the business community. Bank employees are quite well-paid, and their jobs are relatively secure. The employees who participated in the strike could have waited for an appropriate time to press for their demands. Bank employees cannot be allowed to hold the government to ransom when employees in other sectors are having to bear the brunt of the recession. Banks charge customers for the services rendered, but when these institutions decide to go on a strike, they create problems for their customers who are dependent on their services. Strikes demanding pay hikes have become common. The government should either privatize all banks or submit to the demands of public sector bank employees.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
R. Sekar, Visakhapatnam 

                
	Parting shot          
	Sir  My grandmother was admitted to the female ward of the Uttarpara State General Hospital recently. Because of the reputation of state hospitals, we were hesitant to take her there. But considering her age and her illness, we had no option but to rush her to the nearest available health centre. During visiting hours, we were shocked to find cats roaming in the female ward and in the nearby childrens ward. We were also told that the hospital did not have an ICU. By then, my grandmother was no longer in a state to be shifted elsewhere. The hospital did not have a laboratory of its own, and, on one occasion, we found that a new oxygen cylinder stopped working minutes after it being installed. On another occasion, after we found that the saline bottle had run out, we went in search of the attendant and discovered that she had gone to buy paan. Sadly, most government hospitals treat ailing patients in a similar manner.          
	Yours faithfully,

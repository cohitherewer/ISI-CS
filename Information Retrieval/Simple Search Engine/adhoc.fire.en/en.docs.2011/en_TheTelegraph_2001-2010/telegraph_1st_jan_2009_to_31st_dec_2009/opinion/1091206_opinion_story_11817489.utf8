                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	Empty promise                  
	Sir  The dream that things will improve in West Bengal under a new political dispensation seems illusory. A glaring contradiction is apparent in the railways ministers own conduct  on the one hand, she has pledged her support to an austerity drive, but on the other, she has doled out lucrative monetary benefits to her favourite supporters from the public exchequer. One wonders whether the promises made by a party seemingly keen to bring about change will turn out to be as empty as some of the earlier pledges.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Snigdha Sen, Calcutta

                
	Not for the people          
	Sir  The editorial, Cash course (Dec 2), is convincing in its argument. Democracy in India is not for the people; only political parties enjoy the fruits of democracy. Populist agendas are publicized by these parties before an election, but they are conveniently forgotten later even as the leaders form pacts with one another to retain their hold on power. Madhu Koda, the corrupt former chief minister of Jharkhand, had been supported by both the leading parties of the state. They had done so to protect their own interests. The poor people of India are putting up with this deceit since Independence. Now, some of them have raised their voices by lending their support to the Maoists. The deprived sections have fallen prey to the idea of a rebellion, even though it has resulted in the violation of democratic rights.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Dangerous journey          
	Sir  The news report, Young and lost (Nov 22), came as a shock. Many people seem to think that jumping before a train of the Metro Railway is the easiest way to kill oneself. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the media and the authorities to dispel this common notion. If these deaths are publicized unnecessarily, there is a possibility that more people will be tempted to commit similar acts. Television channels, too, must refrain from airing news concerning such events frequently. The Metro authorities, on their part, must ensure that the drivers drive the trains at a slow speed when they enter the platform. There must also be tight vigil in each station to prevent people from stepping beyond the demarcated yellow line.          
	Yours faithfully,       
S.S. Manna, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Efforts by the Metro authorities to prevent the mounting rate of suicides have not borne fruit. Earlier this year, there had been a proposal to put up screen doors on each platform to prevent suicides. But will this plan work, given the costs involved? Instead, slowing down trains just before they reach a station is likely to serve the purpose. If a train driver were to drive cautiously, most of the suicide attempts will prove to be unsuccessful. That way, people will no longer try to end their lives in this manner.           
	Yours faithfully,       
S. Datta, Calcutta 

                          
	Parting shot          
	Sir  Sukanta Chaudhuris article, Presidency: future tense (Dec 3), was quite brilliant. Chaudhuri has succeeded in analyzing the vitiated past and the uncertain future of this premier educational institution in the state of West Bengal.           
	The college has been under the control of Alimuddin Street for a very long time. All these years, the process of appointing teachers to the institution was largely influenced by political interests. Now that the college is about to attain the status of a university, one hopes that the appointment of teaching staff will be fair, and based purely on academic merit.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

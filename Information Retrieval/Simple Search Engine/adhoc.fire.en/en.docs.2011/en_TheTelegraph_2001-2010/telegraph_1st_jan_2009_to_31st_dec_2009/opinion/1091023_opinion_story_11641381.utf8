In this country, however, few memorials have been able to serve this purpose, thanks to the poorly developed sense of conservation among Indians. A.S. Bhallas ROYAL TOMBS OF INDIA: 13TH TO 18TH CENTURY (Mapin, $65) is a tribute to the majesty of 25 royal tombs that have survived the onslaught of time and neglect. The beauty of the monuments, dating from the Slave dynasty in the 13th century to the end of Aurangzebs reign in the 18th, dazzles the eyes even though the photographs are less than unremarkable. On the left are carvings on a Hindu temple pillar, the likes of which inspired the motifs on Islamic tombs. Top is a Tughluq tomb with characteristic lack of ornamentation. Bottom left is the jali screen in Humayuns tomb while bottom right shows floral motifs on the walls of Jahangirs tomb.

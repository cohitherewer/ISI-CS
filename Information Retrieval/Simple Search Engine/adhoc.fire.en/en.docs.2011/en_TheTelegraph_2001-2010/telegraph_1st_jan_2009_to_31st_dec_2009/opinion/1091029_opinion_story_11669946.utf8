The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A fine balance
                                                                                                                 A FINE BALANCE                                                    
	Some analysts called it hawkish; others termed it as baby steps towards an exit. The second quarter review of the Reserve Bank of Indias monetary policy is finely balanced between keeping liquidity in the financial system steady and taking measures towards an exit from the monetary accommodation that was provided in the aftermath of the global financial crisis that severely contracted global growth and dampened Indias growth. The policy review has three objectives: providing an assessment of how the recovery from the economic slowdown has progressed, pointing towards an earlier-than-expected exit from loose monetary policy conditions to stabilize expectations of inflation over the next few months, and initiate some monetary tightening by raising the statutory liquidity ratio for banks back to 25 per cent from 24 per cent, the last of which came as a complete surprise. Most bankers and RBI watchers were expecting a more direct measure on containing liquidity through a hike in the cash reserve ratio.        
	The RBIs tone  both in its assessment of the macroeconomic situation that was made public on the day of the policy review and in the policy statement itself  indicates that the central bank is less certain about whether the recovery is well anchored across the economy; rather it suggests that its recovery has been weaker than expected. Private investment demand is yet to pick up satisfactorily, as is consumption demand, despite the rosy picture in automobile sales and in other products that has been painted by some companies and by stock market performance. The RBIs estimate of inflation at 6.5 per cent in March 2010 lies between the 4.5 per cent advanced by a few optimistic economic researchers and the 8 per cent that the more pessimistic forecasters have suggested. The hike in SLR will not affect liquidity in the market; a CRR hike, on the other hand, could well have pushed overnight interest rates to the upper end of the corridor between the repo and reverse repo rates (at which banks borrow from and lend to the RBI, respectively); the signalling effect may have pushed rates up, something that the RBI is loath to do at this juncture and which could crimp the fledgling recovery. The policy is a paraphrase of a Nobel Prize winning economists aphorism: it has its heart to the left, but its brain to the right.

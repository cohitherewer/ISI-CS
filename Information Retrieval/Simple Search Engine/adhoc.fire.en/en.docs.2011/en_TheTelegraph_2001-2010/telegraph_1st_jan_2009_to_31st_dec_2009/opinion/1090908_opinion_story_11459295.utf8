The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | From tragedy to farce
                                                                                                                 FROM TRAGEDY TO FARCE                                  Malvika Singh                              
	Power, and being victims of the belief that they are all powerful, can be a very destructive aphrodisiac, particularly when the incumbents in powerful positions begin to imagine that nothing can touch them and that they have divine protection. Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy, taking off in bad weather, was asking for trouble. Like others before him, leaders riding the wave, at the height of their working lives, tend to be ruled by bravado and not by sane, calm common sense. Advice to refrain from doing something they are bent upon doing, is an anathema to ambitious individuals in the fast lane. More often than not, a moment comes in their heady, reckless, lives when life itself slips away because of carelessness.        
	Reddy, flying in bad weather, has died. From all reports, he was an able chief minister, a grassroots politician who did not tolerate dissension, who expected Congressmen and women to fall in line with his views, and ruled his local party wing and the state like a satrap. With no second-in-command in place, no leadership trained to take the baton and run with it, and with no democratic infrastructure within the party fora that could cushion the blow and allow for sensible succession plans, the Congress went into a tailspin. Hysteria seemed to compel the Andhra Pradesh cabinet to recommend Reddys son as the rightful successor. But, in fact, Reddy had ruled with an iron hand, silencing all who confronted or contradicted him much like a dictator. It is becoming clear that he had managed to hold together a divided party with a rather tenuous string, one that was manipulated by him and him alone. In sheer fear, desperate to survive the aftermath, members of the Andhra cabinet used an emotional moment to endorse the son, become loyalists and buy their ongoing place in the sun.                
	Mock despair        
	The press  as it regaled us with endless repetitions of the same few details over 36 hours, with all channels showing the same visuals and speaking the same half-truths couched in conjecture  did not have any intelligent take on this rather absurd political happening. Now, with the weekend behind us, it may begin to address the reality for what it is rather than continue with the theatre of the absurd. General secretaries of the party sitting in Delhi can play ducks and drakes with the unfolding saga, make a muddle of the entire exercise, and then put their hands up in mock despair as they pass the buck to the high command. It is time to call the bluff of all the people who have spent decades destroying the party and its mechanism.        
	On the one hand, Rahul Gandhi is trying to instil democratic methods within the Congress and on the other, old, failed hands are busy discrediting him and his endeavour by operating against his mandate for the future. Is this how the oldies, those who rule the All India Congress Committee, want to make a mockery of what their future leader is religiously working towards? Is this a silent and polite way of discrediting him? Did M. Veerappa Moily think he was currying favour with the general secretary of the Youth Congress when he stated that Jaganmohan Reddy was a young leader and, therefore, there was nothing wrong with suggesting his name for the chief ministers post although the final call would be from 10 Janpath? The trajectory of the tale has moved rather rapidly from a dreadful tragedy to an inappropriate farce.        
	Will the shift start now or will we have to wait a few more years for the old operating style to undergo a radical overhaul? Will Rahul Gandhis generation take over the revamping of the AICC, and the party functioning? Will Jaganmohan Reddy be sent on a year-long padayatra to discover Andhra Pradesh before he is anointed? Or will he fall into the trap of you scratch my back and Ill scratch yours-type politics?

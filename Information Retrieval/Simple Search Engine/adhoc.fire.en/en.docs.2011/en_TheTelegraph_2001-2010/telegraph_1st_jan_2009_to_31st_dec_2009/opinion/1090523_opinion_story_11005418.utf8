The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Too many pictures
                                                                                                                 TOO MANY PICTURES                              Visual Arts      Aveek Sen                                                
	It was difficult to walk around Shadi Ghadirians exhibition of photographs at 46, Satish Mukherjee Road (April 8-19) without knocking against pictures. For photography to make proper sense, there must be no clutter. Commercially, the temptation to show too much proves difficult to resist. As a result, a photography show could end up looking like a poster sale. In Ghadirians, there was an accompanying little book with a long, all-clarifying interview, and explanations of everything (most of it offered by the photographer herself). So what was the point of putting all that again on the walls, placing too many photographs alongside too many words (there was no information about editions and medium though)?        
	Given the limited space afforded by the venue, only two of the five series, perhaps Qajar and Like Everyday, would have been enough to give an idea of the range and preoccupations of Ghadirians work. And perhaps a little note about her life in Iran placed somewhere unobtrusively. That she is primarily interested in making work about the realities of women, and about the clash between modernity and tradition in her own society, is fairly obvious, and saying it in so many words, and so many times, could make it rather limiting and tiring for the viewer. To risk a clich, the best images speak for themselves, and no amount of historical context can rescue photography from predictability.

                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Out of the corner                  
	Sir Some valid points have been raised in the editorial, Q not an issue (April 30). In spite of L.K. Advanis hue and cry over the investigation into Ottavio Quattrocchis role in the Bofors scandal, in which he blamed the prime minister and Sonia Gandhi for concealing the truth, with nothing emerging after two decades of inquiry, it has to be accepted that legally, Mr Quattrocchi is innocent.           
	People wonder why the National Democratic Alliance failed to bring Quattrocchi to book when Advani was the deputy prime minister and home minister, and the Central Bureau of Investigation was directly under his jurisdiction. Moreover, people would also want to know whether the Bofors file that the former NDA convenor and then Union defence minister, George Fernandes, perused, and of which the NDA prime minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, was apparently fully aware of, had anything in it that was incriminating. Some Bharatiya Janata Party leaders have claimed that the NDA followed legal procedures meticulously. If so, then they have to say why Bofors remained an unsolved case at the end of the NDAs term. That itself is proof that either Advani found nothing against Quattrocchi or he wanted to use the Q factor as and when required to improve his partys fortunes. After all, Bofors is a very emotive issue in India.           
	The Bofors case has haunted Indians for almost two decades. To resolve the issue for good, the CBI must be allowed to function independently. Its chief should be appointed by members of parliament from both the ruling party and the Opposition. Besides investigators, the CBI should also be manned by lawyers.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad

      
	Sir  According to the Congress spokesman, the NDA did not do anything to bring Ottavio Quattrocchi to book during its term from October 1999 to April 2004. It, therefore, becomes pertinent to ask the Congress what steps it has taken to corner this international crook, during the time it has been in power from May 2004 till date. In fact, the Congress appears to have done everything, covertly or overtly, to help the businessman escape the clutches of the Indian law. The Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government delayed its submission before the Argentinian court. Recently, the freeze on his accounts in London was lifted, and now Interpol has been told to remove the red corner notice in his name.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Arun Malankar, Mumbai

                
	Sir  The editorial, Q not an issue, will clear doubts in peoples minds. The issue of Quattrocchi seemed to have become a football that was being kicked around by various teams. That the BJP did nothing to bring the alleged culprit to book was enough to prove that the party wanted to keep the ghost of Bofors alive in order to flog the Congress whenever suitable. This was purely an opportunistic approach.           
	The courts should have set a timeframe to prove the charges against the accused. The delay was totally unethical, more so because the prestige of an internationally renowned company, which supplied us with guns of proven quality, and that of a businessman, were at stake without any substantive proof of bad practices against them. It had become a mockery of the Indian judicial system.           
	Some vested interests have now started questioning the CBIs role. What could the CBI have done other than clear Quattrocchis name in the absence of proof? Yes, it could have sat on the case for a few decades more and become a laughing stock. Either way, the CBIs prestige was getting a knock. There is no doubt that the CBI chose the right path at last.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

                
	Different system          
	Sir  The political situation of a country affects one and all; so elections should be of prime concern for each and every citizen. The poor turnout of voters in Mumbai was undoubtedly disgraceful.By not casting ones vote, does one display despondency or indifference? Whatever it may be, refraining from the system is not going to help. If one wishes to purge the system, one has to make an effort to be a part of it and to change it from within. Neglecting the system will only make matters worse. What is required of the citizen of urban India is to decide what he wants his future to be. Does the poor turnout indicate that urban citizens no longer have any hope?           
	Their hopes have certainly dried up. That is inevitable when a voter has to choose among the useless, the worthless and the hopeless. What would motivate him to go and vote when he knows that, whatever the result, he has to bear the brunt of everything, be it an economic downturn or a terrorist attack? Must this state of helplessness be tolerated or is there something that can be done to come out of it?           
	We have been voting inefficient people to power. Most of them are uneducated, incapable of managing their own households but ready to shoulder the task of managing the country. We all know they hardly do any good. Whatever little progress India is making in the public sector is mainly owing to intelligent officers in the bureaucracy. Not all of them are true to their jobs, but it can be expected that education has inculcated some values that deter them from going astray.           
	The only hope for citizens would be a system manned by such officers, in which everything can be better organized, without the constant meddling of those ministers who only impede Indias path to progress.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Varun Sethi, Calcutta

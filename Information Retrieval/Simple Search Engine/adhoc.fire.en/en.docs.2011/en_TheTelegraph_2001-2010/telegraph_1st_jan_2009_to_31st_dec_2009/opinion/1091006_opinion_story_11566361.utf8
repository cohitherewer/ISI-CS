	Not that bleak                  
	Sir  Ashok Mitra has rightly pointed out the misery of Indian farmers in The new gold rush (Sept 28). But instead of blaming the affluent cricketing establishment, he should have identified the reasons for the farmers penury and a possible solution to the problem. Although the majority of Indias workforce are employed in agriculture, their contribution to the economy is not considerable.           
	Archaic methods of farming result in poor productivity. Mechanized farming, as practised in developed countries, would yield more food and involve far lesser number of workers. While nearly 60 per cent of the workforce in India belong to the agricultural sector, the figure stands at 1.8 per cent and 2 per cent in the United Kingdom and in the United States of America respectively. The challenge facing the government is to modernize agriculture and then generate fresh employment for farmers. This would necessitate privatization. However, not only the Left but also other political parties are opposed to corporate farming that can benefit the economy.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Ashok Mitra predicts a bleak future for Indias agriculture. He says confidently that the country is currently experiencing one of the worst droughts in recent decades and food is likely to be in very short supply. He goes on to add, Millions of people, particularly small farmers and landless wage-workers, will possibly starve. Such gloomy predictions have been made earlier as well. In this connection, Amartya Sen, while delivering the first Hiren Mukherjee Memorial Lecture in the Central Hall of Parliament, admitted that while no famine has visited India since Independence, millions of people have died of hunger in China since the 1950s. Mitra is perhaps underestimating Indias capability. The total grain production in India has followed an upward curve since the 1950s, and Mitra must be aware that in case of a shortfall, foodgrain can be imported. Many countries such as the UK and Japan depend on imported food. It has never been heard that people living in those countries have died of hunger. International cooperation results in nations coming to one anothers rescue, as was evident during famines in some African countries. The USs mammoth food aid to India at the time of the Cold War under PL 480 is perhaps not unknown to the writer. Apart from this, many a drought and flood have occurred in India but they could never devastate the country. India has the strength to overcome all mishaps.          
	Mitra is aggrieved that the benefits of growth in the gross domestic product is not shared by a vast number of rural people. Rural electrification in Andhra Pradesh, for example, shows that villages too have gained from the increase in the GDP.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Ashok Mitra tries to be as provocative as Nirad C. Chaudhuri was in his writings. But whereas Chaudhuris writings were backed by extensive research, Mitras is driven by a dislike of anything contrary to leftist beliefs. Mitra predicts doomsday for agriculturists without looking back on the past to find out what happened in the drought years. He mentions Norman Borlaug but not Swaminathan and his team who introduced the hybrid dwarf variety of rice. Mitra seems almost pained by the steadying GDP of India, but is happy that America has reached zero economic growth.           
	Then he delves into the Indian Premier League and the lure of money it holds out to a few rich individuals in India and abroad without caring to reflect on what the bid price would be for a lame horse such as Andrew Flintoff or Brendon McCullum who have not done well last year.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Early blow          
	Sir  India s debacle in the Champions Trophy can be attributed to Mahendra Singh Dhonis lack of judgment as captain (Dhonis men left high and dry, Oct 1). His earlier astuteness and desire to win were missing in the game India lost against Pakistan, which effectively knocked India out of the tournament. When Pakistan were three wickets down, instead of going for the kill, Dhoni resorted to his second-line bowlers, giving Pakistan an opportunity to put up a decent total. Did Dhoni know what had to be done against Pakistan? If he did not, there were experienced players like Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid who could have been consulted.           
	Yours faithfully,      
S. Kamat, Bardez, Goa 

                
	Sir  Indias much-hyped campaign in the Champions Trophy ended early. But one should not blame only the players for the early exit. While the Board of Control for Cricket in India makes a lot of money from the game, the planning and scheduling of matches seem to be bereft of all logic. The schedule deprives players of much-needed rest and tends to burn them out. If future tournaments are not planned keeping the players fitness in mind, the BCCI will end up killing its golden goose.           
	Yours faithfully,        Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad            
	Parting shot          
	Sir  As the demand for khoya kheer increases in the festive season, harmful synthetic khoya is sold in open markets in Delhi. Private and co-operative milk processing units such as Mother Dairy or Amul should arrange for the manufacture and sale of pure khoya in packets to safeguard the health of consumers. Now that cattle sheds have been removed from urban areas, the government should ensure the availability of milk products that can be safely consumed at its milk-distribution centres.           
	Yours faithfully,      
M. Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

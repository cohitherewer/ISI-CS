	You may be amused by this photograph of five children in a state of high excitement, but you could be getting it all wrong. On its own, the image conveys no clear message; its effect on the viewer is perhaps temporary, even negligible. But the caption claims that the photograph was taken on February 10, 2009 (the day Israel went to the polls), and shows Ultra-Orthodox Jewish children in the Mea Shearim neighbourhood of Jerusalem. (Is it significant that the photograph was taken by someone called Mahfouz Abu Turk?) Without justifying the absurdity of qualifying childhood as Ultra-Orthodox, the caption allows a meaning to cohere around the image, though that sense does not come through in this representation of childhood. Despite its little jabs, the image does not really offer any insight into the lives of these children. Only when those loaded words are tagged to the picture do we become privy to an individual perspective asking us to see the photograph through someone elses eyes. The image belongs to the familiar iconography of childhood innocence, but is chillingly twisted by the text.        
	Childhood, especially in relation to political violence, provides an ever-ready template for photojournalists to manipulate the viewers emotions. The image of a naked girl fleeing with other children has now become iconic of American oppression during the Vietnam War, just as the pictures of dead or injured children in Gaza are routinely used to condemn Israel. In case of the latter, the images do not merely capture the human cost of the struggle in the Middle East, but also advance the Palestinian cause. Recently, pictures of another Jewish child, Moshe, playing with a red ball or weeping in his nannys arms at the funeral of his parents, were used to evoke the same combination of outrage and sadness: Moshes parents had been killed by terrorists in the 26/11 Mumbai attacks.         
	It is possible to respond to pictures of wounded Palestinian children or of little Moshe viscerally  for what they depict  without being aware of their histories. But when an image is far from sensational or simply intriguing (say, of children playing among the rubble of what used to be their homes), then words are considered essential to help us anchor our responses. Is this why it becomes so important to describe children as ultra-orthodox, to have them embedded in a history? Without such markers, these images could look too universally authentic, and that is something impermissible in the republic of media images. It is imperative to reclaim each moment from uncertainties, to articulate the unspoken, to let knowledge prevail over intuition. Everybody wants a monopoly on suffering.

	The official recognition of the phenomenon of sexual harassment at the workplace is one of the major successes of the womens movement in India. Laws do not change society, but the Supreme Courts guidelines regarding sexual harassment at the workplace and the courts insistence on creating institutional mechanisms to address it have achieved at least some of the awareness that is the first step towards change. One advantage of implementing rules against sexual harassment at the workplace is that, by definition, the scope of the offence is limited within the space of each institution. But arrayed against this advantage are numerous problems, not the least of which is the established tendency to play down womens complaints that have a sexual or gendered basis. As a result, women are often unwilling to complain, not wishing to be seen making a fuss, at the cost of dignity, stability and efficiency. Even more confusing is the elusive quality of the offence, for it is not always physical or even culpably verbal, and not always obvious to anyone but the person who feels humiliated or disturbed. On top of that, there are pure misunderstandings, where the offence is real for the complainant but unintended on the part of the accused. So although the action against sexual harassment at the workplace has got off to an uneven start, it is a long way from being satisfactory.        
	The Supreme Courts recent concern about this, particularly with regard to educational institutions, is not surprising. It has asked a senior counsel to list suggestions for the prevention of harassment in colleges and universities. This would mean another set of guidelines specially geared to educational institutions. It could be asked, however, whether more dos and donts would actually be helpful. Certainly, there are some practical steps that can be taken. Security on university campuses could be held to fixed standards and regularly reviewed, all buildings and grounds better lit, help made accessible to hostels at all times, and visitors adequately registered at entry points. Central to the programme should be sensitization sessions for students, teachers and non-teaching staff, as well as forums created for discussions and counselling. Although sensitization is important for all workplaces, it is especially meaningful when the participants are young learners about to enter the adult world.        
	The court is anxious to prevent harassment, and these steps might help lessen its incidence. But to be more effective, guidelines should also clarify certain distinct aspects of the problem. One of the most disturbing aspects of sexual harassment is that it is exploitative; it is related to the abuse of power. This is as possible within a college or university as it is in an office or bank. This kind of harassment is different from that by a colleague or fellow student, which can be anything from humiliating or disruptive to threatening, even violent. It is as important to arm the potential victim as it is to warn the possible aggressor. Beside the sheltering presence of court-recommended complaint cells, individuals must also assert their right to dignity, respect and a non-discriminatory environment for study and work.

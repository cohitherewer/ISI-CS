                                                                                                                 BANISHED TO A FORGOTTEN CORNER                                  THEATRE: Ananda Lal                                                  
	Ever active, involved in some aspect of theatre or the other, Rangakarmee took another step forward at its Natya Mahotsav this year by presenting three new hour-long productions in three different languages: Hindi, Bengali and Urdu. Rangakarmees powerhouse, Usha Ganguli, surrendered her directors chair on these three ventures to younger, but established, names  Goutam Halder, Koushik Sen and Azhar Aalam respectively  so that her large troupe could gain from the experience of working under various styles and methods.        
	For Burhi Kaki, Halder had dramatized into Bengali Premchands short story, revived rather commonly nowadays, about an unfed, old aunt ignored by her entire family celebrating her grandnephews wedding. Suryakant Tewari, in turn, translated Halders version into Hindi. Halder mounts an energetic interpretation that on the surface expresses the inhuman callousness held up to our view by Premchand but, more importantly, by playing down the widows passion for food, he brings out an allegorical dimension it does seem that she represents starving India, outside the vision of shining India. The marked contrast designed by Soumik-Piyali between the festive costumes and set and the shabbily-clad protagonist segregated in a shed at one corner reinforces this impression. Usha Ganguli takes up the role of deprivation to the hilt, moving herself on her haunches across the stage, as the character cannot walk. A typical Rangakarmee ensemble performance in which everyone in the cast contributes, it includes a charming cameo by Aayushi Das (picture), the little girl who has a soft spot for her grandaunt.        
	In Kata Kuti, Ujjwal Chattopadhyay dramatized Joy Goswamis recent autobiographical story, Ghas Phuler Kabi, on a poets economic and domestic hardship. A fit subject for Koushik Sen, because he is partial to poets, it also partly reminds us of Jibanananda Dass Malyaban, which Sen had directed for his own group. It conveys the injustice of an artist having to eke out a daily living somehow, rejected by his publisher for wanting to improve his manuscript after it has gone to press, chided by his wife for failing to provide for the home, ribbed in his newspaper office for his perfectionism in proofreading, and forced into writing a screenplay for money. What is the fine line that an artist must tread between creativity and social compromise? The poet periodically drifts off into conversations with his imaginary muse, a young boy (a motif repeated in Chattopadhyays new play for Sen, Sraban Haoya). Partha Sarathi Sarkar and Reshmi Sen as the couple hold our interest, though her participation is curious, since she does not belong to Rangakarmee.        
	Azhar Aalam adapted the all-women Chehre into Urdu from The Sins of the Mother by Tony Devaney Morinelli, who created it for female students of drama in the United States of America. Originally about three generations of Irish-American women who led and lead troubled, trapped lives as a result of the grandmothers oppression in the past, it recalls Lorcas House of Bernarda Alba and, at times, nearly slips into anti-alcoholic propaganda. But Aalam bravely transfers it into Indian Muslim society, and makes the acting far superior to the script. Usha Ganguli is fine as the inebriated mother on her birthday, but particularly excellent performances come from the trio of Bengali actresses unexpectedly fluent in Urdu: Senjuti Roy Mukherjee as the dutiful daughter and Sohini Mukherjee as the rebellious daughter, both unmarried and living with their mother, and Sraboni Bhadury as her catty, upwardly-mobile sister. Chehre should prove a shot in the arm for Urdu theatre.        
	Despite its melodramatic closure, Chehre has a frisson that Aalams own group, Little Thespian, lacks in Katha Collage 4, directed by Uma Jhunjhunwala, the fourth in its series of short stories dramatized into Urdu. Frankly, this editions two tales on love did not deserve staging. Ismail Choonaras English story, Afternoon, transformed into Dopahar, presents a married ladys bittersweet monologue anticipating a former beaus arrival. Muzaffar Hanfis Ishq Par Zor farcically treats a blind servants pretensions to love. The first is too sickly sentimental, and the second, bordering on the politically incorrect, is hardly funny. I do believe that Little Thespian should bring down the curtain on these little collages and return to full-length theatre.

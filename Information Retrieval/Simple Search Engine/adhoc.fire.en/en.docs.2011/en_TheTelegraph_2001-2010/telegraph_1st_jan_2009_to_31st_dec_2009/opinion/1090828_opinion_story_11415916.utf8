                                                                                                                 LOOK WITHIN                                                    
	A bishop, from the Greek episkopos, is one who looks in on. So, he is a mortal creature who has been elected by god to a position of overseeing authority in church government. This divides the church vertically between the clergy and the laity. Such a divide, existing from the earliest years of organized Christianity, seems to have taken on a new life in India. Some influential lay members of the Indian Catholic community have publicly demanded a law according to which church property  worth several lakh crore  would come under the supervision of the government. But the bishops are firm in resisting this demand. For them, this would break down the crucial separation between Church and State, paving the way for political intervention and control, thereby compromising Indias secular foundations. Interestingly, it is the community itself that has invited the States active role in the administration of church property. Lay Catholics who have asked for such a law have expressed reverence for their bishops in matters of faith, but not of property. Some of them have even found the Indian State discriminatory in taking upon itself the administration of Hindu, Sikh and Muslim property, but letting the Christian churches manage their earthly possessions under their own laws, particularly canon law.        
	This does leave the Indian State in a peculiar dilemma, for seldom does a minority community actually invite the government to intervene actively. The problem is usually the other way round  the State being asked to back off, as happened a few months ago in Madhya Pradesh, when its Bharatiya Janata Party government proposed a waqf-like board to manage Christian properties. It might look as if the church operates as a State within the State, with its own systems of governance and vigilance. But, although holding property by the church is guaranteed under Article 26 of the Constitution, the provisions of the existing Indian laws and of the Indian Penal Code are quite adequate to deal with cases of corruption and other financial irregularities. All church organizations are governed by the law regarding firms and societies, and have to submit audited accounts, for instance. If this is, then, a question of greater transparency and accountability on the part of the clergy, it is perhaps advisable that the matter be resolved without the further involvement of the State. Yet, it is obvious, too, that the community itself remains divided on this issue.

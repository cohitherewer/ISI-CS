The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Things that Matter
                                                                                                                 THINGS THAT MATTER                                  Stephen Hugh-Jones      
	It had to happen, I suppose, and it did. But it still left me shaken. Yet there it was, slap on the front page of the London Times: the state of Britains public finances may mitigate against further investment of British blood and money in Afghanistan.        
	A good thing too, in my view. But mitigate against? Merciful heaven, this is the sort of crass error that educated Britons (Times journalists, for example) used to deride as the semi-literacy of the semi-educated. If, like me, youre one of those people who habitually whisper to themselves the words theyre about to write, some quirk of the brain makes it possible to write right when you mean write, or seen for scene. I know, because Ive done it. But I cant find any such excuse for mitigate in place of militate. There must be some writer on The Times who genuinely thinks mitigate is the right word in the passage Ive cited. Yes, and some sub-editor who let it pass (or put it in)  presumably on into the very last edition of the night, since a week later it was still there in the papers online version.        
	And this in the newspaper which, in its heyday, could fairly claim to be the grandest in the English-speaking world (and which today is busy organizing competitive spelling bees for schools across the country so the kids can show they know propah English, nah).        
	And there I come belatedly to my point, which isnt to be rude about The Times. I doubt that any reader of the Calcutta Telegraph was thrown by my mis-spelling of proper, to reproduce what Britons like to mock as the cut-glass pronunciation of the well-bred. I should think most Telegraph readers could guess, if they didnt know, that nah is a colloquial word, from a much lower grade of British English, meaning roughly indeed or yes, really. To put the two together in one sentence is pretty daft, unless youre being satirical. Yet even in West Bengal, as in Britain, the result surely must have been understandable.        
	And there we come to one of the most heated questions about modern English: so long as the result is understandable, does it matter if language is used incorrectly? Do we need standard English at all? Google the word sociolinguistics (the study of language in relation to its sociocultural context) plus, for example, the name of Professor John Honey, and youll meet some ferocious inter-academic slanging, the sort youd sooner expect when one brand of Trotskyite is airing his views on another.        
	I think correct English matters, and not just because employers like to think so too, or at least to imagine or claim that they do. Im not quite so sure about spelling, and recently raised some hackles by saying so (for pitys sake, what are hackles? Answer: the hairs on a dogs back that stick up when its angry, but that doesnt matter a damn, so long as youre using the metaphor correctly and not, for example, writing roused some hackles or wrung some hackles). Im not even so sure what I mean by correct; certainly less sure than Mr Honey is, though I lean his way. But yes, it matters.        
	I cant go into all this now: it would take megabytes. But Ill be back to the issue  though less lengthily, I hope, and no doubt The Telegraphs sub- editors do, than that.

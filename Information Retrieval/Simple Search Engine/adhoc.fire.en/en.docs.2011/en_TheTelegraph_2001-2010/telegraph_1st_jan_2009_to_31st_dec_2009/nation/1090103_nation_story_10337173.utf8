The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Antony turns up Pak heat
                                                                                                               Antony turns up Pak heat
          JAYANTH JACOB                           Antony in New Delhi on Friday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 2: India today kept up pressure on Pakistan to act against terror outfits, saying there was no change in Islamabads attitude after the Mumbai attacks.         
	Statements are not important, actions are important. That way, I do not think there is any noticeable change in the act of Pakistan. They (Pakistan) should prove that by action, defence minister A.K. Antony said.         
	More than 30 terror outfits are still active in Pakistan. So how can I say that there is a real change in Pakistans attitude? There is no time limit but it must act, he added.         
	India would not be unhappy if those behind the Mumbai attacks are brought to internationally acceptable justice and are kept out of mischief, sources said.        
	The Dawn reported today that the US was no longer asking Pakistan to extradite the suspects to India but wanted them to be prosecuted with sufficient efforts to ensure conviction. The newspaper said the change followed a realisation in Washington that it would be difficult for Pakistan to hand over key Lashkar-e-Toiba  the group India, the US and the UK have blamed for the attacks  leaders to India.        
	Delhi did not react to this report, saying it had not received any formal communication from the US.        
	The ends of justice should be met. These actors should be brought under internationally acceptable justice. They should be kept out of mischief (against India). It should not be an apology of justice. We also want a transparent, verifiable investigation into the role of elements based in Pakistani territory, a government source said.        
	India has so far sought the custody of the Mumbai attackers but the sources admitted that the US has more leverage with Pakistan. The sources said India would not be unhappy if the US could force Pakistan to dismantle the terror infrastructure on its soil.        
	Islamabad should be ready for transparent and verifiable investigations into the role played by elements in its territory in the Mumbai attacks, the sources said.         
	External affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee said it was Pakistans responsibility to act against the terror groups operating from its territory since it was party to various international conventions, adds PTI.        
	When LeT (Lashkar) was banned, it came up as Jamaat-ud-Dawa. Now it has been banned, it might have taken another name.... This is the pattern we have noticed in Pakistan, Mukherjee said. It is the responsibility of the Pakistan government to stop activities of these banned organisations in any form, in any name, in any shape.        
	The comment followed reports that the Dawa, a front for the Lashkar banned by the UN after the Mumbai attacks, was renaming itself Tehreek-e-Hurmat-e-Rasool.        
	Antony said Pakistan had no right to advise India on de-escalation  the neighbour had asked Delhi to withdraw ground troops and de-activate forward air bases.         
	Nobody will tell us, after 26/11 we must be prepared to meet any eventuality. It is our duty. The armed forces are doing their duty. They are not escalating anything. They are not doing any power projection. They are doing their duty. They have to be fully prepared to meet any challenge from any quarter, any threat from any quarter, he said.

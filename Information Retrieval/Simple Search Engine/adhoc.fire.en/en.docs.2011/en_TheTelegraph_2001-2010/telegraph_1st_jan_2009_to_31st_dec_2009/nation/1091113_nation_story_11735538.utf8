  - Panel to protect parliament                          Parliament: Time for house-keeping                          
	At 82, it has seen off an empire, survived a terrorist attack, hosted 13 Prime Ministers and outlasted more than a dozen governments. Now, even a nail to pass through its walls will need the permission of its keepers.        
	Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumars plan to preserve the heritage status of Parliament House got an enthusiastic thumbs-up at an all-party meeting today where leaders across the political divide agreed that a joint parliamentary committee would oversee its maintenance.        
	Now even if a nail has to be fixed, the committees permission will have to be sought, Meira Kumar said after the meeting.        
	The decision to assign the responsibility to the JPC came amid concerns about the ageing building, built in 1927, after bricks and concrete started falling off occasionally in the recent past.        
	The JPC, to be headed by the Lok Sabha Speaker, will now oversee the maintenance of the building with the help of a technical advisory committee.        
	The Lok Sabha secretary-general will head the advisory panel, which would include eminent architects, historians and those attached with the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage and the national museum.        
	Kumar had recently voiced concern that the building, stormed by militants in December 2001, was showing distressing signs. After todays decision, all heritage norms will be strictly applied on Indias temple of democracy, a huge circular structure that comprises three semicircular chambers for the legislatures and a Central Library crowned by a 27.4m-high dome.        
	The colonial edifice, home to some 800 members and opened by governor-general Lord Irwin, measures 173m in diameter and covers an area of 2.02 hectares with colonnaded verandas enclosing the entire circumference.        
	The three semicircular areas were designed for the Chamber of Princes, the Council of States and the Legislative Assembly. Today, they house the Lok Sabha, the Rajya Sabha, the library and the Central Hall.        
	The unity of purpose among the leaders was, however, restricted to preserving the buildings heritage status  the overriding concern was the agenda for the winter session beginning next Thursday.        
	The Speaker herself admitted she was expecting a stormy session amid rising prices and increasing Maoist violence. We look forward to a stormy session with heated discussions, otherwise it will get very boring, she said.         
	She said all parties had assured her they would extend support for the smooth running of the House.        
	Some members expressed concern at reduced duration of sessions and wanted the government to ensure at least 100 sittings every year.         
	Parliamentary affairs minister P.K. Bansal said the government was game but asked political parties to help it prepare the schedule.        
	Among those who attended the meeting from the Opposition were L.K. Advani, H.D. Deve Gowda, Ajit Singh, Samajwadi Party leader Reoti Raman Singh, Basudeb Acharia and Gurudas Dasgupta.

	Bhubaneswar, May 23: Wildlife conservationists today expressed concern over high mortality of endangered Olive Ridley sea turtles on the Orissa coast.        
	While people celebrate World Turtle Day today, there is little to cheer for the Olive Ridleys here, said Biswajit Mohanty, the co-ordinator of Operation Kachhapa, a turtle conservation project.         
	During the past 15 years, carcasses of more than 1.5 lakh turtles have been found on the Orissa coast, which has earned the dubious title of being the worlds largest turtle graveyard.         
	This year was also a nightmare for the Olive Ridley sea turtles, as at least 10,000 of their carcasses were washed ashore, claimed Mohanty.        
	In India, this species is as protected as the tiger and the elephant being listed under Schedule I to the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. Trapping, killing or selling this species could result in a maximum of seven years imprisonment. However, not a single person has been convicted in Orissa for killing sea turtles, rued the wildlife activist.        
	The endangered Olive Ridleys continue to be massacred despite directions passed in April 2004 by the central empowered committee of the Supreme Court to protect them. The apathetic Orissa government continues to neglect turtle protection in spite of several appeals by international and national wildlife conservation groups to save them, alleged Mohanty.        
	Trawler crews often batter the heads of the trapped turtles and cut off their flippers This year, even the Gahirmatha marine sanctuary recorded the death of thousands of Olive Ridleys because of uncontrolled illegal fishing.         
	Turtles are also massacred at the Devi river mouth where illegal fishing is rampant. This year, at least 2,000 turtles died at the Devi river mouth alone, he alleged.

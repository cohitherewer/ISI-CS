The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | PAC heat on HRD secretary
                                                                                                               PAC heat on HRD secretary
                            
	Patna, July 26 (PTI): The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) of Bihar Assembly today recommended the demotion of human resource development secretary Sanjeev Kumar Sinha for not putting certain facts before the accountant-general (AG).         
	In its report, the AG had observed that an excess payment of Rs 10.71 crore was made between 2001-02 and 2006-07 to 51 teachers of a Bihar University in Muzaffarpur whose services were illegally regularised.        
	In light of facts mentioned in the report, HRDs additional commissioner-cum-secretary Sanjeev Kumar Sinha should be demoted immediately... and transferred for his irresponsible behaviour, observed PAC, headed by Abdul Bari Siddiqui. The report was tabled in the Assembly.        
	The committee also observed that Sinha and former director of higher education Dhananjay Kumar used the AGs objections as a tool to inflict mental torture on 51 university teachers. This is an example of blind bureaucracy.         
	The PAC also passed strictures against university Vice Chancellor Rajdev Singh, the former director of higher education Dhananjay Kumar, Registrar and the university finance officer for their behaviour, challenging the authority of the committee and violating the privileges of PAC.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, June 15: Tension reigned in Narayanpatna village of Koraput from early morning as members of the tribal community forcibly ploughed acres owned by non-tribal members, while taking out an armed rally complete with traditional weapons and large groups.        
	With red ribbons tied to their foreheads, men, women and children gathered under the banner of Chasi Mulia Adivasi Sangha, a body that allegedly enjoys Maoist support, around 5am to start a crusade against tribal exploitation.        
	Men with ploughs, cattle and oxen forcibly ploughed fields, planted red flags and then declared them as free lands. The process continued till 9am, till the district collector, Bichitrananda Das, and superintendent of police Deepak Kumar intervened. The duo carried out rounds of talks with both groups.         
	Narayanpatna residents are divided into two major groups. While sangha members are called Sangham, the opponents are named Anasangham and primarily consist of landlords, moneylenders, liquor traders, contactors and politicians.        
	The sangha has been fighting against the alleged Anasangham practise of usurping land that once belonged to tribals. Their demands also include cessation of liquor trade in the region, action against police officers who have wrongly punished tribals in false cases, action against those who abused Adivasi women and a minimum wage of Rs 70 per day.         
	Their claims also received the support from a team of Odisha Shanti--Sadbhabana Abhiyan, led by Ratan Das, that visited the affected villages. The team confirmed that some 211 families in the region have lost their homes and have been forced to stay at tehsil offices, in colleges or have taken to sleeping under the open sky after their land was taken away.        
	The Sangha has also demanded the reconstruction of damaged houses, broken by members of the Anasangham. Nachika Linga, the sangha leader, said that 150 acres are now under illegal possession.

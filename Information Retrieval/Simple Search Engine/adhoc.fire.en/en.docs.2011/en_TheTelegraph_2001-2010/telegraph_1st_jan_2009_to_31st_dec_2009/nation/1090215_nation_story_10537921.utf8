The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Urban job plan on govt table
                                                                                                               Urban job plan on govt table

	New Delhi, Feb. 14: The Centre is planning an employment guarantee scheme for urban areas similar to its rural job scheme, which it feels has paid dividends in state elections.        
	This scheme, and another one to promote tiny industry clusters around the country, could be part of the interim budget.         
	The schemes are being developed as a lifeline for the urban jobless and the lakhs of workers sacked by textile mills, brass foundries and jewellery workshops amid the economic slowdown.        
	Under the job scheme, the urban unemployed will be guaranteed paid manual work for 100 days a year in public projects such as road and infrastructure repair and construction. The political benefits for the UPA could be the highest in towns like Tiruppur, Coimbatore, Ahmedabad and Mirzapur, the layoff-hit hubs of garment, jewellery and handicraft export.        
	Officials said the scheme could be launched in about 20 cities and could cost the government up to Rs 5,000 crore.        
	The other scheme will promote special economic zone-like clusters for small entrepreneurs whom the government will provide with credit as well as marketing and technological help.        
	The small and medium enterprises ministry, working on the scheme along with the Planning Commission, has identified clusters across the country that it would try to help.         
	These include the forging workshops of Howrah, bell metal units in Behram- pore (Bengal), textile clusters in Andhra Pradesh and engineering clusters in Coimbatore.        
	Congress MP and economist Arjun Sengupta had mooted the idea in a letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and party chief Sonia Gandhi, adding that the clusters be given tax sops and other incentives that SEZs get. Its not clear if this part has been accepted.        
	Officials said China had done just that and created extremely successful, low-cost production bases for a large number of manufactures. Tiny industries have specialised in manufacturing parts, which they sell to each other to produce whole products that are sold to the outside world.        
	An Indian labour ministry study has revealed that between October and December, five lakh workers had lost their jobs in industries such as textiles and garment, metals and metal products, automobiles, gems and jewellery, transport, construction and mining.

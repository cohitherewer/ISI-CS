The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Dalit leader evicted, Cong office ransacked
                                                                                                               Dalit leader evicted, Cong office ransacked
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                          Athawale      
	New Delhi, Sept. 18: Dalit leader Ramdas Athawale, who was evicted today from his posh Lodhi estate bungalow here, alleged that the Congress was victimising him for his refusal to offer support to the party in the upcoming Maharashtra Assembly elections.        
	Supporters of Athawale, who is the president of the Republican Party of India (RPI), vandalised the Congress office in South Mumbai. The air-conditioned office, which was renovated and re-christened Rajiv Gandhi Bhavan and inaugurated by Congress chief Sonia Gandhi a few days ago, bore the brunt of the fury of Athawales supporters, 23 of whom were arrested later.        
	Athawale sort of defended the vandalism, saying he had no regrets about it as the eviction had hurt popular Dalit sentiments.        
	RPI, which was a close ally of the Congress, recently broke away from the party to join the third front ahead of the Assembly elections in Maharashtra, scheduled for October 13.        
	Athawale, who has been staying in the bungalow for the past 12 years having been a four-time MP, lost from Shirdi in the last general elections. He was served a notice to move out of the house on August 12 and was given a months time.        
	Urban development ministry sources said officials had visited the bungalow several times to remind Athawales staff as it had already been allotted to a newly elected MP.        
	September 3 was the last day of the notice after which the leader was given 15 more days to pack up. Today officials emptied the house completely. But unlike yesterday when BJP MP Nand Kumar Sais belongings were dumped on the street outside his flat, Athawales belongings were kept in the yard.        
	Athawale, who is in Maharashtra preparing for the polls, said it was politically motivated.        
	Its a vendetta by the Congress against me. They are targeting me because I rejected their offer of contesting elections with them. This is how the Congress has repaid me for the friendship and loyalty that I had shown for the past 19 years, he said.        
	They deliberately gave me the Shirdi seat this time. Senior leaders of the Congress party are politicking against us. They are targeting me because I am a Dalit. I had asked the Lok Sabha house committee to give me three-four months time to vacate the house, he added.        
	Athawales allegation of caste bias by the Congress comes close on the heels of Sai accusing the ministry of picking him because he belonged to the Scheduled Caste.        
	However, ministry officials refuted these allegations.

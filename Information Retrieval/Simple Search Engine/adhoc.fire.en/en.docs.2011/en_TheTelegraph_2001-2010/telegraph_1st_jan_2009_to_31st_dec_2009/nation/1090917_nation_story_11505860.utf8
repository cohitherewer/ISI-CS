The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Apex court scan on removal of governor
                                                                                                               Apex court scan on removal of governor
                            
	New Delhi, Sept. 16 (PTI): A Constitution bench of the Supreme Court today began hearing whether a new government at the Centre could cut short a governors five-year tenure.         
	The question is simple but it has far-reaching effects. It affects so many constitutional authorities, a five-judge bench, headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan, said.         
	Former attorney-general Soli J. Sorabjee said the Union government could not claim to have unfettered powers to remove a governor.        
	It is not so. Today, you cannot say that unfettered and absolute power is vested with the Centre on removal of governors, he told the bench also comprising Justices S.H. Kapadia, R.V. Raveendran, B. Sudershan Reddy and P. Sathasivam.         
	Sorabjee said governors should have security of tenure. It is the most important aspect I am emphasising that there should be a security of tenure for governors, he said.         
	When the bench said governors prefer to give up office after a change of government at the Centre, the senior advocate argued that a governor is asked to resign by the new dispensation.        
	Sorabjee said governors must be allowed to complete their five-year tenure as provided in the Constitution.         
	The court was hearing a public interest litigation filed in 2004 by then BJP MP B.P. Singhal who challenged the removal of the governors of Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana and Orissa by the previous UPA government.         
	Vishnu Kant Shastri, Babu Parmanand, Kailashpati Mishra and Kidarnath Sahni had been dismissed as governors.

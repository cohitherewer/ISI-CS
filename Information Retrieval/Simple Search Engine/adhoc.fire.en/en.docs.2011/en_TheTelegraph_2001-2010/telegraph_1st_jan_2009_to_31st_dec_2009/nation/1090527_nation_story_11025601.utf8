The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Poetic stepdown after slip-up
                                                                                                               Poetic stepdown after slip-up
										      AMIT ROY      Off chair in oxford...                                          
	London, May 26: Campaigners who supported Indian poet Arvind Krishna Mehrotra for the prestigious post of Professor of Poetry at Oxford University said today he should be offered the vacancy following the resignation of Ruth Padel, who had beaten him by 297 votes to 129 in the election nine days ago.        
	Mehrotra, who lives in Dehradun, told The Telegraph: No one from Oxford has sounded me out yet. But in any case, Oxford seems to have decided on fresh elections.        
	 There were only two candidates for the post, founded in 1708, because the third, Derek Walcott, the West Indian who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1962, withdrew from the race on May 12 after an anonymous email campaign claimed he had been guilty of sexual harassment of female students in the past.        
	Padel, 63, stepped down last night after admitting she had alerted two journalists to what was known about 79-year-old Walcott but denied she had participated or encouraged the email campaign against St Lucia-born poet.         
	 Tariq Ali, the Pakistani author and broadcaster, said it would be ridiculous to have a re-run. Two candidates have withdrawn. One hasnt.        
	 Mehrotras other supporters, among them the writer Amit Chaudhuri, also believe Oxford should now offer him the post but the indications from his friends are that the 62-year-old Indian poet will not accept the post by default.         
	In any case, as Mehrotra has suggested, it looks as though Oxford would prefer to hold fresh elections to find a successor to the current incumbent, Christopher Ricks, whose five-year term ends in September. Even if there was to be another contest, it is by no means certain that Mehrotra would stand again or win if he did.        
	Chaudhuri was today at the Hay Festival in Hay-on-Wye, Wales, where Padel, a great-great-granddaughter of Charles Darwin, was also present. She had attracted extra publicity because she would have been the first woman to be Professor of Poetry at Oxford.        
	The Oxford post is regarded as second only to poet laureate among the formal distinctions for poets in Britain. Weeks earlier, Carol Ann Duffy, 53, became Britains first female poet laureate.        
	 I have acted throughout in complete good faith, but I can, of course, see that people can misconstrue that, Padel said today.        
	 She acknowledged that sending the emails to two journalists was naive and silly, and said: I do want to apologise to him (Walcott), but I cannot apologise for things I have not done and I have not done the campaign.        
	 The job generally involves encouraging the art of poetry which does have a devoted following in England.        
	 According to the university, the duties of the Professor of Poetry include giving a public lecture each term and the Creweian Oration at the Universitys honorary degree ceremony every other year.        
	 The professor receives a small stipend of 6,901 (Rs 524,148) a year, plus 40 for each Creweian Oration.        
	 Had Tagore been alive today, there would almost certainly have been a campaign to get him to Oxford for five years. Nirad C. Chaudhuri, who settled in Oxford, listed him as one of the five greatest Bengalis who ever lived.         
	 Professor of Poetry lectures were conceived in 1708 by Berkshire landowner Henry Birkhead and began after he bequeathed some money so it could be a valuable supplement to the curriculum. He believed the reading of the ancient poets gave keenness and polish to the minds of young men as well as to the advancement of more serious literature both sacred and human.        
	 The great Victorian poet and critic Matthew Arnold, uniquely elected twice to the professorship (in 1857 and 1862), is said to have created the professorship in its modern form.         
	 Many of the most celebrated holders of the Chair have been eminent poets, including W.H. Auden (1956-61) and Robert Graves (1961-6), who lectured charismatically on occult theories of inspiration.         
	The emails about Walcott tipped off 100 Oxford academics about sexual harassment claims made by a student at Harvard University in 1982 and documented in a book, The Lecherous Professor.        
	Walcott, who was not available for comment today, withdrew four days before the election he was favoured to win, complaining of a low and degrading attempt at character assassination.        
	During what remained of the campaign, Padel condemned the attacks on Walcott, saying she revered her rival and that it seems horrible, this anonymous campaign. After being elected to the post, she said her victory had been poisoned by cowardly acts which I condemn.... Those acts have done immense damage to people and to poetry.

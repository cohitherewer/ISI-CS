The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cong plays for long-term goals

          SANJAY K JHA                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 25: The Congress leaderships stubborn opposition to Shibu Sorens appointment as chief minister is linked to the partys long-term strategy in Jharkhand and Bihar where it feels it will gain enormously even if the JMM succeeds in forming a government with the BJP.        
	Although the high command called Congress MLAs and ally Babulal Marandi to Delhi today to discuss the next course of action, there was no sense of urgency to manage the required numbers.         
	Senior leaders said the party would show no desperation either in pressuring Soren to fall in line or to win over Independents and the RJD. The Congress feels that if the party is seen as overeager to ally with Soren and Lalu Prasad, it will hamper its long-term plans in Jharkhand and the revival prospects in neighbouring Bihar.         
	The best outcome for us will be a BJP-JMM government, a leader said, taking a lighter view of the Congresss predicament.        
	Our party organisation was in a total mess in Jharkhand but we have gained because of our decision not to align with the JMM. Non-tribal voters (read Bihari voters) get alienated by the very possibility of seeing Soren as chief minister. Soren was our ally and we disentangled ourselves with great difficulty. We dont want to fall into that trap again.        
	The Congress believes the BJP would damage its prospects in both Jharkhand and Bihar by propping up Soren. The BJP commands the support of a majority of non-tribal voters in Jharkhand and won eight of the 14 Lok Sabha seats in the state in the May general elections.        
	 The Congress has been planning for the 2014 general election when Rahul Gandhi will be at the forefront of its campaign, and it will run the risk of losing Jharkhand now to the BJP for reaping a richer harvest in the two states five years later.         
	By backing Marandi instead of Soren, the Congress also hopes to scrub the stains that spread to the party during the Madhu Koda regime. Party spokesperson Shakeel Ahmed said: Our intention is to provide a clean and stable government in the state. Jharkhand has suffered a lot and we should understand the need for good governance. We hope Shibu Sorenji will see the rationale in our approach and agree to support it.        
	Asked if the Congress was determined not to take Lalu Prasads hand, Ahmed said: We dont need anybodys support, if the JMM agrees to our proposal. But if some party extends support on its own, what can we do.         
	The subtle distinction makes it clear that the Congress was appealing to the JMM, but not to the RJD, for support. Ahmed, who agreed that the partys policy in Bihar was to maintain a distance from the RJD, however, refused to categorically rule out the possibility of taking Lalu Prasads help in Jharkhand.        
	 Other leaders admitted in private that the party should not under any circumstances allow Lalu Prasad to create a space for himself in the UPA. We have to present ourselves as the true alternative in Bihar. Nitish Kumar will paint us black if we have any truck with Lalu Prasad in Jharkhand. We will undo all the gains of the last Lok Sabha election. We should wait for Soren to yield or allow him to go with the BJP. If that doesnt happen, let Presidents rule continue for a while, a leader from Bihar said.

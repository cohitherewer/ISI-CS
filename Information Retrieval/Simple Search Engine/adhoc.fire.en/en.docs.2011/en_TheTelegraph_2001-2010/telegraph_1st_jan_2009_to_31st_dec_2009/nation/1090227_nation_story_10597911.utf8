          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	New Delhi, Feb. 26: Protesting JNU students today kick-started an indefinite hunger strike against yesterdays expulsions, bridging divides that define campus politics.         
	The students stationed themselves at the entrance of the administrative block where the vice-chancellor and other staff work as the campus struggled to retain a calm exterior since the authorities rusticated five students for opposing a hike in the cost of the prospectus.         
	Apart from the nine on indefinite hunger strike, 15 students started a relay strike. They will be replaced every 24 hours.         
	The protest has bridged deep differences that divide the JNUs student groups. Six of the nine on indefinite hunger strike are from the CPI(M-L)-backed AISA that controls the JNU Students Union. The rest belongs to the CPMs SFI. The AISF (CPI), the BJP-backed ABVP and the NSUI (Congress) are also supporting the strike.         
	The idea is to peacefully and silently make it impossible for the administration to ignore our demands, Sandeep Singh, the student union president and one of the five rusticated students, said. He and three other rusticated students are among those on indefinite hunger strike.         
	The unions emphasis on peaceful protests means students are unlikely to  at least at the moment  physically bar the administration from running the university from its offices.        
	But thats during the day. Come evening and the students and their protests will rule the administrative block, union leaders promise.         
	Through the night, and every night till the administration revokes its orders, this will be the epicentre of loud protests against the administration, Singh said.         
	The students are also planning a march to the HRD ministry early next week in protest against the prospectus fee hike and the expulsions.

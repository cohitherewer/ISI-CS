The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Copenhagen - Day 3
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Copenhagen - Day 3

	PACHAURI target        
	A 20 per cent cut in greenhouse gases by the industrialised nations would be a pretty good result for the Copenhagen summit though it falls short of developing nations hopes, Rajendra Pachauri, chairman of the UNs Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, has said.        
	He added that an American reduction offer of 3 per cent below 1990 levels by 2020  or a reduction of 17 per cent from 2005 levels  made it hard to reach more ambitious cuts by 2020 for the rich nations as a group.        
	Pachauris panel in 2007 outlined a scenario of cuts of 25 to 40 per cent below 1990 levels by 2020, and many developing nations want cuts of at least 40 per cent.         
	But offers from the recession-hit developed nations so far total about 14 to 18 per cent        
	ACCORD tab        
	If an accord is reached, it will mean profound shifts in energy production, dislocated people, sweeping changes in agriculture and forestry and the creation of complex new markets in global warming pollution credits. All this will cost trillions of dollars over the next few decades. In energy infrastructure alone, the changes will cost more than $10 trillion in additional investment from 2010 to 2030, estimates the International Energy Agency. Project Catalyst, another initiative, estimates that roughly $100 billion will be needed by 2020 to finance climate-change programmes in the developing world        
	WARMING index        
	Scientists today unveiled a user-friendly climate-change index that distils complex factors like carbon dioxide, temperature change, sea level and sea ice into a single figure.        
	In 1980, the index stood at 34, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said. But from 1997, it leapt. In 2007, the figure was 574. In three of the years  1982, 1992 and 1996  the index fell back, reflecting big volcanic eruptions that temporarily cooled the planet by swathing the upper atmosphere with clouds of reflective dust        
	MIGRATION hotspots        
	Climate change and environmental degradation will force one billion people to migrate over the next four decades in Southeast Asia, Central America, West Africa, Afghanistan and Bangladesh, the International Organisation for Migration has said                  Monks check in items at a

	UN climate talks have neglected a food crisis, including measures which can both curb climate change and boost food production, the head of the UNs Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) said. Historically the discussion centred on the industrial aspects of climate change, Jacques Diouf said, adding that farming  along with the deforestation it drives  accounts for nearly 31 per cent of emissions. FAO says cutting stocking rates and applying organic materials to the land can sequester CO2 in the soil equivalent to 10 per cent of global emissions, and help slow warming. Some scientists say greenhouse gas emissions from raising cattle may account for half the global emission, prompting calls to eat less meat

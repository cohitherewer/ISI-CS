          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 27: The Centre has sacked a National Commission for Women member after she remained defiant in the face of allegations of having violated her mandate while investigating the Mangalore pub attack.        
	The Prime Ministers Office has approved the removal of Nirmala Venkatesh, the first on disciplinary grounds in the commissions 17-year history, on the recommendation of the women and child development ministry, which had accused her dereliction of duty. The ministry, it was learnt, issued a notification today removing her with immediate effect.         
	As reported by The Telegraph on February 25, the ministry had last week suggested to the PMO that Venkatesh, who had said the women attacked in the pub were inappropriately dressed, be removed from her post.        
	Venkatesh, given the task of inquiring into last months assault, had suggested in comments to a television channel in Mangalore before submitting her report that the pub owner was responsible for the incident as he didnt have a liquor licence nor adequate security.        
	She did not meet any of the victims. In her report, she said while the men behind the attack should be punished, factors including the nude dresses of the women needed to be considered.        
	Women and child development Renuka Chowdhury had publicly objected to Venkateshs comments, which she said were made on matters beyond the commissions mandate.               
	The commission, the minister argued, was not set up to examine the legality of serving drinks at a pub but to ensure safety and security of women. Venkateshs report was rejected publicly by commission chairperson Girija Vyas on February 5.         
	Chowdhury later issued a show-cause notice to Venkatesh. Asked about the notice, Venkatesh had questioned Chowdhurys authority on matters related to the commission.        
	Venkatesh remained defiant in her reply to the notice, saying she stood by her report where she suggested that the attacked girls were inappropriately dressed.         
	Refusal to act (according to a given mandate) is one of the conditions listed in the commissions clause and Chowdhury, it is learnt, had cited this in her note to the Prime Minister.

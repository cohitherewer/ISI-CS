	Balurghat, Oct. 24 (PTI): Former Union minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, who has been in a paralysed state for more than a year in a private hospital in New Delhi, will be taken to Germany for stem cell therapy next week.        
	He will be flown to Dusseldorf in Germany on October 30 for treatment. He will undergo stem cell therapy for 15 days, Das Munshis wife and MP Deepa Das Munshi said.         
	The doctors in Germany have assured me of his recovery, she said.         
	Deepa, her brother-in-law Asim and two doctors will accompany the ailing former minister.         
	Das Munshi was admitted to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences on October 12 last year and later shifted to the Apollo Hospital in New Delhi.

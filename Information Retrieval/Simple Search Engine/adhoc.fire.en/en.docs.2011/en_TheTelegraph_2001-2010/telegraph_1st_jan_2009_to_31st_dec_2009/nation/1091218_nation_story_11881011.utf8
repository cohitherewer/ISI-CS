	New Delhi, Dec 17: A chartered accountant who cried hijack mid-air just for kicks will have to cool his heels in jail for some more time at least.        
	The Supreme Court has turned down Jitendra Singh Mohlas bail plea though the retired air commodores son admitted his onboard caper  after being refused permission to change seats  was unpardonable and foolish.        
	Earlier, Delhi High Court had rejected his plea for bail on September 29, more than seven months after the 40-year-old activated a security drill, held up 30 flights and spoiled the home ministers Sunday with his February 1 hijack threat.        
	Mohla, who was returning to Delhi on an Indigo flight after a sun-soaked, 11-day trip in Goa, had claimed he had a hand in the 1999 Kandahar hijack, prompting an SOS to the control tower in Delhi. Apparently sold on his fathers profession, he also claimed he was an air marshal and an official with civil aviation regulator DGCA.        
	The claims could have been passed off as harmless but the matter took a serious turn when Mohla told an airhostess he was involved in the Kandahar hijack. The airhostess then informed the captain who alerted Delhi airport.        
	Mohla was taken into custody after the plane landed and later booked under a stringent non-bailable law that could keep him in jail for life if found guilty.        
	He was also charged under penal code Sections 356 (act endangering life and personal safety of others) and 506 (criminal intimidation)  both bailable sections that carry a maximum jail term of two years.        
	Delhi police sources said Mohla told them during questioning that he made the hijack claim just for kicks.        
	In judicial custody ever since, Mohla told the apex court he was a law-abiding citizen and had clean antecedents.        
	The petitioner was an obedient and normal passenger on the flight, the resident of defence officers colony in Dwarka, south Delhi, said in his petition.        
	Mohla alleged he was arrested though nothing incriminating was found on him and that he wasnt needed for questioning any more as investigations were complete and a chargesheet had been filed in a trial court.        
	He also said the flight attendants had handled a minor argument in a very immature way, failed to maintain discipline on board and falsely implicated him to save their skin.        
	There is no prima facie evidence or circumstances of hijack attempt, and no hostage-like situation inside the aircraft or the safety of the aircraft and that its passengers lives were in jeopardy, he said.         
	The transcripts show that the captain did not communicate any emergent hijack situation. Rather the captain informed all operations normal and requested only priority landing, showing there was no threat to the safety of the aircraft.        
	But his pleas didnt melt the Supreme Court, which asked him to raise these points in the trial court, which will hear the case soon.

	Cuttack, Jan. 20: The rebel syndrome has struck all major parties in the fray for the Cuttack Municipal Corporation (CMC) polls on February 6.         
	Leaders of BJD, BJP and Congress have launched damage-control exercise. With only two days left for withdrawal of nominations and rebels remaining in the protest mode, the leaders are busy pacifying them. The state leadership of the three political outfits is reportedly worried over the intra-party feud, fearing it would send wrong signals to voters.        
	Of the 375 candidates who have filed nomination papers for the 54 wards of CMC, at least 45 had been identified as rebel candidates of BJD, BJP and Congress. Only 21 of the 48 corporators in the last council had been renominated by their respective parties.        
	The BJD had renominated five of the nine party corporators. Party sources said 20 rebel candidates had been identified among those who had filed nominations as Independent candidates. The leadership had constituted a seven-member committee for selecting candidates, Madhusudan Sahu, the president of the city BJD unit said.

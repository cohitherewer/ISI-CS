The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | What Gill missed: formula of speed amp; grandeur
                                                                                                               What Gill missed: formula of speed amp; grandeur

	Singapore, Sept. 26: Mr Gill, Mr Gill, calling Mr Gill Mr Gill, Mr Gill, wake up now!        
	Michael Schumacher, Beyonce Knowles, Lewis Hamilton, Chaka Khan, Jenson Button, Lindsay Lohan, Fernando Alonso, the Black Eyed Peas... everyones in Lion City, except our honourable sports minister. We are missing you, Mr M.S. Gill.        
	Had Gill been here this F1 weekend in Singapore, he would certainly have realised what a sport  one he chooses to call expensive entertainment  can do for a country. How two hours of racing can bring the world to a country a fraction of Indias size. Why every country in the world  Abu Dhabi debuts this year  is desperate for its own Grand Prix.        
	Most important, how human skills and not technology  as Gill insists  determine the course of a Formula One race (last years Renault accident is still a raging topic of discussion).        
	After its successful debut in 2008, the second edition of the Singapore Grand Prix takes place this weekend. The first-ever F1 night race last year turned out a blockbuster not only because the cars crossed the chequered flag under the moon but also because of what it brought to Singapore.        
	Of the 100,000 spectators, 40 per cent were foreigners, helping the country make 168 million Singapore dollars in tourism receipts. More than 110 million people watched the 61-lap race on TV.        
	We do believe in our tagline Nothing else comes close, Rostam Bin Umar, an executive director with the Singapore Tourism Board, told The Telegraph. The F1 race has become an iconic event for us people identify Singapore as the country that hosts the night race. Even this year, defying the world economic crisis, we have sold almost all the tickets.        
	While Gill looks at F1 as non-sport entertainment, Singapore looks at F1 as more than sport. So it hosts entertainment shows around it, like the F1 Rocks, where it gets international stars to perform. A Beyonce concert is a lead-up to the race, a ZZ Top gig a side-show.        
	The race is the cricket and the shows are like the cheerleaders, said hotel consultant Suhail Jindran, who migrated from Mumbai a couple of years ago.        
	Everyone has joined the F1 bandwagon, from roadside dim sum restaurants in Chinatown to big shopping malls on Orchard Road. A slew of lifestyle events, and dining and shopping deals are spread across the city. New shops have come up to cash in on the F1 magic, like the TWG Tea Shop at the ION Orchard mall.         
	And now, Indians are competitive. A podium finish in Belgium and a fourth spot in Italy, and Force India is no longer an also-ran.        
	Theres a buzz around the brand in Singapore, with many remembering Vijay Mallyas big bash here last year. Its surprising that India doesnt have its own Grand Prix, said Samuel Tay, a college student.        
	Perhaps F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone needs to meet Gill over lunch with Mallya joining them. And maybe, just maybe, the sports ministry will back the Indian Grand Prix whenever the engines start in Greater Noida.

	Chandigarh, Sept. 17: Two Haryana teenagers were arrested today for allegedly throwing stones on the Shatabdi Express in which Rahul Gandhi was travelling on Tuesday, police said.          
	Both boys are just under 16 years of age and will be sent to a juvenile home. Since they are young, we cannot divulge their names, Rohtak range IG V. Kamaraj said.          
	The boys, picked up from Gharaunda, about 100km from New Delhi, have apparently told the police they had no intention to harm anyone.          
	Their intention was not to harm anyone. They simply felt like throwing stones at the train and did so, Kamaraj said, after the duo were questioned on their motive. A windowpane of Rahuls chair car had cracked in the stone attack.                  
	 New Delhi: Ishrat Jahans mother Shamima Kausar moved the Supreme Court on Thursday against a Gujarat High Court order staying a report which had said the teenager was killed by police in a fake encounter. Shamima Kausar filed an appeal in the apex court seeking a stay on the high court order and sought permission to use the inquiry report to clear Ishrats name.                   
	 New Delhi (PTI): M.F. Husain, in self-exile for 13 years because of threats from Hindu fundamentalists for his works, turned 94 on Thursday. The artist celebrated his birthday in New York where he is currently on a tour. His son, Shamshad, said he had no knowledge of his fathers plans to come back to India.                   
	 Jammu (PTI): Two BSF jawans were injured on Thursday when their observation post came under fire from the Pakistani side across the border in Jammu and Kashmirs Akhnoor sector. The border guards retaliated using small arms.                  
	 New Delhi (PTI): A fire broke out on Thursday at a building in the complex which houses the department of information and broadcasting. Firetenders doused the blaze, apparently caused by a short circuit, in four hours. No one was injured.

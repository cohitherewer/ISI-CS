	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 30: Controversies refuse to die at Utkal University of Culture  Asias only culture university.         
	For more than a month now, the 10-year-old university has become standstill with no official or academic activity being done at present.         
	With the non-teaching staff on a pen-down strike since January 3, students and teachers have been denied access to classrooms, libraries and reading rooms.        
	Voices of protests have only increased with time, as students today joined hands with the agitating staff. Despite several requests, the government has turned a deaf ear to the needs of this university, said Bikash Beuria, a postgraduation student.        
	The agitating staff have been demanding the regularisation of their services and an inquiry into the irregularities and corruption in the university.         
	We have been working on consolidated sum of Rs 2,000 to Rs 3,700 a month since 1999 and it is a pittance, said the employees association president, P.R. Mohanty.        
	We have been submitting memorandum to the government and the university authorities time and again apprising of our miserable service conditions but there is no change in attitude of the administration, he added.         
	There has been a huge irregularity in affiliation to colleges and appointments made by the authorities, said Mohanty, demanding an immediate inquiry into the matter.        
	The 38-member association met culture minister Suryanarayan Patro today and threatened to intensify the agitation if action not taken immediately.         
	The students too have submitted a memorandum to the governor seeking his intervention to end the deadlock in the university.

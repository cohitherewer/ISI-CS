The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Court prod for symbol plea
                                                                                                               Court prod for symbol plea
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, April 2: Orissa High Court today directed the Election Commission to dispose of Samrudha Odishas application that has been pending before it for allotment of a common party symbol.        
	The court issued the order while disposing of a petition filed by the registered regional party seeking judicial intervention against delay in allotment of a common party symbol.        
	The nascent partys general secretary Saroj Kumar Padhi filed the petition urging the high court to direct the Election Commission to allot nagara (drum) as a party symbol to Samrudha Odisha.        
	Samrudha Odisha, founded by Jatish Chandra Mohanty, has decided to field candidates in all the 147 Assembly and 21 Lok Sabha constituencies.        
	With former Lok Sabha MP Trilochan Kanungo as chairman, the regional outfit has already released its election manifesto, promising to eradicate poverty from the state within five years if it is voted to power.        
	Samrudha Odisha, which has former finance minister Panchanan Kanungo as vice-president, had taken part in the urban local body elections and byelection in the state using the Nagara (drum) as a party symbol.         
	But its application for the symbol has been pending before the State Election Commission for a long time.         
	Without a common party symbol it would be difficult for the party members to contest the elections to the Lok Sabha and Assembly seats on April 16 and 23 in the state.         
	With such little time left, it will not be easy to popularise its symbol among the electorate.

          MUZAFFAR RAINA                               
	Srinagar, Nov. 8: Jammu and Kashmir High Court has declared valid the marriage of a Muslim man to a Sikh woman, whose family had sought the Hurriyat Conferences help to separate the couple.        
	The court ordered police protection to Imran Dagga, 22, and Amitpal Kaur, his 20-year-old wife.         
	Imran and Amitpal, both Srinagar residents, had solemnised their nikaah in September but made it public only last month, triggering opposition from both communities.         
	We got married after she converted to Islam and took the name of Aasiya. She didnt reveal the marriage to her family and left for Jalandhar where she was studying physiotherapy, Imran said.        
	Trouble began last month, when Amitpal insisted on coming to Imrans home. He said her family lodged an abduction case against him and approached politicians of the Hurriyat Conference and the ruling National Conference.         
	But the Daggas moved court, which initially asked the police to keep Amitpal as a guest with their womens wing until the probe was over. Imrans father Farooq Dagga today said: Five policemen are guarding our house and I hope my son and daughter-in-law will live in peace now.         
	 Imran said the two fell in love eight years back when Amitpal was in school.         
	She was happy with the order but unsure if their troubles were over. My family may go to the Supreme Court to force a separation, she said.

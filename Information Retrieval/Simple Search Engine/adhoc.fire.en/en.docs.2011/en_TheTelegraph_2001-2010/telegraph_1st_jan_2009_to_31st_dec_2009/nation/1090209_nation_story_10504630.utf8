          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Feb. 8: The landslide victory of the BJD in the Cuttack Municipal Corporation elections has emboldened the party to claim the BJP bastion during seat-sharing ahead of the Assembly elections.        
	With the thumping victory, the demand is natural, said Dharmananda Behera, the district president of BJD. BJDs unexpected revival in the city, signalled by two-third majority in the civic body polls, has established party president and chief minister Naveen Patnaiks political authority, besides making inroads into BJPs vote base, said a senior party leader.        
	For both BJP and Congress, this is the time to introspect what went wrong in the Cuttack polls. Known for a safe seat for the saffron party till yesterday, its three-time BJP MLA Samir Dey, also the state higher education minister, had to resign yesterday owning moral responsibility for the unusual defeat. BJP won just two seats out of 54 wards.        
	It is the verdict of the people and the voting trend in all the wards will be analysed soon, said BJP spokesperson Nayan Mohanty.        
	Apparently, the saffron party had not just suffered a major setback in what is considered a dress rehearsal for the Assembly elections due in April but also had no inkling of what was coming. In fact, it was a major wake-up call for the BJP.        
	The Congress, on the other hand, has something to cheer about the results of the Cuttack elections, as it won from eight wards, while fighting in at least 25 wards. But senior Congress leaders take it as a warning. The party had gone six wards down from the last civic poll. Party campaign committee chief Srikant Jena called for introspection. It certainly needs to be looked into, why this happened.

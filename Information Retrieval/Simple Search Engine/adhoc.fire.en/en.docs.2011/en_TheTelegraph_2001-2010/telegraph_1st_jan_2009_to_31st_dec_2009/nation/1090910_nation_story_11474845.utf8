	New Delhi, Sept. 9: The Centre has asked all states to set up an ombudsman in every district to increase transparency and accountability in the rural job scheme NREGA after being flooded with complaints of irregularities.        
	The order was issued by the rural development ministry on September 7.        
	In some cases, sarpanches demand bribes to enrol people (in the scheme), sometimes job cards dont reach beneficiaries. In certain cases, planning is poor and funds meant for purchase of materials are wasted. An ombudsman will be able to address these complaints at the local level, said a ministry official.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Gloss tag on IIT, IIM pay revision
                                                                                                               Gloss tag on IIT, IIM pay revision
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Sept. 17: Faculty across the IITs and the IIMs have rejected amendments to a controversial pay regime, labelling the changes mere lip gloss and accusing the government of ignoring most of their demands.         
	Teachers at all the apex engineering and management schools are together likely to draft a joint charter of demands which will be submitted to human resource development minister Kapil Sibal.         
	General body meetings of faculty at each of the IITs today passed resolutions rejecting the revised pay notification.         
	IIT Guwahati teachers are expected to protest against the revised notification tomorrow.         
	The Telegraph yesterday first reported revisions to the pay regime for faculty at the IITs and IIMs that propels assistant professors to a higher pay range three years from now.         
	But the revised pay notification is silent on most other demands raised by the IITs and IIMs after a controversial salary regime notified in August slashed salaries recommended by a central government panel.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Push for IT land in Bengal
                                                                                                               Push for IT land in Bengal

	Calcutta, Sept. 15: Nasscom today said it was disappointed by Bengals shelving of the IT township but expressed hope that Wipro and Infosys would be given alternative plots in three to six months.        
	We are disappointed (by the shelving) but we are not giving up. I am hopeful that within 3-6 months, the government will be able to allocate alternative land to Wipro and Infosys, Nasscom president Som Mittal said here today. The two companies were to get 90 acres each in the 1,200-acre township in Rajarhat.        
	Mittal, whose association is the countrys apex body of software firms, said the Bengal government had the right intent to promote the IT industry despite the Vedic Village controversy, which he dubbed an aberration. But the state, he said, needs to re-prioritise its land allocation policy.        
	It is very important to give priority to large IT companies (like Infosys and Wipro) which are willing to expand their presence in the state, and ensure a sustainable atmosphere for (their) operations, Mittal told a meeting of CEOs organised by Nasscom.        
	He suggested that the setback to the two firms may have been relatively less because the shelving had come at a time the IT industry was growing slowly because of the downturn.        
	He said both the state and the central governments should play a positive role in finding alternative ways to accommodate large IT companies.         
	The message would not have been missed: Union minister for corporate affairs Salman Khursheed was present at the conference, as was Bengal IT minister Debesh Das, whose department had announced last week it couldnt proceed with the township. Nasscom will soon meet Das to find out what the state can offer as an alternative to Wipro and Infosys.

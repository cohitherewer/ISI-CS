          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Gaya, Nov. 19: Magadh University (MU) authorities are mulling a plan wherein teaching and non-teaching staff will have to leave their thumb impressions on registers to mark their attendance.        
	The move, the authorities hope, would check attendance and punctuality lapses.         
	According to contents of the university plan incorporated in a brochure titled On Path to Excellence, it is written that the university will be shortly introducing this unique system.         
	Employees, including teachers, are not happy with the idea.         
	The general secretary of the of MU Non-teaching Staffs Association, Amarnath Pathak, said he has already informed authorities that the employees would not mark their attendance as such and no change in the existing system was acceptable to them.         
	Almost ridiculing the proposed system, the postgraduate teachers association president Sunil Singh said that it was a direct attack on the dignity of university teachers. Let the VC put his thumb impression first on every degree that is issued from the university, said a visibly angry Singh.        
	The authorities on their part are preferring to remain mum. Pro-vice-chancellor B. Paswan complained that he was not a party to the decision and added that VC B.N. Pandey was present in the meeting.         
	Pandey and his aides were not present at the headquarters for their comments.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 1: Union minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi has been taken off a ventilator after more than eight weeks on life support, but his neurological condition remains unchanged, the Apollo Indraprastha Hospital said today.        
	He continues to be in an intensive care unit and his neurological condition remains the same, the hospital said. The ventilator could be removed after improvement in his lungs and in his capacity to breathe spontaneously, doctors said.         
	Das Munshi was transferred to Apollo in October last year after being treated for a massive heart attack at the AIIMS.         
	A critical care specialist not associated with the case said the removal of the ventilator without a change in the neurological condition or state of consciousness could mean there has been an improvement in the heart or lung functions.

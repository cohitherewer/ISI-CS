	Cuttack, April 12: Some 10.89-lakh electors of Cuttack do not have their photo identity cards issued by the Election Commission.        
	They are among 17.6-lakh people enlisted in the electoral rolls of nine Assembly constituencies in Cuttack. Of the nine, Barabati (Cuttack), Choudwar (Cuttack), (Cuttack) Sadar, Athagarh, Badamba and Banki fall under Cuttack parliamentary constituency, while Salipur and Mahanga are under Kendrapada constituency, while Niali is under Jagatsinghpur.        
	The cards are mandatory for exercising the franchise. Though 1,089,502 valid voters in the district do not have the ID cards, they will be allowed to use any of the (other) 13 identity-proof documents.        
	The documents include passport, driving licence, PAN or any ID card issued by any central or state PSUs, by self-government organisations and public limited companies.         
	Also, land record documents that have photographs on them, records issued by banks or post office passbooks and Kisan cards issued till February 28, 2009, may also be shown. Documents related to pension for either widows, senior citizens, former service men and their kin and freedom fighters may also be used for exercising the adult franchise. Records and documents such as SC, ST and OBC certificates, documents issued to certify physically handicapped persons, arms licence and NREGS job cards issued till February 28, 2009, will also be eligible to vote.        
	In Barabati (Cuttack), some 1,57,233 electors have not been provided the photo ID cards. The constituency has a total electorate of 1,90,233. Similarly, in Choudwar (Cuttack), 1,63,998 of the 1,93,194 voters are yet to receive their cards. District election officer Kishore Kumar Mohanty said arrangements are on to make up for the lack of cards in 1,507 booths across the district.         
	Of the 1,849 polling stations, 1,311 have been identified as sensitive, while 1,069 booths will cater to 1,000 and less voters, Mohanty said. He said 13,813 polling personnel will be engaged to conduct the election in the district.        
	A total of 73 candidates are in the poll fray. While seven candidates are contesting for the Cuttack Lok Sabha seat, the rest 66 are trying their luck for the nine Assembly seats in the district.         
	As many as 11 candidates are in the fray for Barabati (Cuttack), while 10 are in the fray for Choudwar (Cuttack).

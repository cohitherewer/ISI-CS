The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Gandhian to lecture on peace
                                                                                                               Gandhian to lecture on peace
          PRIYA ABRAHAM                              
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 19: Ram Katha and Hari Katha are pass, now its time for Gandhi Katha.         
	To maintain peace in the state, especially Kandhamal, Orissa Shanti Sadbhawana Abhiyan (Ossa), an initiative by civil society groups and intellectuals from different walks of life, has planned to rope in noted Gandhian, Narayan Desai, to spread the thought of peace and non- violence in the state.        
	Kandhamal witnessed a series of attacks, arson and unrest in the recent past and since then Ossa has been doing all that it can to promote peace. Desai, the son of Mahatma Gandhis secretary Mahadevbhai, lived in the Gandhi Ashram till the age of 12. The narrative Gandhi Katha penned by him serves as a medium to extend the Gandhian thought to the public. There are people who cannot read or have no time to read. This is a way of educating them with the principles of the great leader and his quest for non-violence, peace and harmony, said Ossa working president Bhagwan Prakash.        
	This (the reading sessions) is to generate an enabling environment in favour of peace, non-violence and harmony, he said adding that a good number of residents from Kandhamal would attend the five-day event.         
	The Gandhi Katha will have a prose narrative, but, there will also be parts in verse and song, said the organisers.         
	The mega-event will be held from March 5 to 9. The effort is to appeal to all and sundry to bury their differences and attempt to restore peace without guns, goons and security personnel. We aim to make the public realise the relevance of Mahatma Gandhi, Bhagwan Prakash said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Church loads Left reminder
                                                                                                               Church loads Left reminder
          CITHARA PAUL                              
	New Delhi, June 8: Keralas powerful Catholic Church has called for a silent liberation struggle to commemorate a milestone event that is certain to remind the CPM of a dark chapter at a time the party is facing another siege.        
	The call coincides with the 50th anniversary of the original Church-led Liberation Struggle of 1959 that had brought down the worlds first elected communist government, headed by E.M.S. Namboodiripad, in the state.        
	The Church is observing the June 13 anniversary in a big way. A circular written by Cardinal Mar Varkey Vithayathil asks all believers to participate in functions to be organised by the Church on that day.         
	The commemoration will begin with mourning services at the tombs of the seven martyrs who died in police firing in 1959.        
	Apart from religious ceremonies, the Church will also hold a public meeting that day, to be attended by various social organisations as well as political leaders from the Congress-led Opposition alliance, the United Democratic Front.        
	The 1959 struggle was triggered by the Namboodiripad governments attempts to take over all private educational institutions, including those run by the Church.        
	 Hindu community organisations and Muslim educational bodies had joined forces with the Church to liberate Kerala from the devilish grip of the Reds.        
	The movement witnessed violent protests, attacks by communist cadres on Christians, and deaths in police firing, prompting then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru to dismiss the two-year-old state government.        
	The anniversary comes at a time Christian establishments have fought a legal battle against the governments alleged attempt to interfere in education and deny minority rights. It also coincides with the communists poll setback and the corruption prosecution looming over state CPM secretary Pinarayi Vijayan.        
	The current struggle has been termed silent because it is expected to avoid demonstrations and rely on a more subtle anti-Left campaign, including pastoral letters read out during Mass at churches.        
	Cardinal Vithayathils letter cites the Churchs role in the Lefts defeat in the Lok Sabha polls. Before the elections, the Kerala Catholic Bishop Council had issued a pastoral letter urging the laity not to vote for those preaching atheism and engaging in violence.        
	The cardinals letter says Marxists are incapable of recognising multi-party democracy, and that Marxist ideology has to be revamped since it is against the Constitution and challenges the courts.        
	It also criticises the Left Democratic Front governments attempts to reform primary and professional education.        
	 After all these years, the LDF governments reforms in the education sector are a negation of faith and moral values, the letter says.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Anti-mine vehicles set to roll
                                                                                                               Anti-mine vehicles set to roll
                            
	Bhopal, March 29 (PTI): With the Lok Sabha elections drawing closer, an ordnance factory in Madhya Pradesh has started rolling out mine protected vehicles (MPVs) to Naxalite-hit states.        
	We have delivered our first consignment of four MPVs to Chhattisgarh police last week, said senior general manager Sukumar Kole of the Jabalpur vehicle factory.         
	He said that the vehicle plant was in the process of giving finishing touches to four more MPVs that would be delivered to those states that approaches the Jabalpur vehicle factory first.         
	Kole admitted that one of the reasons to acquire an MPV was the security threat faced by Maoist-hit states before an election.        
	It may recalled here that seven policemen were killed and two were injured in a landmine blast triggered by Naxalites, while the police team was returning from Assembly election duty in Bastar (Chhattisgarh) in 2008.        
	Kole said the home ministry has placed an order of several MPVs with the Calcutta ordnance factory board for states such as Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Bihar.         
	However, he declined to give the exact number of MPVs to be delivered to different states.         
	The senior staff also added that the factory, some time ago, began work to prepare the MPVs as the Medak ordnance factory was overloaded with this work.         
	He added that the plant management was importing raw materials to meet the targets for the mine-protected vehicles.

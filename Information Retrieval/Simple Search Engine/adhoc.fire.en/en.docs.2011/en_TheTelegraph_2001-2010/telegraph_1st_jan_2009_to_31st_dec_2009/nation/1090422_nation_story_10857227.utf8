The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Muslims sway with BJD
                                                                                                               Muslims sway with BJD
          LALMOHAN PATNAIK                              
	Cuttack, April 21: The minority voters in the city are all set to switch support to the BJD from their years-old allegiance to the Congress.        
	After parting ways with the BJP, BJD chief Naveen Patnaik has been eyeing the Muslim vote bank. And he has made inroads into this segment, which had over the past decade shifted loyalty back to the Congress. The Muslim vote is considered crucial in Cuttacks Barabati Assembly seat, as it constitutes nearly 20 per cent of the total electorate of 1.9 lakh.        
	The Congress had hoped to cash in on the change in political equations following the break-up in the BJD-BJP alliance and wrest Cuttack city (Barabati Cuttack) in a triangular fight.        
	But the BJD strategists left almost no stone unturned to woo the politically important vote bank since the Cuttack Municipal Corporation polls in February. While former BJP minister Samir Dey is seeking re-election for the fourth consecutive term and Congress city president Suresh Mohapatra trying his luck for the second time, the assurance of Muslim support is perceived crucial for BJD candidate Debashis Samantaray. The Muslim community members acknowledge that Naveens government is a friendly one. A former Muslim councillor said: Naveens government is good and it is in a position to ensure better welfare measures for the minorities. We find no reason why we should not vote for him in the Assembly polls.         
	At least half-a-dozen of maulavis echoed the same.        
	Voting patterns in Cuttack indicate that the Muslims had become alienated from the Congress between 1989 and 1992, during the build-up and eventual demolition of the Babri Masjid.        
	In the 1990 elections, the Congress vote share had gone down to 10.68 per cent, almost half of what BJP got when Janata Dal candidate Mustafiz Ahmed was elected with 66.39 per cent vote. In 2000, the Congress could not have a 30 per cent vote share even after fielding Ahmed as its candidate. But in 2004, the Congress had a vote share of 43.68 per cent even as the party lost to the BJP with BJD as ally.        
	But I will not be surprised if the outcome of the election represents the worst performance of the Congress in two decades, admitted a senior Congress leader.        
	Mohapatra, on the other hand, has his own convictions. I hope the conscious voters will consider efficiency and credibility of the candidates while exercising their franchise, he said.

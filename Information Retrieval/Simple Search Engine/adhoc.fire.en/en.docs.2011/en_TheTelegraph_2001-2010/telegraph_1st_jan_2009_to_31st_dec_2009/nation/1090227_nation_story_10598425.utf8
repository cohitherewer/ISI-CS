	New Delhi, Feb. 26 (PTI): Some 20,000 Indians have returned after losing their jobs abroad because of the meltdown, the government said today.        
	Although the exact number is not available, reports indicate that 16,000 to 20,000 have come back, overseas Indian affairs minister Vyalar Ravi told the Rajya Sabha.        
	He said the Centre was aware some employers kept employees visas with themselves and didnt renew these in time, making them illegal immigrants, but such incidents had fallen by 50 per cent.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | 7-month hope for economy
                                                                                                               7-month hope for economy
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 24: Manmohan Singh today said the economy would revive in the next six or seven months thanks to the three stimulus packages announced by his government.        
	The Prime Ministers remark came at the release of the Congress poll manifesto that promised further stimulus measures and increased public spending in the farm and infrastructure sectors.        
	I am confident that because of the stimulus that our government has announced, later by Pranab Mukherjee (as acting finance minister), in the next six to seven months the revival of the Indian economy should take place in a big way, Singh said.        
	The manifesto said the party would follow the path of faster and more inclusive growth, focusing on stimulating domestic demand and ensuring more purchasing power in the hands of the people and more liquidity in the hands of companies.        
	It said the economy would grow at about 7 per cent this fiscal and promised to revive the economy and restore the high growth witnessed in the first four years of (the) Congress-led UPA government.        
	Analysts said these measures were positive. Good economics is also good politics, said N.R. Bhanumurthy of the Institute of Economic Growth.        
	The government had announced stimulus packages in December and January, cutting excise duty by 4 per cent, increasing public expenditure and giving more leeway to infrastructure finance company IIFCL to raise tax-free bonds. Mukherjee had announced a further 2 per cent cut in excise duty and also service tax, among other stimulus measures.        
	The Congress pledged to expand farmer welfare plans, including interest relief, and promised a hugely subsidised food scheme for the poor. It said it planned to enact a law entitling every family living below the poverty line to a monthly ration of 25 kg of rice or wheat at Rs 3 a kg.        
	Analysts termed this populist. Its very difficult to imagine how they will implement this; its nothing but an election plank. If it happens, it will widen the deficit, said former Planning Commission member S.P. Gupta.        
	The Congress, however, promised to maintain the path of high growth with fiscal prudence and low inflation.        
	It promised to connect every village to a broadband network within three years, helping create non-agricultural jobs in the villages.        
	The manifesto rejected the NDA policy of blind privatisation. It, however, said people had the right to own part of the shares of public sector companies while the government retained majority stake.         
	Government companies in energy, transport, telecom, banking and insurance would remain in the public sector and receive all support to grow and compete.        
	The manifesto promised to promote foreign investment in areas that would maximise local value-addition and export potential. Specifically, it said the private investment allowed in oil exploration would be extended to other minerals like coal and iron ore. Analysts said the foreign investment would attract much-needed capital, spurring economic activity in sectors that require large investments.        
	In the backdrop of the Satyam scam, the Congress promised to introduce regulations to ensure good corporate governance, ethical business practices and accountability.        
	The manifesto promised to introduce the goods and services tax from April 1, 2010, thus abolishing all other central and state taxes  such as VAT, excise duty, service tax, entertainment tax and luxury tax -- and creating a seamless national common market. Under this, the Centre and the states would share a unified services tax that would be predictable for businesses.        
	The Congress also promised to add 12,000-15,000MW of power generation capacity every year through a mix of coal, hydel, nuclear and renewable energy sources. It promised to pursue oil diplomacy aggressively, and pledged a scheme to supply energy cheap to the poor.

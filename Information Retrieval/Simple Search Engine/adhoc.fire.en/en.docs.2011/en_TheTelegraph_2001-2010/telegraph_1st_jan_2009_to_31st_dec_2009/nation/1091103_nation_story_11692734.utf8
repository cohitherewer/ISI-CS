          MUZAFFAR RAINA                                    
	Srinagar, Nov. 2: The countrys border in Kashmir appears to have found new protectors  a Bear Security Force.        
	A bear, or a group of bears, has killed two armed militants on the Pir Panjal mountain range in south Kashmir, state police chief Farooq Ahmad said today.        
	Amin alias Kaisar and Bashir Ahmad alias Saifullah, both allegedly from the Hizb-ul Mujahideen, were attacked in their hideout in the remote mountain forests of Danue Kandimarg, Kulgam district.        
	We have recovered the arms and ammunitions of the slain militants. We are also looking for a third militant who is believed to have been injured by the bear (or bears), the director-general of police said.        
	I have never come across such an incident, said the officer, who has served three decades in the police.        
	Ahmad said both bodies bore marks of the clawing they received. I dont know whether they (the militants) opened fire or not.        
	Police sources said the two militants had been active in both the Kashmir and Jammu regions and were evading arrest for quite sometime.        
	Bears prowl the Danue Kandimarg forests in large numbers. The man-animal conflict in Kashmir has claimed many ordinary peoples lives in the past few years, and villagers have killed several bears and leopards in retaliation.

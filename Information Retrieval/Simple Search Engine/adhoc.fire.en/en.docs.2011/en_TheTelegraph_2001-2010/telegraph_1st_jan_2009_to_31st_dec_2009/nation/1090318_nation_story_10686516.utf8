          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Shillong, March 17: Barely a few hours after his government won the trust vote by a whisker, Meghalaya chief minister Donkupar Roy tonight said he had come to know that governor R.S. Mooshahary had recommended Presidents rule in the state.         
	I have learnt that the governor has recommended Presidents rule in the state and the Union cabinet is likely to meet tomorrow to discuss the matter, Roy said tonight.        
	Raj Bhavan sources refused to confirm the development, only saying that a letter had been sent to New Delhi. The sources refused to divulge the contents of the letter.         
	Earlier in the day, the casting vote of Speaker Bindo Lanong saved the ruling MPA as both the government and the Opposition got 27 votes each after five MLAs, who had deserted the ruling alliance, were denied voting rights following their interim disqualification.

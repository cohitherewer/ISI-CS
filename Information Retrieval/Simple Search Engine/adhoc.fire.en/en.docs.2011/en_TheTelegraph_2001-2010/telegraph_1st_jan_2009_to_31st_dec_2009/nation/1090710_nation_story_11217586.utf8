                                                                                                               Strict code for Raipur schools
          SHEENA K.                              
	Raipur, July 9: Chhattisgarh government will introduce a code of conduct for private schools to check alleged collection of hefty donations from parents.         
	The school education department has constituted a 10-member committee to draft the code and submit it within 15 days.         
	The code will be drafted on the basis of suggestions made by parents, said department secretary Nandkumar.         
	The proposal will be sent to the state government and after its consent, the code will be implemented in private schools, he added.         
	Sources said that the department was forced to take action after it received large-scale protests from parents and students unions regarding hefty fees and donations sought by private institutions in the state.         
	Such unions had also submitted memorandums to the education minister underlining their complaints.         
	Some schools were also demanding a large sum of money from parents to provide school bags, uniforms and stationaries.         
	Representatives of private schools are also slated to be included in the committee.        
	The code would decide on the guidelines following which the schools can seek money.        
	Besides, the department is also planning to empower parents committees of every school with rights to check irregularities within the private schools. Once the code of conduct is implemented, the department will ensure that the guidelines are strictly followed by the private schools, said Nandkumar.        
	The committees would act as code police in each of the schools with help of the district administration.

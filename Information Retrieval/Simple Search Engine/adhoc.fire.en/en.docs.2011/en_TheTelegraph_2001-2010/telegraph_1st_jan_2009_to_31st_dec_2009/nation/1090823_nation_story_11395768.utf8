  - Ganesh saves tribals on screen          PRIYA ABRAHAM                          An idol of Lord Ganesh in Rourkela on the eve of Ganesh Chaturthi on Sunday. Picture by Uttam Kumar Pal                                        
	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 22: This Ganesh Puja, tribals at the Niyamgiri hills will find the elephant god saving them from the ordeal of industrialisation  at least the animation way.        
	Young animators in the state are busy bringing Lord Ganesh back to the screen showing him rescuing indigenous men and women who have been at the receiving end following the current mineral-based industrialisation in tribal areas.        
	Moved by the plight of the tribals, who are being forcefully evicted from their homes and land, a group of animators  Peoples Academy of Cinematics Animation and Design  have joined hands to develop an animation film on the subject.        
	The film, Gajanana, will be the first-ever clay animation in Orissa. The theme, background and cultural depiction will be that of the Saura tribes. The film will be all about innocent tribals who are exploited by the high and mighty. Its about how they evoke the divine blessings of Lord Ganesh, who comes to their aid as the vighna vinashak (destroyer of problems), explained Ranjit Mohaty, the academys director.        
	Its a highly imaginative work and also fits into the current context. It connects with the ongoing disturbance at major future industrial sites occupied by the tribals, he said.         
	About 40 professionals are on the job that is expected to be over by Sunday. We will release it on Ganesh Puja. Last year, we had attempted Ganesh in rangoli animation. The effort is not just to bring forth the talents of our young animators but to draw the attention of the audience towards certain social issues that need to be addressed before it is too late, said Mohanty.

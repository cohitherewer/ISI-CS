  - Virus toll touches 11 but experts say mortality rate still unclear        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	New Delhi, Aug. 11: Indias count of pandemic flu infections climbed to 1,078 cases today with 119 new patients and signs of community-level spread in four cities: Delhi, Bangalore, Mumbai and Pune.        
	Eleven people infected with the pandemic H1N1 virus have died in the country, four of them today. But experts caution that the mortality rate obtained by just dividing 11 by the 1,078 laboratory-confirmed cases could be misleading.        
	The denominator is crucial to computing the mortality rate and theres no way that we can estimate the denominator yet  the actual number of people infected by the virus in India, said Manish Kakkar, a specialist on infectious diseases at the Public Health Foundation of India, New Delhi. If the actual number of people infected is higher, the mortality rate would be lower.        
	Patterns of the infection elsewhere in the world indicate that H1N1 can cause a range of symptoms. Some people may not experience anything more than a mild cold or a sore throat, while some may develop serious illness.        
	The health ministrys update on infections released tonight suggests that 61 among Punes 62 new patients may have picked up the infection either through social or school contacts within the city.        
	In Delhi, 14 of the 15 new patients had no history of travel and developed the infection within the city. Mumbai today reported 22 patients who had no travel history, and Bangalore had four involving local transmission.        
	The patients who died today include a 63-year-old woman from Thane, a Mumbai suburb, who had diabetes and heart disease, and a 13-year-old girl from Pune who had experienced cough, fever and breathlessness for a week before being admitted to the government-designated facility on August 8. A seven-year-old girl died in Vadodara and a 35-year-old man in Kerala, reports said.        
	Public health experts and senior doctors say India needs to rapidly analyse the circumstances under which the flu deaths have occurred and take steps to identify people at high risk of developing serious illness.         
	In cities where community transmission and clusters have already emerged, the focus should change from treating every patient who tests positive to identifying early those people who are at risk, or who develop signs of serious illness, and to treat them aggressively, said a senior doctor in Delhi who has been advising the government on flu policy.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Anti-corruption nudge in higher education
                                                                                                               Anti-corruption nudge in higher education
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                           HRD minister Kapil Sibal                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 22: Indias apex vigilance watchdog has asked the human resource development ministry to beef up anti-corruption wings in key higher education agencies tainted by frequent corruption charges.         
	The Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) has suggested appointing dedicated chief vigilance officers at select agencies, top sources on the panel told The Telegraph, in a snub to the traditional practices adopted by the ministry.         
	The CVC has marked out the University Grants Commission, the All India Council of Technical Education and the Indira Gandhi National Open University for the appointment of dedicated chief vigilance officers, the sources said.         
	Chief vigilance officers head an organisations vigilance measures and are the link between that organisation and the CVC.         
	Most government organisations, including ministries, appoint officers already burdened with multiple tasks as chief vigilance officers.         
	Vigilance cases pile up as overburdened bureaucrats are unable to devote adequate time to studying, examining and investigating allegations of corruption, a senior CVC official said.         
	If we have to clean up corruption in our higher education, however, we have to make that a full-time task  such is the magnitude of allegations against some institutions, the official said.         
	The UGC, AICTE and Ignou have faced numerous vigilance cases against several officials.         
	At present, cases that require CVC intervention reach the commission many years after the initial allegations were made, a commission source said.         
	Often, by then, the accused official has retired and so no disciplinary action can be taken even if he is held guilty of infringement of service rules.         
	The idea is that the UGC, AICTE and Ignou strengthen their existing vigilance set-ups. Because if these set-ups were indeed working well, we wouldnt have so many cases piling up, the source said.         
	The CVCs move comes at a time the Kapil Sibal-headed HRD ministry is grappling with a slew of corruption cases against key education officials.         
	The CBI is investigating top officials of the AICTE on charges of demanding bribes from private technical education institutions in return for recognition to courses they want to offer.         
	AICTE secretary K. Narayana Rao is in CBI custody and the agency is investigating charges against the technical education regulators chairman, Ram Avtar Yadav.         
	The HRD ministry last week received a complaint from an engineering college in Cuddapah, Andhra Pradesh, alleging that an AICTE inspector who had come to screen the institute had demanded money for a favourable report, sources said.         
	UGC officials have also frequently faced allegations of corruption.         
	UGC chairman Professor Sukhdeo Thorat was accused last year by former commission secretary Raju Sharma of corruption in a plan to monitor disbursal of funds to institutions through e-governance.         
	Several top Ignou officials too have been accused of circumventing the universitys mandate in opening certain courses.

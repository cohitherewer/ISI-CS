          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Feb. 2: For Orissa High Court, wilful non-compliance of its orders and mounting backlog of cases are impeding the process of administering justice.         
	Perturbed by this, judges have hauled up the state government repeatedly and even reprimanded senior bureaucrats for it, but to no avail.        
	The high court judges, wary of no response to notices and non-compliance of orders, have been issuing contempt notices and directing for personal appearances by government officers. But despite these measures the bureaucracy has apparently not bothered to mend its ways.        
	In January, the high court ordered for initiation of criminal proceedings against Bhubaneswar Municipal Commissioner Aparajita Sarangi for contempt of court. The high court had ordered for adoption of a single-point garbage disposal system in August 2007. But BMC had skirted the order despite several court directives and deadlines.        
	In August last year, the state higher education secretary was restrained by the high court from drawing his salary when it was found that a court order issued five years ago had not been complied with.         
	The high court slapped a penalty of Rs 10,000 each on higher education commissioner-cum-secretary Madhusudan Padhi and director Suman Mohapatra for civil contempt for not implementing within three weeks an order issued in September 8 last year.         
	Wilful non-compliance is like a cancer in the administration of justice, the division bench of Justices B.P. Das and R.N. Biswal observed, while issuing the order on January 30.        
	According to sources, out of 2 lakh-odd cases pending in the high court, more than 25,000 involve the state government. In 90 per cent of the cases, court orders  both in replying to notices or implementation of orders involving judicial redress  were not complied with by the government.

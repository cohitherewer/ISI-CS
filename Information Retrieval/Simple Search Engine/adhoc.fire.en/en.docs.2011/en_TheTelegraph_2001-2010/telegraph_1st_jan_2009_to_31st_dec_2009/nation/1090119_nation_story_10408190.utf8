          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Jan. 18: At least 124 women have filed nomination papers for 54 wards of Cuttack Municipal Corporation (CMC) council.        
	Elections to the CMC council would be held on February 6. Arrangements are also being made for 3.64 lakh voters to exercise their franchise in 156 booths. Friday was the last date for filing nomination and the rebel problem haunted all the three main parties  Congress, BJP and BJD  taking the total number of candidates to 375.        
	In fact, the rebel problem has increased the number of candidates in certain wards to over 20. The last date for withdrawal of nominations is January 22. Efforts by senior leaders of the three parties are on to ensure that the rebel candidates withdraw their nominations by that day.        
	While 27 corporators have been denied tickets, the BJP has renominated only seven of 16 party corporators.         
	Similarly, only five of the nine BJD corporators in the last council have been given tickets to contest this time.         
	Among those who have filed nomination on a Congress ticket, six are seeking re-election.         
	Priority has been given to apparent ability to represent the problems of the people in the area and most importantly, commitment to party. In the process, new faces in several wards have been preferred, state BJP spokesperson Nayan Mohanty said.

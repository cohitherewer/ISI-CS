                                                                                                               Dalit unity, minus an Ambedkar 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, Aug. 18: Most factions of the Republican Party of India today set aside their differences to announce they would contest the coming Assembly elections in Maharashtra under one symbol and not ally with either the Congress-NCP or the Shiv Sena-BJP.        
	The Bharipa Bahujan Mahasangh, led by B.R. Amedkars grandson Prakash, however, stayed away from the formal announcement that came after three rounds of talks between various Dalit leaders.        
	The leaders met for the first time at the initiative of Ramdas Athawale, who heads the RPI (Athawale) faction, but Prakash had slammed the Dalit unity plan as a farce and skipped the meeting. The other factions held a second round of meeting on August 11 and another round today.         
	After todays meeting, Athawale said their unity would continue. We (will) maintain equal distance from the Sena-BJP and the Congress-NCP.

                                                                                                               26/11 trial
                            
	Mumbai, April 22: Congress leaders A.R. Antulay and Narayan Rane are likely to be summoned by a special court during the trial of 26/11 accused Sabauddin Ahmed.        
	While Antulay had hinted at the role of Hindutva groups in the killing of ATS chief Hemant Karkare during the Mumbai attacks, Rane had alleged that some Congress leaders supported the conspirators. Karkare was probing the Malegaon blast allegedly involving Hindutva groups.         
	The court has asked Ajmal Kasabs lawyer to respond to the prosecutions draft charges by May 2.

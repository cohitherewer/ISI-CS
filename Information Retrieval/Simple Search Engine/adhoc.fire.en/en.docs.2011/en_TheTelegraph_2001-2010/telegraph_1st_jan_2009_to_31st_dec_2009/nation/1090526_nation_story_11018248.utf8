	Motihari (Bihar), May 25 (PTI): Naxalite rebels gunned down a suspected robber in Bihars East Champaran district for allegedly extorting money from people after posing as a Maoist, police said today.        
	Deputy superintendent of police (Pakridayal sub-division) M.K. Anand said the Naxalites assaulted Bhikara Prasad, 35, at Bara Bihsunpur village under Rajepur police station area late last night before shooting him dead.         
	The Maoists then left leaflets behind warning others like Bhikara Prasa trying to malign the organisation. They warned that every other poser would face the same fate.         
	Anand said Bhikhara was wanted in several cases of dacoity and robbery.         
	The body has been sent for post-mortem and efforts are on to arrest the Naxalites.

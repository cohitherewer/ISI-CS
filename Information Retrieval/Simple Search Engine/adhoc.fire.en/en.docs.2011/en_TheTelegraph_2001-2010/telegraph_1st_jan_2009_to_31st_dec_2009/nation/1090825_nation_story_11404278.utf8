The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Judge consensus bid in assets row
                                                                                                               Judge consensus bid in assets row
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                          KG Balakrishnan                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 24: The Chief Justice of India today said he was trying to build consensus in the Supreme Court on whether judges assets should be made public.        
	We in the Supreme Court are trying to evolve a consensus, said K.G. Balakrishnan, who has so far resisted such a move.        
	The issue has divided the judiciary but united politicians, who have called for transparency and recently stalled a bill that would keep judges assets statements away from the public domain.        
	All judges now have to routinely declare their assets and liabilities to the chief justices of their courts, who have the discretion to make them public. The Central Information Commission had passed an order asking the CJI to part with such information but the apex court registry challenged it in Delhi High Court.        
	This has sparked a debate on why the judiciary should be exempt from a requirement that applies to all other public functionaries, with even some judges adopting a pro-transparency stand.        
	Former CJI J.S. Verma has said the refusal to publish such information was creating an impression that the judges had something to hide, and that he felt ashamed about it.        
	Justice Verma has publicly urged the current CJI to place his assets statement in the public domain, a challenge Justice Balakrishnan is yet to accept. The CJI fears that interested parties may misuse information on judges assets to eventually erode the independence of the judiciary.        
	Critics argue that the judiciary would be more susceptible to political pressure if the public is denied such information while the executive has it.        
	The controversy was revived last week when a Karnataka judge said the CJI had no authority to speak for all judges.

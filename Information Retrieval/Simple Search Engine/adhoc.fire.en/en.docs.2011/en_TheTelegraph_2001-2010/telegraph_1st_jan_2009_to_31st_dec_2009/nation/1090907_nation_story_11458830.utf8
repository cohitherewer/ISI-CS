                                                                                                               Gaya priests protest
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Gaya, Sept. 6: A section of Gayawal Pandas, priests holding the key to salvation, organised a demonstration against a drive to remove encroachment from the pilgrimage this morning.         
	The priests were joined by some of their clients visiting Gaya for prityapakshya.         
	According to municipal commissioner Rai Madan Kishore, protestors blocked traffic, raised slogans against the municipal corporation and pelted stones. The commissioner closely escaped injury as a stone, directed at him, hit his vehicle instead.         
	Trouble erupted in the morning hours as staff of municipal corporation imposed a penalty of Rs 1,000 on one priest after he refused to budge his office. The priests were provided time to remove their offices to avoid penal action in accordance with the Municipal Corporation Act, said Rai Madan Kishore.         
	Shatrughan in Gaya        
	Actor-turned-politician Shatrughan Sinha performed pindadan rituals for his father and ancestors at Vishnupad Temple in the afternoon. The rituals were conducted by Sinhas family priest. However, Shatru, as he is known, skipped shaving his head.        
	After the rituals, he told the media that facilities meant for the pilgrims were not up to the mark.                    
	The municipal commissioner said the corporation would not succumb to pressure tactics. Penalty would be imposed on violators, even if they are priests, he said.         
	Distancing himself from the protest, Vinod Meharwar, the secretary of the Association of Gayawal Pandas, denied any knowledge of a scuffle.         
	On Saturday, pilgrims protested against a railway decision to side-track a train carrying pilgrims to facilitate the passage of others at Manpur station for almost three hours.

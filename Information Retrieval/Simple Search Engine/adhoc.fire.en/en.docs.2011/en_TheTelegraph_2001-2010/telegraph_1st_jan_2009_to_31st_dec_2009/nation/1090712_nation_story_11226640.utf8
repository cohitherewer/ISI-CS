          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, July 11: Expect more lateral entry of experts into the governance process. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has said that Nandan Nilekanis induction as chairman of the body that will ensure a unique ID card to each Indian is not a one-off experiment.         
	Himself a technocrat who has risen to the most powerful political job in the country, Prime Minister Singh told journalists on the way back from Italy: I would like to involve more and more intellectuals in the processes of governance of our country. It is a process, and we have made a beginning and it is my hope that in due course of time, we can enlarge this process. We need all the wisdom, knowledge and experience and there is enormous reserve of knowledge, wisdom and experience available outside the political system.         
	He hinted, though, that the process would have to be gradual and take into account the sensitivities of the political class in an elected democracy. It will be my effort to do so (induct experts) at a pace at which it does not create any side effects. I think Nandan Nilekanis appointment has been widely welcomed and I sincerely hope that in due course of time we can enlarge the involvement of top intellectual elements in processes of governance, the Prime Minister said.         
	In response to a question on the recent court orders on Section 377 of the IPC, the Prime Minister hinted that the government might prefer to let the judiciary pronounce on sensitive sexual issues rather than intervene. Stating he was yet to discuss the court orders with his cabinet colleagues, Singh said: I will seek their views as to if anything further need to be done or said in this regard.

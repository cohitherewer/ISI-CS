	Lalgarh, June 22: Villages around Lalgarh that are known to be Maoist hubs have emptied. But central and state forces billeted in Lalgarh are not venturing out to sanitise them.        
	This is because the Subsidiary Intelligence Bureau, the central intelligence agency, has sent a report to the Bengal government that the Maoists might try to trap the forces.        
	We have information that armed Maoist cadres have moved into these empty villages, a police officer said. So the report we have received from the SIB fits into this.        
	The police are also checking out why there has been such a huge exodus from these villages.        
	It is very tempting to believe that the villagers have taken fright and fled at the sight of the huge force deployed here, and have assumed that the committee along with the Maoists will not be able to match our might, the officer said.        
	This may very well be true. But we are also checking whether in villages over which the Maoists have a stranglehold they have instigated people to leave in droves.        
	The officer explained that this would serve two purposes for the Maoists. One, it would earn them goodwill among the villagers who do not want to become part of human shields and be at the receiving end of the police action.        
	Two, it might tempt the police to venture into the empty villages where the Maoists, hiding behind the mud walls of the houses, would get a chance to fire at them.        
	Also, the roads leading to the villages are narrow kuchcha roads where police vehicles will not be able to ply. This means that policemen would have to trek through the village paths not knowing what lies ahead or where the Maoists are hiding.        
	This would make us extremely vulnerable, an officer said.        
	Besides, inside the villages, there are bushes and trees behind which the Maoists could be hiding. Another factor that has deterred the police from moving in is that to approach many villages, they have to walk along the banks of the Kangshabati river which could be heavily mined.        
	This is why the police have restricted themselves to marching only within Lalgarh town and dominating the Pirakata-Lalgarh road that they have secured.        
	Today, Zulfiquar Hasan, IG, welfare, reached Lalgarh from Calcutta and held a meeting with Midnapore DIG Praveen Kumar at Lalgarh police station.        
	The next course of action was discussed at this meeting.         
	Many DSP-level officers who had served in Lalgarh earlier were consulted at the meeting since they have a feel of the people here as well as the terrain, an officer said. We wanted to share their knowledge.

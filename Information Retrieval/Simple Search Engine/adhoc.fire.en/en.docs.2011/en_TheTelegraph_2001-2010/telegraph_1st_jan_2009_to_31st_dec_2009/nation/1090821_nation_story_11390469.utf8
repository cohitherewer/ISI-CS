                                                                                                               Classes off at IIT in pay ire
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           IIT Madras                                   
	New Delhi, Aug. 20: The IIT Madras faculty today declared they would stop taking classes indefinitely from tomorrow in protest over a new pay regime that teachers across the IITs and IIMs have dubbed disrespectfully inadequate.         
	The IIT Madras faculty associations decision is unprecedented in the history of the IITs and it means there will be no classes at the institute till the protest ends.         
	The faculty association also resolved to stop mentoring the new IIT at Hyderabad, a task that had been assigned to IIT Madras.         
	IIT Kharagpur teachers are also going on mass casual leave tomorrow. They will not take classes or perform administrative tasks. However, they will return to work on Monday.         
	Till late this evening, the authorities at the Madras and Kharagpur IITs were trying to convince angry teachers to come to work tomorrow, but the faculty refused to bow down.         
	The faculty associations of the other IITs are also scheduled to meet over the next two days to finalise their protest strategy.         
	The IIMs at present have not declared how they plan to protest the new pay regime.         
	The directors of all IITs are scheduled to meet in Chennai on Sunday, when they will discuss how to raise the concerns expressed by their faculty with the Union human resource development ministry.         
	As reported by The Telegraph on August 19, the new pay regime for teachers at these premier institutions snips increments recommended by a central pay panel under former Indian Institute of Science director Goverdhan Mehta.         
	The new regime approved by the cabinet earlier this month  but kept under wraps till it was notified yesterday  also cuts back on a slew of incentives suggested by the Mehta panel.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Trinamul basks in glory of Arunachal Five
                                                                                                               Trinamul basks in glory of Arunachal Five
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                  (From top) Karya Bagang, one of the five Trinamul winners; Gegong Apang, the five-time winner who lost; and current chief minister Dorjee Khandu who won                          
	Itanagar, Oct. 22: The Congress has retained power in Arunachal Pradesh with a two-thirds majority but five names that do not belong to the party now stand out on the victors roster.        
	Karya Bagang, Kamthok Lowang, Laeta Umbrey, Tani Loffa and Tapak Taku  all five have beaten their nearest Congress rivals.        
	The five also happen to be candidates of the Trinamul Congress.        
	Trinamul is now touting the victory of the five as evidence of the partys national presence outside Bengal, although the candidates have won on their own individual steam or because of the influence their families wield in the seats.        
	The victory in Arunachal helps the party acquire a national presence. This will give more teeth to the all-India description of our party, Mukul Roy, Trinamul leader and junior Union minister for shipping, said in Calcutta.        
	The toast of Trinamul was Karya Bagang, a homemaker who avenged her husbands defeat five years ago at the hands of Kameng Dolo, a Congress heavyweight who was then in the BJP. This time, she beat Dolo, a former deputy chief minister, in his backyard, Chayang Tajo in East Kameng.        
	Trinmaul had given tickets for 10 of the 26 seats it contested to sitting Congress MLAs. Only two of those who switched sides before the polls won.        
	A senior Trinamul leader admitted the winners had succeeded on their own merit. More than the party, it is the winning candidates who deserve applause since they have triumphed on their individual pull. The party hardly has any base in the state.         
	He also pointed out that several former Congress leaders lost despite a Trinamul tag. The fact that most of the former Congress leaders have lost despite the Trinamul tag goes to show that those who have won have done so because of themselves and not because of the party.         
	For the Congress, it was a sweep with a sting. The partys tally leapt to 42  including three seats it won uncontested  in the 60-member Assembly from 34 in 2004. But stalwart Gegong Apang bit the dust.        
	The former chief minister who had ruled the state for 23 years, though in interrupted spells, suffered a double blow. He lost to NCPs Alo Libang in Tuting Yingkiong, which he had won five times. His son Omak, a sitting MLA and a former Union minister, also lost, to a BJP candidate.        
	Th Congress played down the Apang ache and gloated over the peoples victory. Chief minister Dorjee Khandu, among those who won uncontested, and state party chief Nabam Tuki said the win was the result of the good work by the Congress at the Centre and the state.        
	The NCP, the Peoples Party of Arunachal and the BJP won five, four and three seats respectively. Only one Independent succeeded.

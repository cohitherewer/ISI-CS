The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Impeach warning from Moily
                                                                                                               Impeach warning from Moily
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 26: Union law minister Veerappa Moily today said the impression that nothing happens in impeachment has to go and declared that Calcutta High Court judge Saumitra Sen would definitely be impeached.        
	Chief Justice of India K.G. Balakrishnan has named Justice B. Sudershan Reddy to head a panel that will probe the charges of misconduct against Sen, Moily told a news conference. The report will be ready in no time, he added.        
	Once a motion of impeachment is introduced in any House of Parliament  in this case the Rajya Sabha  a probe panel frames the charges. The process was stalled in Sens case after Justice D.K. Jain of the Supreme Court, who was to head the panel, opted out. With Reddys appointment, the process will now go on.        
	The Chief Justice of India had recommended Sens removal over charges that he misused money entrusted to him as a receiver when he was a lawyer, before his elevation as a judge.        
	Keen to send the message that the judiciary also had to be accountable, Moily said a draft bill making it obligatory for judges of superior courts to reveal their assets and liabilities was ready. The bill will now be placed before the cabinet for its approval and introduced in Parliament, he said.        
	Moily tried to remove the impression that judges were reluctant to make such disclosures. The perception that judges arent ready to reveal such details is wrong.         
	Judges of the Supreme Court and high courts are now required under convention to file their assets and liabilities with the Chief Justice of India. But Balakrishnan had insisted that any disclosure law that required him to make the details public should come with safeguards to prevent misuse of such information. Otherwise, the law would end up eroding the judiciarys independence.         
	Moily also said he was working on another bill that would put in place a mechanism to ensure every complaint against a judge was properly looked into. Currently, there is nothing short of impeachment (to enforce accountability).        
	His ministry, he said, was also preparing a roadmap to improve the justice delivery mechanism. The plan will be ready by September and address the problem on several fronts.        
	Efforts were on to cut back on government litigation, enforce annual audit of cases being handled by every court and reduce disposal time from 15 years to three, Moily said. The backlog is alarming but highly exaggerated.         
	He said his ministry was planning to introduce specialised commercial courts in the four metros to deal with high-value cases.        
	On the controversy over the delay in dealing with Parliament attack convict Afzal Gurus mercy petition, the law minister agreed with suggestions that a mechanism was needed to ensure faster disposal of such pleas pending with the President.        
	But no political party has the discretion of following a pick-and-choose policy in such matters. Thats not done even in Pakistan. No country which believes in rule of law can exercise such discretion.         
	Moily insisted that while his ministry had not taken a decision on introducing reservations in the higher judiciary, he was conscious of the fact that social engineering had bypassed the judiciary.         
	While declaring that merit couldnt be compromised, he said it didnt mean that women, SCs and STs had no merit. The comment appeared to suggest that courts had to ensure representation to these sections in appointments to the higher judiciary.

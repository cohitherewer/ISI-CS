	Patna, March 16: The JD(U) president, Sharad Yadav, today refused to recognise the third front describing it as a group of frogs that cant be weighed on any scale.         
	Talking to the media, the party chief also desisted from divulging names of his candidates slated to join the fray on the plea that the names will be announced shortly. Sources revealed that the NDA is keeping its cards close to the chest, while waiting for the UPA to declare its candidates first.         
	Nobody knows the many directions that these frogs (third front partners) may go after the Lok Sabha polls. Parties with diverse shades have formed what they are describing as a third front that has neither a goal, nor a political philosophy, Sharad Yadav said. The JD(U) president, however, recognised the importance of the Left. The Left is a political force.         
	Asked about his meeting with the CPM politburo member, Sitaram Yechuri, yesterday, he said: It was a courtesy call. Yechuri and Left leaders had come to see when I was ill.         
	The Left and JD(U) have worked together in several governments in the past and share a positive relationship. But, the JD(U) is a part of the NDA and is working to strengthen the NDA as of now.         
	The senior leader dismissed the third front from the poll race and said that the battle would boil down to the UPA versus the NDA. Members of the so-called third front will split, joining either the UPA or the NDA after the Lok Sabha polls, he predicted.        
	Referring to LJP chief Ram Vilas Paswans hope of becoming the Prime Minister, Sharad Yadav said: Even Jaspal Bhatti declared himself a prospective Prime Minister in a television show yesterday.         
	He also refused to talk about his candidature from Madhepura. The JD(U) will decide if I contest from Madhepura or from two seats.         
	Meanwhile, a revolt-like situation arose in the NDA and the UPA ranks over suspicions of contenders being denied party tickets. A number of disgruntled candidates mobbed Sharad Yadav when he landed in Patna.         
	The Kishenganj unit of the BJP has raised a banner of revolt against the leadership for conceding the Kishenganj seat to the JD(U). The BJP and JD(U) have agreed to contest 25 and 15 seats, respectively.

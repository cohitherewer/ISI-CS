	Allahabad, Dec. 15 (PTI): Allahabad High Court today upheld the life sentence awarded to a constable for killing five Sikhs at a police station in the aftermath of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhis assassination.          
	A division bench dismissed the appeal of Tilak Ram, who had claimed that he was of unsound mind at the time of the incident. Ram had opened fire on a group of Sikhs who had gathered at Badaut police station (now in Baghpat district) in the early hours of November 5, 1984, and had threatened fellow police personnel when they tried to stop him.          
	The court dismissed his plea, saying it was not a schizophrenic act but an instance of Sikh killing, the like of which had happened and was happening at that time because of the assassination of Indira Gandhi.                  
	New Delhi (PTI): The government has said it will strive to set up National Security Guard hubs or its equivalent commando force in each state. But home minister P. Chidambaram also warned that this was a long- term plan in view of constraints of manpower and training.                   
	New Delhi (PTI): The CBI has filed a case against a former income-tax commissioner for allegedly obtaining pecuniary advantage of about Rs 50 lakh and claimed to have tracked down cash and property worth crores during raids at his residence.

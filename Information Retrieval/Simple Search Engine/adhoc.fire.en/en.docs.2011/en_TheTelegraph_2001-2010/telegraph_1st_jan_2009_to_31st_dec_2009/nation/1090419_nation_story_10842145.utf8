The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | State govt worried over force exit
                                                                                                               State govt worried over force exit
          SUBRAT DAS                              
	Bhubaneswar, April 18: Withdrawal of central paramilitary forces after the second phase of polling in Orissa has worried the state government as well as the minority community.        
	The 45 companies of central paramilitary forces deployed in the state are to be pulled out from Orissa for deployment in other states once the second phase of polling is over on April 23, said director-general of police Manmohan Praharaj. He added that the state government had requested the Centre to retain some of the forces.        
	The state government, which is facing twin threats of Maoists menace and communal violence, is obviously worried. At least 16 of total 30 districts are now affected by the Maoist menace.        
	Cuttack-Bhubaneswar diocese archbishop Raphael Cheenath said: Security of the minority community members may be in danger. As long as the riot victims are living in relief camps and normality is not fully restored, central paramilitary forces should be there.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Northeastgrapples with rebel factor 
                                                                                                               Northeastgrapples with rebel factor

	Fear is the key. Come April 16, and over the next seven days, insurgency, or its side effects, could well influence the three-phase vote when people in the Northeast troop to polling booths.        
	Except, perhaps, Mizoram, the lone island of peace in the troubled region.        
	In 14-seat Assam, the year began with three blasts, hours before Union home minister P. Chidambarams scheduled visit. On Saturday, Karbi militants called a 48-hour strike from April 15 and warned that all polling officials who defy the bandh would be targeted. The bandh was, however, called off on April 14.        
	In insurgency-torn Manipur, militants hold the state to ransom and run a parallel government. In adjoining Nagaland, the NSCN continues to influence affairs of the state, though it is observing a ceasefire now. It could also decide the outcome in two districts under the Arunachal East constituency in Arunachal Pradesh.         
	In Tripura, some areas in the east are seen as risky. In Meghalaya, the militant group HNLC had called a bandh to coincide with Sonia Gandhis visit on Monday. But the Congress chiefs trip went off peacefully.         
	In Assam, blasts in quick succession  one on March 31 hours before a rally by foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee and several on April 6 a day ahead of Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs visit  have put the ruling Congress on a sticky wicket.        
	The Congress is hoping to improve upon its tally of 11 seats it got last time in the Northeast, nine of them in Assam alone. But it is in Assam where it is headed for a stern test with the Opposition AGP joining hands with the BJP.        
	The Assam United Democratic Front may make its debut in parliamentary polls by cutting into the Congresss vote among minorities in Silchar. The apparent disenchantment of tea tribes with the party has added to its woes.        
	In Sikkim, the ruling SDF won the states lone Lok Sabha seat in 2004. This year, seven candidates are in the fray, and analysts believe Opposition votes may split, giving an edge to chief minister Pawan Chamlings SDF.        
	Elections in Mizoram are a relatively orderly affair, watched by Church bodies that wield tremendous influence.         
	The Northeast goes to the polls on April 16, 22 and 23

	Bangalore, June 13: Karwar police have found the body of a man in the Kali river, not far from the Kaiga Atomic Energy Station township from where scientific officer L. Mahalingam went missing six days ago.         
	We are yet to identify the body, said Karwar police superintendent Raman Gupta. The police are also yet to establish the cause of death.        
	However, PTI reported that the Kaiga plant authorities had identified the body and that the family members had also confirmed the identification.        
	Mahalingam, who was working in the simulator training section, had gone out for a morning walk on Monday last but did not return to the residential township located about 20km from the power plant.        
	The township and the plant are set amid a forest and close to the Kali river.         
	Navy divers fished out the body today. They had been called in after a search by local divers yielded no result, Gupta said. The local divers had searched a stretch of 35-40km in the river.        
	District police, CISF and forest department personnel had also intensified their joint operation in combing the Kaiga forest before the body was found in the river.         
	Mahalingam had earlier worked with the Madras Atomic Power Project at Kalpakkam near Chennai.

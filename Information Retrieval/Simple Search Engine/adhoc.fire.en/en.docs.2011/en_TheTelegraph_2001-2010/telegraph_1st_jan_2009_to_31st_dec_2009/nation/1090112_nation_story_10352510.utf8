          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          A villager in Orissa reconstructs his house damaged in a cyclone                                  
	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 11: The Orissa State Disaster Management Authority has submitted a proposal of Rs 441 crore to the Centre for implementation of World Bank-assisted National Cyclone Risk Mitigation Project.        
	The chief secretary and chairman of the authority, Ajit Tripathy, said the project would be funded by the Centre as a grant to the state through National Disaster Management Authority. While the Centre would provide 75 per cent funds, the rest would be shared by the state government, he said.        
	The project would be implemented in the coastal districts of Balasore, Bhadrak, Kendrapara, Jagatsinghpur, Puri, Ganjam and parts of Khurda adjoining Chilika lake, he said.        
	Earlier, the Orissa State Disaster Management Authority had submitted the investment proposal involving a cost of Rs 234.7 crore in 2005. Later, it was revised to Rs 609.4 crore on the basis of current schedule of rates and the revised proposal was submitted to the national authority in August 2007.        
	However, as the national authority requested to limit the proposal to around Rs 400 crore under component-B (structural measures), the project was revised to Rs 441 crore and submitted to the authority recently, Tripathy said.        
	The project, spread over a period of three years, is likely to be implemented from April this year, he said.         
	Meanwhile, the state authority has got ISO 9001 certification from the Norway-based certification body Det Norske Veritas AS for its activities in conformity to the requirement of international standard, said Tripathy.         
	The certification will help the authority to measure its own achievements against the objective targets and for setting higher targets to reach further heights continually in future and fulfil its objectives, he said.        
	Orissa has also been shortlisted for the Prime Ministers award for best flood management this year, said Tripathy.

	Bhopal, Feb. 1: A battle is on in Bhopal and the army is out  to salvage a heavily silted, fast-drying lake.        
	Thousands of men in olive green have joined a brigade of schoolchildren, senior citizens, NGOs, civic officials and government employees to remove silt from Bada Talab, a picturesque lake that has long been the major source of water for the city of more than a million.        
	The initiative, one of the first tasks chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan took up after returning to power in December, has now morphed into a public campaign that has seen people from all walks of life pitching in.        
	The urgency behind the Apna Sarovar, Apni Dharohar, Bada Taal Suraksha Abhiyaan (Our Lake, Our Heritage, Save Big Lake Campaign) has come from warnings that water in the lake may last only a few months.        
	Scanty rainfall in 2008 forced the Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC) to restrict water supply to alternate days. Even after that, water (in the lake) will last only till March, said Abdul Jabbar, a member of an NGO for survivors of the 1984 gas victims that is part of the lake campaign.        
	Lieutenant General A.S. Lamba, the general officer commanding of Sudarshan Chakra Corps, said his team would put in 14,000 man-hours in the community labour initiative.         
	Over the past two days, more than 1,000 army personnel, including 100 officers, have worked to de-silt the lake so that it can store more water during this years monsoon.        
	Jabbar said the lake, built in the eleventh century by Raja Bhoj of the Paramar dynasty, had shrunk from 31sqkm to 9sqkm because of years of neglect and exploitation.        
	The army has decided to join the effort for two consecutive weeks with special vehicles. We will offer 14,000 man-hours with highly trained engineers and machinery, said Lamba, who himself took part in the desilting.        
	The participation in the lake effort is in line with Sudarshan Chakras ecological initiatives, including tree plantation, social forestry and water harvesting, Lamba added.        
	Bhopals residents hope the campaign will set a trend of public participation in conserving the states other ill-kept water bodies.         
	The effort has thrown up another gain: senior bureaucrats and politicians, often out of reach, can often be seen at the site.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cong stays off Mamata track
                                                                                                               Cong stays off Mamata track
  - Ruling party will not head rail panel         RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              Mamata, Sonia				                                       
	New Delhi, Aug. 7: The Congress has chosen not to head the parliamentary standing committee on railways to avoid run-ins with rail minister Mamata Banerjee.        
	The DMK, a UPA ally, has been persuaded by the Congresss parliamentary managers to take the chairmanship of the panel.        
	The post was with the CPM since 1996, but for a period from late 1999 to 2001 when Mamata was railway minister for the first time in the NDA government.        
	The Left Front was requested to opt out again after Trinamul Congress chief Mamata returned as railway minister. It willingly agreed.        
	The Congress did not want to hand the chairmanship of the panel to the BJP, fearing it could play politics and create problems for Mamata. The party had to choose between keeping the post for itself or handing it to an ally.         
	The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) was ruled out because with only nine MPs, it could not head a panel. The post went to the DMK as the Congress trusts it would play straight and narrow and keep out of Mamatas way.        
	Former Union minister T.R. Baalu is likely to be the chairman.        
	The Left can claim two chairmanships, one each in both Houses. Rajya Sabha MP Sitaram Yechury is likely to retain the chairmanship of the standing committee on transport (including civil aviation), tourism and culture.         
	But the front is unlikely to get rural development, which Left leaders indicated was their first choice among the committees in the Lok Sabhas quota. That ministry is expected to go to the BJP. The Left has been asked to choose from energy, steel and urban development.         
	The government is grappling with another problem, triggered by the Samajwadi Party. Like the Left, the Samajwadis can chair two panels. The party has placed power, petroleum and information technology and communications on the table. Government sources said they were unwilling to consider its wish list because the three ministries involved issues impinging directly or indirectly on the clash of interests between the Ambani brothers, Mukesh and Anil.         
	The Samajwadi Party had openly taken up cudgels on Anils behalf and demanded the resignation of oil and natural gas minister Murli Deora for allegedly siding with Mukesh.        
	Samajwadi sources maintained they would not settle for any other ministry and that, if necessary, they would go to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. He is the only Congress leader who is still sympathetic to us, said a Samajwadi MP. However, Congress sources said Singh was unlikely to intervene in the matter.        
	In the last Lok Sabha, the Samajwadis headed IT and communications while power and petroleum were with the Congress.        
	Amethi MP Rahul Gandhi said he would like to continue as a member of the panel on human resource development  which was chaired by Congress general-secretary Janardhan Dwivedi last time. The sources said Dwivedi could continue heading it.        
	The 24 ministry-related standing committees have two main tasks: to examine demands for grants in the budget session, and to peruse bills referred to them by either House when there is a dispute and amendments are sought.        
	Unlike House queries that are public, the standing committees discuss matters in private. They can access privileged information on government plans and policies.

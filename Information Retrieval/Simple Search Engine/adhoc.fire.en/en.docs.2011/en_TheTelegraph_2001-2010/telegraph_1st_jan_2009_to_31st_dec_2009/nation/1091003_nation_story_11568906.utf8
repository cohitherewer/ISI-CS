The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Shipwreck worry for rare turtles
                                                                                                               Shipwreck worry for rare turtles
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Oct. 2: Turtle conservation group Operation Kachhapa today warned that MV Black Rose cargo carrier, which sank off Paradip on September 9, had now turned into a threat for the environment in the absence of efforts to carry out remedial measures.        
	Operation Kachhapa co-ordinator Biswajit Mohanty expressed shock that the port trust had not yet announced any plan to salvage the ship from its present location. Allowing the wreck to remain there can be a disaster for nearby beaches even after removal of stored oil, he said.        
	Submerged ships near beaches are known to cause massive beach erosion.        
	Mohanty had urged the environment department and pollution control board to issue directions to the Paradip port to salvage the ship completely instead of only recovering its fuel.        
	MV Black Rose is an artificial disturbance to natural current flow patterns.         
	This is expected to affect nearby nesting beaches of Agarnasi island of the Gahirmatha Marine Sanctuary where thousands of Olive Ridley sea turtles nest every winter, he said.                          
	After the end of monsoon this month, sea currents in the Orissa coast change direction and move from south to north bringing about deposition of sediment. But due to the huge artificial obstruction caused by this large ship, the current pattern will be disrupted, leading to erosion of beaches at turtle nesting grounds, he added.        
	The best solution will be to tow the ship to deeper waters to a distance of at least 20km and leave it in deep waters or in the alternative float and remove it for ship breaking, Mohanty suggested.        
	Meanwhile, the Paradip port had floated tenders to retrieve the trapped 924MT of furnace oil. But the process was inexplicably delayed by more than two weeks, exposing local environment to avoidable danger, the environment group rued.        
	Since the migratory Olive Ridley sea turtles are expected to arrive next week, it will be a sure disaster if these materials pollute the area before their arrival, he emphasised.

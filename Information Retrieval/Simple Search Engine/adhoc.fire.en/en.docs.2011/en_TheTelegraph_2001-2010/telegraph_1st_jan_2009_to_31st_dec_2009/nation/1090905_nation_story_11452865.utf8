                                                                                                               JD-U declares summons illegal
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Patna, Sept. 4: The JD(U) today declared a chief judicial magistrates (CJM) summons to chief minister Nitish Kumar as illegal.         
	The Barh CJM has transgressed his authority by issuing summons to Nitish Kumar in a case in which he stands acquitted, said the state JD(U) chief Lallan Singh. Party general secretary Shivanand Tiwary concurred.        
	The two leaders also circulated a copy of Patna High Courts order issued on April 4, 2009, staying proceedings in the 1991 murder case under Pandarak police station area of Barh sub-division in Patna district.        
	The CJM has overstepped his jurisdiction as he has issued a summon despite the fact that a superior court has stayed proceedings, Lallan Singh said, adding: We will challenge CJMs order in the court of the Chief Justice of the Patna High Court. Rajaram Singh, the brother of deceased Congress activist Sitaram Singh who was gunned down on a polling station on November 19, 1991, submitted a petition in the Barh CJMs court on January 10, 2008, stating that he had no complaints against Nitish Kumar or others in the case for its main accused Dilip Singh had died.         
	Police, too, had submitted a final form giving a clean chit to Nitish. The court accepted Rajarams petition and the polices final form. But Ashok Singh, a relative of Sitaram Singh, submitted a fresh PIL on January 9, 2009, on the basis of which the court summoned Nitish on September 9.         
	The court should not have issued a summon, especially after case proceedings were stayed by a higher court, said one of the leaders.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Talks on to work out Bengal tie-up
                                                                                                               Talks on to work out Bengal tie-up

	New Delhi, Feb. 10: Congress sources have said high-level negotiations were on to stitch an alliance with the Trinamul Congress following gestures from both sides.        
	Congress leaders holding talks with Mamata and other Trinamul leaders said the move to withdraw the party nominee from the Bishnupur West Assembly seat was cleared by Sonia Gandhi.         
	The sources said Sonia and other AICC leaders were pleased by Mamatas statement that disapproved of the BJPs Ram temple plank. The AICC leaders said Sonia and Rahul Gandhi took note of Mamatas assertion that Trinamul would back a secular alliance after the Lok Sabha polls.        
	The sources said that in principle the two sides had agreed to let Mamatas party contest the bulk of seats in south Bengal while the Congress would fight the majority of seats in north Bengal.         
	Although some sections of the Congress continue to view Pranab Mukherjee, the new state Congress chief, as anti-Mamata, AICC officials looking after Bengal affairs said that in party meetings, the Union minister seldom opposed the idea of an alliance.         
	At another level, Congress leaders said CPM general secretary Prakash Karats recent TV interview, too, prompted the Congress to look at Mamata more closely.         
	Karat said that in the post-Lok Sabha poll scenario, the Left parties would have problems backing the Congress, irrespective of its prime ministerial candidate.         
	The Bengal alliance is crucial to Sonia. While the AICC chief is determined to deny the NDA a chance to return to power, Congress leaders said she was equally conscious of the coming together of opportunistic and rank anti-Congress forces with the sole purpose of keeping her party out of power.         
	With the alliance talks with the Samajwadi Party hitting a rough patch, Congress leaders said the Bengal alliance had assumed added significance.        
	The Congress assessment is that if an alliance with Trinamul becomes a reality, the Lefts tally in Bengal could be curtailed to half.

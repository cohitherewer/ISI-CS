          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 20: Delhi High Court today granted Varun Gandhi anticipatory bail till March 27 in a case over his alleged anti-Muslim speech at an election rally.         
	This gives the BJP leader enough time to have the FIR, filed in Pilibhit under the Election Commissions order for the alleged March 8 remarks, quashed by Allahabad High Court and file his election papers when nominations open on March 23.         
	The leader today gave his reply to the poll panel notice, denying the charges and claiming that the CD containing his speech was doctored.         
	The BJP shrugged off any responsibility for the alleged speech in its reply.

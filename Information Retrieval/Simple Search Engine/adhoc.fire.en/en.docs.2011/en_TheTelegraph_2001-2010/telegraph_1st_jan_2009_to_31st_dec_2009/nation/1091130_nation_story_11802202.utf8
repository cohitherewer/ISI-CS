	New Delhi, Nov. 29 (PTI): Home minister P. Chidambaram today said the proposed multi-state offensive against Maoists would be intelligence-based and the forces would have to adopt tactics implemented to tackle militancy.        
	In these areas, operations have to be intelligence-based and (security forces) have to secure the support of the community and people living in those areas, he said.

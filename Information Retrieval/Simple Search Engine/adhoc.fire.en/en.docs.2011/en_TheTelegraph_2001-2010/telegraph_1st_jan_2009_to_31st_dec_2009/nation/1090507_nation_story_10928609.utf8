The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Kalyan factor: Not all are unforgiving 
                                                                                                               Kalyan factor: Not all are unforgiving 
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN IN BULANDSHAHR                              Kalyan, Mulayam: Friendship on trial				                                 
	One needed a lifeline, the other a tonic. So Kalyan Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, enemies once, sealed a pact.         
	Come May 7, that friendship will be on test when Uttar Pradesh votes in the fourth round of polling.        
	When Kalyan Singh folded up his five-year-old Rashtriya Kranti Dal and returned to the BJP in 2004, beaten and humbled, his supporters said the homecoming was less out of choice than compulsion.        
	Apparently, the incorruptible former chief minister couldnt raise the money he needed to run his outfit, floated in 1999.        
	The second time he left the BJP, he was more pragmatic. At 76, the man who was once on the same pedestal as Atal Bihari Vajpayee and L.K. Advani has neither the energy nor the resources to float a party.        
	He wants to become a member of Parliament and, if possible, get his son elected to the Assembly, said a former Congress MP of Etah, Kailash Yadav.        
	Kalyan is contesting from Etah in west-central Uttar Pradesh as an Independent with the Samajwadi Partys support against sitting Samajwadi MP Devendra Prasad Yadav who has crossed sides and is the BSPs candidate.        
	The Samajwadi was Kalyans only lifeline for survival, said Kailash, who is now with Mulayam.        
	If Kalyans expectations are limited to winning a single seat, Mulayams hopes from the pact that has churned social equations soar higher. Kalyan belongs to the backward Lodh-Rajput caste. A conservative estimate says the caste can be decisive in 16 Lok Sabha seats from Bulandshahr in the north-west to Lalitpur in the south-west.        
	Mulayam had been feeling restless about his Muslim support ever since he suffered losses in the 2007 Assembly elections. The Yadavs, too, were feeling low. He needed to infuse tonic into the body politic. The tonic was Kalyan. He calculated that the coming together of two major OBC leaders might regroup the backward castes, said Kailash.        
	But the mixed reaction among Muslims to an alliance with the person they still hold responsible for the Babri Masjid demolition makes the move a huge gamble.        
	In Bulandshahr, where the Samajwadis Kamlesh Valmiki is locked in a triangular contest with the Congresss Devi Dayal and the BJPs Ashok Pradhan, clerics have appealed to Muslims to vote for the Congress in the interest of preserving the soul of Islam.        
	But Muslims in constituencies neighbouring Bulandshahr have taken the pact in their stride as Mulayam and Kalyan vowed to seal their friendship in meeting after meeting.        
	The former BJP leader has gone the extra mile to assuage minority sentiments. Addressing a meeting for the Samajwadis Aligarh candidate, Zafar Alam, at Alambaghpur, 45km from the city, he told the crowd: In this country, if Hindus command respect, Muslims deserve more respect because they have sacrificed a lot for its freedom.        
	Alam, a lock manufacturer who left the RLD and joined the Samajwadi despite Kalyan after Ajit Singh cosied up to the BJP, said: Yes, Kalyan was the CM when the mosque fell. But he was a member of the BJP and, as a disciplined soldier of the party, he merely implemented the high commands orders. Kalyan has disowned the BJP while Ajit has embraced them.        
	About 90km away in Firozabad  where Mulayams son Akhilesh is pitted against his fathers former protg S.P. Singh Baghel  the Samajwadi has mobilised clerics to win over Muslim support.        
	When the Maker forgives, we are only his creations, said Alam Ansari, the town president of the Momin Conference. Kalyan has been punished. His only objective is to stop the BJP in its tracks and we should support him.        
	 Bulandshahr, Firozabad, Agra and Etah vote on May 7

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Rebel angle                                  
	Bhubaneswar, June 16: Narayanpatna continued to simmer today as Chasi Muliya Adivasi Sangha carried on with their protests against illegal occupation of tribal land by non-tribals, with a little help from the Naxalites.        
	In the early hours today, Naxalites destroyed a nursery that belonged to the forest department and that housed rare saplings. However, no one was injured in the incident as no one was present at the office during the attack. Sources said an estimated 38,000 saplings were destroyed.         
	Hand-written posters were left behind that complained that the nursery was enabling non-tribals to take away tribal rights on forests.         
	Before leaving, Naxalites also blocked several approach roads to Narayanpatna by felling trees disrupting traffic and affecting communication on the Laxmipur-Narayanpatna, Parbatipur-Narayanpatna, and Rayagada-Narayanpatna roads.        
	Till noon, most of the roads remained clogged.         
	Security in the area has been beefed up and work is on to clear the roads, said Koraput superintendent of police Dipak Chouhan adding that the situation was tense, but under control         
	Earlier the organisation had pressed for the closure of the nursery that they alleged was set up on lands that were snatched from marginalised tribals and was being used for plantation.        
	While rumours of the outfit bearing a ultra Left-wing leaning have been doing rounds, the organisation leaders had been denying the link all along. However, Narayanpatna is also a major Naxalite hub of Koraput.         
	The group had also directed its supporters to not let forest department plant trees on land used by them.        
	Yesterday, the same group had tilled around 800 acre of agriculture land and planted red flags on the ground.         
	Some hundreds of men, woman and children bearing traditional weapons had also taken to the streets protesting the land rights violations by non-tribals.

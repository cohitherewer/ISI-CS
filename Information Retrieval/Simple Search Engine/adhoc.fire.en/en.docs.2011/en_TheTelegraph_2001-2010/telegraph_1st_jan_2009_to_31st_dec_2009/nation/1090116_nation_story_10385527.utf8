The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | IMR blot on riot district
                                                                                                               IMR blot on riot district
  - Orissa second on infant death list          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 15: The strife-torn Kandhamal district now carries yet another disturbing tag. The tribal-dominated district has reported the countrys highest infant mortality rate (IMR)  121.        
	This was revealed in the latest report, Infant and Child Mortality in India: District Level Estimates, prepared by the New Delhi-based Population Foundation of India (PFI).        
	Keeping in view the policy of decentralised planning, district  the lowest administrative level  is taken as a more appropriate unit of health planning, including planning for child survival strategies. Planning at this level is also more appropriate because of the relative ease of availability of technology and skill necessary for implementation of programmes, PFI executive director A.R. Nanda said.        
	Among the 593 districts, Kandhamal is having the highest (121) IMR, while Kottayam in Kerala recorded the lowest (13), the report said.         
	The distribution of districts by IMR in the report shows that there are 42 districts having IMR 97 and above. In case of eight districts, IMR is equal to the national average of 54 and 338 districts record IMR more than the national average.         
	Among the states and Union territories, Madhya Pradesh has the highest IMR (94), followed by Orissa (90). Kerala has the lowest IMR at 18. As for child mortality rate (CMR), the trend continues with Madhya Pradesh having the highest (102), followed by Uttar Pradesh (94) and Orissa (90). Kerala has the lowest (20). Besides, female IMR is more than male IMR in states like Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Bihar, Mizoram, Nagaland and Kerala.         
	But Kandhamal chief district medical officer had a different argument. People in Kandhamal are more aware than those of Koraput or Kalahandi. Therefore the IMR will be more or less the same as in those districts and should not exceed 90, said A.M.M. Patnaik, the Kandhamal chief district medical officer.         
	The main causes of deaths in the newborn period are prematurely and low birth weight, sepsis, birth asphyxia, infections like acute respiratory tract infections, diarrhoea and malaria, post-measles complications and malnutrition.

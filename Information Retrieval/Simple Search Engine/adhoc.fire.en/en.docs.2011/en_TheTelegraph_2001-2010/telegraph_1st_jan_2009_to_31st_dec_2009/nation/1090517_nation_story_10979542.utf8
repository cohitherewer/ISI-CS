The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Maya trips over caste coalition and falls
                                                                                                               Maya trips over caste coalition and falls
  - PM dream fades          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Mayavati: Same as 2004                                        
	New Delhi, May 16: Mayavati wanted to be Prime Minister, so she set her government babus a target of ensuring 50-60 seats for her.        
	She thought it shouldnt be difficult  segment-by-segment math based on the 2007 Assembly polls verdict already gave her 48 of the states 80 Lok Sabha seats.        
	Today, she was left with just 19  equal to her tally in 2004 when she was out of power  while the Congress, believed to be down and out, bagged 21. So why did she fall, and why so fast?        
	Political observers in Uttar Pradesh say that in 2007, Mayavati had simply borrowed the Congresss old formula of stitching the Brahmins, Muslims and Dalits into a single vote bank. In other words, she had borrowed an emaciated Congresss vote bank. Some of those voters returned to a resurgent Congress this election.        
	The old Congresss core leadership, drawn primarily from the Brahmins, had been able to paper over the tensions in the three-way coalition; Mayavati couldnt.        
	It helped that the Congress had ruled the state at a time the Dalits were yet to assert themselves and had been content mortgaging their rights and interests with the Brahmins. That changed with the BSPs rise.        
	In village after village during this campaign, Brahmin voters carped about how the BSP had taken their votes but given them nothing (although every second minister in Mayavatis cabinet is a Brahmin).         
	There were complaints of Dalit officials liberally using the Dalit atrocity law to book innocent upper castes, of Mayavati asking for surplus land to be redistributed among Dalits, and of Brahmins having to pay bribes to get anything done.        
	The Dalits, too, said sharing political space with the Brahmins was untenable, and the sooner the arrangement ended the better for all.        
	The Muslims were unsure about voting for the BSP again because of the buzz that she might tap the BJP to become Prime Minister. Already put off with the Samajwadi Party for embracing Kalyan Singh, they voted for the Congress.        
	As for the Brahmins, they did not want to see Mayavati as Prime Minister, period.        
	Even some Dalits felt Mayavati should do something more substantial for them than put up statues of herself and her mentor Kanshi Ram.        
	One other factor that cost Mayavati was fielding charge-sheeted defectors from the Samajwadi Party and the BJP, analysts said. Uttar Pradesh is no stranger to crime-tainted politicians, but Mayavati had won the Assembly polls promising to end Mulayam Singh Yadavs goonda raj.

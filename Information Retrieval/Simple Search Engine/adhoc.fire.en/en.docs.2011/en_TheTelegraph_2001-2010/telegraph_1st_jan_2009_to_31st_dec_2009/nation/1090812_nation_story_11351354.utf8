The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Babri report in winter session
                                                                                                               Babri report in winter session
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                          Liberhan                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 11: The government has decided to table the Liberhan Commission report along with an action-taken report in the next session of Parliament, The Telegraph has learnt.        
	The report, which Justice Liberhan handed over to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on July 1, is bound to create political ripples and discomfit the BJP, which had played a major part in the Babri Masjid demolition in Ayodhya on December 6, 1992.        
	It (the report) has been submitted and the government will table it on the very first day of the next session of Parliament, a senior home ministry official said.        
	Having taken nearly 17 years and 48 extensions to be completed, the report reached the home ministry from the Prime Ministers Office within a fortnight. Home minister P. Chidambaram, who has gone though it, has promised Parliament that the report will be tabled in both Houses within the stipulated six months of its submission.        
	In order to table the Liberhan report along with an action-taken report, steps will have to be taken over the next three months. The government can reject the recommendations in the report. Sources said that if the report is not rejected, there might be a few arrests of those indicted.        
	The next session of Parliament is likely to be held in November, after the state elections in Maharashtra, Haryana and probably Jharkhand take place in October. So, while the government is for now insulated from any adverse content the report may have, the UPA may be able to use it to corner the BJP over the next few months.        
	Those questioned during Justice Liberhans 399 sittings includes L.K. Advani and then Uttar Pradesh chief minister Kalyan Singh, who is now close to Mulayam Singh Yadav.        
	The panel, set up on December 16, 1992, was asked to probe the sequence of events leading to ---- and all the facts and circumstances relating to ---- the occurrences at the Ayodhya complex 10 days earlier.         
	This included the destruction of the structure, security deficiencies, and the roles played by the then chief minister and his council of ministers, officials of the Uttar Pradesh government, and individuals, organisations and agencies concerned, or in any way connected, with the destruction of the structure.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | My CM or poll: Soren
                                                                                                               My CM or poll: Soren
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Soren: Firm on successor                                  
	Ranchi, Jan. 12: Jharkhand chief minister Shibu Soren today resigned five days after his Tamar bypoll defeat, but declared that the JMM would prefer fresh elections if party legislator Champai Soren was not considered for the top job.        
	Governor Syed Sibtey Razi accepted his resignation but asked him to continue in caretaker capacity till a replacement was found. A viable alternative will be worked out in accordance with the Constitution and democratic values.        
	After holding on in defiance of the UPA diktat to step down, Soren was left with no alternative today when his deputy Stephen Marandi submitted his resignation to the governor.        
	Soren told reporters the JMM would not accept any government other than one led by Champai Soren. His party, he said, would prefer to face fresh elections rather than support any other government in the state.        
	During my last Delhi visit, the UPA asked me to find a successor. On my return to Ranchi, I called a UPA meeting. But no one turned up. In the meantime, our party evolved a consensus around Champai Soren. No other candidate will be acceptable to us. Champai nahin to chunav, he said.

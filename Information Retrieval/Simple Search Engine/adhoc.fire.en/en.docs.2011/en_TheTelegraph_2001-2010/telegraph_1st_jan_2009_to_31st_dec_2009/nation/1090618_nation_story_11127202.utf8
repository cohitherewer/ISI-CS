The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP quit parade continues
                                                                                                               BJP quit parade continues
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Koshyari in Delhi. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, June 17: A resignation a day keeps chinta (worry) and chintan (introspection) away. For the BJP, at least.        
	After Yashwant Sinha and Arun Jaitley quit party posts, Bhagat Singh Koshyari resigned from the Rajya Sabha today. He was elected only four months ago from Uttarakhand, his home state.         
	Koshyari sent his resignation to Rajya Sabha chairperson Hamid Ansari, not the BJP chief, indicating he was serious about quitting.        
	Koshyaris move could de-stabilise the BJP government in Uttarakhand. After the BJPs wipe-out in the hill state  it lost all five Lok Sabha seats to the Congress  chief minister B.C. Khanduri was under fire from a section of his MLAs who rallied around Koshyari. However, on L.K. Advanis intervention, Khanduri managed to keep his job.        
	Koshyari, a Rajnath Singh loyalist, had been advised by the BJP president to lie low for a while, at least until the party settled the problems on other fronts. But BJP sources said Koshyari, emboldened by the swipes at the top leadership by veterans such as Sinha and Jaswant Singh, thought it apt to strike while the iron was hot. The sources said his resignation was a pressure tactic to force Khanduri to quit.         
	It is unclear how much support Koshyari has among the 35 BJP MLAs. The figure ranged between 20 and eight, depending on who was spoken to.        
	Sources said Koshyari was brought to the Upper House this February so that Khanduri would be free of dissidence ahead of the Lok Sabha polls.         
	Although Khanduri, a retired lieutenant general, was seen as a clean and efficient administrator, many BJP members were unhappy with his military style of functioning.         
	Sources said Koshyaris supporters had asked him to return to Uttarakhand to stay relevant in state politics. Khanduri has tried hard to neutralise Koshyaris followers. If he stays put in Delhi, he will have no one left in the state, a former Uttarakhand MP said. State elections are due in 2012.        
	Koshyari told Rajnath he wanted to return to rebuild the organisation before the 2012 state poll. Asked if Khanduri would be asked to quit, BJP spokesperson Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said: The parliamentary board will take a call. We want to run a stable government.

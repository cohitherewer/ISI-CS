The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sibal scare for diaspora plan
                                                                                                               Sibal scare for diaspora plan
          JAYANTH JACOB                              
	New Delhi, June 15: The ripples from Kapil Sibals probe into deemed universities are being felt in other areas of education. It has complicated matters for the five proposed Persons of Indian Origin universities, to be set up by private Indian groups to attract children of the diaspora.        
	A nervous ministry of overseas Indian affairs (OIA), which is to guide and facilitate the establishment of the PIO varsities, is now planning legislation to grant these institutions full-fledged university status.        
	The original idea, envisaged in the more relaxed days when Arjun Singh was education minister, was to have these five as deemed universities, a status that only needs a nod from the University Grants Commission (UGC) instead of an act of Parliament.        
	But the OIA ministry has had second thoughts after Sibal turned the spotlight on the controversial mushrooming of deemed universities across the country under Arjun.        
	Besides, the OIA ministry appears to have suddenly woken up to the realisation that certain proposals for the PIO varsities, such as 50 per cent reservation for overseas Indians and a sizeable foreign faculty, would need new legislation anyway.        
	Current laws allow the appointment of foreign teachers only on a case-by-case basis, and usually on part-time assignments. And the seat reservation would mean the SC/ST and OBC quotas would get halved, applying only to the 50 per cent seats earmarked for Indians, and that the overall reservation would climb near 75 per cent.        
	Under the existing legal norms, we will find it difficult to open (even) a deemed university of this nature, K. Mohandas, secretary in the OIA ministry, said.        
	Sources hoped the lengthy process of legislation  drafting a bill in consultation with other ministries such as the law ministry, getting it vetted and cleared by the cabinet, tabling it in Parliament and getting it passed  would be completed in eight months.        
	Land acquisition has begun in Bangalore for the first of the five PIO varsities which, in the best-case scenario, expects to start teaching from the next academic session. It will be set up by the Manipal Academy of Higher Education, which runs Manipal University.        
	Bidding has started for the other four, with the ministry receiving 18 proposals. Among the bidders are Symbiosis of Pune, the Karnataka Lingayat Education Society of Belgaum and the Muslim Education Society, Kerala. The locations of the campuses are yet to be decided.        
	The PIO universities are to offer courses in all streams: including the humanities, engineering, biotechnology, nanotechnology, medicine, literature, pharmacy, nursing, and art and culture. The OIA ministry will have a nominee on each varsitys board of governors.

  Rajnath amp; Ajit in heartland handshake           OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                  
	 New Delhi, March 2: The BJP today announced an alliance with Ajit Singhs Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD), bolstering its election prospects in Uttar Pradesh.                   Rajnath and Ajit      
	Ajit has considerable influence on Jat voters who decide around 15 seats in western Uttar Pradesh.        
	The RLD will contest seven seats, though the seat-sharing formula has not been announced yet.         
	L.K. Advani, the BJPs candidate for Prime Minister, and Rajnath Singh, the BJP president, described the alliance as formidable and said it was a step towards ending the misrule of Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party in Uttar Pradesh.                     
	The BJPs chances of returning to power at the Centre depend in a large measure on the state that sends 80 members to the Lok Sabha. The BJP won only 10 of these seats in 2004, when it lost power in Delhi. The partys performance was worse in the 2007 state polls.         
	Rajnath conceded that the party apparatus was weak in the state, but other leaders hoped the alliance with the RLD would help it reach 20 seats this time.         
	The BJP had polled 22.17 per cent votes in the state in 2004 while the RLD had got 4.49 per cent votes. Together, the two parties could pose a tough challenge to the two big players, the BSP that got 24.67 per cent votes and 19 seats and the Samajwadi Party that polled 26.74 per cent and 35 seats.         
	Although the RLDs entry into the NDA is being touted as a big development, Ajit is famous for switching sides. Political circles were abuzz with speculation about what he might do in case the BJP is not in a position to secure majority.        
	Ajit, who inherited the legacy of anti-Congressism from his father Charan Singh, has not only aligned with the party in the past but also contested on a Congress ticket.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Jayalalithaa prods Sonia on DMK
                                                                                                               Jayalalithaa prods Sonia on DMK
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chennai, April 20: Jayalalithaa today wondered why Sonia Gandhi had not responded to DMK leader M. Karunanidhis sympathetic comments about Tamil Tiger chief V. Prabhakaran.        
	Why is Sonia Gandhi remaining silent? Is she not the Congress president? Is she not the UPA chairperson? Is she not Rajiv Gandhis widow? She should come up with clear, explicit answers.         
	She should tell the nation what she thinks and proposes to do about Karunanidhis statement, Jayalalithaa told a news channel, referring to comments attributed to the Tamil Nadu chief minister that Prabhakaran was a friend and not a terrorist.        
	Karunanidhi today tried to wriggle out by claiming that his comments were distorted and he had termed the LTTE a liberation movement that had transformed into a terrorist organisation.        
	He added that he had not forgotten Rajiv Gandhis assassination. But he did not clarify whether the observation that Prabhakaran was not a terrorist continued to stand.        
	Jayalalithaas swift statement  she rarely gives interviews  is being seen as an attempt to exploit the resentment within the state Congress towards the DMK.         
	In Delhi, Congress leader Kapil Sibal said: There is no question of silence. I have spoken, the PM has spoken. Karunanidhi has gone back on what he said. The Congress president does not have to react on every development.... Does Jayalalithaa react to every issue raised by the DMK?

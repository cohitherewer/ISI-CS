The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Advani, Modi clear PM air
                                                                                                               Advani, Modi clear PM air
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 17: Narendra Modi has made the family proud, but Lal Krishna Advani remains the shadow Prime Minister.        
	The younger leader and the BJP veteran have broken their silence that had been fuelling rumours of a rift within the party after top industry leaders said the Gujarat chief minister should be the Prime Minister.        
	Three days after Anil Ambani and Sunil Mittal proposed his name for the top job, Modi said in Halol, Gujarat, that the BJP would come to power after the Lok Sabha elections and L.K. Advani will be the Prime Minister.        
	Modi, who many BJP leaders felt should have nipped the controversy in the bud, said rival parties were trying to divert attention from the success of the Vibrant Gujarat global investors summit.        
	After the development works we have undertaken in Gujarat, Delhi now recognises that the BJP can come to power at the Centre. Our leader Advani will be the Prime Minister and, under his leadership, even the country will witness rapid growth like Gujarat.        
	Synchronised with Modis support came Advanis praise. It is amusing to find these days some sections of the media hostile to the BJP labouring hard to discern even in the Vibrant Gujarat event evidence of differences in the BJP, he wrote in his blog today.        
	It often happens in a family that a younger member records an achievement which no one else has made earlier. This only makes the whole family proud, he added, recalling his reply to a reporter who, after the Gujarat victory, had asked if Modi had become larger than the party.                    
	What accounts for Narendrabhais success? he went on. The answer is simple: he exemplifies the BJPs commitment to good governance, development and security.

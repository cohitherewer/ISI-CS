The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP leader resigns
                                                                                                               BJP leader resigns
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT       
	Bhubaneswar, March 10: The exodus of BJP legislators continued today even as the saffron party performed a Hanuman Chalisa recital to strengthen the ranks.        
	The BJP state headquarters was turned into a kirtan mandap with state president Suresh Pujari, general secretary (organisation) Panchanan Rout and others joining in the recital. The programme began in the morning and ended late in the afternoon.        
	Speaking to The Telegraph, Pujari said: A war of Mahabharat proportion will start soon. Before the war, we want to seek the lords blessings. And that strength would be needed as Mahesh Sahoo, one of the senior party legislators, deserted the BJP this morning. Confirming his resignation, the three-time MLA from Talcher, said: I have sent in my resignation to the BJP president and the Speaker. He cited neglect of the party leadership towards a senior legislator like him and announced that he would vote for the government in tomorrows trust vote.         
	He was the third BJP legislator to resign from the party within a fortnight following Brundaban Majhi and Dhaneswar Majhi. The duo has also announced their intention to vote for the Naveen Patnaik government.         
	Later, BJP vice-president and former Union minister Juel Oram alleged that the ruling BJD had indulged in horse-trading to win the trust vote. We have issued whips to party legislators to vote against Naveen Patnaik. If any MLA defies the whip, he will invite the anti-defection law and will be disqualified, said the party MP.

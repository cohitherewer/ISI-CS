          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, May 25: The southern and western states, plush with IIT entrance coaching centres, have outscored the north and east in sending students to the premier engineering schools  yet again.        
	This despite attempts by the Centre to reduce the influence of the coaching centres over students preparation for the IIT entrance test.        
	The 2009 IIT Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) results, declared today, show that the success rates have been highest in the region stretching from Rajasthan and Gujarat to Maharashtra and the four southern states.        
	Although IIT preparation is synonymous with coaching centres across the country, it is these states that are considered the most affected by the trend of intensive training courses, especially for the JEE.        
	India is divided into seven zones for the purpose of the JEE examination, with an IIT in the capital of each zone.        
	The JEE 2009 results show that the zone around IIT Bombay performed best, with one in every 25 students qualifying.        
	Of the 80,501 students who appeared from this zone, 3,379 qualified, making up over 33 per cent of the 10,035 successful candidates in all.        
	The Bombay zone includes the IIT coaching Mecca of Kota, where thousands of students go in their final year of schooling for specialised training for the JEE, often neglecting their school studies.         
	The southern states, represented by the Madras zone, performed best after the Bombay zone, with one in every 27 students qualifying. From the Delhi zone, one in every 40 students qualified, while the success rate was one in 54 in the Roorkee zone, one in 56 in the Kharagpur zone, one in 80 in the Kanpur zone and one in 125 in the Guwahati zone.        
	Over the past few years, the IITs and the ministry of human resource development have tried to limit the influence of coaching classes.        
	Earlier this decade, two committees set up by the Centre recommended measures to discourage students from neglecting school for IIT coaching classes.        
	The minimum score required in the qualifying exam  the Class XII board exam  was raised to ensure students would not neglect school. The IIT entrance syllabus was brought in line with the curriculum followed by major national school boards.        
	Some 384,977 students appeared in the JEE, competing for 8,295 seats at 15 IITs, the IT-BHU, and the Indian School of Mines, Dhanbad.

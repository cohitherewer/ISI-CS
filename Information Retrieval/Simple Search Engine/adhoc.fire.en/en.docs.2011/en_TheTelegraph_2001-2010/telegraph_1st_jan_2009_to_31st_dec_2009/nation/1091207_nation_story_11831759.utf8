          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 6: A senior Indian negotiator today said he had concerns that Delhi had been offering unilateral concessions in climate change negotiations without obtaining reciprocity, but added that he would join the Copenhagen talks after receiving assurances from environment minister Jairam Ramesh.         
	My concern is that we have been offering unilateral concessions without obtaining any reciprocity, said Chandrasekhar Dasgupta, a former ambassador.         
	He said Rameshs recent statements seemed to water down the Prime Ministers per capita approach, the position on technology transfer and our rejection of international verification of review of our domestically funded actions.        
	On the basis of certain assurances offered by him (Ramesh), I now plan to fly to Copenhagen in the next few days to assist our delegation.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          BJP members hold a demonstration outside the Assembly in Bhubaneswar on Wednesday to protest against the Orissa governments alleged neglect of farmers. (Sanjib Mukherjee)                                  
	Bhubaneswar, Nov. 18: Speaker Pradip Kumar Amat today rejected the Opposition motion in the Assembly for condoling the death of farmers because of crop loss and debt burden.        
	Opposition chief whip Prasad Harichandan had moved an amendment motion to condole the farmers death, apparently to embarrass the government and the ruling BJD.        
	However, Amat said the amendment motion was not admissible as there was no precedent of condoling the death of persons other than sitting/former MLAs, sitting/former governors and sitting/former Presidents, Vice-Presidents or Prime Ministers, besides the security personnel, laid down lives for the country.        
	Amat, however, allowed the official condolence motion moved by chief minister Naveen Patnaik, expressing grief over the death of former Governor Harcharan Singh Brar, six former MLAs, nine jawans of army, CRPF and police and a jail warder.        
	Later, Leader of Opposition Bhupinder Singh suggested the government to move a condolence motion for the death of farmers, who had committed suicide following crop failure. More than 22 farmers committed suicide during the past couple of months, alleged Singh, while making his point. Amat rejected the suggestion, stating that there was no such precedent.        
	However, BJP legislature party leader K.V. Singhdeo, while making obituary reference to leaders and martyrs, condoled the death of farmers, too. Finance minister Prafulla Chandra Ghadei was scheduled to present the supplementary budget in the House this afternoon.         
	However, after the condolence, Speaker adjourned the proceedings for the day, paying tribute to Brar. But Harichandan argued that the House had never been adjourned honouring any former governor.

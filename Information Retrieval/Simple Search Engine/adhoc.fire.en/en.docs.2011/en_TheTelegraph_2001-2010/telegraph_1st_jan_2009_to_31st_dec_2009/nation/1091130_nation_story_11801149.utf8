                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      5-star hotel on cards
          SUBRAT DAS                              
	Bhubaneswar, Nov. 29: Troubled times due to a global slowdown notwithstanding, Noida-based real estate company Assotech in joint venture with Milan Group has ambitious plans to set up a five-star hotel in Orissa under the Radisson Hotel brand.        
	This will be the first international five star hotel in Orissa, a senior official of Assotech Milan Group told The Telegraph.        
	Till date, Orissa, a favoured tourist destination, did not have a super luxury hotel other than the Trident Hilton.        
	Radisson Hotels amp; Resorts is a worldwide chain of 435 hotels in 61 countries.        
	We have taken the franchise from Radisson Hotel, which has agreed to offer its brand name, while our company will make the entire investment for development and management of the hotel, said the official.        
	Explaining why Assotech Milan Group had decided to start such an ambitious and expensive project at a time of a global economic slowdown, group director Anoop Dhir Samant held out hope.        
	Now India and the rest of the world have already come out of the worst. Most sectors are already on the development path again after a lull or period of stunted growth. Apart from tourism, Orissa has attracted a lot of corporate and industrial houses.         
	The Assotech Milan group director, however, refused to divulge the investment figure and tie-up details.         
	Meanwhile, the Assotech Milan group has acquired 3 acres close to Biju Patnaik airport at Bhubaneswar and obtained all clearances from authorities concerned, including IIT Kharagpur, which is drawing up a comprehensive development plan for Greater Bhubaneswar.        
	The company has already taken up fencing around the plot and the foundation stone is likely to be laid in December, company sources said.        
	The proposed hotel will be of 5-star deluxe category with 200 rooms and is expected to be commissioned within 25 months, sources added.

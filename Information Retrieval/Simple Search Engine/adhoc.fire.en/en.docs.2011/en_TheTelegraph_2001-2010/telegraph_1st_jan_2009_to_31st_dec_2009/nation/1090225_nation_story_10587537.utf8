The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sonia sets deadline 
                                                                                                               Sonia sets deadline 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          UPA ally Lalu Prasad at a book release in New Delhi on Tuesday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 24: Sonia Gandhi has asked her team to get cracking with the poll spadework and complete it by mid-March.        
	With the general election likely to be notified by this weekend, Sonia has instructed general secretaries and chairpersons of candidate-screening panels to get over with the preliminary work by the following Thursday so that the central election committee could wrap up matters by March 15.        
	In a meeting today, Sonia told her team, including senior ministers Pranab Mukherjee, Sushil Shinde, A.K. Antony and Vayalar Ravi, that they must complete negotiations with allies, present and prospective, as soon as possible.        
	Shinde, who is a member of the Maharashtra sub-committee tasked to deal with the NCP, hosted a dinner for the states MPs tonight.        
	From March 6, the party election committee is expected to meet daily to finalise candidates. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is likely to attend the meetings, but in short spells.        
	Sources said Sonia had decided that candidates names would be announced close to the nomination dates, possibly to rule out chances of lobbying, rebellion and counter-rebellion.        
	Asked if the pacts with the Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh and Trinamul in Bengal would be sewn up in the next one week or so, the sources said there was some distance to be travelled. The sources acknowledged they could make no sense of the Uttar Pradesh charade, where the two players were blowing hot and cold by turns.         
	General secretary Satyavrat Chaturvedi, who has attacked Amar Singh in the past, today said: The Samajwadi is offering us only 20 seats or less. Do we shut our party offices and ask our workers to stay at home in the remaining 60 seats? How can the Congress have anything to do with Kalyan Singh, directly or indirectly? Are we to destroy our legacy of being the only party that has never had any truck with communal forces?        
	Sources said if Sonia disapproved of his objections to the Samajwadis, Chaturvedi would not go public with them any further.        
	The Congress has not given up on the Janata Dal (Secular) in Karnataka. Although H.D. Deve Gowda has said he is part of the CPM-led third alternative, sources said Ghulam Nabi Azad, just made general secretary in charge of Karnataka, had been told to seriously pursue talks with the Dal (S).

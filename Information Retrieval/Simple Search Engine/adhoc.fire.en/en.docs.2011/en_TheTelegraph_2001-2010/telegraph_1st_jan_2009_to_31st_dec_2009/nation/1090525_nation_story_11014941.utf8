The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rain, storm to continue today
                                                                                                               Rain, storm to continue today
                            
	Bhubaneswar, May 24 (PTI): Bringing respite from the scorching heat, rains lashed many parts of coastal and interior Orissa today, as the depression over the Bay of Bengal intensified into a deep depression.        
	The deep depression, which lay about 350km south-east of Paradip, is likely to intensify further into a cyclonic storm and move in a near northerly direction and cross Bengal and Bangladesh coast around tomorrow evening, the Met office here said.        
	Under its impact, several places, including Bhubaneswar and areas in Khurda, Cuttack, Puri, Jagatsinghpur and Bhadrak districts experienced rains and thundershower, which brought down the temperature considerably.        
	The weather office also warned that heavy to very heavy shower would lash a few places and extremely heavy falls over coastal Orissa during next 48 hours.         
	Under the influence of the system, squally wind speed reaching 55 to 65kmph is likely to blow along and off Orissa coast, while sea condition would be rough to very rough along and off Orissa coast, it said.        
	Fishermen were advised not to venture into sea along and off Orissa coast.        
	Several parts of the state, including Bhubaneswar and Cuttack, reeled from power cuts for hours throughout the day, as cyclonic storm hit the coast, disrupting uninterrupted supply to districts.         
	However, the downpour was not so heavy to cause waterlogging even in low-lying areas.         
	But incessant drizzling prompted citizens not to venture out of their homes.

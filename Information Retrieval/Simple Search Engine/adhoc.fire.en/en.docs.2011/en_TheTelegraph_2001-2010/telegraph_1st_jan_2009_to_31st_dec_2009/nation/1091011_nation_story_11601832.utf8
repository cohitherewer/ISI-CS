The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | SC nod to life term minus parole
                                                                                                               SC nod to life term minus parole

	New Delhi, Oct. 10: The Supreme Court has upheld judges right to award a life term without the possibility of parole.        
	A life sentence subject to parole  which state governments have the power to grant on humanitarian grounds or for good behaviour  effectively works out to 14 years.        
	A debate had broken out a few years ago on whether a life term meant 14 years, with the apex court clarifying that life meant life. Yesterday, it effectively buttressed that view by ruling that if courts felt a crime did not deserve the death sentence but was bad enough not to merit parole, they could award a life term while pre-empting parole.        
	The ruling came as the court commuted the death sentence awarded to a paedophile to a life term without the possibility of him ever being released as his continuance as a member of an ordered society was uncalled for.        
	This court may feel, as in the present appeal, that the case just falls short of the rarest of the rare category and may feel somewhat reluctant in endorsing the death sentence. At the same time, having regard to the nature of the crime, the court may strongly feel that a sentence of life imprisonment subject to remission  14 years  would be grossly disproportionate and inadequate, a two-judge bench said.        
	The 24-year-old paedophile from Kerala, Sebastian alias Chevithiyan, had raped and murdered a two-year-old girl in 2005, picking her up from near her mother. He had earlier been convicted of outraging a womans modesty in 1998.        
	A life term without the possibility of parole goes against international norms that state such a punishment is inhuman and should not normally be awarded.        
	Sebastian, however, had also been convicted of kidnapping, raping and killing another young child, and his appeal against his life term in that case is pending. He had earlier been tried for the murders of several other children but was acquitted on July 28, 2005, with the benefit of the doubt. Within the next three days, he committed his next crime.        
	The apex court had earlier awarded Swami Shraddhananda, convicted of murdering his wife Shakareh, a life term without parole. In that case, the court had ruled that if a death sentence was commuted to life, it meant a jail term for the rest of the convicts physical life unless the commutation order stated otherwise.        
	In another recent case, the court awarded a 35-year jail term to Haru Ghosh, convicted of twin murders, without possibility of parole.        
	State governments are empowered to release prisoners on parole after a minimum of 14 to 20 years, as specified by the states laws.

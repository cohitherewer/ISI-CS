                                                                                                               Left allies in Kerala tussle
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 9: The CPM has decided to play tough with ally CPI over Ponnani, though differences over the Kerala Lok Sabha seat are holding up the announcement of the Left Democratic Fronts list of candidates in the state.         
	The CPM central committee, which concluded its meeting here yesterday, has endorsed the state units stand that a Left-backed Independent would contest from Ponnani, not an Independent decided by the CPI.        
	The party believes that the candidate it announced for Ponnani, Husein Randathani, can draw Muslim votes. The Indian Union Muslim League, the biggest Muslim party in the state, is with the Congress-led United Democratic Front.         
	Although the central committee asked the state unit to sort out the issue with the CPI amicably, the CPM has told Hussein to start campaigning in right earnest.        
	CPI sources said their party has been contesting Ponnani since 1984 and that they had agreed to field an Independent on the understanding that they would decide who it will be. CPM leaders in turn pointed out that the CPI had lost in the seat in every election since 1984.         
	The CPM has also run into trouble with other Kerala allies over seat adjustments.        
	Discussions over Kozhikode with the Janata Dal (Secular) ended in a stalemate in Kerala today.

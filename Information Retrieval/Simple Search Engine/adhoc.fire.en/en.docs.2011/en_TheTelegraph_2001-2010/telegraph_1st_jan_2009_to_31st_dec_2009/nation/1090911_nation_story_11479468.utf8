The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | VIP austerity? Fat chance
                                                                                                               VIP austerity? Fat chance
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Pawar: Tough squeezing in?                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 10: Austerity is fine, if you have the stomach for it.        
	How can a fat person survive the ordeal of being squeezed into the middle seat of a planes economy class, Sharad Pawar asked today as the cabinet discussed cost-cutting on VIP travel. Farooq Abdullah had another worry: what if you were tall and needed more leg space?        
	Its anyones guess if the concerns stemmed from their self-perceptions. But most ministers got animated over the finance ministrys five per cent slash on non-planned spending, which covers domestic and foreign travel, sources said.        
	Pawar suggested flying economy was infra dig for ministers. He described how, when he flew out of the country in Y class several years ago when he was defence minister, his hosts had a hard time spotting him at the planes tail end.         
	The cabinets high-fliers, who spend at least half their week abroad, wondered if the austerity measures unveiled on Monday by Pranab Mukherjee --- who is neither fat nor tall ---- was practical.        
	 Little things dont add up to much, said one, cribbing about the dated daily allowance of $75 during foreign travel. Why cant the government restore the $100 allowance that was slashed during the Kargil war, he asked.        
	Others said the measly allowance forced them to constantly look for local hospitality for meals.        
	Pawar wasnt done: when ministers had to host meetings for foreign delegates in plush hotels in India, did the finance minister expect them not to serve lunch to curtail costs, he asked.        
	Mukherjee said a bit of indulgence was permissible when the economy was growing at nine per cent  not now.

	Ahmedabad, Feb. 18 (PTI): The global slowdown has affected the lateral and pre-placement offers coming to IIM Ahmedabad, institute director Samir Barua said today.        
	The offers for lateral placements have, of course, come down this year but the impact here is far less as compared to the tier II and III business schools, Barua said.         
	He said pre-placement offers from the financial sector had declined this year.

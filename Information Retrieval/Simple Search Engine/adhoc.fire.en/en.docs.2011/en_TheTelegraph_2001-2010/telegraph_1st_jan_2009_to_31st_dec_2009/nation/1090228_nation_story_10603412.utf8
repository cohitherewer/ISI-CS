The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Lalji gets Atal seat 
                                                                                                               Lalji gets Atal seat 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Feb. 27: The BJP today announced Lalji Tandon as its Lok Sabha candidate from Lucknow, the choice signalling the partys reluctance to fight for Atal Bihari Vajpayees legacy.        
	Tandon is seen as a weak candidate as compared to his likely rivals for the seat held by the former Prime Minister, who is recovering from pneumonia in hospital.        
	 The Bahujan Samaj Party is expected to field Akhilesh Das, a Congress renegade who has been nursing the constituency with his financial muscle. The Samajwadi Party sprung a surprise by bringing actor Sanjay Dutt into the fray.         
	The decision to field Tandon was taken yesterday at the BJPs central election committee meeting. The announcement was made today after party president Rajnath Singh called on Vajpayee to seek his approval.         
	Tandon, who was Vajpayees election manager, used to nurse the constituency on his behalf but got embroiled in a stampede controversy in 2004, just before the general election. In April that year, 25 women and a child were killed in a stampede in a Lucknow park where Tandon was distributing saris to celebrate his birthday. The Election Commission ruled that Tandon had violated the model code, forcing him to resign from Vajpayees poll team.        
	Initially, many BJP veterans had dreamt of laying claim to Vajpayees legacy but developed cold feet as Lucknow has a large Muslim presence. Vajpayees charisma cut through caste and communal lines but no other BJP leader can boast of such political reach among the masses.         
	The BJP has almost chickened out of a big battle by putting Tandon, Lucknows best known chicken trader  he has a thriving poultry business  in the ring.        
	The BJPs candidate selection has been tardy. The party had planned to complete the process, started almost a year ago, by February-end. Yesterdays meeting cleared just 19 names  seven for Jharkhand and 12 for Uttar Pradesh.

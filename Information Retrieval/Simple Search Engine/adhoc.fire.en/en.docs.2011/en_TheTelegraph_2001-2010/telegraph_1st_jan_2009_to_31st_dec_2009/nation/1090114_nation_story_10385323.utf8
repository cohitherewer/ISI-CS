          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 13: The phased pullout of central paramilitary forces from the state will start from January 15.         
	In the first phase, 10 companies of CRPF and two companies of Rapid Action Force (RAF) will be withdrawn, said home secretary Aditya Padhi today.        
	However, the details of the withdrawal would be worked out in consultation with the officials of the Union home ministry, he said. At least 53 companies of central paramilitary forces  49 companies of CRPF and four companies of RAF  have been deployed in the state since August-September when communal violence broke out in Kandhamal and other parts of the state.        
	More than 40 companies of central paramilitary forces have been deployed in Kandhamal alone. The Centre had deployed paramilitary forces till December-end on the direction of the Supreme Court. The deployment was extended till middle of January following request from the state government to retain the forces till January-end to facilitate restoration of normalcy. The Union home ministry, however, did not agree to extend the deployment further and insisted on withdrawal of forces by mid-January.        
	At the chief ministers conference on internal security held in New Delhi on January 6, chief minister Naveen Patnaik proposed that the withdrawal of central paramilitary forces should be in phases over the next three months.        
	He stressed the need for continuance of central forces in Kandhamal even after March and said a minimum contingent of about 20 companies of CRPF should be retained in the troubled district to help maintain law and order during the forthcoming general elections.        
	Christian leaders have been requesting the Union as well as the state governments to deploy paramilitary forces till end of general elections as they apprehend fresh violence during and prior to polls.         
	Meanwhile, the state government is in the process of recruiting about 3,000 police personnel who would be deployed in Kandhamal by March.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, April 15: Despite tall claims, the fact remains that there are few women candidates in the fray for Lok Sabha and Assembly poll.         
	Out of total 157 candidates, nine are women (6 per cent of contestants), while in the Assembly women are just 10 per cent of the total 1,397 contestants.         
	Congress and BJD, claiming to be pioneers in women empowerment, have not fielded any woman candidate for Lok Sabha polls. BSP, CPM and Samrudhha Odisha have nominated a candidate each. Similarly, the BJD, taking credit for launching Mission Shakti, has nominated only eight women for 130 Assembly seats that it is contesting. The Sonia Gandhi-led Congress has fielded 15 among the total 147 party candidates.         
	BJP, has chosen 14 women to contest the elections to the 147-member Assembly.        
	Interestingly, CPI and NCP have not chosen any for the Lok Sabha and Assembly polls.         
	Of the total 140 women candidates contesting in the Assembly elections, 37 are Independents. Newly-floated regional outfit, Samruddha Odisha has fielded the highest number of women candidates (26). Samajvadi Party and BSP have nominated 12 and 11, respectively.         
	Women participate more in the election process, right from attending election meetings to casting votes. But, they are given a raw deal at the time of selection, said Tapasi Praharaj, an activist.         
	Orissa has so far elected seven women to the Lok Sabha and nine to the Rajya Sabha since its first general election.         
	Similarly, state Assembly has had 53 women legislators during the period between 1952 and 2004. The former BJD-BJP coalition government had two ministers  Pramila Mallick (BJD) and Surama Padhy (BJP)  who were women.

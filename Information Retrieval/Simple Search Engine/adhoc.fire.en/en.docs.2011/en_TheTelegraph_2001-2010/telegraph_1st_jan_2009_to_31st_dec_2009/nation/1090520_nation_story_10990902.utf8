The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Karat camp defends break with Cong 
                                                                                                               Karat camp defends break with Cong 
          BISWAJIT ROY                              
	Calcutta, May 19: The CPM politburo today appeared to strike a balance on the reasons for the Lefts poll debacle, saying both national and state-specific factors are responsible for the poor performance.        
	The Prakash Karat camp, however, refused to accept the line of some defeated Bengal MPs that the withdrawal of support to the UPA over the nuclear deal was to blame and a review of that decision as well as the gamut of tactical moves that ensued was called for.        
	Tarit Topdar, Amitava Nandi, Rupchand Pal, Rabin Deb and others have been insistent that the pullout, the voting in Parliament along with the BJP, and Karats stubborn anti-Congress position had done the Left in.        
	Politburo member M.K. Pandhe today spoke up strongly in favour of the central leadership. Both the withdrawal of support and voting against the trust motion were unanimously decided in the politburo and the central committee. Nobody opposed it in either forum, he told The Telegraph.        
	The withdrawal is still correct and has no direct bearing on the poll outcome.        
	Taking a swipe at the defeated MPs, he continued: Those who are blaming the central line should speak in party forums instead of making public statements. Let the state committees examine what factors played what role in the polls against us.        
	In line with the politburo statement issued today, the CPM central committee is scheduled to meet from June 19 to 21 to discuss corrective steps. State committees will examine the debacle before that.        
	The CPMs Bengal secretariat met this evening to discuss the politburo recommendation and prepare for the state committee meeting on May 24.        
	Bengal CPM secretary Biman Bose called on party patriarch Jyoti Basu at his Salt Lake home after his return from New Delhi today. Yesterday, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had dropped in at Basus to express his anguish and despondency over the results and Karats misplaced zeal for a third front.        
	Bose had yesterday told the politburo that one reason for the Left whitewash could be that it had been unable to project the third front as a viable and credible alternative to the Congress. Many other MPs have been plugging the same line.        
	Feedback effort        
	The CPM state secretariat has framed guidelines for in-depth feedback from the districts on the political, organisational as well as administrative factors that played a role in the poll debacle, sources said.         
	The feedback is expected to include reports on the impact of both central and state-level factors as well as the erosion in the votes of minorities and Scheduled Castes.         
	The pattern of urban and rural voting will also be looked into.         
	We will discuss the poll outcome at the Left Front meeting on May 21 and at our state committee meeting on May 24, Bose said.

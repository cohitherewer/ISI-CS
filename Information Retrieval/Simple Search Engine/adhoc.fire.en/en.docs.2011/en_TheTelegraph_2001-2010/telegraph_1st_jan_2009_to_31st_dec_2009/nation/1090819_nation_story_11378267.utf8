	New Delhi, Aug. 18: The government will conduct a fresh survey to identify critically polluted industrial hubs across India in the next two months, environment and forests minister Jairam Ramesh said today.         
	The survey will use scientific criteria to identify the clusters and will be aimed at developing action plans for each of them, Ramesh said, outlining decisions taken at the end of a national conference of environment ministers.         
	Some industrial clusters have really dangerous levels of environmental pollution, Ramesh said. The conference attended by state environment ministers also agreed to a survey of 17 categories of highly polluting industries to track compliance.         
	States have agreed to develop a time-bound action plan to deal with polluting industrial clusters. The plan would be jointly implemented by the central and state pollution control boards.         
	Ramesh said states had agreed to concentrate on the modernisation of forest administration. He said forest activities would receive an unprecedented increase in funding from Rs 3,600 crore in 2008-09 to Rs 8,300 crore this year.

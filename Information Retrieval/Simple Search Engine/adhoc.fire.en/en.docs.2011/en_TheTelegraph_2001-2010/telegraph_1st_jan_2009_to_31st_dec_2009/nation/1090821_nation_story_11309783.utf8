          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 20: The Central Institute of Freshwater Aquaculture (CIFA), a leading institute for fish research, bagged two competitive projects worth Rs 3.58 and Rs 5.03 crore.        
	The institute, on the outskirts of the city, would operate the projects as a lead centre in partnership with other research institutions for the next three years.        
	The first project would aim at developing an alternative method of fish disease management. It would create toll-like receptor (TLR) database of carps, catfishes and sharks for further researches in inducing immunity. This project is also intended to nurture scientific leadership and pushing scientific frontiers.        
	The other project is developmental in nature, and aims at comprehensive development of livelihood of 3,000 farm families in 60 villages through fisheries, horticulture and livestock rearing.        
	This work would be carried out in Mayurbhanj, Keonjhar and Sambalpur districts. Skill development of farmers in diversified farming practices; socio-economic development in the adopted clusters and ensuring household food and nutrition security are the major objectives, said A.E. Eknath, CIFA director.        
	This project would package science and technology for peoples welfare and in the long run would ensure social inclusion. The Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), under its ambitious programme National Agricultural Innovation Project (NAIP), is providing substantial financial support for developing cutting-edge agricultural technologies. Agriculture and allied sectors, including animal husbandry and fisheries, are in need of innovative technological solutions that would render farming a more profitable vocation, besides ensuring food and nutrition security, said Mruthyunjaya, NAIP national director. He was addressing scientists at a launch ceremony held here today.        
	The launch workshop was attended by over 70 scientists and researchers.

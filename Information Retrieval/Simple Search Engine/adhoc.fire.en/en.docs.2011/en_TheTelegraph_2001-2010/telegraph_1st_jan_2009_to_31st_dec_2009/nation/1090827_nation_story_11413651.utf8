The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Congress finger in Pawar sugar jar
                                                                                                               Congress finger in Pawar sugar jar
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Sharad Pawar                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 26: The Congress is set to steal Sharad Pawars thunder by demanding a hike in the minimum statutory price (MSP) paid to sugarcane farmers, his traditional supporters, before the Maharashtra polls slated for October.        
	The idea is to highlight Pawars lack of commitment to cane growers, who are the backbone of the economy of western Maharashtra, from where the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) boss hails.        
	Official sources said the government was set to raise the price. The cabinet may clear the proposal tomorrow.        
	The Congresss Satyavrat Chaturvedi pitched for the hike today in a swipe at Pawar, also the Union agriculture minister, at a meeting of the National Alliance for Farmers Association, an umbrella body of farmer unions. All political parties had been invited but only three leaders, including Chaturvedi, turned up. No one from the NCP attended.         
	Chaturvedi, a member of the Congress Working Committee (CWC), said: When a drought is staring us in the face, our agriculture minister denied its existence. When the farmers despaired over the meagre rainfall, the minister said there was no such thing. Now he has admitted that acreage has declined because of a bad monsoon. I demand that the MSP paid to cane farmers should go up. If the minister has raised the price for paddy and wheat, why has he left out cane farmers?        
	Chaturvedi pointed out that Pawar had for months been insisting that sugar stocks were comfortable, with even a surplus for export.         
	I believed him. But suddenly why is he talking of sugar shortage? Why is he saying we might have to import? If you have surplus stocks, please release them in the market, said Chaturvedi.        
	Pawars ministry, Chaturvedi said, had sparingly purveyed information on the drought and generally kept people in the dark, forcing the Congress to call a special CWC meeting to get the true picture.        
	NCP spokesperson D.P. Tripathi objected to Chaturvedis comments on Pawar and asked the Congress to take disciplinary action.        
	The Congress didnt come out with an official reaction but a source said Chaturvedi could have avoided criticising Pawar since the party was in alliance with the NCP in Maharashtra. We have to think of the polls. This kind of individual chauvinism can hurt the negotiations (for seat sharing), a source said.        
	Chaturvedis dig at Pawar came days after Congress general secretary Digvijay Singh, a member of the partys cell for the Maharashtra polls, raised the pitch for the seat-sharing talks this week by urging Pawar to merge the NCP with the Congress.        
	Like Digvijay, Chaturvedi is an advocate of the go solo line and believes the fewer the allies, the better for the Congress. Digvijay and Chaturvedi had scuppered the prospects of a Congress-Samajwadi Party alliance in Uttar Pradesh before the Lok Sabha polls.

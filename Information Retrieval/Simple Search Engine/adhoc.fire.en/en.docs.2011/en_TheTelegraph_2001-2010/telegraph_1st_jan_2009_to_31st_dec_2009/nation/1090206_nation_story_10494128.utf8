                                                                                                               Fiza sets 48-hour deadline 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Chandigarh, Feb. 5: Fiza, the second wife of former Haryana deputy chief minister Chand Mohammad, today served him a 48-hour ultimatum to return or face legal action.        
	He can go to Taj Mahal but cannot come to see his wife in hospital, she said, adding that she could approach Congress chief Sonia Gandhi.        
	Chand, who changed his name from Chander Mohan when he converted to Islam and married Fiza (in picture), is a Congress MLA.        
	I am going through a lot of trauma and want to seek an end to my ordeal, said Fiza, 35, who lost her job as assistant advocate-general when she married Chand.        
	Chand, 43, left her recently and has been quoted as saying he wants to return to his first wife Seema and their children.         
	Referring to his statement on TV two days ago that he was shocked at Fizas reaction to his leaving home, she asked what was keeping him from meeting her. Is it family pressure? she asked.        
	Asked if he had divorced her, Fiza retorted: Chand does not have a habit of divorcing wives. Will he now become Peter and bring some Rosy home?

	New Delhi, Nov. 22 (PTI): Violence broke out on the JNU campus tonight when students and police clashed after four allegedly drunk youths were arrested.        
	The youths had allegedly passed obscene comments at some girls, the police said. The campus security staff found the four drinking liquor inside a car and saw them tease the girls. When the staff asked for their ID cards, one of the four took out a pistol that turned out to be a toy gun.        
	When the police were taking them away, JNU students demanded an apology from the four, sparking the clash.

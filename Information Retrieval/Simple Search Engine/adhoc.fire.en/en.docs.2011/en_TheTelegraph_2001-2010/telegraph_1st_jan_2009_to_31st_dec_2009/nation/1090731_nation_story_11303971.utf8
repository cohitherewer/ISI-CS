The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Gorshkov cheque challenge
                                                                                                               Gorshkov cheque challenge
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 30: Navy chief Admiral Sureesh Mehta today staunchly defended the decision to buy the Admiral Gorshkov aircraft carrier from Russia.         
	Can you get me an aircraft carrier for less than $2 billion? If you can, I will sign a cheque just now, he said.         
	Last week the comptroller and auditor general had said India was buying the Gorshkov at more than the price of a new carrier after its cost doubled since it was contracted in January 2004 to more than $1.82 billion (Rs 7,207 crore).         
	The Indian and the Russian governments are now in the middle of negotiations after Moscow demanded $2.9 billion despite the 2004 contract.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sibal raises bar for tech trophies
                                                                                                               Sibal raises bar for tech trophies
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT       
	New Delhi, Aug. 8: The IITs must transform themselves into creators of knowledge rather than focus on undergraduate teaching, human resource development minister Kapil Sibal said today, issuing a thinly veiled challenge to the apex engineering schools.         
	Addressing the IIT Delhi convocation today, the minister also questioned the absence of passion to generate new knowledge among IIT students once they clear the entrance examination to the institutes.        
	The comments are significant because they follow similar criticism of the IITs by a higher education review panel headed by former University Grants Commission chairman Yash Pal. This panel has recommended that the IITs expand into full-fledged universities.         
	Students come here after clearing one of the toughest examinations but then seem to lose their passion for creating new knowledge, Sibal said, addressing graduating students, their parents and faculty at IIT Delhi.        
	The minister called the IITs one of the countrys top technical education institutions but pointed out that the institutes faced fresh challenges as expectations from you have grown.        
	Very often, I am asked by people: Oh, whats so great about the IITs? Have they produced any Nobel laureates? the minister said.        
	In defence of the IITs, Sibal said they were producing more research than many other Indian higher educational institutions.        
	But the best research universities in the world have been able to break out of a chain of undergraduate teaching and become creators of knowledge, in turn attracting the best brains to join them, the minister said. And we need that from the IITs if we are to catch up with the West in terms of research, he added.         
	Yash Pal has criticised the IITs for becoming little more than undergraduate factories with little focus on research.

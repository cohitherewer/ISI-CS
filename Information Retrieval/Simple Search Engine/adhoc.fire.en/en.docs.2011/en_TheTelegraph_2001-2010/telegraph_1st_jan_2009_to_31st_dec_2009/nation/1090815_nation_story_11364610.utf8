The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Azad show raises questions on former CMs
                                                                                                               Azad show raises questions on former CMs
										      RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                      Azad            Krishna            Antony            Singh                                 
	New Delhi, Aug. 14: Ghulam Nabi Azad is an enigma to the Congress.        
	When he was asked to be Jammu and Kashmir chief minister in October 2005, he accepted the job unwillingly because Delhi, and more precisely 24 Akbar Road that houses the Congress headquarters, was the hub of power politics and action, of which Azad was an integral player.         
	Once in Srinagar, he sunk into the role and would have carried on eventlessly  the tulip garden he created in Jammu and Kashmirs capital is billed as the highpoint of his innings  but for his flip-flop over the transfer of state land to the Amarnath Shrine Board that nearly polarised people along Hindu-Muslim lines across the state.         
	Congress sources wondered how the wily Azad, gifted with the ability to transform losing states into winners, very nearly lost his turf in Jammu and Kashmir.         
	Today, as the health and family welfare minister grapples with the second big crisis of his career, the swine flu pandemic, the question being asked by Congress leaders is do ex-chief ministers necessarily shine in the Union cabinet?         
	Seven of the nine former chief ministers in Manmohan Singhs council of ministers are from the Congress. Apart from Azad, they include A.K. Antony, Sushil Kumar Shinde, S.M. Krishna, M. Veerappa Moily, Virbhadra Singh and Vilasrao Deshmukh.        
	Krishna and Moily tripped in the budget session of Parliament. As the foreign minister, Krishna tied himself in knots while trying to explain why Balochistan was included in the joint India-Pakistan statement, hours after finance minister Pranab Mukherjee had managed to quell the Oppositions charges on the issue.         
	Moily, the law and justice minister, had failed to suss out the hostile mood within the Congress and in the Opposition before introducing the Judges (Declaration of Assets and Liabilities) Bill, 2009, in Parliament. He was forced to defer the introduction after his own MPs partially opposed it.         
	Union steel minister Virbhadra Singh is embroiled in a graft charge.         
	Union minister of heavy industries Deshmukh is focused almost solely on Maharashtra, hoping to have a third shot at becoming chief minister in case the Congress-NCP alliance is voted back to power.         
	Once the Parliament session was over, it was Azads turn to face the flak. Blame the party, a Congressman remarked acerbically. In the last week of June, when the swine flu started spreading, Azad was immersed in party work. He continues to be a general secretary minding Tamil Nadu, Orissa and Karnataka.         
	He was criss-crossing the country as his ministry issued perfunctory bulletins on the state of the pandemic. In between, he went to Jammu and Kashmir. The minister has reportedly told his confidants he feels nostalgic about the Valley and would give his right hand to return to Srinagar.        
	When he was made health minister, the Congresss feedback was Azad had wanted a less demanding post that would give him time to keep an eye on Omar Abdullah in Jammu and Kashmir and his organisational work.         
	The pressure is telling on Azad. In the last two cabinet meetings, he was taken to task for not leading from the front when the media launched a wall-to-wall coverage of the pandemic.

          G.S. MUDUR                              
	New Delhi, July 8: A project taken up by the Uttar Pradesh government to erase a green belt and erect statues of chief minister Mayavati and two Dalit leaders in Noida has come under the environment ministry scanner.         
	Environment and forests minister Jairam Ramesh has asked a team of experts to find out what impact, if any, the project might have on the Okhla bird sanctuary, a stretch of marshland along the Yamuna river sandwiched between Delhi and Noida.         
	Ive sent an inquiry team for an inspection of the area to determine whether any rules have been violated, Ramesh said. I am hoping to receive a report from the team in two days.         
	The Uttar Pradesh government is constructing a concrete complex along a 2-3km stretch of green belt close to the Yamuna bank and the Okhla sanctuary which, bird watchers say, attracts up to 30 per cent of Indias 1,200 bird species.         
	Statues of Mayavati, Kanshi Ram and B.R. Ambedkar will be erected within the complex, the government said in reply to a right to information application filed by Supreme Court advocate Ravikanth.         
	The project cost is estimated to be Rs 187 crore, the state said.         
	They have destroyed four parks and pulled down trees. some of the trees were memorial trees planted by local residents, said Ravikanth, who has filed a public interest petition in the Supreme Court challenging the project.         
	Ramesh said the project activities appeared to be below the threshold level that would require environmental impact assessment, but this would become clear once the expert team hands in its report.         
	Its proximity to the Okhla bird sanctuary has been causing concern to some people, Ramesh said. The expert team has been asked to assess whether the project could have any adverse impact on the sanctuary.        
	An online petition signed by bird enthusiasts to protect the sanctuary has said that construction had destroyed a large extent of green and wooded area that was home to resident and migratory birds.

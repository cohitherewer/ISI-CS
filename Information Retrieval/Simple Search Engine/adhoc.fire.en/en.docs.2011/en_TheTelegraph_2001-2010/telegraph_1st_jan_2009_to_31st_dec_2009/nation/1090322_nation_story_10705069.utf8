          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Bhubaneswar, March 21: BJD MP from Kendrapara and former firebrand student leader Archana Nayak today quit the party and joined BJP.        
	Announcing her decision, Nayak (in Sanjib Mukherjee picture) said: I quit the party in protest against the break-up of the BJD-BJP alliance.         
	Stating that both the Congress and BJD were against the states interests, she said BJP was the only alternative. Nayak said she was joining BJP to continue her fight against the Congress and for the cause of the people of the state.        
	Criticising the role of bureaucrat-turned-politician Pyarimohan Mohapatra in destabilising the party, she said BJD had been converted to Pyari Janata Dal. Internal democracy in BJD has been given the short shrift and frontal organisations have deliberately been made dormant.

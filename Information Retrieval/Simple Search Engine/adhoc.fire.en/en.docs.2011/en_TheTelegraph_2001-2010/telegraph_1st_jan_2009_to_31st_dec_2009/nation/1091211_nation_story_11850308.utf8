          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 10: When it comes to carving out states, optics rules for the BJP.        
	In other words, what the public might perceive.        
	The main Opposition party still bats for carving out smaller states, holding up the relatively smooth creation of Uttarakhand, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh during Atal Bihari Vajpayees tenure as evidence of its intent and commitment.        
	In practice, though, expediency has been the deciding factor.        
	Rajya Sabha MP M. Venkaiah Naidu, who criticised home minister P. Chidambaram for making a statement on Telangana outside Parliament last night without taking the House into confidence, was chided for his thoughtless remark by his colleagues.        
	Especially after Chidambaram had explained he couldnt defer announcing the decision as the government could brook no delay given the situation in Andhra Pradesh.        
	In the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, when the BJP did a deal with the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha to get Jaswant Singh elected from Darjeeling, it promptly chanted the Gorkhaland mantra.        
	After Singhs expulsion  he still remains a Lok Sabha MP  a senior member insisted there was no need to clamber onto the bandwagon just like that, for the sake of it.        
	Naidu was today told his comment gave an impression the BJP wanted the Telangana announcement to be put off by a few hours only to score a point over the Con- gress when what was at stake was the life of the fasting statehood spearhead, K. Chandrasekhar Rao, and the law-and-order situation in Andhra.        
	This is not the time to score brownie points or make prestige issues out of trivial points, a colleague of Naidu said.        
	Naidu, who is from Andhra, was asked to brief the media although he was at first reluctant for fear that articulating the BJPs line of unequivocal support for Telangana might jeopardise his political base in Nellore in coastal Andhra.        
	Although late, we welcome the announcement. The basic issue is that the government seems to have not done enough groundwork or homework or taken their own (Congress) MLAs and MPs into confidence, Naidu said.        
	Asked if the BJP still backed the demand for Gorkhaland, he replied: When such demands come to us, we will look into them. In any case, we have not raised it and we are not in government.        
	The BJP hasnt yet called off its alliance with the Telangana Rashtra Samiti, struck before the last Lok Sabha polls.         
	However, indications were it would have to take a broader view of the Telangana issue without ignoring the aspirations and interests of Rayalseema and coastal Andhra.        
	Asked if the BJP would endorse the call for a sepa- rate Kutch and Sauras- htra scooped out of party-ruled Gujarat, Naidu said: You better ask Narendra Modi that.         
	The Gujarat chief minister has apparently rejected the suggestion out of hand.

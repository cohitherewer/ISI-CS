The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Crossed loyalties flood Mithila 
                                                                                                               Crossed loyalties flood Mithila 
          SANKARSHAN THAKUR IN MADHUBANI-DARBHANGA (MITHILA)                                            
	The skies have been cut to ribbons by rival chopper squadrons; the earth lies riven under their recurrent and contrary assault. Lal Krishna Advani swooping about on Nitish Kumars wings, trying to fire his prime ministerial ambitions to life; Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan darting about like gnats to deliver that quest a fatal sting; and in the thick of that combat, the Congress in a desperate effort to get off the ground.         
	This politically critical swathe running east-west between the Ganges and Nepal  cradle of Maithils and Maithili, ancient gateway to Bengal  is such a chaotic clash of armies, its foolhardy trying to tell victor from vanquished.         
	As Kishori Krishna, a retired Madhubani teacher and, like most Biharis, an inveterate dabbler in politics, says: Sab sab par talwar bhaanj raha hai, sab lahu-luhaan hai, kya jaane kaun marega, kaun bachega. (Everybody is sabre-rattling, everybody is bloodied, who knows who will die, wholl survive.)         
	But then, political battles have always been intense here. In its broad east-west sweep, Mithila accounts for nearly half of Bihars 40 Lok Sabha seats and its often said whoever takes Mithila, takes Bihar. But thats paper truism ringing hollow all across the region  too many crossed loyalties have erupted, its not all going into one basket.         
	Mithila has always been a moveable feast  impregnable fortress of the Congress for decades after Independence, vibrant play field of the Mandal revolution, host, if only for a flicker, to hardboiled Hindutva, reliable laboratory of communism. Madhubani was pocketborough to Chaturanan Mishra and Bhogendra Jha, Bihars bygone communist twins. Sitamarhi and Sheohar have become sites of Maoist resurgence.         
	But thats not all; more is getting piled on to Mithilas varied plate, making it a confounding smorgasbord  recently kindled aspiration among the legions of extremely backward castes and Pasmanda (lower caste) Muslims, a stirring of intra-Dalit animosity by a new maha-Dalit class crafted by Nitish Kumar, significant signs of fracture in the sizeable Muslim vote.         
	Says Qamran Ali, a landed farmer from Raiyyam, deep in the Madhubani countryside: For years now, we have blindly voted for Lalu Yadav but the return of the Congress has become a temptation for many  we will still vote for the best bet against the BJP. But that is changing from seat to seat, there are definitely new currents flowing from what I can see.         
	In Madhubani, for instance, it would appear the Congresss sitting MP and Union minister of state for home, Shakeel Ahmed, has the favour of the minorities even though Lalu Prasad has fielded the heavyweight Bihar RJD chief, Abdul Bari Siddiqui. Siddiqui does have pockets of minority influence  and enough material resources  but he may at best be able to play spoiler to Ahmed.         
	In cheek-by-jowl Darbhanga, it is M.A. Fatmi of the RJD who is the Muslims choice. They have a common target but they are taking different routes to it, says Ajit Thakur of Darbhangas Sanskrit University. But this will also inevitably create division in votes everywhere, its confusing, there is division everywhere, traditional votes are getting splintered seat after seat, there is no clear pattern, its a free for all.         
	The minorities are not the only section seeking to break out of their moulds and vote differently this time; the new uncertainties over the certain vote are haunting many.         
	Among them are two Bihar stalwarts and Union ministers  Ram Vilas Paswan (Hajipur  LJP) and Raghuvansh Prasad Singh (Vaishali  RJD). Despite the RJD-LJP alliance, traditional caste votes in both constituencies are threatening to break away.         
	Yadavs in several pockets of Hajipur are in revolt against Paswan for having ditched and betrayed Lalu Prasad in the past and will need personal persuading from their hero to turn around.         
	In Vaishali, Raghuvansh faces an insider problem  the Congresss Hind Kesri Yadav could well erode the RJDs caste vote and leave the rural development minister struggling against his mafioso JD(U) rival, Munna Shukla. Admitted an insider of the Raghuvansh campaign: It is very difficult to judge the ground this time, there is no real sense of which vote is going where, its shifting.                 
	Running north-east of Patna, across the Ganges and its immense alluvial flanks, the landscape quite suddenly recedes in time. On summer afternoons, its a harsh hotplate on which dust swirls and nothing thats living moves. After sundown, north Bihar is a vast darkness infested by mosquitoes and other nocturnal perils (mass roadside defecation, for instance).         
	Save for rashes of retail activity along rutted roads that are slowly getting transformed into highways, feudal  and fragmented  agriculture is all there is as guarantor of subsistence. Nitish-era development has run little blacktop rivulets connecting the interiors but it hasnt done any more yet.         
	In Singhwara village, en route to the Nepal border, a vital bridge washed away in the 1994 floods still awaits completion. Electricity remains an infrequent and fleeting visitor. The fields cough up barely enough to feed those who work them  farmhands and cattleheads. Bar the inroads made by private enterprise  cellphones and aerated drinks  primitive isnt an excessive adjective to apply to these parts; this is still state of nature, it gives and takes away by turn.         
	But hope lives eternal, and theres always an election round the corner to resuscitate it with a fresh breath of promises. This time, they are showering down from all too many vessels scudding the skies. And the objects of their seduction are running all too many different ways.         
	 Larger Mithila region votes on April 23 and 30

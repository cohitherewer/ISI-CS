                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Probe into Headley visa papers
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 16: India has ordered a probe into the alleged disappearance of visa documents of terror suspects David Headley and Tahawwur Rana from its Chicago consulate.        
	The Centre said it wanted to interrogate them and would renew its demand for either full access or custody of the two. Headley and Rana are accused of being part of the conspiracy behind 26/11.        
	Foreign secretary Nirupama Rao said she was aware of reports that the visa papers were allegedly untraceable at Indias Chicago consulate. I have sought a factual report from our consul-general in Chicago, she said.        
	The consulate in Chicago had issued visas to suspected Lashkar terrorists Rana and Headley to travel to India. We would want access to Headley and Rana at some stage. We would also like full access to the investigation, Rao said.              
	This is second instance of India requesting access to the two. A National Investigation Agency team had visited the US in October to interrogate Headley and Rana but had returned empty-handed.        
	The foreign secretary said India was happy with the co-operation from US agencies.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Private hand in China border roads

	New Delhi, June 12: The Centre has decided to step up its strategic border development programme by involving the private sector in building roads and airfields and improving logistics for the military as it beefs up infrastructure on its frontier with China.        
	Three years after New Delhi revised its policy on the development of the frontier with China, the pace of work has picked up so much that the Indian Air Force and the Border Roads Organisation are not able to keep up with the targets. They are seeking to bridge the gap by outsourcing the work to private operators.         
	For decades, the Indian policy on border roads was to leave them undeveloped. This was an overhang from the 1962 war with China. It was premised on the belief that underdeveloped border areas would make an invasion into India difficult.         
	In June 2006, the Cabinet Committee on Security revised that policy and gave a go-ahead for full-scale border development.        
	The development of military infrastructure by both India and China continues despite the growth in commercial and diplomatic ties.        
	Earlier this month, the governor of Arunachal Pradesh and former army chief, General J.J. Singh, said India was raising two army divisions for deployment along the border with China in his state. China disputes Arunachal.         
	Next week, a squadron of the Indian Air Forces powerful Sukhoi 30 Mki aircraft will begin deploying to Tezpur in Assam.         
	On Thursday, the official Chinese Communist Party newspaper Peoples Daily asked the Indian government to consider if it can afford the consequences of a potential confrontation with China.        
	In New Delhi, the resolve to continue with border development is steadfast. The army chief, General Deepak Kapoor, said infrastructure was being improved in Arunachal.        
	Since 2008, the pace of construction projects on the border has picked up so much that twice the amount of engineering equipment (3,800 tonnes) will need to be airlifted this year. The IAFs AN-32 and IL76 aircraft will not be enough for this task. Private air cargo operators will be hired, a meeting of the Border Roads Development Board chaired by minister of state for defence Pallam Raju decided yesterday.        
	The BRO, a military outfit, is the main agency tasked with building and maintaining border roads, advance landing grounds, tunnels and bridges. The IAF airlifts equipment and personnel and operationalises the new or revived airfields. For the military the main reason for improving the infrastructure is to ensure faster deployment and better maintenance of frontier posts.

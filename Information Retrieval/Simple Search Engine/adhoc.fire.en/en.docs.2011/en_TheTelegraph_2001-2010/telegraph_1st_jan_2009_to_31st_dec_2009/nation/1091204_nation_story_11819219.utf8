The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Hasina keeps terror flushout promise 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Hasina keeps terror flushout promise 
          SUJAN DUTTA                      Sheikh Hasina                          
	New Delhi, Dec. 3: Two days after her landslide victory in the election this month last year, Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Wajed declared: I want to make this point very clear, no one will be allowed to use this land to carry out terrorism in India.        
	Before the year is out, Sheikh Hasina has begun to deliver on her promise. Whatever the official claims on the pushback or the surrender, the handing over of Ulfa chairman Arabinda Rajkhowa, easily one of Delhis most wanted fugitives for close to three decades, would not have been possible without Hasina at the helm of the Awami League government.        
	The handing over of Rajkhowa is a major event, says Deb Mukharji, former high commissioner to Bangladesh. It is a very positive move that demonstrates Dhakas intent.        
	When she comes to New Delhi next fortnight (for a three-day visit beginning December 19), Hasina will be wanting to take back more than the Indira Gandhi Prize for Peace, Disarmament and Development. The jury headed by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has decided to give her the prize for 2009.        
	Bangladeshs biggest expectation underlying all the outstanding issues is that India will give without asking for takeaways for everything, said a senior diplomat. That may not be possible on every issue but the visit by their foreign minister, Dipu Moni, in September and by our foreign secretary subsequently has shown that it is possible to move ahead on trade and transit, he adds.        
	The three biggest issues dogging the bilateral relationship for Dhaka  that may yet be softened after the gifting of Rajkhowa continue to be: the sharing of river waters, the trade imbalance and the demarcation of the maritime boundary. Indias expectation will be that Bangladesh will continue to deny sanctuary and hand over more militants, and that it will finally grant permission for the transit of Indian traffic through its territory to and from Indias Northeast.        
	In September, India agreed to give Bangladesh transit through its territory to Bhutan and Nepal. In principle, the two sides have also agreed that India should be able to access its Northeast, to a limited extent (for heavy machinery), through Bangladesh. But the facilities for through-travel are yet to be created.        
	Former high commissioner Mukharji said that along with Rajkhowa, the handing-over of two Lashkar-e-Toiba operatives was also significant. While Ulfa and other insurgent outfits in the Northeast are Indias problem, the threat from Islamic fundamentalists is common to both Bangladesh and India, he said.        
	A thanksgiving for Hasina could mean concessions from India on the issues pending for years. None of these has easy solutions but Bangladesh would want to be kept wholly in the picture, Mukharji said.        
	In October, India and Bangladesh agreed to a joint hydrological survey of the Teesta river. Dhaka wants a commitment from India of a minimum 40 per cent of the rivers water.        
	Bangladesh will also ask for a bilateral agreement on delimiting maritime boundaries. India has, rightfully, made its claims on the Exclusive Economic Zone to the United Nations Convention on Law of Seas. But Bangladesh is saying India can make a small concession, said Sreeradha Datta, fellow specialising in India-Bangladesh relations at the Institute for Defence Studies and Analysis.

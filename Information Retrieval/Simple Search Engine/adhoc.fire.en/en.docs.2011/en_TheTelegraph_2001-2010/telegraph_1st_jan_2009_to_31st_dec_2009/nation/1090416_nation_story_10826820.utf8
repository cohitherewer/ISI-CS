The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Fever hits heat hurdle 
                                                                                                               Fever hits heat hurdle 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Cuttack, April 15: With little over a week left for the second phase of Lok Sabha and Assembly elections in Orissa, election fever seems low in Cuttack.        
	Posters and hoarding are few and far between, while cutouts and banners can barely be spotted. Election fever has not picked up in Barabati, Choudwar or in Sadar Cuttack  all under the Cuttack Lok Sabha constituency. Among all parties, only BJD members were visible a few days ago conducting whirlwind tours for chief minister Naveen Patnaik. The sound and fury is absent, but is expected to heat up after the first phase of polls on Thursday.         
	Party meetings have so far been restricted to workers and padyatras thanks to the summers heat, which netas have failed to combat. I have tried to complete my morning campaigns by 11am and resumed the second spell after 6pm, said BJP Samir Dey.

	 New Delhi, May 5 (PTI): The Supreme Court has ruled that an insurance company cannot issue a policy from a future date without the consent of the insured.           
	The ruling came after an appellant was awarded a compensation of Rs 7.96 lakh for her husbands death in an accident under a policy that came into force a day after his death. The court passed the ruling setting aside a Delhi High Court judgment.                   
	 New Delhi (PTI): The CBI has questioned former defence minister George Fernandes in connection with the alleged mishandling of Rs 51.83 crore in the purchase of armoured recovery vehicles in 1998-2000. He was questioned for 90 minutes.                  
	 Mumbai (PTI): Singer Adnan Sami faces possible arrest after his wife Saba lodged an FIR accusing him of torture, cheating and extortion, police said on Tuesday. A 72-hour notice has been served to Adnan prior to his arrest, allowing him time to seek anticipatory bail.

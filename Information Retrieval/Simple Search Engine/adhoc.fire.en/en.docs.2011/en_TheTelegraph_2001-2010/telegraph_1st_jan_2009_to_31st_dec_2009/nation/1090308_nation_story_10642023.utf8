          SANJAY K. JHA                              
	New Delhi, March 7: The BJP has decided to continue with its Advani versus who campaign despite clear indications from Sonia Gandhi that Manmohan Singh is her candidate for Prime Minister.        
	BJP leaders claim there is still enough room for confusion since the United Progressive Alliance has not clearly demonstrated an intent to seek a fresh mandate for Singh.        
	The Congresss allies are yet to express unequivocal support for Singhs leadership, with some like the Nationalist Congress Party trying to build a case for Sharad Pawar. Besides, the BJP is convinced that even the Congress has a hidden agenda  Rahul Gandhi.        
	BJP leaders are continuing to portray Singh as a stopgap Prime Minister and a nightwatchman. Arun Jaitley, a cricket fan, has often cited how none from the Congress opposed him when he described Singh as a nightwatchman (a lower-order player sent in to protect a top batsman in fading light) in the Rajya Sabha.        
	The BJP claims that the leadership muddle in the UPA has become more complex with Rahuls advent disturbing the de facto and de jure equation that Singh and Sonia had worked out.        
	Spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad today said the Congress campaign did not justify the claim that Singh was its candidate for the top job.        
	The hoardings the Congress party has put up across the country are Rahul-centric, not Manmohan-centric, Prasad said. Some hoardings have photographs of Sonia, Rahul and Manmohan while others only have Sonia and Rahul.        
	He added that the Congress had not displayed a single poster or hoarding projecting only Singh.        
	Congress sources, however, recently said Rahul had objected to the first lot of posters saying he wanted to be kept in the background.        
	The BJP, however, believes Singh is a showpiece. Although the party is secretly relieved that Advani does not have the young Rahul as his direct rival, it wants to demolish whatever standing Singh has gained over the past five years.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Outsider tag on BJDs camdidate
                                                                                                               Outsider tag on BJDs camdidate
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, April 8: The BJD has apparently missed out on a headstart in Cuttacks Barabati seat due to the outsider tag on party candidate Debashish Samantaray.         
	However, not everyone seems worried. A good start, the 49-year-old BJD leader said: Means little as any battle is a long-drawn affair with a lot of imponderables contributing to the final outcome.         
	Samantaray was elected in 2000 from Tirtol, an Assembly segment under the Jagatsinghpur constituency, but later lost to Congress candidate in 2004. The former MLA is now contesting from Barabati Cuttack after Tirtol was declared reserved for Scheduled Caste candidates.         
	My rivals have been projecting me as an outsider, but it am sure that the discerning voters do not think so, Samantaray told The Telegraph today. Besides, I am no outsider. I was born here and the city has been my home, he added.         
	The three-time Cuttack city MLA and BJP heavyweight Samir Dey, who is also contesting from the Barabati Cuttack seat, had allegedly raked up the outsider factor in his campaigns.         
	Samantarays bid, on the other hand, is to cash in on the anti-incumbency mood among the electorate that was evident in the February civic polls in Cuttack city. The civic poll result was a manifestation of public resentment against the BJP. Its no wonder that in this polls the former BJP mayor is nowhere in sight, Samantaray said, before participating in a BJD workers meet within the Barabati stadium precincts.         
	Cuttack Municipal Corporation has 54 wards. Of them 25 wards (1-24 and 26) constitute Barabati constituency. While the BJP had managed to win from a single ward, 22 had gone to the BJD. But, at this point, supporters are keeping their fingers crossed at this point over the possibility of a repeat of the civic polls.        
	The BJD is contesting for the Assembly seat in Cuttack (city) for the first time since the regional party was formed after the death of Biju Patnaik in 1997. In the past two elections (2004 and 2000), BJD had left Cuttack to the BJP.

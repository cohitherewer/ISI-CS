The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Gloomy Sankranti for staff at Satyam
                                                                                                               Gloomy Sankranti for staff at Satyam
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                          Ramalinga Raju                                  
	Hyderabad, Jan. 15: For Satyam employees and their families, the festival season has been one long nightmare that refuses to go away.         
	The employees, who in previous years would organise social functions during the festive month, are not in the mood to take part in any such gathering given their uncertain future with the company.         
	I never expected this Sankranti (festival of prosperity) would turn out to be such a disaster, said a middle-rung executive at the Satyam learning centre at Bahadurpalli, 20km from Hyderabad, who had been instrumental in organising social events on behalf of employees in previous years.        
	The dark mood started since December 18 following the controversy over a botched Maytas deal. The social calendar in the run-up to New Year went blank as the company started grappling with the crisis that was unfolding.         
	I usually take my family on a picnic or on some pilgrimage to some nearby town. But this year I did not feel like it, said Govind Raj, a Satyamite at Hitec City.         
	He said many of his colleagues had preferred to go back to their native places instead of staying in Hyderabad and confronting questions from neighbours and other non-Satyamites.        
	The Raju home on Road 62 at the upscale Jubilee Hills remained desolate as its master was cooling heels behind bars.         
	Ramalinga Raju and his brother Rama Raju were offered ladoos in the jail as part of Sankranti celebrations. Jail sources said they accepted the sweets in silence. Rajus bail plea would be heard and other petitions filed by investigating agencies in the Satyam case would be heard by Andhra Pradesh High Court tomorrow.         
	The Rajus of West Godavari district are also not celebrating to express solidarity with their fallen heroes.         
	Normally we receive some members of the Byrraju family who visit their village, launch some new schemes and participate in festivities. Sometimes their elders, Rama Raju or the mother and wife of Ramalinga Raju would turn up. But this year no one came, said a village elder.

                                                                                                               Krishna focus on peace in vicinity
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Krishna arrives for the news conference. (Prem Singh)                                  
	New Delhi, May 23: New foreign minister S.M. Krishna today stressed on the need for peace in Indias extended neighbourhood to achieve high rates of economic growth.        
	In his first media interaction after being named foreign minister, he said India was ready to extend our hand of friendship and partnership with Pakistan but the neighbour would have to take determined and credible action to dismantle the infrastructure of terrorism that is operating there.        
	That has been a stumbling block. It is for Pakistan to take these necessary steps so that all of us can live in peace.        
	Krishna, however, added: We cannot change our neighbours, we have to live with it. Generally, we would like to live in peace with neighbours. That has been our desire and we are pursuing that.        
	Earlier, reading out from a written statement, he said Indias primary objective was to sustain high rates of economic growth in the range of 9-10 per cent during the coming decades.        
	For that, we require peace and tranquillity in our extended neighbourhood and a supportive international environment.        
	The minister added that strengthening political, economic and cultural relations with neighbours was his highest priority and he looked forward to visiting them soon.        
	He said there was need to help rehabilitate the civil war-ravaged people of Sri Lanka and take a step towards devolution of power to the Lankan Tamils.        
	Krishna held detailed discussions with foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon and other key officials in the ministry. He said India would consolidate strategic partnerships with the US, China, Japan, the European Union and Russia.        
	Our strong and traditional ties with countries in Africa, West Asia and Latin America will be furthered and our Look East policy strengthened, he said.

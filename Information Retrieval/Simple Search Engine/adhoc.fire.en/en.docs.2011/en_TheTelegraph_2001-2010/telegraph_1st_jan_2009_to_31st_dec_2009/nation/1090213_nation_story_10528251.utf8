The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | The hidden American helping hand   DNA proof did the trick,   say officials
                                                                                                               The hidden American helping hand

	   DNA proof did the trick,   say officials									      NISHIT DHOLABHAI                      Ajmal Kasab (above) and the burning dome of Taj Mahal hotel during the attack                                            
	New Delhi, Feb. 12: One reason behind Islamabads acceptance that the Mumbai attacks were partly plotted in Pakistan could be DNA proof sent by India, home ministry sources told The Telegraph today.        
	Genetic samples from the lone surviving gunman, Ajmal Kasab, and a few of his nine slain comrades had been matched with those of their relatives in Pakistan with foreign help, the sources said.        
	They did not spell out who had helped and how, but revealed that Indian and US experts had been involved in a lengthy exchange of forensic evidence over the past few weeks.s        
	Pakistani media had spoken of an FBI visit to Faridkot, Kasabs alleged hometown in Pakistans Punjab province, around the New Year. Neither the FBI  Americas highest investigative agency  nor Pakistani officials had confirmed the visit.         
	By then Kasabs alleged parents had disappeared from their home, days after the Pakistani media had quoted the father as saying the young gunman shown on TV was his son.        
	A senior home ministry official, however, said that even things like a toothbrush or a piece of underwear left behind in the house would have provided DNA samples. He wouldnt confirm if Kasabs samples were indeed matched with DNA from such articles.        
	Samples could also have been obtained from relatives from his mothers or fathers side, the official said. No one would need to have actually collected blood samples of the relatives just a strand of hair or a glass from which they had sipped water, which would have saliva stains, would be enough.        
	The sources said that MV Kuber, the Indian trawler the gunmen had hijacked off the Gujarat coast, had thrown up DNA samples not only of the 10 attackers but of six more people. Altogether 16 samples were found, they said.        
	The unidentified six could be the sailors on the trawler whom the terrorists killed, or they may have been the gunmens accomplices, from Pakistan or elsewhere. Islamabad insists that the terrorists had local support in India, and even today implied only nine of the 10 had set sail from Pakistan.        
	Islamabads admission of Pakistani involvement in the Mumbai attacks is a first, and was praised as a positive development by home minister P. Chidambaram. He said the dossier was a very cogent document that Pakistan could not have ignored.        
	Asked if any official Pakistani agency  the ISI or any other  may have been involved, Chidambaram said: It is not fair to get into such a debate at this stage. We have received the report. It has a number of questions. I will study it overnight; we will study it in different departments.        
	The 30 answers (or pieces of evidence) that Pakistan has sought include a demand for the terrorists DNA samples and fingerprints. The sources said this could be a pointer that Islamabad had been impressed by the DNA evidence and wanted physical samples to carry out its own confirmatory tests.

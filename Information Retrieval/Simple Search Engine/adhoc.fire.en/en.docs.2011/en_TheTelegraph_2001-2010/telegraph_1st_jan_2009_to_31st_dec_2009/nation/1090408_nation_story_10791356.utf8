The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Smoke doubt on ministers 
                                                                                                               Smoke doubt on ministers 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, April 7: Health watchdogs today expressed their concerns that a group of ministers meeting scheduled for tomorrow may lead to a further delay or dilution of proposed pictorial warnings against tobacco products.         
	The group of ministers in its earlier meetings had consistently either delayed or diluted the pictorial warn-ings that were notified by the ministry of health in July 2006, three non-government health organisations said.         
	In a joint statement, the organisations said any decision on pictorial warnings that might emerge from the ministers meeting could be viewed as a violation of the model code of conduct.         
	Under decisions taken earlier, the deadline for the introduction of pictorial warnings had been postponed to May 31, 2009.         
	The health ministry had initially recommended the use of an image of skull and bones on tobacco packets. But a group of ministers meeting in February 2008 had changed the proposed images to either a scorpion or human lungs.         
	Were worried that the meeting tomorrow may lead to even more delay or further dilution of the warnings, said Prakash Gupta, director of the Healis Sekhsaria Institute of Public Health, New Mumbai, a cancer epidemiologist.         
	Our fear is that the meeting may lead to another postponement of the introduction of pictorial warnings or exempting bidis from warnings, Gupta said.        
	The Framework Convention on Tobacco Control  a global treaty signed by India  and a law passed by Parliament in 2003 mandates that all tobacco products in the country, including bidis, must display effective pictorial health warnings.         
	The group of ministers intervention has continuously delayed the implementation of the warnings, said Monika Arora, the director of another health agency.         
	This is a breach of the right to information about the health hazards of tobacco.         
	Sources in the office of the external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee said the meeting has been scheduled for Wednesday.         
	Mukherjee is chairman of the group, officials said.         
	Health activists said they were also concerned because the meeting scheduled for tomorrow comes at a time when Anbumani Ramadoss, who was the health minister and one of the strongest voices against tobacco use, has resigned.         
	He was one of the strongest supporters of strong, effective pictorial warnings, Gupta said.         
	In his absence, delays or dilution (of the warnings) may have a smooth sailing, he said.

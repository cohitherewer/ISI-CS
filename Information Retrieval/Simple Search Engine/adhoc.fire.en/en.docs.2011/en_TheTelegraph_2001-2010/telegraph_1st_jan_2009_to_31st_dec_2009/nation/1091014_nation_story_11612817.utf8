The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Kerala capsize boat faulty
                                                                                                               Kerala capsize boat faulty
          JOHN MARY                              
	Thiruvananthapuram, Oct. 13: The double-decker boat that capsized in a Kerala lake had a dangerous tilt, was made of sub-standard material and launched without tests, an initial probe has revealed.        
	Forty-five people, including five from Bengal, had died in the September 30 boat tragedy in the lake in the Periyar wildlife sanctuary.        
	K. Mohanan, who headed the Kerala Police Academy team that conducted the initial probe, found that the boat had a slant of 2.9 degrees to the right. An expert from the department of shipping technology of Cochin University engaged by the team detected the tilt.        
	The apparent manufacturing defect, which the boat-maker had tried to rectify without results, meant the lightweight fibreglass vessel could lose its balance when buffeted by strong winds or by sudden movements of those on board.        
	The Kerala Tourism Development Corporation (KTDC) bought the vessel without ensuring design safety and used it without pre-launch tests or getting the tilt rectified, Mohanan said in his report submitted to crime branch IG R. Sreelekha, who is now leading the investigation.        
	The finding about the tilt was significant against the backdrop of initial claims by officials that the boat, called Jalakanyaka, capsized because the tourists trooped to one side to catch a glimpse of the animals in the sanctuary.        
	The report has said the vessel wasnt ideal for an upper deck, had alignment problems between decks and was made of fibreglass and other materials whose quality was below par. Mohanan has recommended strong action against the official who issued the fitness certificate.         
	Sreelekha said the boat inspector was aware of the defects.

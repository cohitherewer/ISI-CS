The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bouncy pitch for debutant Azhar
                                                                                                               Bouncy pitch for debutant Azhar
          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                          Azhar: Challenges ahead                                  
	Lucknow, March 27: A poor team, unfamiliar wickets and a strong opponent  Mohammad Azharuddin may be feeling he has seen it all as he begins his debut Lok Sabha campaign.        
	The former cricketer  who spent the first three years of his India captaincy playing abroad with a weak team  was today named Congress candidate from Moradabad in Uttar Pradesh, far away from his native Hyderabad.        
	Even local Congress workers admitted that the rickety party organisation and the local demography may leave Azhar with a mountain to climb. The Congress had last won the seat in December 1984 before Azhar had scored a single Test run, and polled just 3,000 votes from the Moradabad Town Assembly segment in the 2007 state polls.        
	And though 40 per cent of the seats voters are Muslim, most are the so-called Turk Muslims (as opposed to the Pathan Muslims) who hold no brief for the Congress.        
	Local Congress workers say the favourite this time is sitting MP Shafiqur Rahman, who had won on a Samajwadi Party ticket but has now joined the Bahujan Samaj Party. He has all the advantages, a teacher in Moradabad town said.        
	A Congress worker, Nasim Siddique, said: Had we been consulted, we would have asked the high command to send Azharuddin to the Rajya Sabha. We love him a lot. If he loses, it would amount to an insult for us.        
	Azhars main hopes are his personal popularity and the rather remote possibility of all local Congress leaders and workers shrugging off their lethargy and defeatism to plunge enthusiastically into the campaign. Asked about this, a local political greybeard looked grim.        
	He said many local leaders, who had been eyeing the party ticket, might not co-operate with Azhar since they know that if he wins, their future is sunk.        
	In cricket parlance, however, Azhar has a few positives to take heart from. One, delimitation has sliced Thakurdawa off neighbouring Rampur and tagged it with Moradabad. Thakurdawas 60,000 voters are mostly Pathan Muslims, who could be well disposed towards Azhar.        
	Two, the delimitation has taken away some Jat voters, who are traditionally BJP supporters. Three, Samajwadi nominee Rizwan Ahmad is seen as a weak candidate, unlikely to eat too much into the Congresss Muslim votes.        
	State Congress president Rita Bahuguna Joshi said: We had recommended Azhar for two constituencies, Moradabad and Meerut. Moradabad will be just fine for him. He is a popular sportsman, a celebrity who is loved by all. We will see that he wins.        
	Sources said the party had carried out a survey on these two constituencies and found Moradabad more favourable.

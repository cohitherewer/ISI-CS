          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Aug. 24: A 21-year-old Delhi University student was found hanging in a private hostel today with a suicide note that said she took the step because nobody liked her.        
	The decomposed body of Ritveja Singh, a third-year undergraduate student of Kirori Mal College, was found hanging from the ceiling fan in her room by hostel-mates this morning, police said.        
	The condition of the body led the police to suggest that she committed suicide at least two days ago.         
	The girl from Patna had been living for the past three months at the hostel in Mukherjee Nagar, a relatively quiet residential area in north Delhi that is home to hundreds of outstation students.        
	Ritvejas suicide note said she was hurt and saddened that nobody likes me.         
	Hostel inmates said she was an introvert and had few friends.        
	She was seen by other inmates and even the landlord two days back. Going by the state of her body and the smell that alerted the others, we can assume that she took the step day before yesterday, said Ram Gopal, the investigating officer.        
	He suggested the loneliness as a possible cause. She had no relatives in Delhi and must have been feeling lonely, Gopal said. Her father A.K. Singh has been informed.

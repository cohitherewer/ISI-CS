The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Twin teasers for Gadkari
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Twin teasers for Gadkari

	New Delhi, Dec. 22: Four days into his job, BJP president Nitin Gadkari is up against a double whammy.        
	Orissa party veteran Kharbela Swain quit today, protesting the RSSs undue interference and control. In Rajasthan, Vasundhara Rajes loyalists have threatened to put up their candidate for the state presidents post against official nominee Arun Chaturvedi.        
	When the BJP heard that more members, including its MLAs in Orissa, would follow Swain, who is likely to join the BJD, vice-president Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi was sent to fight the fire. Naqvi oversaw the unanimous selection of former Union minister Jual Oram as the Orissa BJP chief, but barring that, he appeared to have achieved little else.        
	We are keeping our fingers crossed. Everyone here is suffering the pangs of being out of power. As long as Swain kept winning, the BJP was the best thing to have happened to him. Now that we look down-and-out, hes searching other options, a legislator said. Swain lost the Lok Sabha elections this year.        
	Oram told The Telegraph over the phone from Bh ubaneswar: We are trying our best to persuade Swain to return and help revive the party. Swain, who had resigned as a bureaucrat to join the BJP when it was in the ascendant, was one of its most vocal speakers in the Lok Sabha from 1998 to the first few months of 2009. On every issue on the communal-secular question, he took a position close to the RSSs. Therefore, its surprising he suddenly has a problem with the Sangh, the legislator said.        
	In Jaipur, the ongoing organisational polls have underlined the divide within the BJP, with Rajes supporters alleging large-scale rigging and attempts by the RSS to foist its nominees in every important post.        
	Raje, official nominee Chaturvedi, and national treasurer and Rajasthan MP Ramdas Aggarwal are expected to meet Gadkari tomorrow to discuss the irregularities and see if the internal polls can be put off.        
	So far, Gadkaris view is that the party should not defer the polls. At least 50 per cent of the states must be through with the exercise before mid-January so that the required number of electoral colleges are in place to formally ratify his election as BJP president.        
	Such bickering does not augur well when Rajasthan has announced panchayat polls in January, a state leader said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Poll politics in red belt
                                                                                                               Poll politics in red belt
          GAUTAM SARKAR                              
	Jamui (Bihar), April 1: With the Jamui Lok Sabha election date drawing closer, parties have hopped onto the anti-corruption and development bandwagon to woo Dalit and Other Backward Class voters.        
	However, residents of the rebel-hit pocket seem to be least interested in the political campaigns and are more worried about the impact of polls on rebel activities.        
	Residents in the constituency, which would be going in for election for the first time on April 16, apprehend increased Maoist activities in the area  many of them expect pro-Naxalite and Maoists sympathisers to join the poll fray.        
	Interestingly, no boycott call has yet been given by any rebel organisations in the area. As a resident explained: Instead, they (rebels) have begun to hint at candidates that we should vote for, though they are yet to disclose names.         
	Already the poll impact is manifesting itself. On Monday night, armed Maoists blew up a newly constructed primary school at Chormara village, under Barhet block. Jamui superintendent of police Binoy Kumar confirmed the incident and added that the police reached the area on Tuesday morning.        
	Sources from Barhet claimed that the incident was a show of rebel power. Earlier, some outfit members had gone around asking villagers to not support RJD candidate Shyam Rajak. When supporters of Union water resources minister Jai Parakesh Narayan Yadav (an RJD candidate) assembled on the school grounds for a meeting, rebels damaged the building, a source said.        
	Barhet PS sources added that paramilitary force would be deployed at the school, which would house two polling booths.        
	Apart from the lack of election fervour, pre-poll campaigns have been marked by the absence of the usual graffiti. For security reasons, star campaigners have only addressed meetings at Jamui, while a proposed visit by L.K. Advani was postponed. The police have strictly advised all mainstream parties to avoid meetings at sensitive pockets, said a cadre. However, the 21 candidates (seven from mainstream parties) trying their luck in the constituency do not seem too put off by the lack of poll fervour.         
	We will mention all the projects that have been introduced by Nitish Kumar to push our point across and we hope to counter rebels claim of lack of development, said a JD(U) activist.         
	That should keep the Maoist content for now, as some of the outfits had threatened mainstream political parties that they would have to mention details of development projects to the voters, if they wished to carry on with their campaigns in the remoter areas.

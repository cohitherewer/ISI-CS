          CITHARA PAUL                              
	New Delhi, July 13: The All India Muslim Personal Law Board has demanded a new law to criminalise homosexuality even as it prepares to contest the Delhi High Court verdict that decriminalised it.        
	Members of the board, which takes the final call on legal matters relating to the countrys Muslims, plan to meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh immediately on his return from abroad to press the government to bring in the new law and to contest the high court ruling.        
	The All India Muslim Personal Law Board wants the Union government to bring in new legislation to criminalise homosexuality, said Maulana Muhammed Abdur Raheem Quraishi, the boards assistant general secretary.        
	Earlier this month, the high court had taken adult consensual sex, done in private, out of the scope of a law that criminalised all sex apart from conventional heterosexual intercourse  thus decriminalising, among other things, gay sex.        
	Quraishi said the order was deplorable and went against religious values and moral norms.

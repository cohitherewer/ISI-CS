          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Sept. 13: Like in Jamshedpur, at Kalinga Nagar, too, tribal women belonging to Tata Steel Parivar (families displaced by its Kalinga Nagar steel plant project) are being trained to be empowered under the Tejaswini training programme designed by the steel behemoth.         
	The training module aims to empower women by giving them opportunities of an alternative livelihood and educating them about their role in sustainable industrialisation and development of their community and region.         
	After the completion of the programme, each participant is referred to as a Tejaswini  the one with the power.        
	The first step to being a Tejaswini is to attend the training-cum-exposure visit, which was organised for 17 tribal women belonging to Tata Steels Kalinga Nagar Parivar at Gandhi Labour Foundation in Puri. Participants represented self-help groups from Baghuapal, Bajrapali and Kandesahi  all from Jajpur.        
	The women were trained in new avenues of income generation, available assistance opportunities from industries and regarding the government norms, raw material procurement, technical assistance and proper marketing of the products. The participants were also taken on a trip to Pipili to get an idea of the appliqu industry there and explore the possibility of handicraft as a means to a livelihood, said Mohit Das of Tata Steel.        
	Usually, self-help groups fail to make profit due to the lack of knowledge regarding rotation of profit into business and enhancing production. But, we were trained in terms of enhancing productivity, availing loan, market planning of products and utilisation of funds through workshops and exposure visits, said Rasmita Sirka, who led the group.

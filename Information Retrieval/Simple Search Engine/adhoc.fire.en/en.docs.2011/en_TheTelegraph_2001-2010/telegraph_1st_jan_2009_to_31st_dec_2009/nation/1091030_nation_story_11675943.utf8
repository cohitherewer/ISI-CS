          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 29: In these hard times for the Left, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is a careful man. He doesnt want to drop his aitches, especially when it concerns the largest minority community.        
	The chief minister today asked the Centre to add an h to the recommended name for the proposed regulator of madrasa education.        
	In a letter to Union education minister Kapil Sibal, Bhattacharjee said the word madrasa in the proposed Central Madrasa Board should be replaced by madrasah. That is the way the word is spelt in Arabic, a state government official said.        
	Bhattacharjees letter comes at a time the Left has taken a battering at elections, the reverses blamed partly on an erosion in Muslim support.        
	Bhattacharjee has problems with the boards suggested name and composition, too. He wants the board named the Central Board of Madrasah Education instead of the Central Madrasa Board. If the idea is to give the board the same status as CBSE (Central Board of Secondary Education), why should it not be called the Central Board of Madrasah Education? state minority affairs minister Abdus Sattar said.        
	On the composition of the board, the chief minister said more eminent personalities should be included.

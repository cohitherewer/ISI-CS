The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pak takes lesson from 26/11 third eye
                                                                                                               Pak takes lesson from 26/11 third eye
          ANANYA SENGUPTA                   
	New Delhi, March 30: There were no visuals of breathless reporters ducking and scrambling amid the crackle of gunfire on TV today. No from-the-scene, blow-by-blow accounts of counter-terror operations.        
	Pakistani authorities handling of the police academy siege suggested they had absorbed the lessons of 26/11, when chaotic media coverage had allegedly played into the terrorists hands.        
	In Mumbai, the Indian media were accused of acting as the gunmens third eye with their graphic descriptions of commando positions and operations  information that was apparently relayed to the terrorists by their Pakistani handlers. In Lahore, the Pakistani authorities cordoned the academy off, refusing to let reporters within 300 metres of it.        
	A government official rang each news channel in the country with a request to exercise restraint and not create panic. In India, most of the media had dismissed a similar  although delayed  request from the government, but the Pakistani channels today heeded Islamabads advice.        
	There were continuous requests from officials not to air live footage, lest it hamper the operations. Most of the media followed the request. Compared with the coverage of earlier attacks in the country, the media was unusually restrained, a senior Pakistani journalist said.        
	Three things were distinctly different from the coverage in India. The Pakistani media didnt jump to conclusions about India being responsible for the attacks; we didnt jump the gun about the attackers identity; we did not air outrageously large numbers of casualties. The media didnt go overboard.        
	Both the Pakistani government and media earned praise from Indian security experts.        
	The restraint shown by the Pakistani media has been laudable. During 26/11, the Indian media not only acted as the third eye for the terrorists and their handlers, they created psychological pressure on the forces by making irrational demands for immediate results based on half-baked information, said Ajai Sahni, editor of South Asia Intelligence Review and executive director of the Institute for Conflict Management, New Delhi. This in turn created hysteria and brought unreasonable political pressure on the forces.

	Malay Krishna Dhar, former joint director of the Intelligence Bureau, applauded the Pakistani authorities. The difference (with Mumbai) was that the media was cordoned off completely. Operation details werent made available with unnecessary briefings.        
	Some obvious differences with 26/11, however, partly explain the difference in response. One, the Mumbai siege took place in three places in the heart of the metropolis and so spread chaos and panic. The police academy, on Lahores outskirts, was easier to cordon off from crowds and camera crew.        
	A second reason for the heightened panic was that the Mumbai siege was preceded by massacres at restaurants and railway terminuses. A third was that unlike in Pakistan, the hostages and victims in Mumbai were civilians  foreign guests, newlyweds, elderly couples, even children.        
	A fourth reason for the contrast in coverage, some may argue, is that the media of a consistently democratic India may have been especially sensitive about any government bid to restrain them.        
	The footage today showed some policemen crawling on the ground or scaling a wall to safety. The only other signs of the siege were the sound of firing and explosions, policemens bodies lying inside the compound, and personnel in bullet-proof jackets taking up position outside.        
	Most of the reports came through phone calls to the studios; most of the information came from official briefings.        
	The Pakistanis did many things right, though. Within half an hour of the sieges start, all roads leading to the academy had been barricaded with barbed wire, cutting off every avenue of escape. While the Pakistani forces ended the crisis in four hours, India had taken nine hours just to reach its elite forces to Mumbai.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Politicians face civic poll acid test
                                                                                                               Politicians face civic poll acid test
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Battlefield: Cuttack                                  
	Cuttack, Feb. 4: Beyond altering the political composition of Cuttack Municipal Corporation (CMC), the civic polls would perhaps change the fate of a few politicians across party lines.         
	BJD boss and chief minister Naveen Patnaiks agenda is to form the CMC council by repeating a thumping victory seen at the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation.         
	The beleaguered BJP, on the other hand, would try to retain its identity.         
	The K.P. Singhdeo-led new Orissa Pradesh Congress (OPC) teams mantra to local leaders would be to prepare the pitch for the ensuing Assembly elections.         
	The new party, Samrudha Orissas, self-styled mascots for CMC election, former BJD MP Trilochan Kanungo and his brother, also a former BJD leader and a former finance minister, Panchanan Kanungo, would be trying to prove their mettle after two decades.         
	Besides the parties, several politicians will be facing the acid test as the CMC area is spread across two Assembly segments  Cuttack City and Cuttack Sadar.         
	Cuttack Sadar is now divided in three reorganised Assembly segments of Barabati Cuttack, Choudwar Cuttack and Cuttack Sadar under the Cuttack Lok Sabha constituency.         
	The corridors of BJP are buzzing about how the elections will determine the fate of three players  state higher education minister Samir Dey, partys Orissa general secretary Nayan Mohanty and former mayor Nibedita Pradhan.         
	As a senior leader said: If the BJP emerges as the single-largest party yet again, it will make things easier for Dey to plead a case for leaving the Barabati Cuttack seat for BJP before the final seat sharing discussions with the BJD.         
	The same may be said for Mohanty in the Choudwar Cuttack seat from where he plans to contest on a party ticket.         
	Dey is in charge of 28 wards in Barabati Cuttack Assembly segment and Mohanty is responsible for 26 wards in Choudwar Cuttack and Cuttack Sadar Assembly segments.         
	For Nibedita Pradhan, the polls will be a commentary on her tenure as the mayor, making or marring the prospects of a party ticket during the Assembly elections.         
	She resigned as party MLA from Cuttack Sadar to assume office as mayor.         
	For BJD, the polls are not limited to improving its corporator tally above 13.         
	District president Dharmananda Behera, city president Madhusudan Sahu and party MLA from Cuttack Sadar have been made to understand by Naveen Patnaik to consolidate the party base in all wards.        
	If the BJD is to emerge as the majority in the council it will make things easier for Behera to stake claim on Barabati and Choudwar Cuttack during the final seat sharing with the BJP for the Assembly polls, said a senior leader.         
	Behera represents BJD in the Assembly from the Choudwar constituency.         
	Pravat Biswal, who joined the BJD after getting elected from the Cuttack Sadar seat, will also share his partys success or failure. Also, much is at stake for Congress city president Suresh Mohapatra.         
	With the change in guards at the helm of OPCC, his continuance as the chief will depend on the partys performance, a party insider said.

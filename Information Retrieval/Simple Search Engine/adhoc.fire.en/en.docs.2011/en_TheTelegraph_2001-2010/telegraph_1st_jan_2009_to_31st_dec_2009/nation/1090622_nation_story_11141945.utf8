The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Advani tries to humour RSS 
                                                                                                               Advani tries to humour RSS 
          SANJAY K. JHA                           Hema Malini (left) with other BJP members at the national executive in Delhi on Sunday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, June 21: BJP leader L.K. Advani today ruled out the possibility of redefining the relationship with the RSS and publicly endorsed the need for a younger leadership,         
	He iterated at the BJP national executive that Hindutva would remain the ideological bedrock of the party, saying change was desirable in every organisation but it would not take place by cutting off the arteries of life-sustaining sap.         
	Advanis endorsement of the RSS agenda is being viewed as a tactical shift as his immediate priority is to establish control over the party. Sources in the party said Advani would gain little by antagonising the RSS at this juncture as there are ruptures within his own camp.        
	Touching on another subject said to be close to the heart of RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat, Advani indicated that he would not like to invest any further in older leaders (read Jaswant Singh, Murli Manohar Joshi etc) by arguing that talented young members should be given opportunities and the partys leadership planning should take into account the needs for the next 20 years.        
	Advani said the train compartment mentality of not opening the door to those who are waiting outside has to change, echoing the eagerness of the Sangh to nurture to younger leaders to counter the Rahul Gandhi factor in the Congress.        
	He also defended Arun Jaitely, who was picked with the blessings of the RSS to be Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha but had come under attack from a disgruntled section yesterday.         
	Advani sent Venkaiah Naidu, instead of the regular spokespersons, to address the media, primarily with the objective of correcting the impression that Jaitley was being hauled up for the defeat.        
	Venkaiah repeatedly said there was no question of targeting any individual and the reports appearing in the media were misleading. He said disappointment after the defeat was natural and the leaders who make some critical references about others could not be gagged. But the party as a whole does not hold one individual guilty, Venkaiah emphasised.         
	Jaswant Singh and Arun Shourie, who mounted a scathing attack on Jaitley yesterday, are considered close to Advani. But Advani believes Jaitley can take the party on a moderate course without being confrontational with the RSS. Jaswant has never been an organisation man and Shourie is still considered an outsider. Yashwant Sinha, too, never got along with Advani.        
	Advani warned Jaitleys detractors against going to the media.         
	Although the RSS is known to be in favour of a generational change in the BJP, Advani today indicated his desire to carry on. He announced a decision to tour the entire country to convey to party cadres the opportunities and tasks that the 2009 election had brought upon them.        
	Advani pointed out that the general election had established that the BJP was the only viable national alternative to the Congress. He said a big, new opportunity was hidden in the demise of the third and the fourth fronts and it was now clear that a genuine alternative to the Congress could develop only around the pole of the BJP.        
	 Those whose hatred for the BJP has been stronger than their preference for an alternative to the Congress will either gravitate towards the Congress or become irrelevant in national politics, he said.        
	Advani recalled that the relationship with the RSS had been debated thoroughly in 1979-80 when the Janata Party asked Jan Sangh leaders to sever ties with the RSS, which ultimately led to the birth of the BJP.         
	Advani said the RSS, too, was changing with the times, adding that it was not the champion of a state that would uphold the interests of one religion at the cost of others.        
	Advani had in the past suggested a review of the BJPs ties with the RSS and sought greater functional autonomy for the party.        
	Advani stressed that the BJPs Hindutva was inclusive, which is not a new protestation, and still went on to quote former RSS chief Bala Saheb Deoras as having said that Hindu Rashtra was synonymous with Indian state.         
	This has been a point of contention in Indias political discourse. Ironically, most critics of the Hindutva ideology within the party were Advani aides at some point or the other.

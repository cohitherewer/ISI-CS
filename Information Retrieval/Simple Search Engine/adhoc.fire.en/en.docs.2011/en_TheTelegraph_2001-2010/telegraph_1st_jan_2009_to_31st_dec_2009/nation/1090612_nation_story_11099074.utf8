The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Closer to pact on arms scan
                                                                                                               Closer to pact on arms scan
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 11: America and India are ready to sign a contentious military agreement that will allow Washington to inspect hardware it sells to Indian armed forces and step up defence co-operation.        
	I think we will get past that.... Yes, we are closer (to signing the End-User Verification Agreement), US under-secretary for political affairs William Burns said. Two other pacts, the Communications Interoperability and Security Memorandum of Understanding and the Logistics Support Agreement, were also discussed.        
	Burns handed a letter from President Barack Obama to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh that said the US regarded India as a top foreign policy priority and strategic partner.         
	The end-user pact will determine to a large extent the quantum of American military sales. India has accepted conditions of the agreement on a case-by-case basis. But with transactions of military hardware increasing, the case for an omnibus pact has come up. The effort is to clinch it during US secretary of state Hillary Clintons visit in July.         
	Ideally we would not like a pact that requires physical on-site verification of military equipment, a senior defence ministry official said.         
	US firms like Lockheed Martin and Boeing could lose out on billions of dollars in orders if a compromise on the end-user pact is not reached.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Omar for stranded militants 
                                                                                                               Omar for stranded militants 
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                           Omar                                  
	Srinagar, Jan. 15: Omar Abdullah has hit the ground running to fulfil one of his key election promises: bring back the Kashmiri militants stranded across the Line of Control.        
	The chief minister today said the return of the militants, whom he referred to as our Kashmiri brethren across the LoC, was discussed at a meeting of the unified high command, comprising officials of the Jammu and Kashmir government and security forces, in Jammu yesterday. It was the first meeting of the command Omar headed after assuming office over a week back.        
	Most Kashmir parties have been vociferous in demanding the return of the militants  thousands who crossed over for arms training at the start of insurgency in the early 90s  but nothing tangible has been achieved.         
	We tried to chalk out the modalities for the return of our Kashmiri brethren across the LoC at the unified command meeting. We hope to work out the (final) modalities with New Delhi (the Centre), Omar said today in his first press conference in Srinagar as chief minister.        
	Omar said the militants had been coming to the Valley on others (fake) passports, via Bangladesh and Nepal. There are those who come through the LoC but have to leave their families. We are making efforts to bring them back and reintroduce them into the society.         
	Security forces believe many of the militants want to return but are holding themselves back for fear of having to face the law, even if they are treated leniently. They are worried about possible arrest or reprisal from colleagues.                     
	The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), the main rival of Omars National Conference, had repeatedly raised the return of such militants in the past but voted against an Assembly motion on the issue a few years back. The PDP feared its coalition with the Congress might fall because the latter opposed the militants return.         
	The matter was also on the agenda of one five working groups set up by the Prime Minister in 2005 to examine the internal dimensions of the Kashmir problem.        
	Omar also promised to improve relations between two parts of Kashmir, saying he would try to improve the scope of the barter trade allowed at present. The cross-LoC trade is working on a barter system but has been confined to the exchange of onion, potatoes and fruits.         
	The improvement in cross-LoC ties has been one of the PDPs most-touted issues and, while Omar doesnt want to reverse the previous governments moves, he appeared a little wary in the wake of the Mumbai attacks.        
	There is no exchange of money or telephonic talks (between the two parts of Kashmir). These issues were raised by the business community. Post 26/11 (day if the Mumbai strike), there is bitterness in Indo-Pak relations. I appreciate if things havent moved forward; they have also not gone backward. My effort will be that there is no reversal of CBMs (confidence-building measures).        
	Omar described bringing business and industry to Jammu and Kashmir as his top priority and said he was heading to Mumbai tomorrow to attend a programme aimed at presenting the state as a good investment destination.        
	But he said he would like companies to hire locals. We dont want industries coming here to bring skilled manpower with them. We want our own skilled manpower.

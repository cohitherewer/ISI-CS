The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Congress tones down Bundelkhand tune
                                                                                                               Congress tones down Bundelkhand tune
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Rahul in Lucknow on Thursday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 8: The Congress has toned down its stand on a development authority for the Bundelkhand region that cuts into Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh after chief ministers of the states rejected the proposal, saying it would erode their federal rights.        
	Amethi MP and AICC general secretary Rahul Gandhi, who had asked Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to look into the possibility of setting up the body, has reportedly asked the Congress not to go overboard on the issue or use untenable legal arguments to bolster its case.        
	We are clear that if such an authority is constituted, it will plan and monitor the use of the central funds. The execution will be done by the state governments. The Congress will not go against the federal character of our polity, said Digvijay Singh, the general secretary in charge of Uttar Pradesh.        
	Manish Tewari, the Congress spokesperson, was informally asked by the party to explain why he invoked Article 258 (a) to shore up his contention. This constitutional provision virtually empowers the governor to shift part of the executive powers vested in a state government to the Union government.        
	Tewari had said that if a state government was unwilling to cede its authority, the Centre might have to use the carrot-and-stick policy. His assertion was seen as a gesture to please Rahul.        
	Singh clarified that the only provision the Congress would use to support the demand was Article 263.         
	The article says that if it appeared to the President that public interest would be served, a council can be established to investigate and discuss matters in which the Centre and one or more states will have a common interest.        
	The authority will only monitor irrigation and power projects. On all other aspects, the state governments will be free to do what they want, Singh said.        
	The Congress leader said the template the party was looking at was the North Eastern Council that finances and implements centrally funded development programmes sought by the state governments of the region.        
	The state governments have the first and the last word. The Centres task is facilitative and not interventionist. So even the non-Congress governments of Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh shouldnt have a problem with this, said a source.        
	Singh said the proposed Bundelkhand authority would stay out of the execution of the Centres social sector projects such as the rural job scheme.        
	A section of the Congress felt that since the job scheme was being projected as the partys brainchild, Opposition dispensations in the states should not be allowed to nurse it and steal the credit for its success.        
	The lobby had hoped that if the Bundelkhand authority came into being, the prototype could be replicated in the other states to assert the Centres supremacy over the federal governments. But the idea was turned down by the Congresss own dispensations.

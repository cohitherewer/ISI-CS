The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rajnath tries unity menu 
                                                                                                               Rajnath tries unity menu 
  - Lunch at BJP Chief home for team Advani          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                                          
	New Delhi, Sept. 1: Rajnath Singh and his core team today tried to present a picture of unity before RSS and BJP cadres, a day after state elections were announced.        
	The cadres, a general secretary said, had been getting increasingly restive about the party pulling in different directions and showing no signs of wanting to take on the Congress or going for the kill in the poll-bound states of Maharashtra, Arunachal Pradesh and Haryana.        
	Sources said the RSS, whose top five leaders have gone into a three-day huddle at a retreat near Hardwar, had conveyed to Rajnath they were unhappy with the persistent show of defiance in the BJP even after the sarsanghachalak signalled last week that the party must work as a team.        
	Mohan Bhagwat, Madandas Devi and others alluded to instances like senior MP Pyarelal Khandelwals letter calling Jaswant Singhs expulsion unfair and also mentioned Vasundhara Rajes reluctance to resign as leader of the Opposition in the Rajasthan legislature for one reason or another.         
	Yesterday, Vasundhara said she was too ill to meet M. Venkaiah Naidu who was tasked to take the process ahead and get her resignation letter.        
	The BJP has decided not to create another controversy over Khandelwals missive. It advised him not to speak to the media.        
	Using the elections as a pretext, party president Rajnath selectively called Sushma Swaraj, Arun Jaitley and Naidu  who are generally regarded as L.K. Advanis followers even though they have often gone different ways after being mentored by him  over for lunch at his house.         
	He also included Ramlal, the lone RSS pracharak in his team who functions as the organising secretary, but left leaders like Vinay Katiyar and Thawarchand Gehlot, who are considered his men.        
	Sources said although Sushma and the others had wanted to meet him at the BJP office, Rajnath chose his home as the venue to give a touch of bonhomie to the exercise. TV crew were tipped off about the lunch.         
	Rajnath was at the gate to pose with his guests as he received them and then saw them off.        
	However, the mood inside was sombre, a source said.         
	The leaders agreed that the party would have to give its best shot in Maharashtra. The objective circumstances  10 years of the Congress-NCP rule, a perceived anti-incumbency sentiment, doubts over the durability of the ruling alliance, drought, rise in food prices  indicated the time was ripe to induce a regime change.         
	Provided we set our house in order, have a perfect tie-up with the Shiv Sena and are able to neutralise Raj Thackerays (Maharashtra) Navnirman Sena, a source said.         
	Rajnath and company, the source said, werent overly optimistic about Haryana and Arunachal Pradesh, though.         
	We dont have a party left in Arunachal and in Haryana we have dumped Om Prakash Chautala without another ally, the source said.        
	There was consensus that Vasundhara should be asked to quit in the next two or three days and not be allowed to resort to dilatory tactics.        
	But on persuading Jaswant to give up the post of chairman of the parliamentary public accounts committee, the view was to go easy, especially after the expelled leader declared today that he would not resign.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Mission expansion plan on Pak table
                                                                                                               Mission expansion plan on Pak table
          NASIR JAFFRY                              
	Islamabad, Sept. 17: Pakistan is considering a proposal made by New Delhi to expand the Indian mission in Islamabad.        
	India recently sought an increase in the strength of both its diplomatic and non-diplomatic staff at its high commission in Islamabad to 150 from 110 but it was something not doable for many reasons, a senior foreign ministry official here told The Telegraph.        
	Islamabad initially believed the increase wasnt required as there hadnt been much business between the two countries since New Delhi suspended the peace process in the wake of last Novembers Mumbai attack.         
	But later, it decided to look at the request in a way that would allow both sides to have more employees at their missions.        
	Since the increase in staff is reciprocal and Pakistan will also have to enhance the staff strength at its high commission in New Delhi if the Indian proposal is accepted, we agreed to a revised proposal to enhance the number of diplomatic and non-diplomatic staff in the two capitals to 140, the official said, adding a final decision would be taken after more consultations within the government.         
	The official said the Indian proposal was being discussed in the foreign and interior ministries as well as other departments.         
	The Pakistan government is considering another Indian proposal  launching a South Asian train service linking Pakistan, India, Bangladesh and Nepal. The four countries will form a working group of experts to discuss the nitty-gritty, including fares, freight charges and possible routes if the proposal is found feasible.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nod to diluted tobacco alert
                                                                                                               Nod to diluted tobacco alert
          OUR BUREAU                              
	New Delhi, May 6: The Supreme Court today permitted new rules restricting health warnings to one side of cigarette packets to come into force from May 31, rejecting a plea by health activists to restore earlier rules that required the warnings to be displayed on both sides.        
	Several NGOs had urged the apex court to restore the rules notified in 2008, which required a picture of a scorpion or lungs to cover at least 40 per cent of the pack on both sides to warn consumers of the ill-effects of smoking.         
	Although notified last year, implementation of the rules was deferred as the tobacco lobby made repeated representations. This month, the government diluted the rules to restrict the warning to only one side of the pack.         
	The NGO, Health for Millions, challenged this in court. But the government pleaded that the norms had been deferred far too many times and should be allowed to come into effect from May 31.         
	Additional solicitor-general Gopal Subramanium said: Let these norms come into effect, they can always be changed later. There have been several delays in implementing the norms and the Union government did not want to delay the process beyond May 31.         
	On his assurance, the court refused to intervene for now.         
	Public health experts reacted with dismay and said they would fight the legal battle to reassert the citizens right to health, which had been sacrificed for the tobacco lobby.         
	The government had exploited a loophole in the 2003 act that governs tobacco control to justify the latest notification issued on May 3, they said. Section 7 (4) of the Tobacco Control Act says pictorial health warnings should appear on not less than one of the largest panels of the packet. The May 3 notification is consistent with this provision, the government claimed.         
	The act has provisions for tougher rules that had been invoked earlier to propose warnings on 40 per cent of both the front and the back panels, said Monika Arora, director of Hriday Shan, an NGO campaigning against tobacco. While the health ministry had tried to introduce tougher rules, Arora said, the Group of Ministers had steadily diluted them.In February 2008, the GoM had decided to introduce pictures of a scorpion or lungs instead of the skull and crossbones as proposed by the health ministry. It also agreed that the pictures would cover 40 per cent of the front and back panels, as opposed to the proposed 50 per cent. These ruled were notified in March 2008.        
	Appearing for Health for Millions, counsel Indira Jaisingh alleged that the standards had been hastily diluted without taking into account the views of the health ministry, and referred to a letter written by former health minister Anbumani Ramadoss to the Prime Minister protesting against the move.         
	Jaisingh argued that the one-side warning would encourage retailers to stack their wares in such a way as to hide the warnings.

	GREEN fashion        
	A runway show in Copenhagen on Wednesday aimed to show that green styles  some of them stitched in fabrics made from recycled waste  can be fashionable. Twenty designers from five Nordic countries took part. Each presented two looks made from organic cottons and silks, polyesters made from recycled plastic bottles or new fabrics made from industrial and agricultural waste.        
	Never heard of Crabion? Its made from byproducts from the crab industry. Ingeo? Its made out of corn scraps and can be made to mimic the smoothness of silk or the glossy sheen of PVC. Ditto Milkfiber, which is milled milk: from the powder left over from boiled milk.        
	Finlands Saara Lepokorpi took the $6,720 prize for her asymmetrical cocktail dress with what appeared to be panels of ruched silk. Other looks included a strappy bodice that looked like the model was getting a bear hug from an octopus        
	EMAIL flight        
	Over 1,700 scientists in Britain have signed a statement defending the evidence for human-made climate change after hacked emails emboldened climate sceptics. Emails stolen from an English university appeared to show scientists discussing ways to shield data from public scrutiny and suppress others work. The scientists signed a statement released on Thursday, saying they had confidence in the evidence for global warming and the scientific basis for concluding that it is due primarily to human activities                    A US freeskier from Save Our Snow Foundation in Copenhagen to

	PROTECTOR areas        
	A group of global conservation organisations has come out with a book that for the first time highlights how protected areas contribute significantly to reducing the impacts of climate change and what is needed for them to achieve even more. The book, Nature Solution: Protected Areas Helping People Cope with Climate Change, is from the stable of the International Union for Conservation of Nature, Nature Conservancy, United Nations Development Programme, Wildlife Conservation Society, World Bank and the World Wildlife Fund.        
	Protected areas  portions of land and/or sea dedicated to the protection of biological diversity and natural resources  play a major role in reducing climate-changing CO2 emissions since 15 per cent of the worlds terrestrial carbon stock (312 billion tonnes) is stored in these areas around the world.        
	In Canada, over 4 billion tonnes of CO2 is sequestered in 39 national parks, estimated to be worth $39-87 billion in carbon credits. In the Amazon, protected lands are expected to prevent 670,000sqkm of deforestation by 2050, representing 8 billion tonnes of avoided carbon emissions        
	SOROS solution        
	Billionaire financier George Soros said on Thursday he had found a path to unlock a Copenhagen stalemate on climate finance, using IMF assets. The talks in Copenhagen are stuck on splitting the bill to cut carbon emissions and prepare for more droughts, floods and rising seas.        
	Soros said developed countries could invest a portion of their $283 billion IMF special drawing rights in carbon-cutting projects in developing nations. The projects themselves would pay the interest on the proposed $100 billion to be spent over the next decade, and IMF gold reserves would guarantee the principle and interest.        
	Soros acknowledged a series of obstacles to his proposal, including US Congress approval, IMF director approval and a global carbon price              AGENCIES

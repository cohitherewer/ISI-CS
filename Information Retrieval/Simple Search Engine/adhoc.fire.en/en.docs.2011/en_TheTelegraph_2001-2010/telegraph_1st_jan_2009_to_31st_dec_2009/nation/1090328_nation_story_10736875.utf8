                                                                                                               Rajnath fires Babri rebuild barb at Cong
          SANJAY K. JHA                          Rajnath campaigns in Jammu on Friday. (PTI)                                  
	Jammu, March 27: If the temple cant arouse the voters, the BJP hopes the mosque will.        
	Rajnath Singh today asked the Congress to clarify when it would fulfil its promise of rebuilding the Babri Masjid.        
	One Congress Prime Minister (P.V. Narasimha Rao) had taken a vow to rebuild the Babri mosque (at the spot) where it was demolished in Ayodhya, the BJP president said, launching the partys campaign in Jammu.        
	I want to ask Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress president Sonia Gandhi to clarify when the party will deliver on that promise.        
	Rajnath raised the matter soon after declaring that the BJP was committed to building a grand Ram temple at the disputed site in Ayodhya. Ostensibly, the Babri query was the BJPs rejoinder to the Prime Ministers barb at L.K. Advani earlier this week.        
	Manmohan Singh is indulging in meaningless talk. He is asking what our leader L.K. Advanis contribution is except the demolition of the Babri mosque, Rajnath said. He is speaking out of frustration or getting nervous under election pressure. He should rather tell us when he would fulfil the promise made by his partys Prime Minister.        
	The late Rao, under fire within and outside the Congress immediately after the mosques demolition, had spoken of rebuilding it. For many years since then, though, nobody in the Congress has talked about rebuilding the mosque  the party has only insisted that everyone accept the courts verdict.        
	Rajnaths objective in raising the issue, however, appears to go beyond the need to hit back at the Prime Minister and seems part of a calculated assault on the Congress.        
	On the return flight to Delhi from Jammu, the BJP president laughed away questions about his attempt to portray the Congress as a pro-Muslim party.        
	Asked if the BJP would support the Congress if it tried to deliver on that alleged promise of rebuilding the mosque, Rajnath told The Telegraph: Let the Congress state its position first. Our position is clear that we want a Ram temple. We have been consistent in our stand. The Congress never talked of Babri mosque during the five years it was in office and suddenly the Prime Minister recalls the Babri demolition. Does he want to polarise the voters?        
	In his Jammu speech, Rajnath also mentioned the Amarnath row and the Ram Setu. He accused the Congress of deliberately attacking Hindu symbols to pursue vote-bank politics.        
	The BJP launched its poll campaign across the nation today, coinciding with the celebration of the Hindu New Year in some regions.         
	Modi swipe at PM        
	In Gujarat, chief minister Narendra Modi targeted the Prime Minister, saying nobody remembered him when he was on holiday for two months, an apparent reference to Manmohan Singhs recovery from a bypass heart surgery.         
	The Congress described the comment as cheap and condemnable.

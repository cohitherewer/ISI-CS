                                                                                                               Cerebral malaria kills 5 kids
          NALIN VERMA                              
	Patna, Aug. 8: At least five children died of cerebral malaria in Munger in the past three days, taking the toll caused by the fatal disease to 30 since the first week of July when it broke out in the south-eastern district.        
	The situation there is alarming with the disease affecting a large population. District malaria officer B. Sahu said: At least 565 people out of 1,450 whose serum underwent tests, were found cerebral malaria positive.        
	Cerebral malaria is caused by a type of mosquito bite and proves fatal, according to doctors, if not treated in time.        
	An eight-member team of doctors from the National Vector-born Disease Control Programme, New Delhi,  led by Union health and family welfare ministry joint director S.N. Sharma  which has been camping in Munger since Friday and has been moving around the affected areas, is engaged in finding out the reason for the disease and control its spread.        
	The disease, according to experts, has spread in around 100 villages in Haveli-Khadagpur sub-division of Munger district.        
	The acting president of Bihar Congress, Samir Singh, who happens to be a resident of Haveli-Khadagpur, severely criticised the state government for turning blind eyes on the deadly disease.        
	The government machinery has not even bothered to carry out fumigation in the villages to keep the mosquitoes at bay, he said, adding: The government must set up permanent camps of doctors in the affected areas to save people.        
	However, state health department joint director and state programme officer R.N. Mishra said: There is nothing much to worry as the ferocity of the disease in the affected areas is on decline now. The Delhi team, assisted by the state doctors, has effectively been working among the people to control the menace.        
	Mishra returned here yesterday after camping in the affected areas with the experts and doctors for the past two days.         
	He described the geographical and cultural setting of the affected areas as the prime reason for cerebral malaria in Haveli-Khadagpur region.         
	The disease has affected the people in about 100 villages along the hills that end at Dharhara near the Bihar-Jharkhand border.        
	During monsoon, according to experts, many pits and craters develop in the villages close to the hills where rainwater gets accumulated, creating a habitat of mosquitoes. Moreover, the experts said the stretch was inhabited mainly by tribal and illiterate people who bank more on occult rather than approaching hospitals for treatment.        
	Mishra, however, admitted that the backward villages in the hilly region were lacking sufficient number of hospitals and professional medicos. But we have now initiated concerted efforts to control the disease.        
	Cerebral malaria is an acute, widespread disease of the brain which is accompanied by fever. The mortality ratio is between 25 and 50 per cent. If a person is not treated, it turns fatal in 24-72 hours.

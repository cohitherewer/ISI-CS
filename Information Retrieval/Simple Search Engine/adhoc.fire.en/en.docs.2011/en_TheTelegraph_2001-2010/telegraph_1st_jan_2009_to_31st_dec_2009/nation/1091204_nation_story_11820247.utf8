The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cambridge mulls table for Mamata
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Cambridge mulls table for Mamata
          AMIT ROY                                             
	Cambridge, Dec. 3: Mamata Banerjee has been invited by Cambridge University to take part in a discussion programme.        
	The original proposal from a Calcutta-based person to the university, now celebrating its 800th anniversary, was whether the railway minister and Trinamul Congress leader could be invited to Cambridge to deliver an address.        
	Having considered the offer, the universitys deputy vice-chancellor, Dame Sandra Dawson, wrote back and suggested that it might be more appropriate if Mamata could take part in a round-table discussion with other prominent people.        
	Dame Sandra, who has been Master of Sidney Sussex College and KPMG Professor of Management Studies at the Judge Business School and the director there from 1999 to 2009, is now chairman of the Cambridge India Partnership.        
	It was thought it might be valuable to have a round table where Mamatas philosophy on public transport as well as her ideas on social, economic and industrial development could be analysed with other distinguished people.        
	Dame Sandra has written an open letter of invitation in which Mamata has been described as an extraordinarily distinguished political figure.        
	According to Mamatas profile on the Lok Sabha website, she is an MA, BEd, LLB, trained in Work Education, educated at Calcutta University.        
	In India, one of her aides has told a news agency: We have received a communication from university authorities about the proposed visit to Cambridge and the minister is not averse to the visit.        
	If it takes place, it will be her first foreign visit as railway minister.        
	Although no date has been finalised yet, it is expected to be in the last week of January, officials added.         
	But Cambridge University has so far not heard either from Mamata or her office.         
	Although there is no specific invitation yet, a spokesman for the University told The Telegraph: We had some correspondence on this a few months ago, but no firm arrangements have yet been made for a meeting. As a university with global reach, we regularly welcome visitors from around the world.         
	Mamata, should she wish to, can personally discuss her possible visit to Cambridge with both Dame Sandra and the universitys vice-chancellor, Professor Alison Richard, when they tour Calcutta, Delhi, Bangalore and Mumbai in early January.

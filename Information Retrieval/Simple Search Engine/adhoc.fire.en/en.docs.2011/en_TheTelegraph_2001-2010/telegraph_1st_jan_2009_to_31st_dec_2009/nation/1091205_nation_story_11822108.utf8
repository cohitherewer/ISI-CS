          NALIN VERMA                              
	Patna, Dec. 4: The Nitish Kumar government is mulling a new job scheme to recruit at least 3,000 educated women who know how to ride scooters.        
	They will be designated as anganwadi supervisors, who must have masters degree in social sciences.        
	The social welfare department has already formulated the rules and regulations for appointing 3,000 anganwadi supervisors and has sent it to the finance department.         
	The advertisement will be brought out soon after the finance departments approval, sources in the chief ministers office said.        
	The sources also revealed that one third of the posts would be filled by promoting the anganwadis, while fresh appointments would be made against three fourth of the positions.        
	Social welfare department principal secretary V.K. Verma said that the primary responsibility of the anganwadi supervisors would be to take care the work of 1.5 lakh anganwadis engaged in mid-day meal and other schemes for children across 80,000 anganwadi centres.        
	The venture of creating exclusive position for the women is in sequel to the governments priority to encourage more women in governance. The first thing Nitish did soon after landing in the saddle was to reserve 50 per cent seats for women in panchayat and other local administrative bodies.        
	Then, stepping up its campaign to take out women from the kitchen to workplace, the government went on to appointing over 3,000 women in constabulary.         
	Today, one can see women constables manning most of the traffic intersections in Patna and other towns  something virtually out of imagination before 2005 even as the state was ruled under a woman chief minister.        
	The government has already given bicycles to school-going girls. Poor Muslim women are also being given vocational training and equipment to open their business under the Hunar programme that the government started last year.        
	Earlier, the child development project officers (CDPOs), comprising male officials primarily, had been supervising work of the anganwadis. Now, the specially trained master-degree holder women in social sciences will do the job.         
	The sources added that the new recruits would initially be paid Rs 10,000 per month. But the salary would finally be fixed after the finance department approves the social welfare departments proposal, the sources maintained.

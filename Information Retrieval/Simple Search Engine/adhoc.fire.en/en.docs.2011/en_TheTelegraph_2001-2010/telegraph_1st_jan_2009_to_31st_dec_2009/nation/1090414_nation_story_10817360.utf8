                                                                                                               Maoist poll diktat spurs high alert
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          CISF members stand before the Nalco factory in Damanjodi on Monday. (PTI)                                  
	Bhubaneswar, April 13: Security was beefed up in and around Naxalite-hit zones in southern Orissa following yesterday nights attack on Nalco bauxite mines at Damanjodi in Koraput district.        
	The measures were taken especially keeping in mind the poll boycott and bandh call given by the rebels in Malkangiri today.         
	Talking to The Telegraph, inspector-general (law and order) Arun Sarangi said 13 companies of CRPF and Border Security Force (BSF) have been deployed in the worst-hit Malkangiri, located on the Andhra Pradesh and Chhattisgarh border. Both the neighbouring states are also hit by the rebel problem.        
	The states director-general of police, M.M. Praharaj, said Andhra police were being contacted for further assistance in nabbing rebels responsible for last nights encounter.        
	Along with the BSF and CRPF jawans, 18 companies of central paramilitary forces have been deployed in the otherwise communally sensitive Kandhamal, which also faces Maoist threats. Previously, Maoist posters asking states voters to boycott the polls were found in Kotgarh, Subarnagiri, Raikia and G-Udayagiri areas.         
	In Gajapati and Koraput, five and four companies of CRPF and BSF personnel, respectively, have been deployed to counter rebel threat, while seven companies of central paramilitary forces have been deployed in Rayagada, said Sarangi.         
	Apart from the high deputation of forces, a high alert has been issued in Malkangiri, Koraput, Rayagada and other Maoist-hit districts, Sarangi added.         
	Security has been tightened after orders came in from the Election Commission following the murder of a candidate in Malkangiri last week. Somnath Madkami, a candidate of Samruddha Odisha in the poll fray for the Malkangiri Assembly seat, was hacked to death by a group of suspected Maoists for defying their boycott call.         
	Today, the red bandh to protest against the death of four Maoists in the police encounter was observed in most southern districts. Bus services between Malkangiri district headquarters and connecting towns such as Motu, Kalimela and Padia was disrupted as trees were felled to block roads. However, no incident of violence was reported during the bandh, said Malkangiri superintendent of police Satyabrata Bhoi.         
	In Rayagada, too, Maoists blocked roads by felling trees in protest against the Saturday arrest of three rebels from Chandrapur forest area. Those arrested reportedly have confessed that plots are being hatched to disrupt the polls during interrogation. On Saturday, a joint team of CRPF and Special Operation Group of Orissa police had busted the rebel camp in Chandrapur forest and recovered arms and posters and leaflets calling for poll boycott.        
	Meanwhile talking to the media today, the chairman-cum-managing director of Nalco, C.R. Pradhan, admitted that yesterdays attack was a setback to the companys security system, but was thankful that the nine tonnes of explosives were recovered.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sweat out and keep diabetes at bay
                                                                                                               Sweat out and keep diabetes at bay
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Oct. 30: Thirty minutes of moderate exercise five days a week and diet control is the best way to prevent or delay diabetes for up to 10 years, one of the largest and most rigorous prevention studies has suggested.         
	The study by US researchers has shown that prevention or delay of diabetes through either lifestyle changes or an inexpensive drug called metformin can work up to 10 years, but the cumulative incidence of diabetes was lower with lifestyle changes.        
	The researchers followed up 3,150 volunteers for a decade and found 23 per cent of those who pursued lifestyle changes, 19 per cent of those who took metformin, and 19 per cent with neither drug nor lifestyle changes had normal sugar levels.        
	The lifestyle changes delayed onset of diabetes by about four years, and metformin delayed it by two years, compared with the onset among people who did not take any preventive action, William Knowler at the diabetes epidemiology unit of the National Institutes of Health and his colleagues said. They reported their findings in medical journal Lancet yesterday.        
	The lifestyle changes were aimed at helping the participants achieve and maintain 7 per cent weight loss and at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per week. The volunteers on metformin received 850mg twice a day.         
	Intensive lifestyle intervention (change) remains the best bet for prevention of diabetes, said Anoop Misra, director of diabetes and metabolic diseases at New Delhis Fortis Hospital. He was not associated with the study but made the observations in a commentary on the research in the same journal.         
	The prevention study had already established the superior effect of lifestyle changes compared with metformin a few years ago. The significance now is its long-term follow-up. No other study has done this so far, Misra told The Telegraph.         
	He said the findings were relevant to India where experts estimated that about 40 million people already had diabetes and a large number might be susceptible to developing the disease because of diet and inappropriate lifestyles.         
	Indians are much more sedentary and, in general, do not pay much importance to what they eat. India is on the ascending limb of a diabetes epidemic  and both public health initiatives and individual actions are needed to reduce the risk.        
	Although people who took metformin had a statistically higher incidence of diabetes than those who merely altered lifestyles, the incidence was lower in the metformin group than in the group without any action.         
	But in his commentary, Misra wonders whether it is cost-effective to take metformin for a decade to delay diabetes by two years.

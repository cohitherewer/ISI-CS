          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 25: The Supreme Court has said even open universities such as Annamalai University cannot admit students into postgraduate courses if they do not have a basic three-year degree.        
	The judgment nullifies over 2.5 lakh masters degrees granted by the university in Tamil Nadu before May 5, 2004, and recognised post-facto by the UGC in 2004.        
	The court frowned upon such post-facto recognition in what bodes ill for all such degrees granted by other open universities.        
	Formal universities had been prevented in 1989 from granting masters degrees if students had not completed a three-year degree course.         
	Open universities continued doing so till 2004.        
	Now the Supreme Court has thrown its weight behind the UGCs 2004 cut-off for open varsities.        
	The court was ruling on an appeal filed by N. Ramesh, whose candidature for the post of principal of the Film and Television Institute, Tamil Nadu, was not considered.        
	Madras High Court had declared him ineligible on the ground that he had acquired the MA degree from Annamalai without having a three-year degree.        
	The university as well as Ramesh had then approached the apex court, which dismissed the appeals today.        
	By doing so, the court has held that the UGC has the jurisdiction to lay down the minimum standard, regulations framed by it are binding on all universities and, thus, it would not be correct to contend that the Open University Act shall prevail over such regulations.

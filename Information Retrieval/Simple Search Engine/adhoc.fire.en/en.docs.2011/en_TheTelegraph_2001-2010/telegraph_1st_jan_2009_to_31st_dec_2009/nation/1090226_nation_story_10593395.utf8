The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | JNU expels five, student mutiny looms
                                                                                                               JNU expels five, student mutiny looms
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, Feb. 25: Jawaharlal Nehru University today rusticated five students, including three top student union office-bearers, for allegedly blocking the sale of admission forms, sparking fears of an open mutiny against the administration.         
	The students were rusticated within hours of being handed showcause notices after they attempted to prevent the sale of a prospectus they claimed was too expensive.         
	We had no choice. No administration can allow students to stop the process of admissions, vice-chancellor B.B. Bhattacharya told The Telegraph.         
	The students said the move revealed the undemocratic nature of the JNU administration and claimed the university had made up its mind to rusticate them even before it issued them the notices. The notices, the rusticated students claimed, were issued to them at 3pm and they were asked to respond by 4pm. Bhattacharya said the students were given three hours to respond.         
	Either way, both students and administration sources accepted that never in the history of JNU had students been rusticated after being given so short a time to respond to showcause notices.         
	At 4pm, I submitted a reply on behalf of all of us, asking for one day to respond. One hour is too short a period. But the university decided to turn down our appeal, said Sandeep Singh, president of the JNU Students Union (JNUSU).         
	Sandeep, union vice-president Shephalika Shekhar and joint secretary Mobeen Alam have been rusticated along with two other students  Roshan Kishore and Renu Singh. While Sandeep has been rusticated for two years, the rest have been rusticated for one year each. Their period of rustication is based on whether they have committed the same offence earlier, Bhattacharya explained.         
	All major student groups on the campus  cutting across political affiliations  are scheduled to meet late tonight to chalk out a strategy of protest.         
	We may have differences but we will try and work out a common protest agenda, a senior SFI representative in JNU said. The JNUSU is at present controlled by CPI-backed AISA.         
	The students have been protesting over what they allege are the universitys plans to sell out the campus. The hike in cost of the prospectus, they allege, makes it hard for poor students to seek admission. The students have also opposed a move to loan out Parthasarthy Rock  an iconic landmark of the campus  for film shooting.         
	JNU authorities say the varsity needs extra resources to accommodate 54 per cent extra students because of OBC quotas. Bhattacharya said the cost of the prospectus had been hiked, but after taking into account the JNUSUs argument that it might hurt poor students.         
	The JNU administration late last week announced that it would provide the prospectus free to all aspirants below the poverty line. But the JNUSU has alleged that the prospectus fee waiver is an eye wash.

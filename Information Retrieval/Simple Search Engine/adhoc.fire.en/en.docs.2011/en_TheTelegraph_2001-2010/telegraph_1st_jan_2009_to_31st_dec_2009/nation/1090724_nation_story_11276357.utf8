          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 23: Crossing the Prime Ministers path can be risky, even for members of Mamata Banerjees brood.        
	Trinamul Congress MP Kalyan Banerjee was today forced to argue  in vain  with security officials who prevented him from entering Parliament because Manmohan Singh was expected to leave around that time.        
	Banerjee, who drives his own car, alleged that the security officials misbehaved with him even though he showed them his identity card, establishing his status as an MP.        
	I have no problem with waiting if I am asked to. But they misbehaved with me and were rude, Banerjee, MP from Serampore, said.        
	Security officials at Parliament confirmed the incident. Five security personnel have been taken off duty and police are examining whether Banerjee was mistreated.        
	Banerjee said he had been allowed to drive past the first barricade near the entrance to the Parliament complex but was stopped at the second barrier.

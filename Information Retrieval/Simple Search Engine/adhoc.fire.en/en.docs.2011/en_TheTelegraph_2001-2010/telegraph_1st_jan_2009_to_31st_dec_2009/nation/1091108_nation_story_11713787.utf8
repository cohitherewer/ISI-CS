          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Raipur, Nov. 7: A seven-year-old physically challenged boy was killed and his mother was looted allegedly after being chloroformed inside a running train between Raipur and Nagpur.        
	The woman, Rozy Aslam Gilani, 33, is a resident of Byron Bazaar of Raipur.         
	Yesterday afternoon, Rozy and her son, Arsh, boarded the AC (II-class) coach of 2102 Howrah-Kurla Gyaneshwari Superfast Express for Nagpur where Arsh was being treated.        
	Around 1pm after the train left Durg Arshs milk tooth chipped off and Rozy took her son to the restroom to clean him up.         
	Raipur GRP superintendent P.S. Bara told The Telegraph that the particular bathroom where the mother-son duo went was isolated and not connected with the next coach.        
	Two persons, a man and a woman, standing near the bathroom, pushed Rozy inside and tried to snatch her purse. When she raised alarm, the two covered Rozy and her sons noses with a chloroformed cloth.         
	After two hours, Rozy gained consciousness as the train approached Gondia station in Maharashtra. She called her husband, an electronic goods trader, on the cell phone, who alerted some of his kin at Gondia.         
	When the train chugged into the platform, people and railway police had gathered for Rozy and her still unconscious son. Arsh was rushed to the nearest hospital where doctors pronounced him death on admission.         
	An FIR was registered with Ramnagar police station in Gondia stating that the culprits decamped with Rozys purse, a gold chain and a ring. Bara said, a hunt has been launched.         
	Closed circuit televisions are installed both at Durg and Gondia and we are trying to scan the record to identify the culprits, he added.

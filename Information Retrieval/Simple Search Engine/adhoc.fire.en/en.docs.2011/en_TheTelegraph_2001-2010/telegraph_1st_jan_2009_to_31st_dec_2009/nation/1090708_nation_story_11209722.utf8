                                                                                                               Slowdown finger at rich nations
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 7: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today obliquely blamed developed economies for the financial slowdown being felt in countries like India and the adverse impact of climate change across the globe as he headed for Italy today to attend the G8 and G5 summit.         
	The global financial and economic slowdown that we are witnessing is particularly detrimental for the development objectives of developing countries such as India. This has not been a crisis of our making, but we have had to bear its consequences. The slowdown in the advanced economies has affected our exports, strengthened protectionist sentiments and impacted credit and capital flows, the Prime Minister said in his departure statement.

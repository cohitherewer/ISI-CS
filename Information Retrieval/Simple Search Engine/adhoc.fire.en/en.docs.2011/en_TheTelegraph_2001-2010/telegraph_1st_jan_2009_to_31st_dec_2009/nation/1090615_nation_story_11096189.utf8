The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cong fends ally demand for panel

	New Delhi, June 14: The Congress is in no hurry to yield to allies demand for a co-ordination committee even if that means the UPA partners airing contrary stands on touchy issues such as divestment, as happened last week.        
	In the Lok Sabha last Monday, Trinamul Congress MP Sudip Bandyopadhyay had opposed any divestment in profit-making PSUs and in the banking and insurance sectors. The same day, DMKs Kanimozhi opposed divestment in the Rajya Sabha.        
	Trinamul leaders now blame it on the absence of a UPA co-ordination committee. We are an independent party and have every right to voice our views in Parliament. But had there been a co-ordination committee as we have demanded, we may not have needed to make our opposition to divestment public, said a party MP known to be close to Mamata Banerjee.        
	The previous UPA government and the Left had drafted a common minimum programme (CMP) as the framework for government policies, and formed a UPA-Left co-ordination committee to discuss issues on which the allies had conflicting views.        
	Trinamul and the Nationalist Congress Party have demanded both the panel and a CMP this time too, but a much stronger Congress isnt interested.        
	The Congress election manifesto and the Presidents address (to Parliament on June 4) form our CMP, a cabinet minister said.        
	The lone concession the Congress is prepared to grant is creating a means for structured floor co-ordination in Parliament that was not evident in the just-ended session.        
	Sources said even this would come at the governments own pace. Right now the top priority is the budget, a source said.        
	One reason for the Congresss nonchalance towards allies restiveness is that it believes the BJP with its 116 MPs would back the governments reforms-oriented bills. Also, unlike the Left, the DMK and Trinamul do not have a problem with divestment in principle. There is no question of a blanket opposition to divestment, Trinamul minister of state for health Dinesh Trivedi clarified.        
	If divesting a PSU in the service sector brings in benefits to the employees, we will not oppose it. But if its ONGC, which is in the core sector and important to the countrys progress, we will have an issue. Even the President has said in her address that divestment will not go beyond 49 per cent and Bandyopadhyay was agreeing with her.        
	DMK sources said Kanimozhis statements should be read in the specific context of one PSU, the Neyveli Lignite Corporation, whose union the party has controlled for the past 30 years. In 2006, the DMK had nearly threatened to pull out of the UPA government when the Centre decided to offload 10 per cent of its shares.        
	Congress sources, therefore, dismissed the allies protests as their state-level political compulsion. Since spearheading the Nandigram-Singur land agitation, the Trinamul has been claiming to be the voice of the masses, accusing the Left of aiding industrialists.        
	The sources also ruled out the allies uniting to form a ginger group, perhaps led by Sharad Pawar. They said NCP chief was preoccupied with infighting --- nephew Ajit Pawar apparently resents the rise of Pawars daughter Supriya Sule.

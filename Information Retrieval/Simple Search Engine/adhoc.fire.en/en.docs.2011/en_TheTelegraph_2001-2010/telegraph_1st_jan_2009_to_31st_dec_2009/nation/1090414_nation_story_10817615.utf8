The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP chuckles at trio hitback
                                                                                                               BJP chuckles at trio hitback
          SANJAY K. JHA                              Singh, Advani: Another bout?				                                 
	New Delhi, April 13: The three-pronged attack by Manmohan Singh, Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi on L.K. Advani has delighted the BJP leadership, which sees this as a success for its main slogan: Strong leader, decisive government.        
	We are delighted to see that the central theme of this election is whether Manmohan Singh is weak or not. We would love it if it stays this way throughout the election, chief BJP strategist Arun Jaitley said today.        
	We were focusing on the weak leadership of the Congress and it is now clear our strategy has paid off. It is certainly not a happy situation for the government that the Prime Minister is claiming on a daily basis that he is not weak.        
	Although some in the party, especially the middle-rung leaders, found Singhs incisive remarks on Advani surprising and disconcerting, the spin doctors are happy about a situation that has brought Singhs leadership qualities into direct comparison with Advanis. They believe this is better than a comparison between Advani and Sonia or Rahul.        
	The more Sonia and Rahul come to the Prime Ministers rescue, the more his vulnerability is exposed, one Advani aide said.        
	Jaitley explained: Manmohan Singh has made three interventions so far and each has been Advani-centric. Instead of speaking about his governments achievements like the NREGA (the rural job scheme), farm loan waivers and economic growth, he is harping on our agenda. The PM seems to have developed a complex about Advani.        
	He refused to accept that Singhs probing questions on Advanis achievements and barbs at the terrorist-hostage trade-off in Kandahar would make much difference, saying this was not the first election after the IC 814 hijack.        
	Party spokesperson Sidharthnath Singh said: Advanis long track record is there for everybody to see. And about Kandahar, home minister P. Chidambaram has said it was a difficult decision and I dont know how I would have reacted in a similar situation.        
	Advani himself continues to beat the weak PM theme, saying it shows that the control of the UPA government is dynastic, not democratic. The BJP has pounced on Priyankas remark that Rahul would be Prime Minister one day.        
	This shows the mindset of the family and speaks volumes of the dynastic principles of the Congress. We should analyse what message such claims send out to the youth of India who believe in democracy, a BJP leader said.        
	On Advanis portal, new features have been added to attack the Prime Minister and the Nehru-Gandhis. One write-up argues the whole of the Congress is committed to serving the interests of one family.        
	The posts include a claim to have sent a complaint to the Election Commission with a list of 450 schemes and projects named after Nehru-Gandhi family members.

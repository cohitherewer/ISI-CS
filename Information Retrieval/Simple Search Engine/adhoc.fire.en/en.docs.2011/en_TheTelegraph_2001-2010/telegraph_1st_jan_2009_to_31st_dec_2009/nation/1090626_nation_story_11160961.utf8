The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Mamata to PM: Dont back CPM
                                                                                                               Mamata to PM: Dont back CPM
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 25: Mamata Banerjee today conveyed to the Prime Minister her unhappiness over the Centres participation in the Lalgarh operations.        
	I told him (the Prime Minister) not to side with the CPM, Mamata told reporters at her residence late this evening after returning from a meeting with Manmohan Singh.        
	Mamatas meeting with the Prime Minister was officially dubbed a budget-related call, but the Trinamul Congress chief confirmed that she also raised her partys concerns over the operation in Lalgarh.        
	Innocent people are being attacked in Lalgarh in the name of operations, Mamata said, adding that she came to know of the central ban on the CPI (Maoist) only from the media.        
	Mamata, a close aide said, is unhappy with the Centres decision to send the forces to Lalgarh at the request of the Left government without first consulting her.        
	She was informed of the decision to intervene in Lalgarh, but only after the decision was taken, almost as an afterthought, the aide claimed.

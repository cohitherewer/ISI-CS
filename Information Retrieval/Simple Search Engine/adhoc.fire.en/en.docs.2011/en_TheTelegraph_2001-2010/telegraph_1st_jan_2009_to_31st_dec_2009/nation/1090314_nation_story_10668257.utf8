      34 days to go
  * For first day of polls                              
	Hyderabad: Poll sparks have started flying in Andhra, so are text messages.          
	The Opposition Telugu Desams message, Save Andhra Pradesh, highlights the corruption in the ruling Congress. Vote for the TDP if you want to save your property and your childrens future, says one SMS.          
	The Congress and its chief minister Y.S.R. Reddy are hitting back. Messages are being sent in the name of YSR Foundation, floated by party workers for the SMS campaign. However, some of its messages could leave rivals with a bitter aftertaste. Dont believe in the khichidi alliance of the (Desam-led) Opposition, says one.           
	There is foul play, too. The Congress has filed a police complaint against a fake portal allegedly sending messages in the foundations name and promising money if they are forwarded.          
	 New Delhi: The glass ceiling in the Lok Sabha seems impregnable despite promises of a bigger role for women.          
	The presence of women in the lower House has ranged from a dismal 3.5 per cent to 9.02 per cent of its strength. The highest has been 49, in the 13th Lok Sabha (1999-2004). The lowest was 19, in the sixth Lok Sabha (1977-1979).          
	The picture isnt bright when it comes to the success rate, which often dictates how many women get tickets. In the last elections, Uttar Pradesh had 61 women contestants, but only seven won. In Bengal, only four out of 34 won. The figures were 3 out of 21 in Andhra, 1 out of 8 in Haryana and 3 out of 30 in Madhya Pradesh.          
	 Bhubaneswar: The CPI has said the Third Front wouldnt name any prime ministerial candidate despite ally BSPs keenness to project Mayavati leader for the top post.          
	The Third Front will not project anyone as its prime ministerial candidate during electioneering, CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan said here. His remarks came a day after the Left and some regional parties joined hands to launch the front as an alternative to the combines led by the Congress and BJP.          
	The CPI leader said the question of who would be Prime Minister would be looked at only after the elections. After launching the front in Karnataka with other leaders yesterday, senior Mayavati aide S.C. Mishra said the BSPs aim was to make her Prime Minister.

          SHEENA K.                              
	Raipur, April 26: Akshaya Tritiya will not be auspicious for hundreds of youths planning to tie the nuptial knot in the state under a government scheme.        
	For, the marriages were to be held under the state governments Mukyamantri Kanyadaan Scheme. And the Election Commission had stayed the ceremony as the election code of conduct is effective in the wake of the Lok Sabha elections.        
	Sources in the department of women and child welfare said that about 3,000 couples had planned to enter into wedlock on Akshaya Tritiya on Monday. But, their dreams to start the new life from the auspicious day remains shattered. The department was supposed to conduct the marriage ceremony at different places across the state.         
	The scheme, launched in 2005, enabled the marriage of girls living below poverty line at the expenses of the government.        
	The marrying couples were provided a financial assistance of Rs 4,000 besides giving clothes, utensils and silver ornaments worth Rs 1,000. The sources said that the department had invited applications from couples to solemnise the marriage on Akshaya Tritiya as it was anticipating that the code of conduct would be lifted in the state.        
	All the 11 Lok Sabha constituencies in the state went to the polls on April 16. Chief secretary P. Joy Oommen urged the poll panel to lift the ban so that the government can start development work. But the commission did not entertain the plea. The sources said that more than 3,000 couples were registered to get married tomorrow on Akshaya Tritiya.         
	But the programme has to be put on hold much to the disappointment of the couples. Since most of them are not in a position to afford, they are left with no option than to wait for the next date, the sources said.        
	The assistant director with the department, Sunil Sharma refused to talk on the subject, citing that the code of conduct was in effect in the state.         
	He, however, confirmed that the marriage ceremonies planned for Akshaya Tritiya under the government scheme had been postponed.

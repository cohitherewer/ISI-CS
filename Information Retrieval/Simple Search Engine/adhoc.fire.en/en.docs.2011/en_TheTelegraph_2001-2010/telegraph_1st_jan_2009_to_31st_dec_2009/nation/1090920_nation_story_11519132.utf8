The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Deb unsure of infotech giants response
                                                                                                               Deb unsure of infotech giants response
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 19: Bengal housing minister Gautam Deb appeared sceptical whether anything would emerge at this moment from the proposal to give 45 acres each to Infosys and Wipro.        
	Given the recession, I dont know whether Infosys and Wipro would accept the new deal we have offered them. Even if they do, Im not sure whether they would start construction now. The IT sector is facing a problem because of the meltdown.         
	He said TCS had taken land in Rajarhat two years ago but not even 10 bricks had been laid there.        
	The company is keen to set up its office in Rajarhat but recession stands in the way. Thats why they have probably deferred their construction plans, he said.        
	Deb said this was true of DLF, too, which has taken 25 acres from Hidco to set up infrastructure for an IT township. Even DLF is now on the back foot because of the global downturn, the minister said.        
	DLF has sought permission from us to convert a part of the proposed IT township for housing construction. I understand their problem but cant give this permission. My department is developing 10 lakh square feet in Rajarhat for creating an IT hub but I have been able to sell only 1 lakh square feet. Given all this, I dont know what Wipro or Infosys will do, Deb said.

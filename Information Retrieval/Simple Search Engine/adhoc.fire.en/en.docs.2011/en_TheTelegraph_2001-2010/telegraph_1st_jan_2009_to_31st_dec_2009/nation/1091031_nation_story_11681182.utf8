                                                                                                               Farm schools in rural Bihar
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, Oct. 30: Bihars hinterland will soon have green schools for farmers where they will be the students to state-level agriculture scientists.        
	The government planned this novel venture to augment the rabi yield after a drought-like situation affected kharif crop across the state this season. Agriculture commissioner K.C. Saha has instructed all district magistrates to begin the schools in their jurisdictions from next month. Any delay in setting up of the schools will defeat its purpose as the wheat sowing time lasts only between November 15 to December 15, he explained.        
	The schools are being opened under the Learning by doing programme and aim to achieve the escalated target of rabi production to compensate for the loss in the kharif.         
	Sources in the agriculture department said the government had already prepared a list of 25 farmers from each block.         
	Director of agriculture department R.K. Sohane said that state will have 1,078 such schools, each spread over 2.5 acres where practical classes will also be held. The ownership of the crops grown for the practical classes will stay with the landholders.         
	A staff at the agriculture department said that the schools would be set up at a cost of Rs 50,000, including expenditure on sitting mattresses, blackboards and chairs. The amount was sanctioned by the cabinet, he said.        
	It may be recalled here that the agriculture department had brought out a farmer consciousness chariot on October 1 and had subsequently organised agriculture development camps and agriculture fairs in all districts.         
	The schools are the next step for the administration, since chief minister Nitish Kumar declared 2009 as agriculture year to emphasise on growth.

                                                                                                               Nitish flood lessons for Buddha
  - How Bihar CMs relief measures turned public anger into votes        NALIN VERMA                                                
	Patna, June 6: If Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee wants to turn the calamity of Cyclone Aila into an opportunity before the 2011 Assembly polls, he need look no further than neighbouring Bihar for a lesson.        
	There, chief minister Nitish Kumar had turned the public anger after last Augusts Kosi floods into votes, his NDA candidates winning all five seats from the six flood-hit districts in the Lok Sabha elections.        
	The same people who had thrown stones at Janata Dal (United) ministers and MLAs in the first days after the floods now salute Nitish as Quintalia mukhyamantri. The reference is to the two quintals (200kg) of food grain he gave away free to each of the 8.43 lakh worst-hit families, some of whom were still to finish the stock when this correspondent visited the region during the poll campaign.        
	Yet Nitish had started as badly as Bhattacharjee. For the first eight days after the August 18 embankment breach in Nepal, the administration could reach little relief into the inundated districts of Madhepura, Supaul, Saharsa, Araria, Purnea and Katihar.        
	The estimated number of flood victims in the 993 marooned villages was 33.29 lakh compared to the 25 lakh affected by Aila in the Sunderbans. Water resources minister Bijendra Yadav  MLA from worst-hit Supaul  had his convoy stoned. District officials were attacked; some MLAs were roughed up.        
	But Nitish turned the tide by throwing the entire state machinery into short and long-term relief operations in three phases (see chart). This is how he mobilised his forces:        
	Nodal agency        
	After the 2007 Mithila floods, Nitish had created a disaster management department and appointed an honest and efficient IAS officer, R.K. Singh, as its secretary. Its personnel were trained in their job and some police contingents were attached to the department.        
	This department engaged all local government staff  from schoolteachers to panchayat employees and block clerks  in the relief operation.        
	These employees, self-help groups and local people started kitchens at all the 68 relief camps, ensuring the victims were served only cooked food. Camp inmates who helped prepare the meals were paid in cash under the daily wage regime.        
	At the initial stage, paperwork was shelved to reach the relief fast; only the quality was checked, officials say.        
	Other departments        
	Five other departments were drafted in. The health department ensured medicine and treatment reached the victims; the food and civil supplies department took care of milk and food-grain supply; the welfare department supplied clothes; and the water resources department oversaw drinking water supply and sanitation.        
	The population control department carried out the Herculean task of registering each affected family with full details about its members and their needs.        
	Core team        
	All six district magistrates were made accountable for the quality of the grains, milk and other food supplied to the camps by milk co-operative Comfed, other agencies and local Samaritans.        
	Nitish mobilised his party cadres to help the administration. He got five of his ministers to camp in the flood zone for a month and supervise the operations. He himself visited almost every camp thrice.        
	Funds        
	Nitish quickly released Rs 182.57 crore from the chief ministers relief fund for Phase I. By end-August, Rs 1,000 crore had been sent from the Prime Ministers fund after Manmohan Singh made a visit and declared the devastation a national calamity.        
	Bihars demand for Rs 14,000 crore to rebuild the devastated region is pending with the Centre.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Buddha skips Karat session for rest
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Buddha skips Karat session for rest
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                  Bhattacharjee, Karat                                
	Calcutta, Nov. 29: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee did not attend the morning session of the CPM state committee when Prakash Karat spoke, prompting some leaders to wonder if the chief minister stayed away to dissociate himself from any criticism of the Centre on the eve of a Delhi teams tour of violence-hit areas in Bengal.        
	But state party leaders close to Bhattacharjee said the chief minister skipped the first half because he was unwell and needed rest.        
	Those who felt otherwise interpreted the absence as a manifestation of the tension between the section favouring building bridges with the Congress to take on the Trinamul-Maoist nexus and opponents of such a rapprochement.        
	These leaders felt that though Karat had not opposed the visit of the central delegation  sources in Delhi said a home ministry team would reach Calcutta on Monday  the CPM general secretarys veiled criticism of the Centre on Saturday might have prompted Bhattacharjee to skip the morning session as he had to keep in mind his responsibilities as chief minister, too. Besides, the chief minister is banking on the home ministrys help in tackling the Maoists.        
	But leaders close to Bhattacharjee dismissed the speculation. Both (Bhattacharjee and Karat) were present at last nights secretariat meeting which thoroughly discussed the points Karat wanted to explain this morning. There was no such difference on the central team. It was division of labour. Since we have got the information that the home ministry is really sending a team, Left MPs would object to it tomorrow in Parliament, a CPM secretariat member said.        
	The secretariat met this evening, when Bhattacharjee was also present, and decided to raise the issue in Parliament tomorrow.        
	As it turned out, at the morning session of the state committee, Karat did speak of the Lefts continued opposition to the anti-people economic and pro-US foreign policies of the Centre. But party leaders who attended the meeting felt that Karats usual anti-Congress virulence was missing today.        
	A CPM statement said Karat asked the party to step up its campaign against the violence of the Trinamul-Congress alliance as well as Maoists.         
	Some CPM state committee members expressed exasperation with police and bureaucrats, complaining the officials were reluctant to protect cadres from Trinamul because of the winds of change in Bengal.        
	A section asked the leadership to either activate the administration or allow the party to organise its own resistance.        
	In his report on the outcome of the bypolls, state secretary Biman Bose admitted further erosion in the support base of the party as well as the Left Front, particularly among Scheduled Castes and Tribes and Muslims. He underscored a finding that the Oppositions victory margin in most seats had multiplied.        
	However, most participants saw room for a turnaround before the 2011 Assembly polls.

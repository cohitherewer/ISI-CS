          CITHARA PAUL                               
	New Delhi, Aug. 31: MPs and MLAs will now monitor development programmes in every district to ensure efficiency and check corruption, with even senior ministers like Pranab Mukherjee and Mamata Banerjee drafted in.        
	The Centre has asked all states to set up vigilance and monitoring committees at the state and district levels to watch over programmes such as the job guarantee scheme and rural housing, road and sanitation projects.        
	The Union rural development ministry has already chosen the chairpersons of the district-level committees and informed the states. In Bengal, they include Mamata, Pranab, Jaswant Singh, Basudev Acharya, Satabdi Ray, Sultan Ahmed, Sisir Adhikari, Dinesh Trivedi and Deepa Das Munshi.        
	The central ministry has not yet decided which MPs would be on the state-level panels, which would be headed by the individual states rural development minister.        
	Sent on August 28, the directive says the ministry may consider withholding funds from districts whose committees fail to hold regular meetings. Every financial year, any state or district-level committee must hold its first meeting by June 30.        
	A state-level committee will include four Lok Sabha members and one Rajya Sabha member chosen by the Centre, and five MLAs nominated by the state government, apart from officials.        
	A district-level committee will include the Lok Sabha members and MLAs from the district as well as panchayati raj representatives and officials.        
	The committees will watch over the allocation, release and utilisation of funds and keep track of the balance. They will ensure the schemes are run according to the guidelines and look into all complaints, including those of funds misuse or diversion, and recommend action.        
	In the case of the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, the committee will help select the projects and the beneficiaries, and make sure the full wages are paid without delay.        
	Among the other major programmes to be monitored are the Swarnjayanti Gram Swarozgar Yojana, Indira Awaas Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana, National Land Records Modernisation Programme and the Rural Sanitation Programme.        
	A district-level committee will have the senior-most Lok Sabha member from the district as its chairperson if there is no minister among its MPs. If there is more than one MP of equal seniority, the member who has the largest slice of the district under his or her parliamentary constituency will be chairperson.        
	All the other MPs would be designated co-chairpersons. Apart from the MPs and MLAs from the district, the zilla parishad chairman and the chairpersons of the districts panchayat samitis will be on the committee.        
	The committees, which are to co-ordinate with the Union rural development ministry and their state governments, existed earlier too but did not include MPs or MLAs. These earlier panels were dissolved after the UPA government returned to power in May.

	Cuttack, May 20: The AIDS time bomb may not have started ticking in Orissa, but for the state health department authorities, the HIV positive prevalence rate is already a cause for concern.        
	On an average, at least 10 HIV positive cases are detected across the state in a day, the screening of blood samples during the first quarter of this year revealed.         
	State health department reports said blood samples of 76,218 persons had been screened for the past three months and 910 HIV positive cases had been detected. Nearly 88 per cent of the HIV positive cases were in the age group of 15-39 and 64 per cent of them were men. Besides, 18 persons had died of AIDS during this period. The state has been conducting HIV diagnostic tests through over 120-odd integrated counselling and testing centres. HIV test kits had been provided to the 53 government blood banks operating in the state.        
	Tests had been conducted on 5,66,432 blood samples since 2002. While 1,063 of them were found to have the AIDS virus, 846 had died in the past seven years, a state health department official said. The disease had claimed 133 lives in the state in 2008 and 28 in 2007. Higher rates of incidence have been detected in Ganjam, Koraput, Rayagada, Phulbani, Nuapada, Sundargarh, Balasore and Kendrapada districts, which have a large concentration of migrant labourers. The migration of tribal community members to urban areas in search of work for livelihood and unsafe sex are apparent causes, the official said.         
	Poor access to basic health care facilities and low awareness aggravated the situation in these regions, he added.        
	Meanwhile, the state government  with support from the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO)  had come up with three anti-retroviral treatment centres at MKCG Medical College Hospital in Berhampur, VSS Medical College Hospital in Burla and SCB Medical College Hospital in Cuttack.        
	Anti- retroviral treatment involves drug therapy to HIV positive individuals after advanced immune-suppression.

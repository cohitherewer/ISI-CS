          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                      Breather                          
	New Delhi, July 7: The Centre has moved the Supreme Court against a high court order permitting civic authorities to pick up stray dogs that were a nuisance and kill them.        
	Bombay High Court had on December 19, 2008, permitted the Bombay Municipal Corporation to kill nuisance stray dogs.         
	Asserting the supremacy of its own laws over municipal and state laws in a federal structure, the Centre said the Bombay Municipal Corporation Act, 1888, could not override the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960.         
	Municipal or state laws cannot supersede central laws which prohibit culling of stray dogs except in certain situations, the animal welfare division of the environment and forests ministry said in its appeal.         
	The rules under the central act permit killing only when stray dogs are incurably ill, mortally wounded, rabid or perennially violent.         
	An apex court bench headed by Chief Justice of India K.G. Balakrishnan today issued notices to all parties involved on the Centres appeal.         
	The bench had on January 23, 2009, stayed the high court order on an appeal filed by several NGOs.         
	The NGOs  In Defence of Animals, the Mumbai-based Welfare of Stray Dogs and the Viniyog Parivar Trust  had cited the central rules to argue that indiscriminate killing of strays could not be allowed.         
	But the Centre itself had refrained from appealing the high court order till now.         
	The NGOs also argued that the high court order did not define nuisance, leaving civic authorities with a lot of discretion.         
	Only the dogs that are incurably ill, mortally wounded, rabid or perennially violent should be euthanised in a humane way after experts certify them so, they argued.         
	In 1994, the municipal corporation first decided to stop killing  it was found to be ineffective  and turned instead to sterilisation to check their population. The ban on their killing was reinforced by a high court order in 1999.         
	But in 2008, in another case Bombay High Court gave a nod to killing stray dogs.

      13 DAYS TO GO*              
	Avoid the press      
	New Delhi/Mumbai: The Election Commission has advised Union ministers to avoid press conferences as far as possible in view of the polls and follow the practice of issuing press releases.    
	The advice came on a day a Maharashtra police officer said the state intelligence wing and CID had been asked not to give regular briefings to the chief minister and the home minister till after the polls to prevent giving anyone unfair political advantage.    
	A letter from the poll panel to the cabinet secretary on Thursday said it had been the normal practice of Union ministers to address press conferences after cabinet meetings or when issues of public importance needed to be brought into public domain.    
	Now that the model code of conduct is in force in view of the elections to the Lok Sabha and (some) Assemblies, the commission would like to advise that such press conferences should be avoided, as far as possible, the panel said. Instead, the practice of issuing press releases may be resorted to, it added.    
	The directive came in the backdrop of a BJP complaint against Union home minister P. Chidambarams comments on Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi at a press conference.    
	The commission, however, said that where holding of a press conference becomes unavoidable in public interest, an appropriate official may preferably address the conference.    
	In Maharashtra, director-general (elections) S. Chakravarty, said the state CID and intelligence wing had been told to brief the chief secretary or additional chief secretary (home) until elections were over.    
	Translation    
	Kanpur: The elections have turned teachers into translators.    
	Nine teachers from eight colleges in this Uttar Pradesh city will every day translate reports of Hindi newspapers for poll observers not conversant with the language.     
	The district administration had asked for six teachers but we have appointed nine so that the work is not hampered if anybody is absent, district inspector of schools S.S. Singh said.    
	The poll panel has so far appointed six observers from Maharashtra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh for the city, which votes on April 30.    
	 quot;The translators will reach the election control room by 6:30am and would send the translated copies at the earliest, Singh said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Modi fascist but a role model, says Marxist MP
                                                                                                               Modi fascist but a role model, says Marxist MP
          JOHN MARY                       Kutty                          
	Thiruvananthapuram, Jan. 16: A Muslim CPM MP from Kerala has asked his party to follow Narendra Modis development model, almost borrowing words from industrialists championing the riot-tainted Gujarat chief minister.        
	A.P. Abdulla Kutty, replying to a CPM show-cause notice for his earlier praise of Modi at a Dubai conference, has reaffirmed that the BJP leader deserves full marks for his success in attracting investment.        
	However, the young, two-time MP from the Marxist citadel of Kannur has stressed that he considers Modi a fascist  a point he had made also in his Dubai speech.        
	Kuttys reply to the notice asks the CPM to separate Modis pro-development face from his communal politics, the MP told a news conference in Kannur today.        
	He cited how Stalin had recommended US efficiency for the USSR and how the late E.M.S. Namboodiripad had advocated unity across party lines for grass-root development.        
	On December 28, Kutty had told the India Media Forum in Dubai: Gujarat is Indias number-one investor-friendly state. Other states, including Kerala, should emulate the Gujarat model. Modi has been doing a commendable job in attracting investment. I am saying this while maintaining (that) Modi (is) a communal fascist.        
	Some of his words echoed those of Ratan Tata who this week held Modi up as a model chief minister, before fellow industrialists Anil Ambani and S.B. Mittal suggested the BJP strongman would be an ideal Prime Minister.        
	Gujarat BJP chief Purushottam Rupala said Kuttys remarks were heartening.        
	This should be an eye opener for the communist parties. This is a clear signal about (Modis) acceptability.        
	Kutty today said his Dubai comments were well-intentioned and added that development was the key issue, as shown in the recent Assembly poll results.        
	The CPM, however, has spied a chance to discipline a loose cannon it could not touch earlier for fear of angering Muslims. Kutty has often criticised the party for its reactionary support for bandhs and participated in religious functions.        
	The CPM reckons Kuttys pro-Modi comments were a misstep that would not have impressed Muslims.        
	Kutty is sure he will be denied a third poll ticket but believes his constituents support his thinking.        
	BJP clears air        
	The BJP today said Modi had expressed surprise at the media hype over industrialists pushing him for Prime Minister. Arun Jaitley said he had spoken to Modi, who wanted to know how the media could project L.K. Advanis biggest supporter as his competitor.        
	Asked why Modi had not himself spoken up, Jaitley said everybody need not react to every controversy. Modi stands behind Advani like a rock.

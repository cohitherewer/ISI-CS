          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Geelani                                  
	Srinagar, Feb. 3: Champions of girls education in Pakistans tribal areas have got unexpected support: from Syed Ali Shah Geelani, the hardline Islamist leader that Kashmiri militant groups such as the Lashkar-e-Toiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad see as a father figure.        
	Geelani has spoken out against the Pakistani Talibans ban on girls education, calling it un-Islamic.         
	The Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistans ban on girls education in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas and Swat Valley of Pakistan is depriving some 74,000 students of schooling. Around 150 schools have been set ablaze.        
	The Pakistan Taliban is led by Baitullah Masood.        
	Geelani has for long been fighting for Kashmirs accession to Pakistan and imposition of Shariat law here. He supports many Islamic causes across the world and has been an unequivocal supporter of militancy in the state. Most Kashmiri militant groups look up to him.        
	On girls education, however, Geelani has chosen to differ and declare the ban un-Islamic and unjustifiable. The situation evolving in Pakistans tribal areas and neighbourhood is frightening and disturbing, he said.         
	Preventing a man or a woman from pursuing education is against Islamic teachings and contrary to basic beliefs. Women have equal right to education, which is obligatory for both Muslim men and women, he said, accusing militants of being ignorant of Islamic values.        
	They should withdraw the diktat and stop torching the schools, the hardline leader said.         
	Geelani has urged the Pakistan government, clerics, politicians and the civil society to engage the extremist groups in dialogue.

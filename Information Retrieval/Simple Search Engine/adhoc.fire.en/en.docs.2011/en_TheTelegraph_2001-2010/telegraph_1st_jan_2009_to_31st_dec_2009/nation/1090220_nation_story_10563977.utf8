The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Jaya betrays love for Cong
                                                                                                               Jaya betrays love for Cong
          G.C. SHEKHAR                          Jayalalithaa                                  
	Chennai, Feb. 19: Jayalalithaa today sought to rebuild bridges with the Congress by urging the party to dump the DMK and recall the good relations it had enjoyed with her in the past.         
	But Congress leader Veerappa Moily declared that its alliance with the DMK was quite strong and there was no move at a rethink.        
	Jayalalithaa, whose ADMK was routed  the party didnt win a single seat  in the 2004 general election, invoked history to make her appeal to the Congress.         
	The Congress will only be dragged down by the DMK which is caught in a quicksand. Instead, the Congress should recall those days when it had enjoyed excellent rapport with the ADMK during the days of Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi, Jayalalithaa said while presiding over the wedding of 61 couples in connection with her 61st birthday.        
	From 1971 to 1991, the alliance comprising the Congress and one of the two Dravidian parties has swept the Lok Sabha polls in Tamil Nadu.         
	This changed for the first time in 1996, when the ADMK, partnering a divided Congress, drew a blank. The Congress fought the 1998 elections by itself and again could not open its account. In 1999, it went back to the ADMK alliance, which won 14 of the states 39 seats, the rest going to the DMK-BJP combine. In 2004, the roles were reversed with the DMK-Congress alliance sweeping the polls.        
	Jayalaithaa has already sealed an alliance with the Left. I would only urge the Congress to withdraw support to the DMK government in the state and dismiss its ministers from the Union government, she said.         
	ADMK leaders doubted if the Congress would respond positively, considering the rapport between Sonia Gandhi and DMKs M. Karunanidhi.

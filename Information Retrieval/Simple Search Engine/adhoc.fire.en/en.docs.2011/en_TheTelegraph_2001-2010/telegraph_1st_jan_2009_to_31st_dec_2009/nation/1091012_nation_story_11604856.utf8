  - Dilemma as Left govt enforces provisions party had opposed         BISWAJIT ROY                          Bhattacharjee with other CPM leaders at the politburo meeting in Delhi on Sunday. (PTI)                                        
	Calcutta, Oct. 11: The CPM politburo refrained from discussing the use of the controversial Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) in Bengal on a day Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee talked anti-Naxalite strategy with P. Chidambaram.        
	The CPM central leadership had opposed some of the laws stringent provisions when Parliament passed it last year, but Bengal has now enforced it against the Maoists and used it to arrest the rebel-backed Lalgarh tribal leader, Chhatradhar Mahato, and others.        
	With some Left Front allies resentful of the UAPAs use in Bengal, many had expected the CPM politburo to discuss it today.        
	Our agenda today was the finalisation of the document on the partys internal rectification campaign. No other issue was discussed. Neither Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee nor Biman Bose mentioned the Bengal situation, M.K. Pandhe, politburo member and president of party labour arm Citu, told The Telegraph.        
	Party sources, however, said both Bhattacharjee and Bose had discussed the state situation with CPM general secretary Prakash Karat on the sidelines of the politburo meeting.        
	Pandhe indicated the partys dilemma: I dont know the details of the actions taken by the state government. The party may have taken a certain position (on the act) but the state government functions under the Constitution, and central laws are applicable all over the country. Just like the Industrial Disputes Act, which we consider a black act but still go by it.        
	Left Front allies, however, accused the CPM of doublespeak. Sources cited an article by CPM politburo member and Rajya Sabha MP from Bengal, Sitaram Yechury, in party organ Peoples Democracy after the amended UAPA Act was passed following the November 2008 Mumbai attacks.        
	The December 21 article had criticised the Centres move to make significant amendments to the UAPA Act of 1967 and create a federal National Investigation Agency (NIA) by negating its own considerations which led to the repeal of (NDA-sponsored terror law) Pota in 2004.        
	Yechury felt the two bills should have been referred to a standing committee.         
	Yechury had cited three clauses of the amended UAPA that had the potential of being grossly misused. One was the doubling of the maximum period of detention without bail to 180 days. Yechury had mentioned that his party had proposed an amendment to delete this provision.        
	 Much is being said about the manner in which the USA has enacted tough anti-terror laws after 9/11. In the USA, no citizen can be kept under detention beyond two days without charges being framed, Yechury had written.        
	Its classic doublespeak  the state government is trying to detain Chhatradhar and others for longer periods without bail under the UAPA, an RSP leader said.        
	Yechury had also opposed clause 43E of the act, which puts the onus of proving innocence on the accused. (This) completely reverses the civilisationally accepted norm of jurisprudence: a person is innocent until he is proved to be guilty, the CPM leader had written. He had mentioned his party had sought an amendment to this too.        
	His third objection was to clause 43F(2), which provided for a three-year jail term for failure to furnish information or deliberately giving false information. The party wanted it left to the courts.        
	Some former and sitting Marxist MPs said the party didnt really push for the amendments in Parliament. We couldnt go further because xenophobic, ultra-nationalist sentiment was running high. It was just after the terror attacks in Mumbai, a former party MP said.        
	Backing for Delhi        
	Two politburo members, Yechury and Bengal CPM secretary Bose, told reporters in Delhi the CPM supported the Centres actions against the Maoists. They said no talks were possible if the rebels refused to give up violence and lay down arms.        
	The details of Bhattacharjees 40-minute meeting with the Union home minister were not known, but CPM sources said they discussed the strategy to be adopted against the Maoists in Bengal.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Opp. wants House dissolved, fresh polls
                                                                                                               Opp. wants House dissolved, fresh polls
          SUDHIR KUMAR MISHRA                                    
	Ranchi, Jan. 19: The Centres decision to finally act, left Jharkhands political formations ducking for cover: the Opposition, sensing an upper hand, went for the kill by seeking dissolution of the Assembly, while the ruling UPA still saw a ray of hope and promised to project another leader as chief minister soon to regain power.        
	And the man behind it all, former chief minister Shibu Soren, who plunged the state into a crisis when he lost the Tamar bypoll on January 8 and had been confined to a hospital bed ever since, had to leave Apollo Hospital today under personally trying circumstances: his younger brother, Shankar Soren (55) had died.        
	The imposition of Presidents rule failed to usher in a sense of immediate political stability. The Opposition BJP, the Left, regional parties and Independents said dissolution of the Assembly and fresh polls were the need of the hour.         
	Leader of the Opposition Arjun Munda described it as eyewash and a desperate bid by the UPA to grab power. By keeping the Assembly under suspended animation, the UPA is again preparing for another marriage of convenience. Horse-trading will gain momentum, the former chief minister said.        
	JVM(P) leader and the states first chief minister, Babulal Marandi, the Left, the Jharkhand Party and some Independents echoed his views.         
	Stephen Marandi blamed Sorens indecisiveness for the current impasse.         
	Jharkhand Party (A) chief Anosh Ekka, whose trusted lieutenant Raja Peter defeated Soren in Tamar, also wanted the Assembly dissolved.         
	The Congress and RJD, however, argued that the Centre had acted out of compulsion. We arent scared of fresh polls, but early dissolution of the Assembly is no solution either, claimed state Congress chief Pradip Kumar Balmuchu.         
	RJD chief Lalu Prasad told reporters in Delhi that the Centre had kept all options open and viable alternatives would be worked out soon.         
	He, however, discarded JMMs recommendation to make Champai Soren the next chief minister.         
	As for Soren, he was considering leaving hospital in view of the days developments, but was forced to take care of family matters arising out of bereavement. He will now go to his hometown of Gola tomorrow morning to attend his brothers funeral.         
	His brother expired. Now he is unlikely to go to Delhi for the next few days, said his press adviser Shafiq Ansari.         
	Earlier, soon after the Union cabinets decision was known, Governor Syed Sibtey Razi summoned chief secretary A.K. Basu and DGP V.D. Ram for discussions. He also held a meeting with senior officials to resolve the impasse at RIMS where junior doctors are on strike.

	Srinagar, May 30: Hundreds of Kashmiri protesters clashed with police today over the mysterious death of a young mother and her teenaged sister-in-law amid allegations that the two were raped before being murdered and dumped near a stream.        
	The demonstrators ransacked a hospital and thrashed its doctors after they said there were no marks of violence on the bodies. The police had to fire tear gas shells and use batons to disperse the stone-throwing mob.        
	Witnesses said thousands of demonstrators massed in Shopian, south Kashmir, chanting punish the killers.        
	Villagers said the two women had left for an orchard in a neighbouring village yesterday afternoon. When Neelofar, a 25-year-old mother of two, and Aaliya, 19, did not return even late at night, family members lodged a missing complaint.        
	Early today, the police found Neelofars body near a local stream. Some of her relatives immediately put the blame on her in-laws, saying she might have been murdered, police sources said. They fell silent after Aaliyas body was found some 200 metres away.        
	By then thousands had poured on to the streets and the bodies were taken to a local hospital for an autopsy. The doctors conducted the autopsy but did not find any physical mark, one police officer said.        
	This infuriated the mob, which thrashed the doctors and other staff. They were adamant that the two were raped before being murdered.        
	They were hale and hearty. There should be a thorough investigation, said Neelofars husband Shakeel Ahmad.        
	A police officer said doctors did a second autopsy after the villagers refused to bury the bodies.

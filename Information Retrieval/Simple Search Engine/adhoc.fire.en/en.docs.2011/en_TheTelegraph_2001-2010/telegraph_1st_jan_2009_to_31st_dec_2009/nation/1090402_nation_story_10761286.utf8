The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cash hitch for model schools 
                                                                                                               Cash hitch for model schools 
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, April 1: The Centre has aborted a plan to launch 750 model schools it was to exclusively fund, and is considering asking states to shoulder the financial burden of starting these schools.         
	The Planning Commission has rejected the human resource development ministry plan to start 500 new Kendriya Vidyalayas (KVs) and an equal number of Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas (JNVs) under a scheme to launch the model schools, citing funds shortage.         
	The central government is in a position to fund only 250 new KVs and no new JNVs  residential schools that are more expensive  top commission officials said.         
	Under the 11th five-year plan, the UPA promised 6,000 new model schools across the country, one in each block.         
	Of the 6,000 schools, 2,500 centrally funded schools loosely modelled on the KVs have been cleared by the Union cabinet. The HRD ministry has already asked states to send in proposals  state governments have to provide the land  for these schools, which are to come up in 2,500 blocks that are educationally most backward.         
	Another 2,500 schools are to be set up with a public-private partnership (PPP) mode of investment. These are currently stuck because the Planning Commission, the HRD ministry and industry representatives at the Confederation of Indian Industry are yet to agree on an ownership pattern.         
	The remaining 1,000 of the 6,000 promised schools were to be the most elite of the lot  500 KVs and 500 JNVs.         
	With the Planning Commission refusing to part with funds for any more than 250 KVs, the ministry has redrawn a blueprint that requires state governments to fund the remaining 750 schools.         
	The new blueprint is reflected in a note to the Expenditure Finance Committee (EFC) which needs to approve the plan before it can be presented to the cabinet. The Telegraph has access to the EFC note.         
	But merely shifting the financial burden onto the states is unlikely to resolve the problem of the shortage of funds that the project faces, Planning Commission officials said.         
	State governments too, like the Centre, are suffering from a shortage of funds because of the economic slowdown.         
	Critics of the proposal are calling the decision to shift burden onto the states a precursor to disaster. State governments are unable to fund their own projects. Where is the possibility that they can fund a centrally proposed project? a ministry official questioned.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 13: Environment minister Jairam Ramesh today said the Wildlife Protection Act would be amended to avoid prosecution delays, citing the poaching cases against Salman Khan and Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi without naming them.        
	We had two high-profile poaching cases  one involving a famous film star and the other one involving the former cricket captain of India, Ramesh said, adding that he was extremely dissatisfied with the pace of prosecution under the act.        
	Moreover, under provisions of the act, the penalties are laughable now, said Ramesh. The time has come for imposing stringent penalties, he added.

	Srinagar, May 20: The separatist Hurriyat Conference has revived its proposal of resolving the Kashmir tangle on the lines of the Northern Ireland model, reports our special correspondent.        
	The 1998 model, known as the Good Friday agreement, had proposed the right to self-determination for the people of Northern Ireland.        
	Moderate Hurriyat leader Mirwaiz Umer Farooq said the model could help achieve the aspirations of the people of Kashmir. The disputes can be resolved when the parties reach an acceptable agreement, like the one in Ireland.        
	The states National Conference government has demanded that the Centre resume talks with the Hurriyat.

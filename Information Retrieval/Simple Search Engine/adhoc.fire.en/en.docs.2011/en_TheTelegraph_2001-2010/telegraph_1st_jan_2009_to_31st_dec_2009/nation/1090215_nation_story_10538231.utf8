The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Letter asks judges to disclose assets
                                                                                                               Letter asks judges to disclose assets
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 14: Several citizens and activists have urged the judges of the Supreme Court and high courts to follow the standards set by the apex court for legislators and make public their assets.        
	The appeal, made through an open letter dated February 13, refers to the rationale the Supreme Court cited while setting the guidelines for elected representatives in two cases in 2002 and 2003 on the need to make public their assets.        
	Although all judges voluntarily disclose their assets in line with an informal code of conduct adopted in 1997, the Chief Justice of India has refused to part with the information under the Right to Information Act, 2005.        
	Since then, the apex court registrar has also challenged in Delhi High Court the central information commissioners order asking the chief justices office to reveal whether the judges were indeed disclosing their assets to him. It will be heard on February 27.         
	The apex court had held that the right to know about the assets and liabilities of candidates contesting elections was part of the fundamental right of citizens under Article 19(1)(a).        
	The open letter from the Campaign for Judicial Accountability and Reform said the same rationale should apply to public servants occupying crucial positions of authority.        
	With the RTI act now in place, the letter said, it was clear that all such disclosures to the government should be accessible to citizens.        
	Unfortunately, instead of complying with the orders of the highest statutory body on the right to information, the Supreme Court has chosen to challenge this in the high court, it said.

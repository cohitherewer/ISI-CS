The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Small growth in poll purse
                                                                                                               Small growth in poll purse
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 16: Votes are costly, elections not so much.        
	The interim budget, which earmarks Rs 1.3 lakh crore for pro-poor schemes, provides Rs 850 crore for the Lok Sabha elections. Just a 3.8 per cent rise over the Rs 818.38 crore allocated in 2004.        
	Since that doesnt cover even for inflation, it raises a question: was the government budgeting for an austere election in the middle of an economic downturn?        
	(One question no one will ask: Are the political parties planning austerity as well?)        
	The cost of organising polls, however, has fallen slightly in the 2000s after a 500-fold rise over three decades. The 1999 election bill was a record Rs 880 crore; only Rs 1.79 crore was spent in 1967.        
	If the ever-growing electorate, heavier security and fuel-run vehicles (replacing bullock carts at many places) kept bloating the bills, the electronic voting machines (EVMs) and photo identity cards added to the expenditure in the 90s.        
	Yet this decades lower costs would owe much to the EVMs making the lengthy, old-style counting process redundant, saving a fortune in ballot paper and manpower.        
	The interim budget also allocates Rs 291 crore for polls other than the Lok Sabha elections  a 15.2 per cent fall from the Rs 343.12 crore set aside in 2004. This sum, meant mainly for Lok Sabha bypolls and Rajya Sabha polls, includes Rs 43 crore set aside for voter identity cards. In 2004, the I-card component was Rs 100 crore.        
	A sum of Rs 21 crore has been earmarked for the Election Commission. No such provision was made in 2004.        
	According to commission sources, the law ministry handles the entire funds but spends them according to the poll panels proposals. In allocating funds, the finance ministry usually accepts the commissions recommendations.        
	States foot their entire Assembly poll bill, except for the Centre paying half the costs of the I-cards and poll rolls. In case of simultaneous polls, all expenses are shared equally.

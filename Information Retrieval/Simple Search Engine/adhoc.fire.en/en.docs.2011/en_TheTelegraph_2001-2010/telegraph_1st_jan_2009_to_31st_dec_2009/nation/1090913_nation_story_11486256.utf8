The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Scam hits mineral traders hard
                                                                                                               Scam hits mineral traders hard
  - Transit permits amp; trading licence renewals stopped          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Iron ore: Centre of controversy                                        
	Bhubaneswar, Sept. 12: The multi-crore illegal mining scam, unearthed in Keonjhar district recently, has hit mineral trading in Orissa.        
	Around 500 mineral traders and about 1 lakh workers are now sitting idle as the mining officials have stopped issuing transit permit and renewal of trading licences following the scam.        
	Since August, officers of the state mining department have all of a sudden stopped issuing transit permits and are not renewing trading licence though all statutory requirements have been fulfilled by all traders, the Orissa Mineral Traders Association president, P.K. Nayak, said today.        
	As several officials were involved in the mining scam  as many as five senior mining officials were arrested by the vigilance sleuths  they have stopped issuing transit permit and renewal of trading licence, apparently to cover up their gross irregularities and malpractice, he alleged.        
	Consequently, mineral trading has stopped all of a sudden. Huge stocks are now piling up at the mines because of non-removal of minerals. Unless these minerals are removed, the mines may have to stop production affecting livelihood of lakhs of workers and causing huge revenue loss to the state exchequer, he added.        
	Already more than 15,000 trucks transporting minerals are now lying idle, affecting the livelihood of more than 45,000 families dependent on transportation of minerals. Similarly, at least 1 lakh workers engaged in loading and unloading of trucks, besides 3,500 staff employed by the mineral traders have been rendered jobless, said the association leaders.        
	Several buyers from outside the state and importers are also putting pressure on the traders to deliver the contracted material as per their buying orders which cannot be fulfilled because of absence of the transit permits, they said. Clarifying that they have no role in the mining scam, the traders said they only buy and sell minerals with all government approvals and permits. Why then we be punished and harassed for no fault of us? they asked.        
	The association urged the state government to direct the mining department to renew trading licences and issue legal permits for transportation of minerals.        
	New PIL        
	A PIL has been filed in the Orissa High Court, challenging the ongoing state vigilance probe into the Rs 110-crore mining scam and sought to direct the CBI to inquire into it. The petition, filed by Bhubaneswar-based advocate Rini Rath yesterday, has questioned the action of the Naveen Patnaik government for ordering a vigilance investigation.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | RSS sounds minority warning on statehood demand
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      RSS sounds minority warning on statehood demand
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 26: The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh has given a communal twist to the demand for small states, claiming that Muslims see a higher possibility of domination if some of these are created.        
	Muslims see a great chance of domination in a new Harit Pradesh; they view it as a throwback to the Nizam days when they speak of Telangana. These have dangerous dimensions, warns an editorial in the latest edition of the Sanghs weekly journal, Organiser. The editorial is on the journals website; the issue will be published tomorrow.        
	The article rejects the adoption of religion and language as criteria for carving out new states  although religion has never been an official criterion for statehood.        
	Asked to react, Asaduddin Owaisi, Hyderabad MP and leader of the Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen, said: We have not publicly stated our position (on Telangana statehood).        
	However, sources said that in the Majliss internal discussions, a view had been expressed that the BJP could gain ground over time in a Telangana state where Muslims would make up 14 per cent of the population. In undivided Andhra Pradesh, they are 9.4 per cent.        
	The Hindutva mindset is very much prevalent in Telangana although the BJP might not be strong in the region at the moment, a source said.        
	Rashtriya Lok Dal leader and Harit Pradesh statehood spearhead Ajit Singh dismissed the Sanghs suggestion. (Mohan) Bhagwat (the Sangh chief) endorsed Harit Pradesh in a statement in Agra. In any case, we are not asking for it on the basis of caste or religion, he said.        
	Ironically, at a time the Sangh is trying to appropriate and run it, the BJP has been the only party, apart from the Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS), to have consistently supported statehood for Telangana.        
	The BJP has long supported the creation of smaller states and expresses pride that Uttarakhand (then Uttaranchal), Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand came into being without controversy during the NDAs tenure. The party now backs the demand for Gorkhaland following its alliance with the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha during the last Lok Sabha elections.        
	The Organiser editorial grudgingly endorses the idea of linguistic states. It says that although unimaginative to start with, the states evolved into a workable model over the years.        
	A certain level of emotive integration and development structure emerged over a period which brought both political stability and national integration. This is not the time to rake up fresh controversies. This is not the way other developed or developing countries manage their affairs, it adds.        
	The editorial uses economic and political arguments to discredit the case for small states. Its suggested solution is a strategy for seamless economic and emotional unity and not more states and more political loot at the expense of the taxpayer.        
	The editorial accuses Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi of fomenting the Telangana trouble. It was Sonia Gandhis midnight political harakiri in offering Telangana to the agitating TRS that has helped sprout such demands instantaneously from almost all parts of the country by little-known organisations.        
	About TRS president K. Chandrasekhar Rao, it says: Local politicians are prone to foment and support the demand as it helps their career advancement.        
	The editorial claims that Rahuls attempts at nurturing his political career in Uttar Pradesh by exploiting the backwardness of Bundelkhand and eastern Uttar Pradesh has provoked Mayavati to demand the states trifurcation.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Congress scouts for right nominees
                                                                                                               Congress scouts for right nominees
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, March 15: The Congress is facing difficulty finding suitable candidates for the Assembly elections from Barabati Cuttack and Choudwar Cuttack, the two new constituencies formed after delimitation.        
	The Congress had lost from the Cuttack Assembly seat in the past five elections. The end of the BJD-BJP alliance had triggered chances of wresting the seat in the event of a triangular fight. There have also been enough indications of the Congress fielding candidates keeping in mind their ability top win in the post-delimitation scenario.        
	The Congress is in a dilemma, as the partys Cuttack president, Suresh Mohapatra, is looking for a nomination from the Barabati Cuttack seat. Mohapatra had lost from Cuttack in 2004.        
	A section in the Orissa Pradesh Congress Committee, however, is apparently in favour of a new face. Among the names doing the rounds are youth leader Sanjay Behera and former Congress M.P and Orissa Cricket Association president Ranjib Biswal, whose Lok Sabha constituency Jagatsinghpur has been declared reserved for Scheduled Caste candidates.        
	Sanjay is the son of Asirbad Behera, the secretary of Orissa Olympic Association and Orissa Cricket Association. Biswal is the son of late Basant Biswal, a Congress stalwart during the J.B. Patnaik regime.        
	Another dilemma for the Congress is whether or not to select a Muslim candidate from Barabati Cuttack considering the high presence of minority voters there. The party has a limited choice among Muslims following the exit of Mustafiz Ahmed. Noted builder Mohammed Moqim is apparently lobbying hard for a ticket from the seat, something resented by local leaders, a senior Congress leader said.        
	As for Choudwar Cuttack, the Congress is in a fix as former minister Bijay Laxmi Sahu is left with no constituency with Sadar Cuttack seat declared reserved for Scheduled Caste candidates. Another party heavy weight and former minister Kanhu Charan Lenkas Assembly constituency Choudwar has been abolished and a major part of it included in Choudwar Cuttack constituency.        
	Sources in the Congress said there is a scramble for a party ticket from the newly carved constituency because of the reservation of Sadar Cuttack and abolition of Choudwar.

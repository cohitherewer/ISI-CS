	Patna, July 24: Hulas Pandey, a dreaded don-turned-legislator and brother of incarcerated gangster-cum-MLA, Sunil Pandey, was arrested on the Bihar legislature premises today soon after he took his oath.         
	Hulas, an absconder who has 24 cases of murder, dacoity and kidnapping to his name, became a member of the state legislative council after winning the recently concluded council polls. He is an Independent member.         
	Soon after he came out of the House, police took him in custody and produced him before the court concerned which remanded him to judicial custody.         
	Hulas is a named accused in the kidnapping of Patna-based neurosurgeon Ramesh Chandra in 2004 and for kidnapping a doctor from Muzaffarpur in north Bihar.         
	Ironically, often touted as the main shooter for brother Sunil Pandey, who has been in the prison for the past four years, entered the upper House believed to be a rendezvous of educated elite.         
	In fact, almost all the former gangsters who contested the Lok Sabha polls that was conducted in April and May, lost leading to the media to speculate that the people were now rejecting dons and criminals as politicians.        
	But, Hulass entry in the legislative council is apparently an indication to the fact that the dons turned politicians are still alive and thriving in the states political culture.

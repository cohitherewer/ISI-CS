	Raipur, Aug. 12: Maoist rebels have reportedly killed eight members of a family in the remote Koilibeda area of Kanker and later cremated the bodies in a move to dispose of the evidence.         
	The victims include a two-year-old girl.         
	Kanker police today received a complaint from Ramain Vishwakarma, who walked more than 50km barefoot to reach the headquarters from his village in the interiors of Koilibeda, to lodge a complaint.         
	The incident reportedly took place on Tuesday afternoon. Director-general of police Vishwa Ranjan said a complaint had been filed.        
	The report stated that the Maoists intervened in a land dispute between two families and killed eight members of one family headed by the complainant, Ramain, Vishwa Ranjan told the media.         
	According to Kanker superintendent of police Ajay Yadav, Ramain said that the Maoists slaughtered his family and later cremated them at the village outskirts.        
	Yadav, however, said the police would officially confirm the incident only after visiting the spot. A police party has been sent, he said.        
	He added that it would take a day or two to confirm the incident.

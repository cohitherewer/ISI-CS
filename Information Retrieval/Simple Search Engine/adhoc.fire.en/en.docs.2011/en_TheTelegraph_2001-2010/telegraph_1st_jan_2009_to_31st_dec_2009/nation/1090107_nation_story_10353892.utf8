The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | NDA salvo on terror agency
                                                                                                               NDA salvo on terror agency
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 6: NDA chief ministers today accused the Centre of encroaching into states domain in setting up a National Investigative Agency with undue haste.        
	At least three heads of government sprung a turnaround at the chief ministers conclave today, having backed the Centres decision to set up such an agency after the Mumbai terror strikes.        
	Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi said the agency was contrary to our federal spirit and an attempt at sidetracking states in the fight against terror. Even though this... is contrary to our federal spirit, I wish the central government all success in its new role, he, however, added.        
	Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan said states should have been involved before the act was brought in Parliament. Claiming there were holes in the act, he urged the Centre to consult states and make changes.        
	Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar said there should be one comprehensive law to tackle terror, not many statutory provisions.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Petrol flak, govt unfazed
                                                                                                               Petrol flak, govt unfazed
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, July 2: The Congress-led government seems confident of riding out the protests from allies DMK and Trinamul Congress against the fuel price hike.        
	Congress sources who spoke to Murli Deora, the petroleum minister, quoted him as saying there would be no rollback in the near future, at least not until there was a significant decline in international crude oil prices.        
	The sources said they would back the government if it brought about reforms in the oil sector. The petroleum ministry is considering deregulating fuel prices, or allowing market-set rates.         
	International rates determine domestic prices. But each time the government goes for a hike, it faces flak because the decision is seen as being anti-people. If we let oil companies determine prices, we wont get the flak, a central minister said.        
	The Congress sources added that the nearest elections were in Maharashtra, in September-October. By then, there will be other issues to contend with and this one will be forgotten, a source said.        
	The source also cited the compulsions of the DMK and Trinamul. The DMK has to keep its government (which depends on Congress support) going in Chennai until 2011 (when Assembly polls are due). They will swallow their reservations on economic policies.        
	With Trinamul, the source spoke of an unstated understanding that allowed party leaders to make all the noise they needed to in Bengal  to answer the Left and pacify their followers  but not to block important policy decisions in Delhi.        
	They have a winner of an alliance with the Congress in Bengal. We hope and trust they will not do anything to rock the boat, not until the state elections (due in 2011) at least, the source said. Trinamul had indicated yesterday that Mamata Banerjee had been informed about the hike because it would impact her railway budget tomorrow.        
	 The Lok Sabha had to be adjourned today because of the fuel furore. In the Rajya Sabha, much of the Opposition walked out.

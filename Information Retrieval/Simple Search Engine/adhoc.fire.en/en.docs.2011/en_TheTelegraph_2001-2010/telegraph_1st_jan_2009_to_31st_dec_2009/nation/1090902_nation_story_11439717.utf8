The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Karat rules out need for Buddha deputy
                                                                                                               Karat rules out need for Buddha deputy
          JAYANTH JACOB                          Karat                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 1: Prakash Karat today denied any plans for a deputy chief minister in Bengal, scotching speculation that arose after illness forced Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to miss the last chief ministers meeting in Delhi.        
	In an exclusive interview with The Telegraph, the CPM general secretary also said Bengal was working out a fresh compensation package in case land had to be acquired for industry but ruled out large-scale acquisition.        
	Karat added that the September 5-6 politburo meeting in Delhi would discuss the rectification campaign that the party is finally ready to start. The drive meant to weed out cadres who bring the party a bad name was conceived in 1996 but was never carried out.        
	He said the buzz about a deputy chief minister in Bengal was only speculation, there is such no plan.        
	Such speculation arose because the Bengal government lacks an official number two, and Bhattacharjee had failed to send any minister to the August 17 chief ministers meeting on internal security.         
	Bengal was represented only by bureaucrats, who were not allowed to speak.        
	Karat responded at length when asked whether the industrialisation drive was being put on ice in Bengal after the drubbing the Left Front received in the last Lok Sabha elections.        
	We have to rework the land acquisition policy. There wont be any large-scale land acquisition for industry, he said, adding the state was working on a fresh rehabilitation and compensation package for acquiring land if absolutely necessary.        
	No projects are being started in the state because of resistance from the Opposition parties, Karat said. Land cannot be acquired for even a power plant.        
	Asked if the cumulative anti-incumbency of 32 years in Bengal was bothering the party, he said: Thats not an issue before this politburo meeting. We have already discussed the matter at length at the state committee. Now its about implementing the decisions we had arrived at (in the state committee).        
	Last months state committee meeting had witnessed demands for fresh faces in the Bengal ministry, and for improved mechanisms for delivery of government schemes and feedback from the grassroots.        
	The politburo will discuss the rectification campaign, Karat said. Then a draft will be placed before the central committee that meets in October.        
	The rectification campaign was promised in the political organisation report adopted at the party congress in Coimbatore last year. Many party workers in Bengal, the report had said, live in an atmosphere marked by self-centredness, greed, consumerism, jealously, etc.         
	The CPM blamed such traits on the philosophy of globalisation.

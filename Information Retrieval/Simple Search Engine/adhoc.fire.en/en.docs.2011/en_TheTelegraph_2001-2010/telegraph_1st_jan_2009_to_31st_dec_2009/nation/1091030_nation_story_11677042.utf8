          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          
	New Delhi, Oct. 29: A 12-city survey has suggested that the ban on smoking in public places is widely flouted in pubs and restaurants, but its simultaneous attempt to track indoor air pollution has encountered sharp criticism.        
	The survey, carried out over a six-month period by the Voluntary Health Association of India and 11 other non-government agencies, found people smoking in 127 out of 211 indoor public places.        
	At seven out of a set of 24 indoor public places where smoking was observed, the restaurant or pub employees actively assisted smoking by lighting cigarettes for customers, association officials said.         
	This clearly shows violations of the ban on public smoking, said a senior association official.        
	In nine cities, the proportion of sites where people were seen smoking exceeded 50 per cent.        
	But the associations attempt to measure and interpret indoor air pollution at these sites has drawn criticism for what one expert has described as a serious problem in the design of the study.        
	Using hand-held pollution detectors, the activists posed as customers in pubs and restaurants for 30 minutes to an hour, discretely measuring the levels of airborne particulate matter an indicator of pollution  less than 2.5 microns in size.        
	Particles of this size are small enough to be inhaled deep into the lungs, said Pramesh Chandra Bhatnagar, director of community health at the association.         
	The levels were significantly higher where people were observed smoking than in places where people were not observed smoking.         
	But a senior Central Pollution Control Board expert who was not associated with the survey said its design does not allow it to establish a connection between the levels of pollution observed and smoking.         
	The crucial thing to do is to pinpoint the source  through chemical fingerprints (of particulate matter), the board official said. There are methods to establish whether the source of the particulate matter is tobacco smoke.         
	Fine dust particles of this size remain suspended in the air over long periods of time, the official said. A number of other sources could contribute to fine particles indoors  dust from carpets or poor ventilation or air filters. Even open doors could draw the particulate matter indoors.        
	This was just a preliminary study  we plan to look into these aspects in the future, an association official said.

	Raipur, May 26: Civil rights activist Binayak Sen walked out of the Raipur central jail this evening, two years after he was booked under the Chhattisgarh Public Security Act for alleged links with Maoists.        
	Yesterday, the apex court granted bail to Sen, who was arrested on May 14, 2007.         
	Sources said Sen was released on a personal bond of Rs 100,000 as decided by a local court following an order from the Supreme Court. The copy of the apex courts order was presented in the trial court today.        
	As Sen walked out of the jail around 6pm, his family and human rights activists greeted him.         
	I am a human rights worker and will continue to stay so, Sen told reporters. I dont know why I was put in jail, but it feels good to be out, Sen said, adding that he was on bail and that his case was being heard.        
	The 59-year-old national vice-president of the Peoples Union for Civil Liberties said he would continue to fight for the restoration of peace in Chhattisgarh.         
	I have no separate message for Maoists and am against all kinds of violence, Sen said.         
	Peace must prevail and must replace war, he said, adding that violence by any party must be condemned.        
	Asserting that Maoist problem could not be solved by force, Sen said he would try to resolve the conflict through political engagements.         
	Sen demanded immediate end of alleged state government-backed civil militia movement, Salwa Judum, in the conflict zone where people have raised arms against the rebels.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, May 11: Koraput collector Bichitranand Das today held talks with a delegation of Chasi Mulia Sangh, a branch of CPI(Maoist), to resolve an ongoing strife between the administration and the Sangh that had led to a series of attacks on the regions people.        
	The Sangh has been on an attacking spree at Gadabaguda village under Narayanpatna police station area since last week.         
	About 200 members participated in the meeting, chaired by the collector and attended by senior officials including the tehsildar and the joint commissioner of settlement, said BDO B.M. Bhuyan.         
	At the meeting the Sangh members complained about tribal exploitation by non-tribals.         
	The discussion was fruitful and the matter will hopefully be amicably settled, said district collector Das, adding that no fresh incidents of violence was reported today.         
	On Saturday, Sangh members had killed a villager, Nityananda Melka, and went on a rampage ransacking houses. Ever since then, outfit members had been allegedly forcing the villagers to join the Sangh, spreading panic in the region.        
	Today, shops remained closed and roads wore a deserted look as locals preferred to stay indoors fearing for their lives.        
	Meanwhile, police continued to conduct flag marches.

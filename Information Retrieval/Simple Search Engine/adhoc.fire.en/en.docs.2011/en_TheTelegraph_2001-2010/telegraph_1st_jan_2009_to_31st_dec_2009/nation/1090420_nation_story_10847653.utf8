	Mumbai, April 19 (PTI): Maharashtra industries minister Narayan Ranes cousin, missing since Friday, was found dead today in Sindhudurg district, police said.        
	From the preliminary information we have received, it seems that the body found near Kankavli is that of Narayan Ranes cousin Ankush, director-general of police S.S. Virk said. A case of murder has been registered and further investigations are on, he added.        
	Rane had earlier blamed the Shiv Sena, the party he left for the Congress, for his cousins disappearance. The Sena denied the charge.        
	Ankush, a farmer, had gone missing on his way home from Kankavli market. Blood-stained articles belonging to him were found near his house.         
	The body was found with the face disfigured, Sindhudurg superintendent Ravindra Shisve said. Enough force had been deployed to ensure law and order.        
	Ranes son Nilesh is the candidate from the Ratnagiri-Sindhudurg Lok Sabha seat.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Air force opts for US plane
                                                                                                               Air force opts for US plane
          SUJAN DUTTA                              
	New Delhi, June 15: The Indian Air Force has chosen Boeings C-17Globemaster III for its strategic airlift capability, preferring the American aircraft over traditional supplier Russia.        
	The air forces choice is not the final word. The cabinet committee on security will have to decide on the proposal after the defence ministry has vetted it. But after air headquarters has made its choice clear, the decision cannot be overturned easily.         
	The IAFs current airlift capability is fulfilled by the Russian-origin IL-76 and the AN-32. The AN-32 (maximum all-up weight about 30 tonnes) is small, at the end of its service life and due for an upgrade. The IL-76 (maximum all-up weight nearly 200 tonnes) is much larger, but the Globemaster  it was displayed at the Bangalore air show in February  is bigger by about a third.        
	Last year, India contracted six Lockheed Martin-made C-130J Hercules transport aircraft in a government-to-government deal with the US. These are also used for special operations but are smaller than the Globemaster.         
	Air Chief Marshal Pradeep Vasant Naik is understood to be in favour of acquiring the 10 Globemasters too through the Pentagons foreign military sales programme in a government-to-government deal.        
	Boeings Globemaster is used by the US Air Force and by Nato in operations in Afghanistan and Iraq.        
	Boeing desperately needs orders to keep its plant in California for the airlifter running. But so does Russias military industrial complex that relies heavily on exports to India.         
	India contracted the six Lockheed-made C-130J Hercules for over $1 billion. The cost of the Globemaster deal is not known but it would be more than thrice that amount.         
	Air Chief Marshal Fali Homi Major, who retired last month, said the IAF had also expressed its preference for the Airbus Industries produced MRTT mid-air refueller over the Russian IL-78 tanker.         
	The Russians had expressed displeasure over this choice to a team from India, led by defence secretary Vijay Singh.         
	A decision on the refueller is yet to be taken by the government.         
	Defence ministry officials insist that military deals involving billions of dollars will be made on purely technical and commercial considerations. But with the companies bids backed by their respective governments, political and diplomatic considerations play a huge role.

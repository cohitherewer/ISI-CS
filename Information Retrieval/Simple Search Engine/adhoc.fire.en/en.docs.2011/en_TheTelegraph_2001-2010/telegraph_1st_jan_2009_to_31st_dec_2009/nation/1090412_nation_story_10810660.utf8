          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Akhil Dev                                  
	Chennai, April 11: A management student studying in Coimbatore was left with a damaged retina after five of his seniors allegedly banged his head against a wall during a ragging session last month.        
	P. Akhil Dev, a first-year student of PSG Arts and Science College in Coimbatore filed a police complaint yesterday saying he and his roommate Tony were physically assaulted by Ashwin, Ajmal, Arjun, Nihashil and Shamir on March 7 at a private hostel where they were staying.         
	They stripped me naked and forced me to lick their shoes. Two of them banged my head violently against a wall. Then they made me climb the stairs and pushed me down, Akhil, who met Coimbatore police commissioner M.K. Mahali yesterday, said.        
	My parents took me to an eye specialist in Kochi who said my retina was damaged in the impact of the blows. I had to undergo a laser surgery and require one more surgery to get back full vision, Akhil, studying a bachelor course in business management, said.         
	Akhils father, Sunil Parameswaran, told the commissioner that two days after the incident he had met the college principal. But the principal was totally non-committal and refused to file a police complaint, he said.         
	Akhil alleged that the five seniors had been harassing him since the last few months, often demanding money and assaulting him if he failed to pay.        
	An FIR has been registered against the five. Principal Sheela Ramachandran said they have been suspended.

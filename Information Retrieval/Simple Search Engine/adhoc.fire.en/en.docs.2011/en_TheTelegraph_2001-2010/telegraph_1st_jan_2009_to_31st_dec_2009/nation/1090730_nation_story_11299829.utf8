	New Delhi, July 29: A.K. Antony today told Parliament that negotiations were on with the Russian government which was demanding a substantially huge amount for aircraft carrier Admiral Gorshkov and the deal had not been finalised yet.        
	The defence minister clarified the governments position during a discussion in the Rajya Sabha on a question from the NCPs Y.P. Trivedi on indigenous manufacturing of aircraft-carrier vessels.        
	At the present stage, only negotiations are going on. Nothing has been decided finally, Antony said.

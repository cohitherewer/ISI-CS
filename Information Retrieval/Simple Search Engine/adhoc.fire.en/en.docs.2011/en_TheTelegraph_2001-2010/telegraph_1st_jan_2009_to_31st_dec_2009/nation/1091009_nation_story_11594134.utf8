The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Kabul blast finger at outside bases
                                                                                                               Kabul blast finger at outside bases
                              A damaged building at the site of the blast near the Indian embassy in Kabul on Thursday. (AP)                            
	Kabul, Oct. 8 (Agencies): A car bomb blew up outside the Indian embassy here today, killing two policemen and 15 other Afghans on the street in an attack Delhi said was aimed at its mission, a claim that is certain to direct suspicion at Pakistan.        
	The 8.27am blast comes 15 months after two Indian diplomats and 56 others died in a car bomb attack on the embassy, which India and US intelligence blamed on Pakistani spy agency ISI, pointing to its resentment at Indias growing influence in Afghanistan.        
	Foreign secretary Nirupama Rao said none of the embassy staff was among the 76 injured today, but three Indo-Tibetan Border Police guards were wounded and their watchtower damaged.        
	The suicide bomber came up to the outside perimeter wall of the embassy with a car loaded with explosives, obviously with the aim of targeting the embassy, Rao said in Delhi.        
	She said the blast was similar in size and pattern to the July 2008 attack but the security measures taken since then had worked effectively in protecting embassy staff.        
	The Afghan interior ministry is just down the street but if the embassy was the target, Pakistan is the obvious suspect although India didnt name the neighbour.        
	Only yesterday, however, Rao had linked the growing violence in Afghanistan with support from across the border. Asked who might be behind the attack, the Indian ambassador in Kabul, Jayant Prasad, said: What do you think of the fact that the international community is regularly targeted? Its the same answer.        
	The Afghan foreign ministry spokesman pointed to enemies of the relations between the two countries (India and Afghanistan) and said their bases are outside of Afghanistan. Sayed Abdul Ghafar, a senior Kabul police officer, bluntly said Pakistani militants were involved.        
	Islamabad as well as Pakistani militants are alarmed that India has given $1.2 billion in aid to Afghanistan, where its building highways and new consulates. Pakistan fears being squeezed between India on the east and a Delhi-backed Afghanistan in the west.        
	News agencies said a Taliban spokesman, Zabiullah Mujahed, had owned up to the blast, which happened when an SUV driver slowed down near a side wall of the embassy and detonated his payload, partially destroying the watchtower and an outer protective wall.        
	We are really heartbroken, ambassador Prasad said. He said the huge concrete wall put up around the embassy after last years attack had helped protect the building, but some doors and windows were still blown out. An armoured UN Landcruiser was damaged but its driver was unharmed.        
	Ahmad Farid, a shopkeeper who still bears an angry red scar on his face from last years bombing, said: Look at my face  this is from the last Indian embassy bombing and now here we have another explosion.        
	One of todays injured, Mohammad Arif, was leaving the embassy when the explosion hurled him against a concrete barrier, leaving him bloodied on the left side of his head.        
	Most of the dead were ordinary Afghans, many of them merchants. The bomb left a large crater in the road, and the scene was littered with burnt-out vehicles, body parts and scraps of clothing.        
	The heavily guarded area had only recently been reopened to traffic after being closed for months following the previous bombing.        
	The Swedish and Indonesian embassies too are nearby. An employee at the Indonesian embassy said that during the July 2008 bombing, his office window was shattered and glass cut his left arm. We are really not safe here next to the Indian embassy, he said.

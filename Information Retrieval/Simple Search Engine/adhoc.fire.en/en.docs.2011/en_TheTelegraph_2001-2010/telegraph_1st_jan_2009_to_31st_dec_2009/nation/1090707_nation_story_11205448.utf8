          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                              
	New Delhi, July 6: Call it a Lalgarh budget for police.        
	The Centre has announced an allocation of Rs 33,809 crore for police forces  a 33 per cent hike from last years revised estimate of Rs 25,439 crore  mainly to counter Left-wing extremism in eastern and central India.        
	One lakh housing units for CRPF personnel, risk allowance on a par with the army and over Rs 2,200 crore for securing international borders summed up the governments intent at a time police forces regained control of Lalgarh, the West Midnapore liberated zone, from the Maoists.        
	The budget also set aside Rs 100 crore solely to help Naxalite-affected states to raise critical infrastructure.        
	The allocation for training CRPF personnel has gone up by 50 per cent to Rs 208 crore.        
	Not bad, this had to happen, said a former secretary of RAW, Indias external intelligence agency, commenting on the increased allocation for police forces.        
	If Februarys interim budget more or less concentrated on hiking the allocation for defence in the wake of 26/11, internal security was the priority in budget 2009-10 after Lalgarh and Maoist strikes a few months ago during the elections.        
	Home minister P. Chidambarams recently released action plan for the first 100 days also concentrates on anti-Naxalite operations. The ministry, sources said, hopes to reap dividends over the next 10-odd months as infrastructure comes up and additional state and central forces are trained in anti-Naxalite operations.        
	In states, including Bengal, paramilitary forces have suffered from poor infrastructure. The housing units, sources said, are expected to boost morale and help performance.        
	Chidambaram hailed the budget as one prepared with great skill and wisdom though the former finance minister hardly commented on the allocation for his own ministry.        
	But sources said the budgets overall objective of inclusive growth, increased allocation for the flagship rural job-guarantee scheme NREGA and better housing for the rural poor would help the security forces in Naxalite-infested areas.

          JOHN MARY                              
	Thiruvananthapuram, July 19: Kerala CPM secretary Pinarayi Vijayan plans to approach the Supreme Court questioning the constitutional validity of governor R.S. Gavais sanction to prosecute him in the SNC Lavalin scam.        
	Gavai had ignored the state cabinets advice to approve Vijayans prosecution by the CBI, making him the first CPM politburo member to be staring at a corruption trial.        
	Sources close to Vijayan said a petition was likely to be filed in the apex court before September 24, when the state secretary has to appear before a special court in Kochi to receive the charge-sheet.        
	The chances of the Supreme Court entertaining (the) petition are just about five per cent because the grievance could have been taken to the high court. Normally, the apex court would advise petitioners to exhaust all other legal avenues before approaching it, said a lawyer close to Vijayan.        
	According to Vijayans counsel, however, this case is different because Gavai had examined two high court judgments  of a seven-judge bench in 1974 and a five-judge bench (in Madhya Pradesh) in 2004  before deciding to overrule the cabinet and sanction prosecution.        
	The seven-judge bench had held that the governor was bound by cabinet advice; the five-judge bench had ruled that in corruption cases, the governor could ignore cabinet advice against prosecution.        
	Vijayans line would be that since the seven-judge bench is the larger one, its verdict should prevail unless the apex court rules otherwise.        
	The petition is likely to be filed on behalf of Vijayan and not the CPM or the Kerala government. A state government questioning the governors action could lead to further legal tangles, and an adverse verdict in the apex court could hurt the CPM.        
	Vijayan is accused of conspiring to cheat the state by bypassing procedures while awarding a contract to Canadian company Lavalin when he was Kerala power minister in 1996-98.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          L.K. Advani in Orissa. Pix: Sanjib Mukherjee                                  
	Bhubaneswar, March 31: NDA prime ministerial candidate L.K. Advani today promised Orissas voters to retrieve black money, estimated at over Rs 25,000 lakh crore and reportedly deposited in Swiss banks, if the BJP-led alliance came back to power at the Centre.         
	Addressing campaign rallies in Orissa, Advani said the money would be invested in development projects. Beginning his campaign from Khariar, on the Orissa-Chhattisgarh border, the stalwart said the UPA government had set records in matters of inflation, corruption and poverty. We will provide a honest government, if the NDA comes to power, he said.         
	Incidentally, Advani had launched his India Shining campaign in Orissa from the same place in 2004. Slamming the Centre for its failure in handling the economic crisis, the veteran leader said poverty and unemployment were on the rise, while internal security was at risk with the UPA at the Centre. The politician also ruled out the possibility of a Left-led third front and said a bipolar system had emerged in the country, with alliances led by Congress and BJP.         
	Advani addressed two more rallies at Paikamal (Bargarh) and Sonepur, seats going to polls on April 16. He was scheduled to address a meeting later in Cuttack.

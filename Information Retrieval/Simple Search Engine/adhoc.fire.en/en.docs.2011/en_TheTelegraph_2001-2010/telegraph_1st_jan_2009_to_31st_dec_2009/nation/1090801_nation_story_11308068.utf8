          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 31: The Supreme Court today told the Centre to ensure that no temples, mosques, churches or gurdwaras were allowed to encroach on streets or any other public space.        
	Demolition of existing structures may create a law-and-order problem but the Centre should ensure that such structures do not come up in the future, a two-judge bench observed. Even if a single (religious) institution is put up on public space, the (civic) officer concerned should be suitably punished.        
	It asked the Centre to file an affidavit in four weeks listing the steps it had taken to ensure this, and posted the next hearing for September 29. The Centre agreed to try and build a consensus among state governments.

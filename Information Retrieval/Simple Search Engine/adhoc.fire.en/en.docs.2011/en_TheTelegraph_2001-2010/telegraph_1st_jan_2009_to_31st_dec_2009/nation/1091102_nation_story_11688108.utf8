	New Delhi, Nov. 1: A shift from a farm-based to a knowledge-based economy may narrow the gap between the rich and the poor, a study of wealth inheritance in societies scattered across three continents suggests.        
	The study, by an international research team, has shown that material possessions are more easily passed down the generations than other types of wealth such as skills or reproductive success or social networks.        
	The 26-member team examined intergenerational flow of wealth in 18 populations  from farmers in Bengal and Bangalore to livestock herders in Chad and Tanzania to hunters in Bolivia and Paraguay.        
	The researchers stretched the definition of wealth to cover not just material goods but other things perceived as needed for a good life  camels in Chad and house utensils in Tanzania, in-law networks in Bangalore and reproductive success in farming societies from Bengal and Sweden. Among hunter-gatherers in South America and Africa, bodyweight or grip strength counted as wealth.        
	The study, published on Friday in the journal Science, has validated an economic model that suggests high levels of wealth inheritance in society fuel inequality, but its flow down the generations depends on the type of the wealth.        
	The link between inheritance and inequality by itself isnt surprising.        
	When there is faithful transmission of material wealth, economic shocks tend to become less effective in redistributing wealth  and long-term inequality persists, said Monique Borgerhoff Mulder, professor of anthropology at the University of California, Davis, and a study team member.        
	But this is the first study to test the model that links transmissibility of wealth to economic inequality with data from a large range of populations around the world, Borgerhoff Mulder told The Telegraph.        
	The study found that children from the top 10 per cent of the wealthiest farming communities were 11 times likelier to be wealthy than children from the poorest 10 per cent. But among hunters, the children of the wealthiest have only a three-fold advantage in staying wealthy compared with the children of the poorest.        
	Agricultural land or bullocks and the like are readily transmitted from a parent to child and this perpetuates high levels of inequality, said Sam Bowles, a study co-author and an economist at the Santa Fe Institute.        
	In a knowledge-based economy, what counts as wealth is less easily passed on for the exclusive use of (ones own) children. Knowledge is passed on, but its hard for the children to own the knowledge the way they can own land, Bowles said.        
	Wealth measures such as the number of children or in-law networks appeared to flow weakly from parents to children among all the three populations studied in India Khasi farmers and communities in Bengal and Bangalore that mainly do farming.        
	This fits our overall finding that (non-material) wealth is weakly transmitted, Borgerhoff Mulder said. But the researchers caution that the emergence of a knowledge-based economy doesnt guarantee equality.        
	The type of wealth influences inequality. But whether the greater importance of knowledge together with the lower importance of material wealth will lead to a more egalitarian society would also depend on the institutions and norms in a society, Borgerhoff Mulder said in a statement issued through her university.

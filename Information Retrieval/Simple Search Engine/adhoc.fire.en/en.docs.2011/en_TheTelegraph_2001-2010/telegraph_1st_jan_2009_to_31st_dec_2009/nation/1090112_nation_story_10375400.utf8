                                                                                                               PIL against relief camp eviction
          OUR CORRESSPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Jan. 11: A PIL has been filed in Orissa High Court, seeking intervention against forced evacuation of Kandhamal clash victims from relief camps without adequate life protection measures, relief and compensation.        
	The PIL assumes significance in view of the strongly worded January 5 Supreme Court direction to the Orissa government to ensure protection for the minority community in the state, while hearing a petition filed by archbishop Raphael Cheenath.        
	Kesamati Pradhan, the wife of Baleswar Pradhan of Kajuri under Raikia police station of Kandhamal district, filed the PIL supported by affidavits of victims.         
	The 45-year-old woman has alleged that there are nearly 26,000 people at different relief camps in Kandhamal district. Many of the relief camps have been closed and the victims have been forced to leave those by handing a cheque of Rs 10,000, 50kg of rice and polythene against destruction of their homes.

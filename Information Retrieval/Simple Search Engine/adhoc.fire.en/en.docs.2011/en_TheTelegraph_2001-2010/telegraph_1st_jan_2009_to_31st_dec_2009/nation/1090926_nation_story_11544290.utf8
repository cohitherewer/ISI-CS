The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Tough talk on Aussie attacks
                                                                                                               Tough talk on Aussie attacks
          JAYANTH JACOB                                           Vayalar Ravi      
	New Delhi, Sept. 25: An Indian minister today shed some of the usual diplomatic niceties to tell a high-ranking Australian delegation that Delhi was running out of patience with the continuing attacks on Indians in Australia, officials present at the meeting said.        
	Overseas Indian affairs minister Vayalar Ravi met Victoria Premier John Brumby, minister for skill and workplace Jacinta Allan and Australian ambassador Peter Varghese on a day a drunken Australian football star beat up an Indian taxi driver in Melbourne.        
	According to sources, Ravi said India had so far agreed to see the attacks as stray law-and-order incidents and had kept bilateral ties foremost on its mind while reacting, but that position was now becoming untenable.        
	The minister stressed the racist angle and cited how the attacks were continuing despite Australian assurances about taking strong measures to stop them. He cited the recent attack on three Indians in a bar and said the level of racial bias and insensitivity was reflected in the fact that 90 people watched the incident without coming to the Indians aid.        
	Ravi also expressed displeasure at Australias support for China at a vote at the Asian Development Bank aimed at blocking a loan for a project in Arunachal Pradesh. He said Australias stand was not consistent with its friendly relations with India.        
	Ambassador Varghese intervened to say the Australian vote was not against India but an expression of support for the ADB management, the sources said.        
	Ravi then moved on to Australia hiking its aid to Pakistan  a move Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has announced in New York  citing that financial assistance given to Pakistan had been used against India.        
	The Australians clarified that the aid didnt involve supply of equipment and hardware but help with development projects.        
	While briefing the media, though, Ravi was composed and said Australia had proposed giving Indian students safe housing and transport.        
	Brumby asserted that Victoria was a safe place for Indians and added: We have toughened our laws related to the racial crimes. We will inform the Indian government on the follow-up of the crime investigations by Australian police.        
	Ravi said the recent attacks would not prevent Indians from investing in Australia. The people of India consider Australia a friendly nation, he said.        
	Brumby also met education minister Kapil Sibal who said that if the colleges of Indian students in Australia were closed because of quality concerns, they should be admitted to other good colleges. Three colleges in Australia were closed recently for poor standards and the axe looms on many more.

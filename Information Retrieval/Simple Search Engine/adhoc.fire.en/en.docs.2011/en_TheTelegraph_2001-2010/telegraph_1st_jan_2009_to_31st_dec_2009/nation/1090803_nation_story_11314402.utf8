The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Flu cases too few to alter fight plan
                                                                                                               Flu cases too few to alter fight plan
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Google employees wait outside a hospital for precautionary swine flu tests in Hyderabad. Google had closed one of its offices in the city for two days after an employee was diagnosed with the flu. File picture                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 2: The scale of the pandemic influenza infection in India is still too small to warrant changes in the existing strategies of testing suspect cases and treating every patient, experts have said after days of intense debate.         
	The number of persons found infected with the H1N1 virus climbed to 534 yesterday.         
	The virus has surfaced in at least 22 cities across the country and has spread among schoolchildren in Delhi and Pune, prompting some medics to call for new strategies.         
	Health officials say 534 cases in a nation of a billion-plus is too small for a strategy shift. Every patient who has tested positive for H1N1 in India so far has had either a history of foreign travel or a history of close contact with a previously infected person, an official said.         
	Health officials believe the discovery of a patient who has neither travel nor contact history  someone in whom the source of infection remains unknown  will be a key sign of community spread.         
	But some doctors are worried that the existing policy of testing only persons with flu symptoms who have had travel or contact history is likely to miss persons who pick up the H1N1 infection locally.         
	A group of doctors, public health experts and microbiologists gathered for a special meeting on Friday called by the health ministry to discuss how and when to tweak Indias flu strategy as the pandemic evolved in the country.         
	They debated whether India should abandon its current policy of testing all suspected cases and hospitalising and treating every case with the anti-viral oseltamivir and reserve treatment only for those who showed severe sickness.         
	Each laboratory confirmation of H1N1 costs about Rs 10,000, and not every patient requires drug treatment, an expert said. But for the moment, weve decided to continue with existing policy.         
	Health officials believe that Indias entry screening at airports and its policy of isolating and treating every case and close contacts has helped prevent rapid spread of the infection. This has given us time to stock up on anti-virals, prepare state and district level response teams and build up capacity in hospitals an expert said.         
	But at some point in time, we will need more intensive community surveillance to determine the extent of the spread of the virus, said Randeep Guleria, professor of medicine at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.         
	Some experts believe allowing the virus to circulate will help the population build natural herd immunity  a phenomenon through which a large population acquires immunity through exposure to the infectious agent.         
	But the medical community appears divided on the concept.         
	What if the virus mixes with other seasonal flu viruses, said Subhakar Kandi, a chest physician who has been managing H1N1 flu patients in Hyderabad. The flu season is just starting now.

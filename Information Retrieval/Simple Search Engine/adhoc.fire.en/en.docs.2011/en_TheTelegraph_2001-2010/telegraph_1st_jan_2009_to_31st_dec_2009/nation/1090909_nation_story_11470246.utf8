The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | No 5-star please, we are Congress
                                                                                                               No 5-star please, we are Congress
          SANJAY K. JHA                             Krishna, Tharoor                                 
	New Delhi, Sept. 8: An embarrassed Congress leadership today asked foreign minister S.M. Krishna and his deputy Shashi Tharoor to immediately move out of the five-star hotels they were staying in for three months after joining the Union cabinet as it violates the partys code of ethics.        
	The ministers obliged but defended their conduct by pointing out that they paid the bills on their own and had not burdened the public exchequer in any manner.        
	The Congress found the ministers stay in expensive hotels unpalatable as the party has been stressing austerity in the face of a drought threat, asking legislators to give up part of their salary. The Centre had also issued austerity directives to various departments yesterday.        
	Krishna, who was staying at Maurya Sheraton, has now moved to the Foreign Services Institutes (FSI) guesthouse. Tharoor, who was at the Taj, said in a Twitter post: I would be ashamed if I was spending the peoples money. But I am not, Im spending my own savings. It is a non-story. I wasnt spending taxpayers money or using any government privilege.        
	Although he had booked a room in Kerala House, he did not shift as he wont get privacy and gym there.        
	Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee directed the two to vacate the hotel suites and move into state bhavans.        
	Sources said Mukherjee took the step under Congress chief Sonia Gandhis instructions. While the party president was not willing to get directly involved, she used the services of the senior-most minister to send the message across.        
	The party too expressed its disapproval in no uncertain terms; spokesperson Manish Tiwari said the ministers should use their own rationale to decide if such behaviour hurt the partys image.        
	Some Congress leaders expressed shock at the ministers conduct. But the issue was sought to be blown out of proportion also because some Congress leaders are unhappy with the two ministers.        
	The ministers argument that they were paying their own bills did not pacify these Congress leaders. They said that ministers at least should understand the Congress culture and pointed to what Sonia had been saying ever since she became party president in 1998.        
	Sonia has not only been appealing to party leaders and ministers to strictly observe austerity, she also released in 2002 a code of ethics applicable to every party member.        
	At the Congress chief ministers conclave in Guwahati in 2002, Sonia said: Austerity begins at home. If we want society to make sacrifices today for a better tomorrow, we must ourselves take the lead and set an example for others to follow. In a country like ours, the kind of ostentatious display of wealth we see is unacceptable. So also is the tendency to arrogantly display the trappings of authority and power.        
	I must honestly admit that there is a lot of this in our system. We should collectively boycott such exhibitions. We must practise what we preach.        
	At the 2004 AICC session in Delhi, Sonia repeated what she described as a special concern and said: I had circulated a code of ethics and austerity. That code has largely remained on paper. This pains me. There is so much deprivation around us. Yet, so many of us talk of the poor while engaging in conspicuous consumption, ostentatious displays of wealth and outright wastage.        
	In 2005, she followed it up by writing letters to chief ministers on austerity and ethics.        
	At the Satyagraha centenary celebrations in 2007, she said: Even as we are inspired by Mahatma Gandhis life, let us today affirm our commitment to the Gandhian way, a commitment that is reflected in demonstrable actions and results. Let us ensure that this day does not get reduced to an annual ritual.        
	Recently, she announced austerity measures in the wake of drought-like conditions, asking every minister, MP and MLA to donate 20 per cent of their salaries. A few days ago, Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda was asked to shift his sons engagement ceremony from a five-star hotel to an MPs residence.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP issues Vajpayee appeal for Advani
                                                                                                               BJP issues Vajpayee appeal for Advani
          SANJAY K JHA                                               Advani, Vajpayee      
	New Delhi, April 15: The BJP today released an appeal from Atal Bihari Vajpayee to vote for L.K. Advani as Prime Minister.        
	Advani is a sensitive person and a distinguished leader whose best is yet to come. I believe his best accomplishments will come as a Prime Minister, the written appeal says.         
	The statement, in line with similar appeals issued before every Assembly election since Vajpayee became too ill to campaign, comes at a time Manmohan Singh and Sonia and Rahul Gandhi have repeatedly questioned Advanis contribution as home minister.         
	But Vajpayees appeal does not attempt to answer that question, choosing to speak of his potential rather than his achievement in government.         
	India today needs a leader like Advani. This election is a good opportunity to make him the Prime Minister, it says.        
	Advani was my closest and most talented companion. We worked together since 1952 both in Opposition and government. I hold him in high esteem because of his intelligence, clarity of thought and the capacity to take everybody along, the appeal adds.        
	Vajpayee is in poor health and has not made a public appearance in over two years.         
	His appeal does speak of Advanis contribution to politics. Advani is primarily responsible for the rise of the BJP. His spotless character and resolute personality is like a shining symbol of Indian politics. He accepts challenges and delivers. He is a committed soldier in the BJP fight against terror and is a thoughtful politician, it says.        
	After much prodding by reporters to list Advanis achievements, BJP spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad said: Advaniji has been a Rajya Sabha MP for 19 years, Lok Sabha MP for 21 years, BJP and Jan Sangh president for four terms, toured the entire country several times, and changed the political discourse of the country in terms of pseudo-secularism and true secularism.

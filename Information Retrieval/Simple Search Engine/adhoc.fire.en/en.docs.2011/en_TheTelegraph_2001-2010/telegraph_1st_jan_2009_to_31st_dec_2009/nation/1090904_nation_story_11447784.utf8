	New Delhi, Sept. 3 (PTI): The Supreme Court has said insurance must be paid for damage caused by a fire, even if the blaze lasts for a fraction of a second.        
	As long as there is a fire which caused the damage, the claim is maintainable, even if the fire is for a fraction of a second, the apex court said.

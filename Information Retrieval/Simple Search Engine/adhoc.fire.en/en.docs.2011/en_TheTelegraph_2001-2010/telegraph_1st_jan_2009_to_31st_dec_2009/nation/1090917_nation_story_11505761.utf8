The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Crew rescue plea
                                                                                                               Crew rescue plea
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Sept. 16: The daughter of a Ukrainian chief engineer, who went missing after a Mongolian cargo ship sank off Paradip coast last Wednesday, has sought the help of celebrated scuba diver Sabir Bux to locate her father.        
	Aleksandera Ilyushchenko sent a mail to Sabir, requesting him to look for Olexander Liosinko, who is feared trapped in the sea. The letter reads: I am the daughter of the missing chief engineer (Ukrainian national) of MV Black Rose. The coast guard and the ports rescue team took measures to save the crew  26 of the 27 members members on board were rescued. One crew member, who is my father, is still not found and I hope that he is still alive.        
	Sabir recently ran into trouble for allegedly trespassing into the prohibited area in the Paradip sea where he voluntarily reached to search for the missing engineer.        
	Annoyed Paradip port authorities had then registered a case against the underwater stunt master at the marine police station for venturing in the area without permission.                                
	However, Sabir seems unfazed by the FIR. I had been there to save a life and if they book me for that, I have no complaints. If saving a life is a sin, I will like to do it again and again, he said.        
	Sabir repeated that he was willing to be a part of the rescue operation once again as he believed that the missing chief engineer was alive and stuck inside the sunken ship. I was the first person to reach the deck of the sunken ship. The ship is submerged 60 per cent in the sea. The rest portion is above the water. Since the chief engineer was well acquainted with the ship, he might have accommodated himself in a safer portion. Thorough rescue operation can trace him, Sabir said.        
	I wish the government or any related organisation like the state human rights commission would grant me a permission to go for it, he said, adding that six days had already passed and the port authorities have failed to trace him.

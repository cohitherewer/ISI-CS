The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Smelling rift, BJP alters tune 
                                                                                                               Smelling rift, BJP alters tune 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 12: The BJP has responded with caution to the tussle between the RSS and L.K. Advani over control of the party.        
	No senior BJP leader chose to publicly contest the impression that the RSS was unhappy with Advanis continuance and wanted a new leader of Opposition.        
	The subdued response of the BJP was in sharp contrast to the carpet-bombing it is accustomed to.        
	The RSS had initially allowed the BJP to undertake an overhaul after the organisational election when a new president replacing Rajnath Singh is to be elected.        
	According to this schedule, Advani was supposed to pave the way for a new leader of Opposition before December.        
	After the Advani-RSS chief meeting, party leaders were signing a different tune on the chintan baithak, too, asserting that the causes of the Lok Sabha poll defeat would be probed.        
	One leader revealed that the first day of the three-day chintan baithak would be devoted entirely to post-mortem. Advani had said that the baithak would not discuss the election defeat.        
	Sources said the RSS intervention had made the Advani camps plan to maintain status quo far more difficult.        
	He is depending on his loyalists but the younger leaders in his camp may not run the risk of antagonising the RSS at a point when a deep sense of discontent is brewing among the cadres.

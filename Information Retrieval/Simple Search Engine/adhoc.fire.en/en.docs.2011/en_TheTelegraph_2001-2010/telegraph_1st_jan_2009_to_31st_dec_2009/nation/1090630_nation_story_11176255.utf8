	New Delhi, June 29: The Supreme Court today asked the Mayavati government in Uttar Pradesh to explain its statue-building spree at the cost of the exchequer, swatting away last-minute attempts by the state to block court action.         
	The state government claimed that the money used for building the statues was a small fraction of what was spent on development work. At least Rs 9,000 crore has been spent on development, state counsel and Mayavati aide S.C. Mishra said.         
	A PIL filed by two advocates, however, claimed the BSP chiefs indulgences cost Rs 5,000 crore.        
	Between 2007 and 2009, Mayavati has built 40 statues of Dalit icons, including that of Kanshi Ram and herself, and 60 marble elephants, her partys symbol.        
	The apex court did not buy Mishras argument on the development budget so he immediately changed tack and pointed to the Congress. What about the Teen Murti memorial? Even the land on which it is sitting is worth Rs 5,000 crore. Should it go for a memorial? And only one statue for Ambedkar is hurting? Mishra asked, trying to play the Dalit card.         
	Fine, let the court issue a notice. We will raise larger issues, he said, hinting that the state government might point fingers at other parties indulging in similar exercises of aggrandisement.        
	Teen Murti Bhavan, a Lutyens bungalow in the heart of Delhi, was former Prime Minister Indira Gandhis last residence and has been turned into a memorial to her.         
	Justice Dalveer Bhandari and Justice Asok Kumar Ganguly stuck to their line  the state government would have to address the issue of misuse of public money raised in the PIL  and slapped a notice telling the government to reply within four weeks.        
	Huge amounts of public money were used for this (erecting the statues), Justice Bhandari said and insisted that the state government must answer the charges.         
	The state government first tried to hide behind earlier court orders.        
	It said the matter was pending before Allahabad High Court that had prevented the state from erecting any permanent structure in parks. Another bench of the Supreme Court had later stayed that order.         
	The governments next argument was that the Assembly had cleared all the expenses. This is something that has been going on for the last two years. Nothing has sprung out of the blue, lead counsel Uday Lalit said.         
	Mishra said any court notice would end up in a media trial of the state government. For four days now, all TV channels have only been reporting this, he said.         
	At this, one of the judges asked sarcastically: Do you want an in-camera hearing of the PIL?         
	The Mayavati government has never come out with any statement on the cost of building statues and renovating parks meant to be memorials to Dalit icons. But a reply to a right-to-information plea filed last year said the statues of Mayavati and Kanshi Ram built near the Ambedkar Park cost Rs 6.68 crore. The 60 marble elephants at the Ambedkar memorial cost Rs 52 crore.        
	In Uttar Pradesh, news of the court notice was received with glee by Mayavatis opponents. Akhilesh Pratap Singh, chief spokesperson for the state Congress, said: Mayavati clearly diverted central funds meant for welfare projects to build statues and we want a probe into the case.         
	Samajwadi Party state secretary Akhilesh Yadav said: Our agitation against the statue politics of Mayavati has already started. We think the apex court notice was very timely.                    WITH INPUTS FROM TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Neglect cry in mother death 
                                                                                                               Neglect cry in mother death 
          ANANYA SENGUPTA                      Nitika                          
	New Delhi, May 23: A police complaint for negligence has been filed against a Delhi hospital following the death of a 30-year-old woman two days after a Caesarean delivery.        
	The family of Dr Nitika Manchanda says doctors at MAX Hospital, Pitampura, kept giving her painkillers and other medicines through the night of May 4-5 without diagnosing the reason for her abdominal pain. Later, allegedly, the hospitals ineptness delayed the delivery of blood from a blood bank.        
	The police complaint was lodged hours after Nitikas death on May 5, nine days before the Supreme Court ordered a Hyderabad hospital to pay Rs 1 crore  an Indian record  to a patient paralysed waist down after surgery.        
	Nitika, an assistant manager with BPO company Genpact, had a normal pregnancy and delivered her first child at 5.41am on May 3. Hospital records show normal post-operative evaluation.        
	She fed baby Aryan, comfortably making her way up the four floors to the nursery, a day after her operation. Around 10pm on May 4, she developed complications.        
	According to hospital records, Nitika complained of abdominal pain and severe backache. The nurse said it was muscular pain and a resident doctor prescribed painkillers. Nitika, who was a qualified homoeopath, kept insisting it didnt seem like muscular pain, Nitikas sister Deepika said.        
	She said she had trouble breathing. There were no senior doctors present, and through the night she was given painkillers and medicines to stop her vomiting. There was no effort to find out what the problem was.        
	Records available with The Telegraph show Nitika was given painkillers at 11pm, then at 2am by when she was shivering and vomiting repeatedly, and again at 6am. By then, Nitika had developed rashes all over her body, her eyes had turned blue, and she was complaining of abdominal tenderness (pain on touch).        
	At 7am, when the consulting gynaecologist who had operated on her was called, she sent a junior doctor who checked the stitches and dressed Nitikas wounds.        
	Her doctor, Alka Gupta, finally arrived around 7.45. By that time her blood pressure was falling and her vital signs were bad, Deepika said.        
	Hospital records show the doctor advised Nitika to be taken to the post-operative care unit at 7.45, but she was taken there 45 minutes later. By then Nitikas pulse reading was nil.        
	They told us she needed blood. The paperwork took half an hour and, because of lack of co-ordination between the hospital and the blood bank, I had to wait at the blood bank for an hour and a half. By the time I reached the hospital with the four units of blood needed, she was dead, Deepika said.        
	The preliminary post-mortem report  the autopsy was done at another hospital  said the cause of death was unknown. The final report, with viscera and blood analysis, is still awaited.        
	Sanjay Rai, director (administration) of MAX Healthcare, which runs the hospital, today said: We have commissioned an internal inquiry and are regularly in touch with the family. Its a medico-legal case and I cannot comment further.        
	He added: There will be complete transparency in our investigations. Since she had no prior medical history and had a healthy delivery, her death has perplexed us. We have a moral responsibility and will do a complete study.        
	Both the hospital and police are waiting for the final post-mortem report. The family has not moved a consumer court for compensation.        
	On October 30 last year, the Delhi State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission had ordered the hospital to pay Rs 1.5 lakh to Dhanesh Agrahari, 70, ruling that poor medical care had needlessly landed him in the intensive care unit.

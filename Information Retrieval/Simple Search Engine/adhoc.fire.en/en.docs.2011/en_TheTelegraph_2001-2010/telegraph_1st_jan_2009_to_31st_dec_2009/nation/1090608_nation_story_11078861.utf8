The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | A Berlin Wall falls, this time in America 
                                                                                                               A Berlin Wall falls, this time in America 
  - A bankrupt General Motors marks the end of a capitalist dream, little dynasties of automobile workers and destiny for generations as the spectre of half-a-million jobless Americans looms										      K.P. NAYAR IN DETROIT                      The American flag flies at the General Motors headquarters in Detroit                                
	I am witnessing the end of an era. This weeks bankruptcy of General Motors is to 21st century capitalism what the fall of the Berlin Wall was to communism in the 20th century.        
	Here in Americas automobile capital of Detroit and across the Detroit river in Canadas car capital of Windsor, thousands of little dynasties are dying because of last Mondays bankruptcy filing by General Motors, the earlier bankruptcy of Chrysler and the troubles of Ford.        
	For more than a century, in cities like Detroit and Windsor, a childs career was on course even before he or she was born into families of the hordes of workers employed by these three companies.        
	It was ordained that the child would complete school, get trained in some aspect of automobile manufacture and begin an apprenticeship in General Motors, Chrysler or Ford. Or take up an equally lucrative job in one of the scores of ancillaries that supplied the three automobile giants.        
	For generations, that was destiny.        
	Blue-collar parents who sought another career for their children  even if it was a white-collar job outside the automobile industry  were sneered at, sometimes viewed as heretics in a community which swore by the big three in car and truck manufacturing.        
	Workers here believed that it was stupid to look for jobs outside the automobile industry when General Motors, Chrysler and Ford were together putting on the road four out of five cars on the entire planet.        
	Of these, General Motors had the biggest share. Half of this total.        
	Logic was on the side of these little dynasties of automobile workers: in Windsor, the average wage of a skilled worker not only in the big three but also in ancillaries was anything between 30 and 40 Canadian dollars an hour. Yes, an hour.        
	In addition, they were fully covered by health insurance, probably the greatest blessing in the US, where sky-high health care costs have left more than 47 million people without any medical insurance. An even bigger number of Americans are under-insured.        
	There were generous schemes which enabled these workers to buy good homes with swimming pools and jacuzzis, boats to spend their off days on the river and take vacations in exotic locations.        
	Such homes, only a few minutes away from Fords global headquarters in the Detroit suburb of Dearborn, were testimony to the infallibility of the high priests of capitalism and the super power of American industry.        
	Employee pricing and other discounts on new cars meant that these workers changed their gleaming vehicles every three years or less for the latest models.        
	It was all possible if in a family of five, both the parents and one or two of the children were workers in one of the big three and the remainder in a plant that thrived on producing automobile components.        
	For decades, this was a way of life that was not confined merely to blue collar workers in the automobile industry here, except for a brief period in the 1980s when large-scale imports of Japanese cars rattled Detroit and Windsor.        
	City workers in Detroit and Windsor owed everything they had to the car and truck-making plants in their midst. So did restaurateurs, and in Windsors case, employees at its shiny casinos, which drew weekenders from Detroit, where American puritanism banned gambling.        
	But now everyone is set to lose, not just the little dynasties of automobile workers here and across the Detroit river. Neither President Barack Obama nor Canadas Prime Minister Stephen Harper has any privy purses on offer to these dynasties of automobile workers who had it good for so long.        
	The steady bleeding of the north American automobile industry in this decade has already cost Michigan a whopping three quarters of a million jobs.        
	What may shape Obamas legacy  in part  is that the bleeding is getting far worse. Where it took nine years to lose about 750,000 jobs, the fear is that more than half a million Americans may become unemployed in Michigan alone in 2009 and 2010 because of the bankruptcy of General Motors and Chrysler and troubles at Ford.        
	It is a story that is being repeated on a smaller scale in eight American states, where General Motors is closing 14 plants or warehouses and in 50 states where car dealerships are being terminated.        
	It has become a cliche here to say that Mondays bankruptcy filing by General Motors was the biggest industrial failure in American history. But that is not the only reason why it is the Berlin Wall of 21st century capitalism.        
	Even if General Motors and Chrysler survive bankruptcy protection for now and emerge in a leaner incarnation, they will also be meaner. Same with Ford, which is ailing, but in much better shape than the other two.        
	The good times are never going to come back.        
	For decades, the organised automobile workforce drew the political landscape of large areas of Canadas Ontario province. They had the strength of numbers.        
	In the US, General Motors alone employed 440,000 people in 1981. In all the company employed 850,000 people at the zenith of its success.        
	Even if the company survives, the plan is to have merely 38,000 workers in the US in another two years.        
	Before General Motors filed for bankruptcy protection, its US trade union, United Auto Workers, gave up the right to strike until 2015. The significance of this trade union sacrifice will not be lost on the managements of other big corporations in todays troubled times.        
	The end of the capitalist dream is at its worst for retirees in General Motors, Chrysler and Ford. They spent a lifetime in the footsteps of their parents working for these corporations in the belief that they had earned the comforts of retirement for the rest of their lives.        
	The unions have had to agree to big cuts in existing benefits for those who have retired, especially in health care when these people need those benefits more than ever in their old age.        
	But that is nothing compared to worries these retirees have that they now risk losing everything they have. Haunting them are images of pensioners in Moscow, Prague or Warsaw, transported to sudden poverty in the 1990s after the collapse of the Berlin Wall.

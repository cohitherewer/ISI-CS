          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                                                          (From top) Mulayam Singh Yadav, Kalyan Singh and Abu Asim Azmi      
	Lucknow, Nov. 14: Mulayam Singh Yadav has come up with a two-point formula to try and win back his partys Muslim vote base after the drubbing in the recent bypolls.        
	One, distance the Samajwadi Party from Kalyan Singh and two, project Maharashtra Samajwadi MLA Abu Asim Azmi as the partys Muslim face.        
	The Samajwadis, who lost six seats and won none in the byelections, today decided to accord Azmi a public felicitation here on November 16.        
	Azmi gained pan-Indian publicity this week after he was attacked in the Maharashtra Assembly by members of Raj Thackerays Maharashtra Navnirman Sena because he had taken the oath in Hindi. His stand goes well with the Samajwadis pro-Hindi stand, meant to woo heartland voters.        
	Besides, the Samajwadis urgently need a Muslim mascot to replace Azam Khan, who has been expelled over his differences with party general secretary Amar Singh.        
	Kalyan, with whom Mulayam had tied up recently to win the votes of his Lodh caste, however, has cost the party Muslim support.        
	Mulayam today dropped enough hints that he was distancing himself from the man who was the BJP chief minister of Uttar Pradesh when the Babri Masjid was demolished in 1992.        
	Why this fuss over Kalyan Singh? He is not a part of the Samajwadi Party. He himself says he is not part of any party, Mulayam told reporters.        
	Senior party leaders who met today debated the wisdom of asking Kalyan to campaign in Muslim-dominated Firozabad just because the Lok Sabha constituency has a sizeable Lodh population. They said this had alienated the Muslims. Congress candidate Raj Babbar won the byelection from the seat, defeating Mulayams daughter-in-law Dimple by over 85,000 votes.        
	Mulayam hopes that hoisting Azmi can undo the damage.        
	Azmi upheld the prestige of the national language in the anti-Hindi environment prevailing in Maharashtra, a resolution taken at todays party meeting said.        
	During the general election, Azmi had campaigned in Rampur and ensured the victory of Samajwadi candidate Jaya Prada despite opposition from Azam Khan in a constituency where he wielded a lot of clout.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cong shifts focus in poll panel spat
                                                                                                               Cong shifts focus in poll panel spat
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              Gopalaswami (top) and Sibal. (Ramakant Kushwaha)				                                 
	New Delhi, Feb. 3: The Congress has insulated chief election commissioner N. Gopalaswami from the discourse on the CEC-election commissioner face-off and attacked the BJP for undermining constitutional offices and vitiating the pre-poll ambience.        
	Kapil Sibal, the science and technology minister and a senior lawyer, was fielded to signal the nuanced change in the partys line.        
	Addressing the media, Sibal, who was in Davos when the controversy broke, said the BJP had a history of attacking institutions, especially if it perceived them as being hostile. (J.M.) Lyngdoh (a former CEC), J.S. Verma (the former NHRC chairperson) were not spared by the BJP during and after the Gujarat communal violence Sibal said.        
	The BJP will attack the court if the judgment is not in its favour. We do not wish to speak on any constitutional authority, it is not good for democracy. With elections round the corner, it is improper to attack any authority, especially when it is about to preside over the national polls.        
	Sibal urged political parties to take a mature and long-term view of institutions and not sully the democratic process.        
	Yesterday, law minister H.R. Bharadwaj said the CEC had exposed himself to humiliation in old age by politicising the Election Commission and interpreting the Constitution differently.         
	He claimed the government was privy to details on how Gopalaswami ran the commission and conducted the delimitation exercise.         
	The minister hinted at the CECs purported closeness to the BJP and L.K. Advani.        
	Congress spokesperson Manish Tewari claimed there was a congruence of actions between the BJP and the CEC.        
	Congress sources said the jibes  whatever be the merits in them  did not go down well with the leaders because the party and the government could be accused as much as the BJP of partisanship while dealing with a constitutional office.        
	Second, Bharadwajs defence of Chawla could reinforce the BJPs allegation of his proximity to the Congress brass and compromise his credentials even before he became the CEC.        
	Sibal explained the government/Congresss position on the Gopalaswami-Chawla spat and said the CEC could recommend an election commissioners removal if and only his views were sought by the government.

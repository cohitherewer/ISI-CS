	Vienna, March 3 (Reuters): A UN watchdog has approved a deal allowing extra inspections of Indias atomic industry, a condition of a US deal allowing New Delhi to import nuclear techno-logy after a 33-year freeze.          
	The 31-page Additional Protocol would broadly give International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors more information on Indias nuclear-related exports, imports and source material. Some members of the 35-nation IAEA board joined the consensus vote only with reluctance, sources said.           
	Sceptics felt the safeguards could have been stronger had there been more time for negotiations. Switzerland, Ireland, Cuba and South Africa protested that the agreement was handed to the board only two days ago, too late to thoroughly assess whether it will really contribute to disarmament, a diplomat said. It doesnt because there are no provisions to ensure India cannot divert into its military nuclear sector nuclear materials and know-how it obtains abroad for the civilian sector.          
	The protocol will give inspectors wider access to Indias programme but not as much as in countries that have signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty.                  
	New Delhi (PTI): India will approach the US armed with an interim injunction by Delhi High Court to prevent Mahatma Gan-dhis personal belongings from going under the hammer. The external affairs ministry is going to take up the issue with the US to stall the auction at Antiquorum Auctioneers in New York, tourism minister Ambika Soni said. India will argue that the ownership of the items  among them the Mahatmas spectacles and a pocket watch  are in dispute.                  
	Mumbai (PTI): Mum- bai police have arrested a 40-year-old assistant vice-president of a Pune-based multinational firm for allegedly trying to rape a doctor after they became friends through a matrimonial website. Sameer Pareeja, a married man living in Bangalore and earning Rs 17.5 lakh a year, was said to have lured the 35-year-old woman by giving false information about himself.                  
	New Delhi (PTI): A surgeon who carried out heart-valve implants even on dead patients has been sentenced to five years rigorous imprisonment for defrauding people into buying substandard valves at exorbitant rates. A CBI court also slapped a fine of Rs 1.4 lakh on R.S. Dhaliwal, a former surgeon of the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh.                  
	Kochi (PTI): Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee attacked his former party, the CPM, on Tuesday, saying it had reduced itself to a non-actor in national politics after withdrawing support to the Congress-led coalition at the Centre. The step was a big blunder, he said. It (the CPM) has failed to feel the pulse of the people and is quickly losing mass base.

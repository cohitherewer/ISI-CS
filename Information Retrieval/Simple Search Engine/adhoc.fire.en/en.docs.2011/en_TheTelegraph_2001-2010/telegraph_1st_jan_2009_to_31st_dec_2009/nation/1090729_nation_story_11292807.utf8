          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, July 28: The government today suspended two Mayurbhanj mining officials and ordered a vigilance probe into illegal mining activities in Kasiabeda mines, even as the BJP staged a dharna in front of Raj Bhavan pressing for a CBI probe into the mining scam in Keonjhar.        
	Steel and mines minister Raghunath Mohanty told reporters that Baripada deputy director of mines Lalmohan Soren and senior inspector of mines P.C. Sahu were placed under suspension for furnishing false facts. Chief minister Naveen Patnaik has referred the case to the vigilance department, said Mohanty.        
	Action against the two was taken on the basis of findings of a joint inquiry by the joint secretary of steel and mines department and chief vigilance officer.        
	The inquiry was made following a order made by former Bahalda MLA Prahlad Purty. Earlier, raising the issue in the Assembly during zero hour, BJP leader K.V. Singhdeo reiterated the partys demand for CBI probe into the alleged mining in Keonjhar.

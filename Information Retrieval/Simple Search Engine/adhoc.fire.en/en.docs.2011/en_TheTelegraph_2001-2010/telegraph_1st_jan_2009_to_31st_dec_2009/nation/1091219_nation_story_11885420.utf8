	What do you put on the dinner table when your monarch is hosting world leaders for a summit on climate change? You make sure the meal is low carb... er, as in low-carbon. Key ingredients for a royal banquet hosted on Thursday by Queen Margrethe II placed the emphasis on locally sourced products rather than exotic materials.  
	The menu kicked off with pureed scallops in green sauce, followed by turkey loaf with an emulsion of peas, braised potatoes in tarragon sauce. The dessert  a date cake with caramel sauce  carried a little carbon guilt, as did the wine, La Cigaralle de Prince, grown on a vineyard owned by Prince Consort Henrik.        
	A pair of Greenpeace activists dressed in formal wear crashed the banquet and unfurled two banners reading Politicians Talk, Leaders Act as they walked on the red carpet reception line. They were dragged from the hall by security guards        
	Missing list  
	Leaders from 119 nations are meeting, but with around 200 countries worldwide, who ismissing? Here are some nations that didnt send their head of state or government:  
	Big oil producers: Fossil fuels are some of the main contributors to global warming. These nine nations account for around 44per cent of the worlds proven oil reserves: Angola, Azerbaijan, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Libya, Oman, Qatar (worlds highest emissions per capita), Saudi Arabia, UAE        
	Island nations: Low-lying island nations are among those expected to be worst hit by rising sea levels. Absentees include Antigua amp; Barbuda, Barbados, Cape Verde, Cuba, Fiji, Jamaica, Solomon Islands, Tonga   
	Latin America: Guilty of widespread deforestation. Absentees include Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay   
	Others: Switzerland (melting glaciers threaten its tourism industry), Ukraine (among the top 20 polluters), Italy (an attack has left Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi with a broken nose and teeth)  
	Singh meets Wen  
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and his Chinese counterpart Wen Jiabao held talks in a bid to consolidate the position of developing countries ahead of the world leaders meeting. Singh recalled that the two countries had been co-operating at various forums, including the G-20. We need to continue the co-operation, he said.  
	Singh expressed hope that the two countries would be able to take their strategic partnership further. He said he believed that the importance of China-India relations was underlined by the fact that the two leaders were meeting again now on the sidelines of the summit, recalling that they had earlier met in Thailand on the margins of the Asean summit in October.

	Pledges so far by all nations for curbing greenhouse gases would mean a world temperature rise of 3 degrees Celsius, above many estimates of dangerous climate change, according to a leaked UN document. Industrialised nations have set a 2 degrees Celsius warming as the maximum limit to avoid dangerous climate changes including more floods, droughtsand rising seas.  
	The note by the UN Climate Change Secretariat, dated December 15, says that the present pledges are not enough, exceeding safer emissions limits by about 1.9-4.2 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases a year by 2020. That would result in an unsustainable pathway that could lead to... a temperature rise of about 3 degrees, it said. Further steps were possible and necessary.

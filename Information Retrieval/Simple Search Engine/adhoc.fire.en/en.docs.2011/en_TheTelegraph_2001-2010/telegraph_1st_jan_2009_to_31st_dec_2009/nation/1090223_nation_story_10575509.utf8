          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 22: The seat sharing talks between ruling coalition partners BJD and BJP for the coming Lok Sabha and Assembly polls remained inconclusive for the second time last night with both sides sticking to their stands.        
	While big brother BJD insisted on its demand for a change in earlier seat-sharing formula, BJP stuck to the old formula.         
	Sources said BJD leaders argued that winning prospects of individual candidates should be the main criterion for seat sharing rather than sticking to a pre-decided number. Citing the spectacular victory of BJD in recent panchayat and civic polls, they said the results reflected the growing popularity of chief minister Naveen Patnaik and his regional party. The changed electoral scenario warrants change in seat sharing formula, they argued         
	However, BJP argued that there is no foolproof parameter to ascertain wins. The results of panchayat and urban body polls would have no bearing on the coming Lok Sabha and assembly polls. They insisted that earlier seat-sharing ratio of 12:9 in case of Lok Sabha polls and 84:63 for the Assembly polls should be maintained. The two allies have been sharing seats on the basis of that formula since 1998 Lok Sabha and 2000 assembly polls, said the BJP leaders.

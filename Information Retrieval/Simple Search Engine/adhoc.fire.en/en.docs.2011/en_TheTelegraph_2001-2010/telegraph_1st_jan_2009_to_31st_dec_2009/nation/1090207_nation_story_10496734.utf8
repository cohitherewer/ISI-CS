                                                                                                               Cuttack queues up to cast vote
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Feb. 6: More than 62 per cent voters exercised their franchise in 54 municipal corporation wards in Cuttack in an incident-free polling today, as three parties  BJD, BJP and Congress  tried to dominate the premier urban landscape after Bhubaneswar.         
	The voting percentage was better than the last poll said observers.         
	District election officer Udayanath Naik said polling was 58 per cent to 62 per cent at the 425 voting sites across the city by 3pm. He expected the percentage would be 70 per cent by 5pm. An approximate 62 per cent was recorded during the last CMC polls in 2003.         
	Polling percentage at Gandhipalli and Nehrupalli booths in ward 50 was over 85 per cent. The polls were peaceful with stray incidents of scuffles between party workers, deputy commissioner of police A.N. Sinha told reporters.         
	In Bidyadharpur polling station, voting was stopped at five booths for nearly 45 minutes after rival workers clashed. Polling was resumed at the five hypersensitive booths after deployment of extra force. There were incidents of scuffles near polling stations in Poprada and Jobra areas.         
	Many voters had to return from the polling centres after they found their names missing from the list. Some were not allowed to cast votes as they had come without identity proof. BJD city president Madhusudan Sahu expressed confidence that the increase in turnout will benefit his party. Counting of votes begins at 9am on Saturday and results are expected around 4pm, said a district election office source said.

	Lucknow, April 24: Priyanka Gandhi is sleepless: if the turnout in her brothers Amethi is a pointer to that in her mothers Rae Bareli, there could be a problem.        
	Having spent days canvassing for brother Rahul and mother Sonia in the sapping Uttar Pradesh heat, Priyanka today said she was surprised that only 45 per cent people had voted in Amethi yesterday.        
	Of course, it gave me a sleepless night, she said in Rae Bareli. I am keeping my fingers crossed. I am making an impassioned appeal to all to come out and vote.        
	Priyanka had visited practically every nook and corner of Amethi, telling people that this was a vote for development and that they should re-install her brother as MP.        
	If you want to let my brother continue his development schemes, please vote for him, she had cajoled them.        
	Congress sources said the heat and the ongoing wheat harvesting season could have affected the turnout. Some said people had lost interest because a Congress victory was a foregone conclusion.        
	Priyanka seemed to agree. There is a problem when people see that there is hardly any contest. They seem to lose interest and do not make the effort to come out and vote.        
	 Rae Bareli votes on April 30

                                                                                    Sunday , November 15 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                            Sanghs stern signal to divided BJP
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Mohan Bhagwat                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 14: RSS chief Mohanrao Bhagwat has sounded a mild warning to the BJP to either accept the Sanghs advice or risk remaining a divided, dysfunctional and rootless party.        
	The BJP is a divided house and a divided house cant function properly, Bhagwat was quoted by news agencies as telling reporters in Pune. He reportedly added that the BJP needed to rediscover its roots.        
	The Sangh chief said he had counselled the BJP leadership to look for a young candidate for the post of party president who could restore its (the BJPs) organisational set-up. He said: We have conveyed our expectations of the new leader and if they (the BJP leaders) approach us after taking a decision, we will okay it.        
	Bhagwat is believed to have conveyed to L.K. Advani and current party chief Rajnath Singh his choice of Nitin Gadkari, a member of the Maharashtra legislative council, as the next BJP president.        
	BJP sources familiar with the Sanghs style of communication and functioning interpreted Bhagwats latest remarks to mean he expected the partys leaders to fall in line with his wishes or risk being marginalised.        
	Sangh sources said Bhagwat was extremely unhappy at the persistent defiance from some BJP leaders to his efforts to help the party get its act together.        
	Bhagwat apparently did not like Sushma Swarajs assertions that Advani would serve out his five-year term as leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha. The sources claimed Advani had conveyed to Bhagwat he would make way for a younger leader.        
	During the Karnataka revolt against B.S. Yeddyurappa, the RSS chief was apparently disconcerted by information that the Reddy brothers were being instigated by a BJP member of Parliament from the state who is known as an Advani loyalist.        
	This MP, sources said, has conveyed to the RSS that if it foists Gadkari or someone else as BJP chief, he would not work under that president.        
	Sangh sources said the potential dissenters in the BJP ought to learn from the conduct of their seniors like Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Advani.        
	They cited how, in 1995, when the Sangh decided to project Vajpayee as the BJPs candidate for Prime Minister in the following years elections, Advani gracefully accepted the decision despite having crafted the partys victories since 1989.        
	The sources also mentioned that when the dual-membership (the choice between being an RSS member and a Janata Party member) issue arose in 1979, Vajpayee had remained loyal to the Sangh after a lot of agonising.        
	Even the late Pramod Mahajan, not exactly a Sangh favourite, was cited as an example. The sources recalled that Mahajan had agreed, without fuss, to work under M. Venkaiah Naidu and, later, Rajnath when they headed the BJP although he had had a longer innings at the centre than them.        
	Sangh sources said that if anyone had an issue with the next party chief, they were free to go their own way.        
	 Bhagwats in the mood to overhaul the party organisation. He will risk bringing in an entirely new team instead of putting up with individual shenanigans and egos, a source said.

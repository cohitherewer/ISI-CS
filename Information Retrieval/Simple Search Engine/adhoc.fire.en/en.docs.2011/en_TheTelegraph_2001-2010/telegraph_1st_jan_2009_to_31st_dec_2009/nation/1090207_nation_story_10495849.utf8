The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Central team visits cyclone-hit areas
                                                                                                               Central team visits cyclone-hit areas
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 6: Cyclone-prone Orissa is now on the radar of World Bank and the National Disaster Mitigation Authority.        
	A 14-member team from the World Bank and the authority is now visiting the cyclone-prone areas to assess institutional preparedness for implementation of the National Cyclone Risk Mitigation Project.        
	On October 29-30, 1999, at least 14 districts had been devastated by the supercyclone, which had claimed more than 10,000 lives and crippled the coastal economy.        
	Recently, the Orissa State Disaster Management Authority, an autonomous body set up for disaster management and preparedness, had submitted a proposal of Rs 441 crore to the Centre. The visiting team is in the process of evaluating the proposals and assessing our institutional preparedness, the Orissa State Disaster Management Authority managing director, N.K. Sundaray said today.         
	Sundaray claimed that the visiting team had been impressed with the construction of cyclone shelters and road connectivity works undertaken earlier by the state. The team members had expressed their appreciation during a meeting with the Orissa State Disaster Management Authority officials yesterday, he said.        
	The team visited flood and cyclone-prone areas, including Kakatpur and Astarang block of Puri district, Ersama block of Jagatsinghpur and Aul and Mahakalpada blocks of Kendrapara district.        
	The cyclone risk mitigation project is proposed to be implemented in Balasore, Bhadrak, Kendrapara, Jagatsinghpur, Puri, Ganjam and parts of Khurda adjoining Chilika lake. The project, spread over a period of three years, is likely to be implemented from April this year, the state authority officials said.         
	The project includes establishing at least 150 cyclone shelters, strengthening of the saline embankments, ensuring connectivity in terms of road network to the shelters from disaster-prone villages, better wireless connectivity for communication and capacity building measures. Earlier, the state authority had submitted the investment proposal involving a cost of Rs 234.7 crore in 2005.         
	Later, it was revised to Rs 609.4 crore on the basis of current schedule of rates and the revised proposal was submitted to the national authority in August 2007. However, as the national authority requested to limit the proposal to around Rs 400 crore under structural measures component, the project was revised to Rs 441 crore and submitted recently.        
	The World Bank grant would be routed through the Centre, which will provide 75 per cent of the project cost, while state government would bear the rest 25 per cent expenses. Official sources said the state government had already taken steps for allocating funds in the budget for providing its matching share of 25 per cent.        
	The project would consist of four components  providing VHF connectivity to the villages in two to 5km of the coast, structural measures, capacity building and project implementation as well as monitoring.         
	The project proposals include components for cyclone shelters (Rs 130 crore), coastal embankment and canal (Rs 150 crore), shelter belt plantation and regeneration of mangroves (Rs 20 crore), shelter connectivity (Rs 120 crore) and strengthening fishing communities.

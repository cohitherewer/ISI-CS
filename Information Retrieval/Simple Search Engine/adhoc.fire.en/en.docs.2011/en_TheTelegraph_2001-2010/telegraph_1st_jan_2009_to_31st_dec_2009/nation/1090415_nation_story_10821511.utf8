                                                                                                               Jamui voters in double jeopardy
          GAUTAM SARKAR                              
	Jamui (Bihar), April 14: Jamui voters, especially those living around Bhimbandh wildlife sanctuary (Munger) area, are caught between Naxalites and security personnel.         
	The rebels have called a bandh on the polling day (April 16) through a communiqu issued in the name of spokesman Avinash, across Jamui, Munger, Banka and Bhagalpur. Earlier, posters were put up at Chakai, Sono, Jhajha, Jamui, Khaira, Barhet and Lakshmipur urging voters to stay indoors on Thursday.         
	In Sonarba village, near the Bhimbandh wildlife sanctuary (Munger), residents believe that trouble has just begun as 500-odd security personnel, led by the SDPO, have arrived for a special operation.        
	We are surrounded by police and Maoists, and both wish to keep us indoors, said Basanti, resident. The young woman came out of her hut to fetch water and was harassed while facing repeated questions regarding Maoist hideouts.        
	Some 500 jawans led by Jamui SDPO C.C. Azad, deputy superintendent of police (SP) of special task force (STF) Ramashanker Roy and STF in-charge Pradip Kumar entered Bhimbandh, a red bastion, recovered explosives including landmines, said Binoy Kumar, the Jamui SP. Combing operations would continue till the polling day and strict security would be maintained in Sonarba, Chormara and Bhimbandh polling booths.        
	Some 37km from Jamui district headquarters, Bhimbandh falls under Jamui Lok Sabha seat (reserved). On January 5, the then Munger SP, K.C. Surendarbabu, and his five bodyguards were killed in a landmine explosion. On June 27, 2007, one cop along with two civilians killed in police-Maoists encounter. Rebels also blew up a government primary school at Chomara and damaged a culvert at Jamuniatard.        
	Spread over 3,122sqkm with 1,403,585 voters, more than 80 per cent polling stations at Jamui have been termed as hyper sensitive.        
	The constituency has 145 super-sensitive booths and we will arrange for the best security cover, said S.K. Bhardwaj, IG (operation) said.         
	Sixteen polling booths in Chakai, Jhajha, Jamui and Sikendara blocks have already been shifted to safer places.         
	The change in the booth venue means that we now have to walk 2 to 3km extra to cast our votes, said a resident of Mayurnacha under Jhajha block.

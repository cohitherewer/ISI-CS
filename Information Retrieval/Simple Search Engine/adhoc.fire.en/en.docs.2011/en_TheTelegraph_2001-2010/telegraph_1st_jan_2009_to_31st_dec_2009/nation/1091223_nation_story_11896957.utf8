          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, Dec. 22: The Bandopadhyay Commission report, which recommended some land rights for sharecroppers, rocked the Bihar Assembly today.        
	CPI(ML) Liberation MLA Amarnath Yadav was marshalled out of the House after he resorted to overturning furniture. Other Left party members joined him, creaking ruckus in the well.        
	As the House assembled for the day, the CPI(ML), CPI and CPM members started protesting, waving placards, and demanding that the state government immediately implement the recommendations of the Land Reforms Commission.        
	The Bihar government constituted the D. Bandopadhyay Commission on land reforms in 2006.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 12: India today termed Pakistans response to the Mumbai dossier a positive development, but underscored the expectation that its neighbour take credible steps to dismantle the infrastructure of terrorism.         
	It remains Indias goal to bring the perpetrators of the terrorist attacks on Mumbai to book, and to follow this process through to the end. We would also expect that the Government of Pakistan take credible steps to dismantle the infrastructure of terrorism in Pakistan, a statement from the external affairs ministry said.         
	In their official response, the Pakistan authorities have admitted that elements in Pakistan were involved in the terrorist attacks on Mumbai. They are still in the process of investigating the attacks and have taken certain actions, including the arrest of some of those who were involved and filing a first information report. This is a positive development, the statement said.        
	Pakistans response was to the dossier New Delhi had given on January 5.        
	Pakistan has also sought further information and material relating to the investigation. The Government of India will now examine the issues raised in the response by Pakistan. After that examination, we will share whatever we can with Pakistan, the statement said.         
	External affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee is expected to make a statement in Parliament tomorrow.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Centre dusts film deal with Britain
                                                                                                               Centre dusts film deal with Britain
          CITHARA PAUL                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 24: The Centre has decided to breathe life into a dormant Indo-UK film co-production treaty, enthused by Slumdog Millionaires dream run at the Oscars.        
	The treaty had not taken off as there was some technical nitty-gritty to be sorted out. Now, we have cleared everything and we hope to have the first Indo-UK film co-production shortly, an information and broadcasting ministry official said.        
	The treaty, signed in 2005, deals with several aspects of filmmaking such as casting, pre-production, production, post-production and distribution. But no initiative was taken so far to encourage co-production.        
	The official said the move was now being made as Slumdog had thrown open an avenue of opportunities for Indian cinema. If a British production like Slumdog can make so much of an impact, a co-production is bound to be more reflective of our culture and heritage, he said.        
	The treaty, which provides for sharing of expertise between the two film industries, entitles filmmakers to tax incentives and access to government funding at nominal interest rates.        
	There are financial incentives from the British government, too. The only condition is that Indian filmmakers will have to spend at least 25 per cent of the films budget in the UK.        
	The official said such provisions were bound to help small and medium producers make crossover movies. Co-produced movies would also be eligible for single-window clearance for location permits and visas.        
	Film processing labs would also benefit as they would be able to bag international projects at competitive rates, the official said. The treaty lays down that a co-produced film should have technicians, actors and producers from both countries.        
	Indian producers like UTV Motion Pictures, Adlabs Films and Percept Picture Company already have co-production deals with 20th Century Fox, Fox Searchlight Films, Overbrook Entertainment and Hyperion Pictures.        
	India has film co-production treaties with Germany and Italy, too.

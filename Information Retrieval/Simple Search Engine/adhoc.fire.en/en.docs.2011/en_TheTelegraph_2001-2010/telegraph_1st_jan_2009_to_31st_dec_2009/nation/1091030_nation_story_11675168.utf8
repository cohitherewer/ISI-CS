The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Lalu, Left tie-up likely
                                                                                                               Lalu, Left tie-up likely

	Patna, Oct. 29: There are strong indications that the RJD and the Left may contest as allies in the forthcoming Jharkhand Assembly polls, with Lalu Prasad engaging Left leaders in a series of dialogues for the second day today.         
	Sources in the RJD and the Left (comprising CPI, CPM and CPI-ML-Liberation) confirmed that the marathon dialogue session among the party bosses will continue till tomorrow when the final deal is formalised.         
	We may enter into an alliance with the RJD as the situation in Jharkand demands that secular parties stick together, said CPI state secretary Badrinarayan Lal talking to The Telegraph, adding: We should reach a conclusion tomorrow.         
	Ram Vilas Paswan, the chief of the LJP, which an RJD ally, will join tomorrows session. Paswan is favourably disposed to the alliance, as his LJP does not have much at stake in Jharkhand.        
	However, no CPM leader attended todays meet. Asked if the CPM was ideologically opposed to the alliance, Badrinarayan Lal said: The CPI is an ally of CPM in Jharkhand. Naturally, the CPM is supportive of our talks with the RJD.         
	Sources revealed that seats going to polls from November 25 were the issues of contention between the Left and the RJD.         
	The Left is opposed to the idea of an alliance with the Congress. As it becomes clear that the Congress is not going to enter in to a tie-up with the RJD-LJP combination, the Left has now responded to the RJD bosss overtures for the secular alliance.         
	The Left distanced itself from Lalu in 2004 Assembly polls and in the last Lok Sabha polls. The RJD chief, on his part, continued to describe the Left as his natural ally. Now the situation in Jharkhand demands that these former allies come together, said Lal.        
	Senior CPI leaders Bhubaneshwar Mehta and Ramendra Kumar attended todays meeting.

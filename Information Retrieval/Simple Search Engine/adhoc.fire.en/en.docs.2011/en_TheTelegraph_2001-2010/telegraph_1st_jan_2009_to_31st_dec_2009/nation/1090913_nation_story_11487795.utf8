The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Mallya plans sports basket 
                                                                                                               Mallya plans sports basket 
                            
	Monza (Italy), Sept. 12 (Reuters): Vijay Mallya plans to gather his Formula One, cricket and soccer interests into one company and float it on the Mumbai stock exchange early next year.        
	So many people are wanting to invest that I said: Why dont we put all the sporting assets under one company and list it? the Force India F1 team principal said at the Italian Grand Prix on Saturday.        
	So thats what we are working on right now.        
	Mallya also owns the Royal Challengers Bangalore cricket team in the Indian Premier League (IPL) and has 50 per cent stakes in Mohun Bagan and East Bengal soccer clubs.        
	Mallya, whose United Breweries Group is Indias top liquor maker, said the company gathering together his sports interests could be called UB Sports but planning was at an early stage and it was yet to be decided.        
	Right now its just past the concept stage. We have advisers working on it so it will take a few months and then we need to ensure compliance and stuff like that with the Securities and Exchange Board of India, he said.        
	Ultimately the first quarter of next year should be an achievable target.        
	Mallya said his sports interests were currently owned by different entities within his business empire and that needed to be restructured within the parameters of Indian law, with independent evaluations carried out.        
	At the end of the day Force India should ideally be majority owned by Indians, he said of the Formula One team that scored their first points in Belgium last month with Italian Giancarlo Fisichella starting on pole and finishing second.        
	Mallya was unable to put a figure on how much a flotation could ultimately raise. We havent looked. We are nowhere near that stage yet, he said.        
	When I paid $115 million or whatever it is for my cricket franchise, everybody said wow. Now they are talking about valuations up to 300 million. So its not a question of only a financial investor. I think a lot of people will invest because there will be a combination of prudent financial investment and passion.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bank in spot for sport deals
                                                                                                               Bank in spot for sport deals
                              Sachin: Expensive?                            
	London, Feb. 15 (PTI): Sachin Tendulkar is among sports stars on whom a UK bank bailed out with taxpayer money has been accused of blowing up 200 million (around Rs 1,400 crore), The Sunday Times has said.        
	Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) signed Sachin as brand ambassador for five years weeks before Fred Goodwin was ousted as chief executive last October, the report said.        
	Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), bailed out with billions of pounds of taxpayers money, hired top sports stars on reckless contracts to entertain clients as part of a 200-million sponsorship binge, The Sunday Times said.        
	The bank, which announced a 28-billion (Rs 196,000 crore) loss last month, the biggest in British history, said it was obliged to honour the deals agreed under Goodwin. Disclosures about the splurge follow a row over a plan to pay almost 1 billion (Rs 7,000 crore) in bonuses.         
	Goodwin, who used to earn 4.2 million (Rs 29.4 crore) a year and walked away with a 8.4-million (Rs 58.8 crore) pension pot, refused comment on the disclosures.        
	Reacting to the revelations, John Mann, an MP who is also a member of the treasury select committee, said: They (RBS) have been reckless yet again. This doesnt seem to be a bank that could do anything in moderation. It now needs to realise the golden days are over.         
	But the bank suggested the sponsorships were proper. Quoting a spokesman for the bank, The Sunday Times said: All our sponsorship agreements were negotiated on commercial principles and meet strict corporate governance rules.         
	The report, however, quoted an RBS insider as saying he wished he could undo some of the agreements. One insider said, We wish we could undo some of these deals but we are signed into contracts, the paper said.        
	Other stars signed as global ambassadors include Zara Phillips, the rider and granddaughter of the Queen, Jack Nicklaus, the golfer, and Sir Jackie Stewart, former motor racing champion. Stewart, said to have earned 4 million (Rs 28 crore) to promote RBS, said last week: I am still with RBS. My contract has nearly two years to run and they always honour contracts.        
	The RBS group, one of the worlds biggest sports sponsors, bankrolls events like the US and British Opens in golf, the Six Nations rugby tournament, the Nat-West series in cricket and Formula One. Its website describes its calendar of events as the RBS World of Sport.

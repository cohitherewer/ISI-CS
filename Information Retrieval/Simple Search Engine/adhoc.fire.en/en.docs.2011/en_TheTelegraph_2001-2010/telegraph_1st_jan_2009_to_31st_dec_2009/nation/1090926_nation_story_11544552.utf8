          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 25: The Centre has extended by a month the deadline for Chinese workers in India to convert their business visas into employment visas.        
	Home ministry sources said the last date, which was September 30, has been extended till October 31, considering the request made by Chinese authorities.         
	Last week, Beijings envoy Zhang Yan had called on home secretary G.K. Pillai to request an extension of the deadline.        
	We decided to give more time, but not beyond October 31, said a senior home ministry official.         
	Those workers who fail to apply before October 31 will be deported, the source said.         
	About 25,000 Chinese nationals are working on various projects in the power and gas sectors and on the installation of float glass at the Indira Gandhi International Airport.         
	The government passed an order on July 2 that all foreign workers needed to make the change.         
	The extension of the deadline is also for nationals of countries other than China.        
	But its the Chinese who mostly come on business visas. We have people coming from France, Germany and elsewhere but they dont come on business visas, the home ministry official said.

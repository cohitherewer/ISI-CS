	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 26: Scotching rumours about shifting the location of its proposed mega steel plant from Orissa, South Korean steel major Posco today indicated that it would go ahead with the construction early next year.        
	There were some rumours about the shifting of the location of the project, Posco India chairman Dong-He Lee told reporters here this evening.        
	Lee, who met chief minister Naveen Patnaik at the state secretariat here this evening and apprised him of the progress of the project, said he had a very constructive discussion with the chief minister.        
	Lee stressed: We will start construction very soon.        
	When the reporters pointed out at land acquisition problems, Lee said: We have almost solved it. We have no other problem.        
	The South Korean steel major had signed an MoU with the Orissa government in June 2005 for establishment of a 12MTPA steel plant near Paradip port. Billed as the biggest FDI project of $12 billion, the mega steel plant, however, has failed to take off because of resistance by local villagers over land acquisition.        
	Out of the total requirement of 4,004 acres, around 500 acres are private land. The state government has failed to acquire any private land so far there.        
	The Posco India chief, however, did not elaborate as to how they have solved the land acquisition problem. Asked whether the company was planning to drop Dhinkia village, which offered the utmost resistance, Lee said: No.        
	The project has also failed to progress since around 3,000 acres are forestland. The Supreme Court has given its stage I clearance for diversion of forestland identified for the project. The stage II clearance is under process. By end of this year, all legal barriers will be cleared and probably next year we will start construction, Lee said.                                
	The project has also been delayed due to legal wrangling over the grant of iron ore mines lease. Orissa government had earlier recommended the Centre for leasing out Khandadhar iron ore mines in favour of Posco. However, it was challenged in the court by the Kudremukh Iron Ore Corporation Limited (KIOCL). Essar Steela, Geomin Minerals and Bhusan Steel Ltd had also challenged it subsequently. The dispute has dragged on in the court for over five months now and is presently pending in Orissa High Court.         
	Asked as to how the company would start construction of the plant when the iron ore mines lease has not been granted yet, Lee said,  We will separate mining and steel plant projects. We start steel plant project first.        
	The leveling of land would begin early next year, he added.

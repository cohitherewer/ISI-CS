	London, Feb. 7: A.R. Rahman is reckoned to have an excellent chance of picking up a Bafta tomorrow evening in London in a much-anticipated ceremony which could point to Slumdog Millionaires Oscar prospects in exactly a fortnight in Los Angeles.        
	The setting for the red-carpet British Academy of Film and Television Arts awards, for which Hollywood A-listers are turning up along with a hopeful Indian contingent (Anil Kapoor, Freida Pinto, Dev Patel and Irrfan Khan, along with Slumdog Millionaires director Danny Boyle and screenplay writer Simon Beaufoy), is the magnificent Royal Opera House  this is about a trillion light years removed from the Mumbai slums where Vikas Swarups adapted novel is set.         
	The author of Q amp;A is not able to make it, because he was apparently not invited on time. His friends are hoping he will attend the Oscars.         
	With 11 nominations, Slumdog Millionaire is expected to do well. Sharon Stone, Daniel Craig and Emma Watson are among those who will hand out the prizes.         
	Boyle will be disappointed if he is not named Best Director and Beaufoy if he does not pick up Best Adapted Screenplay, but in the Best Film category, their movie is up against The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. The latter also has 11 nominations.         
	Dev Patel, the 18-year-old British Indian actor, can scarcely believe how his life has been transformed since he was plucked from nowhere to play the lead, Jamal Malik, the chaiwallah from the slums who goes on to win Rs 20 million in a TV contest.         
	He has been nominated for Best Actor but it will be a surprise if he wins for he is up against very strong opposition  Frank Langella (Frost/Nixon), Sean Penn (Milk), Brad Pitt (The Curious Case of Benjamin Button) and Mickey Rourke (The Wrestler).        
	Freida Pinto, who is also making her debut as a film actress, may also have to be content representing Indian beauty though she is nominated for Best Supporting Actress  she is up against Amy Adams (Doubt), Penelope Cruz (Vicky Cristina Barcelona), Tilda Swinton (Burn After Reading) and Marisa Tomei (The Wrestler).         
	In the Best Actress category, Kate Winslet has been nominated twice, for The Reader and Revolutionary Road.         
	Angelina Jolie has been picked, too, for the Clint Eastwood directed Changeling. But this is more to ensure she consents to come to London, pause with her husband, Brad Pitt, on the red carpet and lend Hollywood mystique to the occasion.         
	Tomorrow night there will also be an occasion to assess whether the negative campaign against Slumdog Millionaire mounted by some in Bollywood has had any effect.        
	Recent interviews given by Boyle has been taken up with the director justifying his stand that he has not exploited the child actors from the slums by underpaying them.         
	Slumdog Millionaire is still heading the British box office, having taken 14,216,466 by the week beginning January 30, while in the US, the revenue has amounted to $67,193,169.         
	Todays report in The Times, Get ready for surprises, notes that the A-list will be out in force at the Baftas tomorrow night; but predicting gongs isnt easy.        
	It also makes the point that by staging the Baftas before the Oscars  it used to be the other way round  the British ceremony has become much more significant.         
	Its been nearly a decade of incremental transformations, but this pre-eminent British awards ceremony now safely enjoys its status as one of the three major movie bunfights  beginning with Januarys Golden Globes and ending with the Oscars on February 22  that define the trophy season.

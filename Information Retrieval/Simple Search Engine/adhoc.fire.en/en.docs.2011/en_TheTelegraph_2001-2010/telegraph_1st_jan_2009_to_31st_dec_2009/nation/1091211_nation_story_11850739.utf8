The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Before fast, think of liver 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Before fast, think of liver

	New Delhi, Dec. 10: A fast-unto-death, for some, may be a rapid downward slide faster than anticipated  as the case of Telangana leader Kalvakuntla Chandrasekhar Rao has indicated.         
	Within days after he launched his hunger strike for Telangana state, Raos condition had deteriorated to a point where doctors dubbed him as critical  and a new state now appears to be in the making.         
	His physiological response to fasting contrasts with what some doctors say is the quick bounce that Manipur civil rights activist Irom Sharmila Chanu appears to display after years of fasting.         
	Doctors say the bodys response to sustained hunger hinges on the underlying health condition  poor health in any form accelerates the adverse effects of starvation.         
	The state of the liver in a fasting person is crucial, said Ambrish Mithal, a senior endocrinologist and diabetes specialist at the Apollo Indraprastha Hospital in New Delhi.         
	The liver is the bodys storehouse of energy. In a prolonged fast, the body is denied glucose  and glycogen in the liver breaks down and releases glucose into the bloodstream, said Mithal.         
	When the body has exhausted its glycogen store, it seeks non-glucose sources  initially fats and later even muscle. This shift to starvation may take two weeks or even longer in otherwise healthy persons, but in a person with poor health, the liver may quickly lose the stored energy  sometimes within two or three days, he said.         
	Any chronic liver condition caused by a fatty liver, a viral infection, or alcoholism may severely compromise liver functions and lead to rapid deterioration in the health of a fasting person.         
	A healthy individual can quickly recover with nutrition, said Mithal, who had once treated environmental activist Sunderlal Bahuguna who had been a hunger strike for several days.         
	Survival without treatment also varies from person to person.         
	In 1981, ten Irish Republican prisoners all aged between 23 and 27 died after hunger strikes that lasted between 46 and 71 days, during which they survived only on water and salt.         
	The first to die was Bobby Sands after surviving 66 days.         
	In 1987, a Tamil activist in Sri Lanka died after a little more than four weeks of fasting. But last year, a medical team in Turkey said they had examined 12 people who had been on continuous hunger strike for 190 to 366 days.

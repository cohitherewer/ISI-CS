	New Delhi, April 17: Shanno Khan, the loveliest of her fathers four girls, was made to stand in the scorching sun for hours by her class teacher on Wednesday. She died today, having battled for life for two days in hospital.        
	The Class II student of a municipal school in north Delhi had not been able to translate a word given by the teacher into English, classmates told her shattered parents.        
	So the teacher, identified only as Manju, allegedly hit the 11-year-old, banged her head on a table and sent her out to stand in the cruel Delhi sun, with bricks on her tender shoulders. Shanno stood there for two hours, before her nose started bleeding and she lost consciousness.        
	She was the loveliest of my four girls. Her school had reopened after 15 days and she must have forgotten bits of what she had learnt. You know how kids are, if they dont revise every day, they tend to forget. Thats what happened to her. I cannot believe that the teacher killed my daughter over one word, said Mohammad Ayub Khan, Shannos father, who works as a waiter in a catering company.         
	I want the government to take severe action, I dont want their money, the father cried.         
	Shanno was found unconscious by one of her sisters who studies in the same school. She ran home to find their mother, Rihanna, who fainted thinking her daughter was dead. The child was rushed to Maharshi Valmiki Hospital by her aunt.        
	Ayub was away in Haryana on work and returned around 9.30pm to find his daughter in hospital. She was shifted to the paediatric ICU of Lok Nayak Jayaprakash Narayan Hospital yesterday afternoon.         
	The child was admitted with severe seizure and her condition further deteriorated before she slipped into coma. She was shifted to LNJP in critical condition, said K.K. Deuri, medical superintendent of Maharshi Valmiki Hospital.        
	The parents approached police for help, but an FIR was filed only after the child died and the media took up the issue. Then the mayor also ordered a vigilance inquiry.         
	The FIR was filed against the teacher under Section 304 of the Indian Penal Code for culpable homicide not amounting to murder.        
	Municipal commissioner K.S. Mehra has asked the director of primary education to conduct an inquiry and submit a report in three days.        
	The Municipal Corporation of Delhi has suspended the principal of the school (identified only as Dhanpati) for dereliction of duty and the teacher for corporal punishment.         
	Will this spate of inquiries bring back my daughter? I know this has happened before and it will happen again. Why cant the authorities take some steps to prevent such incidents? asks Ayub.        
	While the school refused to comment, the municipal corporation denied that the child was beaten up and blamed her death on seizures.        
	The girl has been detained for shortage of attendance. She has been irregular with her classes because of fits. On Wednesday, too, she had fits, following which her parents were informed, the MCD education committee chairman, Prithiviraj Sahni, said.        
	He gave no explanation why the child was made to stand in the sun for hours.        
	The Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights had taken suo motu cognisance of media reports and sent a notice to the municipal corporation, which runs the school.

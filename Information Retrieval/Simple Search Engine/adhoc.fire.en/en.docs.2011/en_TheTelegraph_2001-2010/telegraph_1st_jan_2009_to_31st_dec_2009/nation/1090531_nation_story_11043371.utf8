The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | To Atlantic, for first anti-sub war games
                                                                                                               To Atlantic, for first anti-sub war games
          SUJAN DUTTA                          INS Delhi, which will take part in the exercise                                  
	New Delhi, May 30: The Indian Navy is sending warships of its western fleet to the Atlantic Ocean for the first time for anti-submarine drills with the British and the French, continuing with its strategy of long-reach deployments despite the demands of coastal security after 26/11.        
	Four ships  the INS Delhi, the INS Beas, the INS Brahmaputra and the fleet tanker, INS Aditya  will engage the Royal Navy and the French Navy in separate war games involving nuclear-powered submarines in the eastern Atlantic in June and July.        
	Yes, there is a change in our deployment pattern. While coastal defence is important we believe in a constructive engagement, and pooling in of information and deployments to Europe and the Far East are in keeping with this strategy, a navy spokesperson said.        
	In March and April, ships from the eastern fleet were deployed in China, Japan and South Korea.        
	But the Indian Navy is also looking at the drills with the British and the French navies because of the nature of the exercise. The Indian Navy is eager to gain knowledge on nuclear-powered submarines but it does not have one of its own. Chinas People Liberation Army-Navy is expanding with the acquisition of such submarines (SSNs).        
	The Royal Navy and the French Navy will be deploying two SSNs in the war games  Konkan 09 (with the British) and the Varuna 09 (with the French). Nuclear-powered submarines have longer underwater endurance and their sound signatures are recorded differently from conventional diesel-electric submarines in the SONAR detection equipment.        
	The British will be deploying the HMS Trafalgar nuclear-powered submarine in the exercise between June 20 and June 25. They will also be deploying two guided missile frigates, the HMS Westminster and the HMS Lancaster, two auxiliaries, the RFA Fort Rosalie and the RFA Mounts Bay, Merlin and Lynx helicopters, Falcon and Hawk fighter aircraft and a Nimrod maritime patrol aircraft.        
	With the French, the western fleet is likely to have a deeper engagement. The Flag Officer Commanding in Chief, Vice-admiral S.P.S Cheema, is likely to visit Brest, the headquarters of the French Navys Atlantic command, during the exercise from June 30 to July 4.         
	The Varuna 09 will involve high-end anti-submarine exercises. The navy spokesperson said the Indian Navy was also studying the French coastal security model.        
	The French would deploy the nuclear-powered submarine Emeraude, a guided missile destroyer, the Primaguet, a guided missile frigate, the Lieutenant de Vaisseau le Henaff, Atlantiue II long range maritime reconnaissance aircraft, Lynx helicopters, Rafale and Super Entendard fighter aircraft.        
	A second reason for deploying so far away, a naval officer said, was that the Indian Navy was gradually looking at a situation in which it would have to operate with western navies in foreign waters.         
	In some ways that kind of a situation had already emerged in waters off Somalia, where the Indian Navy had to coordinate at a ship-to-ship level with other navies in anti-piracy patrols.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | PM set for date with Obama
                                                                                                               PM set for date with Obama
          AMIT ROY                          Obama: London stage                                  
	London, March 31: Manmohan Singh, who reached London this evening along with other world leaders for the G20 summit, said he was looking forward to his meeting tomorrow with President Barack Obama.        
	Before leaving Delhi on his first overseas trip since his heart operation in January, the Prime Minister said his talks with Obama would provide an opportunity for us to review our bilateral relations as well as hold discussions on important regional and global issues such as terrorism, the situation in Afghanistan, energy security and climate change.        
	A considerable amount of preparation has been done for the summit, he said. These preparations relate to provision of co-ordinated fiscal stimulus by major economies to offset the decline in private demand, agreement on a set of principles to plug loopholes and weaknesses in the supervisory and regulatory arrangements for the financial institutions.        
	Aware that there are critics who believe the summit will not make much difference to solving the worlds economic problems, he stressed: It is important and necessary for the summit to take credible decisions which will help to halt and reverse the current slowdown and to instil a sense of confidence in the global economy.        
	He added: The time has come for the international economic and financial architecture to reflect contemporary economic strengths.        
	The Prime Minister, who knows he will be addressing a domestic audience from London, pointed out that India had benefited from the high growth rate achieved over the last five years.        
	We would like to ensure that our economy continues to expand at a healthy rate to meet the principal challenges of eradicating poverty and ensuring balanced and inclusive socio-economic development for our people, he said. Our economic, financial and banking institutions have shown great resilience and the fundamentals of our economy remain strong.        
	The leaders of 20 of the biggest economies in the world will have barely a day  under four hours, in fact  to decide what solutions to adopt on Thursday.        
	British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who is the summit host, said today that the G20 must force banks to return to family values of honesty and fairness.        
	In our families we raise our children to work hard and to do their best and do their bit, he commented, referring to the risks bankers had taken with their customers money. We dont reward them for taking risks that would put them or others in danger, and we dont encourage them to seek short-term gratification at the expense of long-term value.        
	European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso played down expectations but insisted the summit had to make a difference. He warned: We dont expect miracles.        
	But he said the world was working together to solve the crisis, and had a unique opportunity to re-shape globalisation. The G20 will not end this crisis overnight. But it can and must make a difference. Citizens will judge the stimulus on outputs, not inputs. What matters are results  jobs saved and jobs created.        
	Financier George Soros said the summit was hovering on a knife edge between success and failure as he called for more help for poorer countries to survive the global financial crisis.

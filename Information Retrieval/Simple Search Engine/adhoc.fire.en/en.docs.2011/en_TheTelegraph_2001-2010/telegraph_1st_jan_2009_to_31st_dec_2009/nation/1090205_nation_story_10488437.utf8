	Lucknow, Feb. 4: The complaint of theft against a six-year-old Dalit girl that prompted policemen to lift her by the hair and thrash her has been found to be based on false information, police said today.        
	The content of the complaint against the minor girl was found to be based on false allegations, Uttar Pradesh additional director-general of police Brij Lal said. The complaint against the girl, therefore, has been withdrawn and a case against the complainant, Anshu Katharia, is being instituted.         
	Of the six policemen named in the FIR under the SC/ST Act for torture of the child, two  Chandrabhan Singh and Shyamlal Yadav  surrendered in the additional district judges court in Etawah today. While Shyamlal Yadav, the key accused, was sent to jail, Singh, who is a Dalit, was freed on bail, a police official said.        
	The police brutality on Monday had sparked a public outcry. Now the revelation that the policemen had not bothered to verify the complaint  that the child had stolen Rs 280  has further embarrassed senior officers.         
	Director-general of police Vikram Singh today warned the force that if any police officer is found to be resorting to this kind of barbaric treatment, he would be dealt with sternly.

                                                                                                               PM faces artery procedure
          OUR BUREAU                                            
	New Delhi, Jan. 22: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is likely to undergo a procedure to clear blockages detected in his coronary arteries during diagnostic tests at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).        
	A decision on the date is expected to be taken shortly.        
	The Prime Minister, who was discharged from AIIMS this morning, did not attend office at South Block but went through files at home. Thursdays cabinet meeting was called off, too.        
	Singh cancelled all his engagements for the week and did not meet visitors. He has been advised complete rest, a source said.        
	A late-night release from the Prime Ministers Office said: The doctors attending on the Prime Minister are completing their medical assessment to decide on the future course of treatment which would be initiated at an appropriate date.        
	Senior cardiologists not currently associated with Singhs diagnosis said it was possible that his medical team had decided to perform an elective angioplasty  a procedure done after more detailed planning and preparation than what is possible during emergency angioplasty.        
	The challenge the doctors face will also depend on the location of the blockages. A blockage in native (original) arteries is easier to handle than a blockage in a grafted blood vessel found in patients who have had a previous bypass surgery, said Vanita Arora, a senior interventional cardiologist at the Apollo Hospital in New Delhi. An angioplasty on a graft vessel is tricky, Arora said.        
	A planned elective angioplasty also allows use of more dye  the contrast material that has to be injected into the arteries during angiography and angioplasty. The dye has the potential to increase the load on the heart and damage the kidneys.        
	The dye used during angiography washes out within two or three days. This will allow higher levels of dye to be used during an elective angioplasty done a few days after the angiography, Arora said.        
	A political source said the protocol requirements of Republic Day will be factored into the decision. The source added that ultimately it would depend on the medical assessment of the Prime Ministers health.        
	While the President takes the salute at the ceremonial parade on January 26, the Prime Minister is a key dignitary, sharing public space with the chief guest who is always a foreign head of state. This year, it will be Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev.        
	Although the number of spectators at the parade has gone down over the years because of security requirements, the live telecast fetches record viewership.        
	The Prime Ministers absence will be noticed. This may not be happy news to us because it will spark speculation and raise the leadership question, admitted a Congress general secretary. Singh may not be thought of as an ace campaigner but the Congress was hoping to build a campaign around his attributes such as integrity, purposefulness and a resolve to steer the country, especially the economy, through trying times.        
	Normally, a patient is discharged within 48 hours of angioplasty and is able to resume office activity within seven days. However, as the Prime Minister is diabetic, sources said, he may need more time to recover.        
	If the surgery is done after January 26, it will give him enough time to rest before facing the last session of this Lok Sabha, starting February 12.        
	If the Prime Minister is hospitalised, he can formally nominate a minister to handle the affairs of the government for the period he is away.        
	Not all Prime Ministers followed this convention, though. When Atal Bihari Vajpayee was operated on twice to repair his knees, he moved the PMO also to the Mumbai hospital.        
	Singh usually hands charge to foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee, the number two in the cabinet pecking order, when he travels abroad. On just one occasion, the two were out of the country simultaneously for a day but no one was asked to stand in.

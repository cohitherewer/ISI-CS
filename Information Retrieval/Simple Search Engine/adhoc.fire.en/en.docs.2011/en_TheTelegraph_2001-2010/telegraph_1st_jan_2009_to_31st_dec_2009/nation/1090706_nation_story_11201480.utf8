The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cubs on Tiger Hill a decade after Kargil
                                                                                                               Cubs on Tiger Hill a decade after Kargil
                          Children outside the Drass war memorial on the 10th anniversary of the recapture of Tiger Hill on Sunday.                     
	Today is the 10th anniversary of our winning back Tiger Hill from the Pakistani army regulars who were sitting on the top, a senior officer from the 56 Brigade in Drass said.         
	The Tiger Hill and Tololing range victories can be said to be the turning points of the (Kargil) war as, from there on, there was nothing stopping the Indian Army till the time the war ended on July 26.         
	Celebrations were held at various locations by units involved in the battle.        
	We would be celebrating the 10th anniversary of the battle at Drass on July 26, the day when the battle ended in favour of India and we wrested all our positions from the Pakistanis, the officer said.        
	The Kargil-based 8 Mountain Division plans to honour the units, the next of kin of martyrs and the gallantry award winners.         
	The Jammu and Kashmir tourism department is also planning to promote Tiger Hill and Tololing as tourist destinations.        
	We plan to build infrastructure to attract domestic tourists. Drass was a main theatre of the Kargil conflict and hence is a potential tourist attraction, tourism minister Nawang Rigzin Jora said.         
	The government plans to build hotels along the National Highway connecting Srinagar and Leh from where Tiger Hill can be viewed.

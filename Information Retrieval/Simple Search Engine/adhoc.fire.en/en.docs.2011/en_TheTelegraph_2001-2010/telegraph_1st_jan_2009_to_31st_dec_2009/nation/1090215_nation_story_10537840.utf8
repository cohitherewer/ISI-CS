	New Delhi, Feb. 14: Sonia Gandhi has decided to firm up the Congresss alliance with the Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh, setting aside reservations of a section of her party.        
	A formal announcement on the seat-sharing formula is expected in the next few days.         
	Sources said the party was likely to get 20 seats in Uttar Pradesh that sends 80 MPs to the Lok Sabha.         
	The alliance got a fillip last night when Samajwadi general secretary Amar Singh called up his Congress counterpart Digvijay Singh iterating his partys keenness to stitch a partnership. Amar is likely to meet Digvijay and then call on Sonia.         
	However, Congress leaders from Uttar Pradesh were far from satisfied. The dominant feeling in the state Congress committee was that the alliance with the Samajwadis would hurt the Congress, particularly because Mulayam Singh Yadav has warmed to former BJP leader Kalyan Singh.         
	But senior party leaders handling Uttar Pradesh and Bengal said Sonia was going ahead with the seat-sharing plans with the Samajwadis and the Trinamul Congress with a two-pronged strategy.         
	The Congress not only hopes to increase its Lok Sabha tally in these two states, it also plans to weaken the Opposition. The alliance with the Samajwadis is aimed at checking the Bahujan Samaj Party and the BJP in Uttar Pradesh.

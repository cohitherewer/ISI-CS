	Cuttack, Dec. 12: Sale of tickets for the December 21 One-Day International (ODI) cricket match between India and Sri Lanka may come down as the 5,000-capacity gallery at Barabati Stadium here is not ready.        
	Sale of tickets for the ODI, which has been insured for Rs 14 crore with Oriental Insurance Company, is scheduled from December 18. But though expansion had been practically completed in gallery 1 and 2, engineers have cautioned against removing the scaffoldings in gallery 2 before December 21. The OCA had announced that the stadium capacity for the ODI would be increased to 40,000.

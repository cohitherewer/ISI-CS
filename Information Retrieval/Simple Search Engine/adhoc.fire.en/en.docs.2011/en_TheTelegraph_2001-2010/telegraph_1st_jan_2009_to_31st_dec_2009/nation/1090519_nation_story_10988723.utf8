The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rahul eyes role of conscience keeper

          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Rahul: Checks and balances                                  
	New Delhi, May 18: Left to himself, Rahul Gandhi may prefer to be the governments social conscience rather than an insider.        
	Manmohan Singh has said he would try his best to persuade Rahul to join the ministry, and no one in the Congress is certain how the Amethi MP would decide. But one informed view is that Rahul would prefer to provide the right checks and balances from outside the government, ensuring it does not stray from the aam aadmi agenda.        
	Rahul doesnt have to be a minister to steer the governments policies, a source said.        
	Since most of the ministries on his radar  rural employment, health, agriculture, labour and human resource development  are expected to come to the Congress, the party can devise a mechanism to keep itself informed of their working.        
	So far, the Congress has not thought of reviving the National Advisory Council, which was headed by Sonia Gandhi and went defunct after she got sucked into the office-of-profit controversy. The council had piloted some of the governments major initiatives such as the rural job scheme and the Right to Information Act, and was considered a counterbalance to economic liberalisation.        
	Although some in the Congress have been raring to complete the first UPA governments unfinished job on economic reforms  such as pension and insurance reforms and the entry of foreign universities --- Rahul, it seems, thinks a little differently.        
	He apparently believes the government should start its innings with a big-bang pro-people move, such as a food security law and a security net for vulnerable social sections. These were promises in the Congresss election manifesto.        
	Congress sources, however, added that like Manmohan Singh, Rahul was convinced that economic reforms must go hand in hand with a social programme because a fiscally strapped government cannot hope to go ahead with ambitious schemes.        
	The UPA was able to implement the rural job scheme and the urban renewal project in its first innings because the economy was doing fine.        
	The sources said Rahul realised that the Congress had made huge gains in the metros (barring Bangalore) and towns as well as the villages.        
	The expectations from both (cities and villages) are enormous and this time we cant cite the Left to plead helplessness. We have the difficult job of simultaneously addressing the sensex-obsessed constituency and the farmers, a former minister said.        
	Rahul also seems to have set himself a two-year deadline to accomplish two tasks: democratise the Youth Congress, of which he is in charge, and use the breakthrough in Uttar Pradesh to build the party.        
	So far, the Youth Congresss experiment with free and fair internal elections has paid off in Punjab, Gujarat and Uttarakhand. Eight of the 10 Youth Congress functionaries whom Rahul provided with Lok Sabha tickets won this time, giving him his best-ever strike rate of 80 per cent.        
	In earlier Assembly polls, Rahuls success rate with Youth Congress candidates ranged from 30 to 40 per cent.        
	Party sources said Rahul was unlikely to push for the inclusion of his candidates in the government and would rather use them in the organisation. He wants to replicate the Uttar Pradesh success in Bihar.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | More pay for lost air luggage and death
                                                                                                               More pay for lost air luggage and death
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, May 11: Indian fliers killed or injured in accidents or losing their baggage on international flights will be entitled to higher compe-nsation from airlines from June 30.        
	Under a new aviation treaty that will start applying to passengers flying into or out of India, those who die in air are entitled to 100,000 special drawing rights (SDRs), equivalent to about $66,500 or Rs 32.5 lakh.        
	Indian carriers currently pay Rs 7.5 lakh for deaths in accidents on international flights.        
	As long as India had not acceded to the Montreal Convention 1999, (Indian and foreign) airlines had the right to pay lower compensation rates, which they could decide, an official explained. Now they have to pay the full rate. It means Indian carriers too will have to pay these rates on international flights.        
	The ceiling on compensation for passenger delays will now be 4,150 SDRs or $2,760 (Rs 1.35 lakh).         
	For delay, loss or destruction of baggage, airlines liability will be 1,000 SDRs or $665 (Rs 32,500) per passenger; and for cargo, 17 SDRs or $11.35 (Rs 560) per kg.        
	The amended law will provide international air passengers to and from India the benefits of the fifth jurisdiction.        
	This means a passenger can take an airline to court in the country where he or she generally resides or in any other country where the airline provides its services.        
	This will enable an Indian to file his claim in India even if the journey was undertaken and ticket purchased outside India, provided the carrier has a presence in India, a civil aviation ministry spokesperson said.        
	The cabinet had last year agreed to sign the convention, a treaty on uniformity of aviation rules on international carriage of passengers, baggage and cargo.         
	To pave the way for signing it, the government got Indias Carriage by the Air Act, 1972, amended through Parliament this year.        
	As long as India did not sign the convention, serious discrimination was possible between passengers of the same flight in relation to compensation, an official said.        
	To cite an example, passengers whose journey originated in the US or Britain would have been entitled to much higher compensation compared with those whose journey began in India. This went against the interests of Indian passengers.        
	Before the Montreal Convention, passengers or their legal heirs had four choices of country for filing claims under an older legal regime, the Warsaw System. These were: the place where the ticket was issued, the airlines principal place of business, the passengers destination and the carriers place of domicile.        
	The International Civil Aviation Organisation started an initiative in 1994 to carry out a socio-economic study of compensation levels, following which the Montreal Convention was adopted in 1999. It unified all rules and added the fifth jurisdiction.        
	The Montreal Convention has been ratified by 91 countries, of which 21 have direct air links with India. These include countries with high-density routes such as the US, Britain, the UAE, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Japan, Austria, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy and Canada.

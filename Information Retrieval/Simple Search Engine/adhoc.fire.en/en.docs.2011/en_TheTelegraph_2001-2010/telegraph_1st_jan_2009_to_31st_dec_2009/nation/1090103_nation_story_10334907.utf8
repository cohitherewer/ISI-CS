The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CBI boss talks terror
                                                                                                               CBI boss talks terror
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 2: The National Investigation Agency  set up exclusively to deal with terror cases  would lessen the burden on Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) enabling it to take over cases of states, believes CBI director Ashwani Kumar.         
	Talking to reporters today, the CBI chief hailed the establishment of the NIA as a welcome step and said that the new agency would be assisted by several other organisations, including the CBI.         
	Any investigation is a team effort. We are ready to co-operate with the NIA, he said.        
	The work load on us is tremendous and for that, sometimes, we are not able to keep request of state governments to take over certain important cases. After the establishment of the NIA, we may be able to take over those cases, he said.         
	CBI is already under the process of restructuring their work force.         
	The CBI chief also expressed his confidence on the Centre to play the role of the mediator between all the agencies.         
	The CBI chief evaded questions on the CBIs latest lead in the much-hyped Arushi murder case.         
	It is under investigation and so the case cannot be discussed, was all that the boss would disclose on the Arushi murder case.

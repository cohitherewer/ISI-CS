          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 23: Samajwadi Party general secretary Amar Singh met police chief Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti today and submitted a complaint against Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayavati and six others, accusing them of conspiring against him.         
	The Mayavati government has transferred a money-laundering case against Amar and his wife to Calcutta police as most of the companies they have been accused of amalgamating illegally were registered here.         
	Amar said: This is an attempt to malign me, my family and friends, including Amitabh Bachchan. He lodged a general diary at Ballygunge police station.

	New Delhi, June 20: The CPM is considering reservation for Muslims in Bengal by including the community, or large sections of it, within the states Other Backward Classes list.        
	The party believes the loss of Muslim votes was a key factor behind its Lok Sabha poll setback in Bengal, sources said.         
	The reservation, which will cover both jobs and education, is to be part of a slew of welfare measures for the community the state government will look to introduce.        
	Although the details of implementation are yet to be worked out, indications are that the existing 27 per cent OBC quota will not be increased, for doing that can raise overall reservation above 50 per cent and invite legal hassles.        
	Before finalising whether all Muslims will be eligible, the state will consider the existing  and contrasting  models of Muslim reservation in the four southern states. Kerala and Karnataka, for instance, have extended reservation to virtually their entire Muslim population.         
	They have simply included Muslims (minus only the well-off creamy layer) as a distinct group within the backward classes and given them a sub-quota.        
	In Tamil Nadu, however, a Muslim is not eligible for reservation just because of his religion. Yet, most of the Muslim sub-communities are included in either the Backward Classes or the Most Backward Classes list. The state has thus avoided reservation on grounds of religion, which can be contentious, yet given the benefit to nearly 95 per cent of its Muslims. Andhra Pradesh burnt its fingers with a Muslim quota per se and has reworked it along the Tamil Nadu model.        
	CPM sources said the National Backward Classes Commission would be requested to recommend reservation for Muslims in Bengal to pave the way for the government to act.         
	With a headcount to be done, a quota size fixed and perhaps sub-communities to be identified, the state government may appoint a commission of its own.The CPM also wants to bring in more people under the below-poverty-line (BPL) net in Bengal by reworking the criteria for eligibility, the sources said. Now, even tribals and Dalits are often denied the BPL card because they own some land or send their children to school.        
	Next months meetings of the CPM state committee in Bengal will discuss in detail the need for pro-poor and pro-minority measures.        
	Buddha to PM        
	At his meeting with the Prime Minister today, Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee asked for more funds towards Aila relief.        
	The central government has assured us all help in carrying out relief operations. They have already started giving us some funds and we are expecting more, Bhattacharjee said.        
	He added: The problem is how to construct permanent embankments that can withstand this sort of cyclone. I have proposed (to) the Centre to involve international agencies for consultation, funding and construction of these embankments, especially in the mangrove delta of the Sunderbans. With global warming and cyclonic storms, the Sunderbans is really threatened. The sea level is rising in the area.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Refrain for alliance man gets louder
                                                                                                               Refrain for alliance man gets louder
          RASHEED KIDWAI                          Rahul: Time constraint                                  
	New Delhi, March 7: Everybody wants Rahul.        
	Congress ticket aspirants across the country as well as allies want Rahul Gandhi to intervene in seat tussles that have spread from the heartland to the east.        
	But the clamour for the young general secretarys healing touch is making it difficult for the alliance man to respond to every cry.        
	His role as party strategist and leading campaigner has queered the pitch further.        
	A section of Congress leaders, however, say the responsibilities indicate Rahuls future role on a larger canvass.        
	These leaders feel it implies that while Manmohan Singh would still be the UPAs candidate for Prime Minister, the period after the April-May Lok Sabha elections could see Rahul getting more burdened with political leadership.        
	If the present is any indication, they may not be far off the mark.        
	In Uttar Pradesh, Samajwadi Party leaders want Rahuls intervention to break the deadlock over seats.        
	Mulayam Singh Yadav and Amar Singh have repeatedly expressed no-confidence in AICC general secretary Digvijay Singh.        
	Samajwadi leaders today hinted that if Rahul was brought in, they could increase the Congresss share from 17 to 21 of the 80 Lok Sabha seats in the state. The Congress has already announced 24 nominees but Samajwadi leaders are hoping Rahul could play a pivotal role in withdrawing three of the candidates.         
	The Samajwadis have already communicated to Congress managers that they are against friendly fights.         
	The friendly fight formula has been coined by Digvijay Singh, Amar said speaking informally at an event in New Delhi. However, there is no fight with the Congress, it is just dostana (friendship) among us.        
	Amar said he did not want to insult the Congress, but the party should assess its current status in Uttar Pradesh.         
	In Bihar, Ram Vilas Paswans LJP wants 16 of the 40 seats in the state while the Congresss share has been pegged at five. RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav wants 22 seats.        
	Faced with tough bargaining, the Congress point man for Bihar, Sushil Kumar Shinde, has sought 10 Janpaths intervention.        
	Sources said Congress chief Sonia Gandhi might depute son Rahul to have a word with both Paswan and Lalu Prasad.         
	Bengal, too, is waiting for Rahuls healing touch. A prominent Trinamul leader camping in Delhi said while Rahul was keen to field associate Mahua Moitra from Krishnagar, the Congress should let Trinamul retain Birbhum where Mamata Banerjees party has informally named a candidate.         
	Rahuls role as alliance man kicked off a few days ago when he made a surprise visit to Pune to meet NCP boss Sharad Pawar. The NCP and the Congress later arrived at a consensus on 40 of the 48 Lok Sabha seats in the state.        
	The Maharashtra success prompted many Congress leaders and UPA allies to ask for Rahuls intervention in similar disputes elsewhere.         
	But the young MP faces an acute time constraint.         
	As a Lok Sabha member from Amethi, Rahul needs to spend time in his heartland constituency. As AICC general secretary, he is also expected to attend lengthy screening and central election committee meetings.        
	Following Rahuls suggestion that youths should be given 30 per cent of seats, fax machines at his office have been receiving thousands of applications in addition to requests for personal appointments.        
	Even a senior leader like Veerappa Moily, who heads the AICCs media department, is seeking Rahuls help in getting a ticket from home state Karnataka.

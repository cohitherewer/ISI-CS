          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                           Shashi Tharoor with Congress MP Suresh Kalmadi at Parliament on Thursday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, July 30: Lalu Prasad has got his front-row seat, Shashi Tharoor had to quickly give up his.        
	The Congress today decided to share one of the front-row seats from its quota in the Lok Sabha with the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief, sources said  a move that puts him on the road to political recovery from the election drubbing.        
	Junior foreign minister Tharoor by mistake took a front-row seat in the Rajya Sabha that wasnt meant for him. It was Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs seat. Tharoor quickly shifted to a back seat after Congress MP Rajiv Shukla whispered to him, probably pointing out the mistake.        
	Tharoor then moved to the back row, striking up a conversation with Ashwini Kumar, the Congress MP who was to initiate the discussion for which the former UN official had to be in the House.        
	Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee is the only person who usually sits next to the Prime Minister in the row that can accommodate two. When Tharoor took the seat for a while, neither was present at the House. Nor was Tharoors boss S.M. Krishna in the House then.        
	But the officers gallery had some faces familiar to Tharoor. Senior external affairs ministry officials, such as foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon and his successor Nirupama Rao, were around then.        
	Parliamentary affairs minister Prithviraj Chavan, who was sitting right behind the Prime Ministers chair, was also seen looking at Tharoor curiously when he occupied the front-row seat.        
	Later, a senior Congress MP said new members like Tharoor would have to be told about the conventions in Parliament. The conventions include seating arrangements and intervening in discussions only when the senior cabinet minister agrees.        
	For courtesys sake, a minister of state takes permission from the cabinet minister when he has to speak. These are some conventions a first-time MP may not be familiar with, the Congress leader said.         
	Unlike Tharoor, who has transgressed only a convention, Lalu Prasad wasnt entitled to a front-row seat in the other House, the Lok Sabha. The House rule says parties with five MPs or less should sit on the back benches, and the RJD has just four.        
	The former railway minister has been sending alliance feelers to the Congress for next years Bihar polls, and the Congresss gesture is being seen as an attempt not to completely close the doors on a former ally.        
	Although Lalu Prasad is supporting the UPA government, he hasnt been given a ministerial berth.        
	Party sources said Lalu Prasad was happy that the Congress had decided to let him occupy the front-row seat, which had become a prestige issue of sorts for him.        
	The former railway minister has been sitting in the front row this session but feared being relegated to the back when the formal seat allotments were made.        
	 Getting a front seat has made him more confident. He was telling us it has upset the grim media forecasts about his future, an RJD leader said.        
	There may be a further bonus in store for the party: it may retain its office on the third floor of the Parliament building which was allotted to the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) a couple of weeks ago.        
	RJD sources said they received the eviction notice from the Parliament secretariat a few weeks ago but had learnt that another letter was on the way, asking the party to stay put in its current office.        
	The sources said the BSP, also supporting the Congress-led UPA, might not object as it would be given another office in the building.        
	Lalu Prasad has also kept his door ajar for the Left ahead of the Bihar polls. He had led the communists recent sit-in outside Parliament to protest the price rise.        
	But his recent stance on the Congress has been subtler, with the sound bite-happy leader apparently realising the value of silence.         
	He didnt participate in the discussion on the Indo-Pak joint statement and spent the time sitting relaxed beside Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav.        
	Everyone in our party realises we committed a big blunder by not going with the Congress in the polls, a senior RJD leader said.

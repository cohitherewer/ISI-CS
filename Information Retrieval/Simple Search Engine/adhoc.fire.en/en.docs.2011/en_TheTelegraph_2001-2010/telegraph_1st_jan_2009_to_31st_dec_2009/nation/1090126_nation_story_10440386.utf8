	Patna, Jan. 25: Bihar has been put on high alert and security has been beefed up along the porous Indo-Nepalese border in the wake of the recent terror attacks and the Maoist decision to boycott the Republic Day celebrations tomorrow.         
	Additional director-general Neelmani said that an additional reinforcement of the Seema Suraksha Bal (SSB) has been deployed to carry out intensive patrolling on the borders to ensure that the rebels cannot disrupt celebrations.         
	He said that security has been tightened around the railway stations and tracks that have been targeted in the past and other government establishments, roads and police stations.         
	The superintendents of police have been asked to direct all the police stations under their control to keep a close watch on the movement of people, goods and arms in their respective jurisdictions, Neelmani said, denying any specific intelligence input about the rebels.         
	The additional director-general said that special attention had been paid to the Naxalite-affected areas of Gaya, Jehanabad and Aurangabad in south Bihar and Muzaffarpur, East Champaran and West Champaran districts in north Bihar.         
	The Patna junction railway station and Gandhi Maidan  where chief minister Nitish Kumar is to hoist the Tricolour tomorrow  have already been carefully sanitised by armed men in khaki.

                                                                                                               Nepal temple reopens
                            
	Kathmandu, Sept. 6 (PTI): The Pashupatinath Temple reopened today after a two-day gap amid tight security but Nepals Maoists blocked roads adjoining the 5th-century Hindu shrine and shouted slogans against their government for appointing Indian priests.        
	The former rebels demanded that the Indian priests be removed and Nepalese be appointed through an open competition.         
	The Maoists also held a meeting in which its struggle committee chief, Rishi Sharma, and Maoist-appointed chief of the Pashupati Area Development Trust, Parmananda Shakya, demanded that an independent selection committee be formed to appoint qualified priests by calling applications.        
	The Unesco-listed temple, which was closed on Friday after two Indian priests were thrashed by Maoists, opened its doors to the public at 4am.

                                                                                                               CISF for firms
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 2: The government will promulgate an ordinance allowing the private sector to hire the services of the Central Industrial Security Force to guard their campuses.        
	The Union cabinet gave its nod to the ordinance at a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, science and technology minister Kapil Sibal said. The companies will have to pay for the security cover.        
	The Tatas, Oberois, Infosys and the Jamnagar refineries (of Reliance) have approached me (for CISF cover), said home minister P. Chidambaram. The move was seen as necessary after the Mumbai terror attacks.        
	The hotel industry welcomed it. It is a move in the positive direction. We, the hotel industry, cannot buy certain restricted weapons for our defence. The presence of the CISF is much needed, since hotels cannot be completely secure on their own, said Tarun Thukral, the COO of Le Meridien, New Delhi.         
	IT companies said the move would equip them with multiple layers of security. Mohandas Pai, the HR director of Infosys, said: Security agencies can be an additional source of strength. They can be the first line of defence in a crisis and will enable multiple layers of security. Till now, CISF cover was provided to public sector units and places like airports.         
	The government introduced a bill in the Rajya Sabha to amend the CISF act but it could not be passed as it was referred to a standing committee.

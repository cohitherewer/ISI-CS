The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Three spellers, single dream
                                                                                                               Three spellers, single dream
                                  Kavya, Sidharth: Matter of brain				                           
	Washington, May 27 (AP): The reigning national spelling champion is a 14-year-old boy whose spontaneous jokes kept everyone laughing a year ago. His parents moved to the US from central India, and he wants to be a neurosurgeon when he grows up.        
	Last years runner-up  and one of this years favourites at the Scripps National Spelling Bee  is a 13-year-old Indian-American boy from Michigan. He has also set his sights on neurosurgery.         
	Another favourite expected to be on stage for Thursday nights nationally televised finals is a 13-year-old Kansas girl with a sweet smile. Her family comes from India and she, too, wants to be a neurosurgeon.        
	Is that right? said Naresh Chand, bursting out in laughter. Thats a coincidence. Thats a big coincidence.         
	Naresh is father of Sidharth Chand, whose mishap in the final round last year allowed Sameer Mishra to claim the title.         
	Trailing closely behind both was Kavya Shivashankar, a three-time finalist who tied for fourth.         
	The spelling bee is a contest sponsored by an American newspaper chain that attracts youngsters in the US to face off in round after round of progressively more difficult words. Contestants who misspell a word leave the competition, and the last speller standing is the US champion.        
	Sidharth, Sameer and Kavya have come to know each other through the bee but it never occurred to any of them that they share more than a heritage.        
	They can trace their roots to Balu Natarajan of Chicago, who in 1985 became the first Indian-American national spelling bee champion. He inspired the others.         
	Kavyas heroine is Nupur Lala, who won the bee in 1999. Sameer was motivated when his friend Anurag Kashyap won in 2005. Altogether there have been eight Indian-American champions.        
	Sameer thinks his mind is perfectly wired to study the brain. Its really interesting how I can memorise a lot of words.... Its a really interesting aspect of the brain, he said.        
	Kavya was quick to point out that her idol, Lala, is now a research assistant in the brain and cognitive sciences lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.        
	The origin of Sidharths neurosurgeon ambition is, however, a mystery. He doesnt have any friends from the spelling circle, his mother Sunita said. Hes not a very social kind of a person, so where this neurosurgeon business comes from, I dont have a clue.

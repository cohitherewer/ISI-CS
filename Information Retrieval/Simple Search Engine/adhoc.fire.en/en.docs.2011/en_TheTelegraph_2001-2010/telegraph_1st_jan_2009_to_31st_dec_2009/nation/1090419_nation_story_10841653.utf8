The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Litmus test for BJD MP
                                                                                                               Litmus test for BJD MP
          LALMOHAN PATNAIK                              
	Cuttack, April 18: The battle for the Cuttack Lok Sabha seat would be an acid test for BJDs Bhatruhari Mahtab, whose victory in the last three parliamentary elections was widely credited for the regional partys alliance with the BJP.        
	Many are asking if the clean image of party leader and chief minister Naveen Patnaik will work magic for him this time too when Cuttack goes to the polls along with 10 other parliamentary constituencies in coastal Orissa on April 23.        
	In 1998, when Mahtab pulled off a victory and went on to win the seat in the two successive elections in 1996 and 2004, everyone credited it to the combined strength of the BJP-BJD alliance.        
	But this time he has to prove that he really has a hold over the voters. The Congress is apparently better placed this time compared to the last three elections and it will be a triangular fight as in October 1996 byelection.               
	But the BJD is believed to have a clear edge in at least five of the seven Assembly segments in the parliamentary constituencies. In the forthcoming polls, victory will be inspired by a firmed up joint strategy of the BJD and the Left. We are jointly striving to keep both the Congress and communal forces at bay, said Subash Singh, the president of CPM Cuttack district unit.        
	Mahtab has been seeking votes this time on two issues  the achievements of the BJD government in the state and consistent neglect of Orissa by different governments at the Centre or deliberate step-motherly treatment to the state.        
	The Congress candidate, Bibhuti Mishra, has been piling pressure on Mahtab with national leaders like Ghulam Navi Azad campaigning for him. The BJD government has failed miserably in spending funds sanctioned under the UPA government at the Centre, Azad has lashed out in his public meetings.        
	Sahu, on the other hand, has been trying to mount further heat on Mahtab by urging people to opt for the NDA to ensure stability at the Centre and discard the BJD to save Orissa from an era of maladministration and corruption.

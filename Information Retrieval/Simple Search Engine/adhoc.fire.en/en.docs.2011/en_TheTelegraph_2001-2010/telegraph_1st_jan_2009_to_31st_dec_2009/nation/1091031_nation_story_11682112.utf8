          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	Ahmedabad, Oct. 30: Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi has tested positive for swine flu.        
	Modi had complained of cold, cough and fever after he returned from Russia on Wednesday.         
	Yesterday, when his swab samples were taken, the chief minister insisted on going in for the HINI test, sources said.         
	Doctors have advised the chief minister seven days rest. Modi will be quarantined at his Gandhinagar residence where doctors will attend on him round the clock. All his public functions have been cancelled.         
	Gujarat health minister Jaynarayan Vyas said Modi was responding to treatment. Vyas said we have found the virus at an early stage but also admitted that it was difficult to say how Modi got the infection. The other members of the delegation that had visited Moscow have tested negative for the H1N1 virus.

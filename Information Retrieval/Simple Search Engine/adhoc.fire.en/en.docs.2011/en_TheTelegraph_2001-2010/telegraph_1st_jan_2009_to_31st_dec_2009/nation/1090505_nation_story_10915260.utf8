          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Gaya, May 4: The police have rescued the Class X student, believed to have been abducted yesterday for a forced wedding.         
	But by the time Lal Babu was freed, he had already been married to Babita, 12. He was forced to apply vermilion and get married to the child at an undisclosed location.        
	Yesterday, the boy was kidnapped from Lodipur village under Belaganj police station area, while he was returning from a private coaching centre. The minor groom was recovered from Nawabganj village within Makhdumpur police station limits in the neighbouring Jehanabad.         
	Confirming the grooms recovery, deputy superintendent of police Rajvansh Singh said Kaushalya Devi, the kidnapped boys self-proclaimed mother-in-law, has been arrested and sent to jail custody.        
	Krishna and Anil Yadav, father and brother of Babita, who engineered the kidnapping, are absconding. The bride is currently in a remand home. Three persons, including Kaushalya Devi and Satendra Yadav (a relative), have been sent to jail.         
	Yesterdays kidnapping has major ramifications as Lal Babus neighbours organised a road block and pelted stones on passing vehicles. Two protestors were subsequently run over by a tractor on the NH-83 after the driver lost control of his vehicle. Besides kidnapping, the accused in the case would be charged with promoting, abetting and performing child marriage.         
	According to rumours, the kidnapping was planned after Babitas marriage to Lal Babu broke, as the child brides parents were unable to meet the dowry demands.         
	According to Magadh academics, the incident has put the Magadh social clock back by several decades. Such weddings were common in the Seventies and Eighties in the past century.

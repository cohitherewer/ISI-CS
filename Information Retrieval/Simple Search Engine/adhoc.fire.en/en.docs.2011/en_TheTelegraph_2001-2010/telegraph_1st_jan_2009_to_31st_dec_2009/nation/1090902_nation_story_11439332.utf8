The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pak adds to nuke arsenal
                                                                                                               Pak adds to nuke arsenal
                            
	Washington, Sept. 1 (PTI): Pakistans stockpile of atomic weapons has increased to an estimated 70-90 warheads and the country is developing two new types of nuclear-capable cruise missiles, according to an American scientist.        
	Writing for the Federation of American Scientists (FAS), Hans M. Kristensen cited the latest Nuclear Notebook published in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists to highlight Pakistans expansion of its nuclear warheads.        
	The estimated number of nuclear warheads in Pakistan had gone up from 60 to 70-90 with Islamabads pending introduction of a new ballistic missile and cruise missiles, he said.        
	Kristensen wrote that Pakistans nuclear-capable Shaheen-II medium-range ballistic missile also appeared to be approaching operational deployment after long-drawn preparations.        
	The army test-launched two missiles within three days in April 2008, and the US Air Force National Air and Space Intelligence Centre (NASIC) reported in June 2009 that the weapon probably will soon be deployed, he said.        
	Two types of nuclear-capable cruise missiles were being developed  the ground-launched Babur and the air-launched Raad, Kristensen said.        
	Two new plutonium production reactors and a second chemical separation facility are also under construction.         
	Kristensen said the development of cruise missiles with nuclear capability was interesting because it suggested that Pakistans nuclear weapons designers had been successful in building smaller and lighter plutonium warheads.        
	He also noted that a recent article in the Combating Terrorism Centre newsletter Sentinel had said that most of Pakistans nuclear sites might be close to or even within terrorist-dominated areas.        
	Senior US officials were quoted as saying that the weapons were mostly located south of Islamabad, Kristensen said.        
	According to the latest Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, it is exceedingly difficult to estimate precisely how many nuclear weapons Pakistan has produced, how many are deployed and of what types. However, its nuclear arsenal may not have reached 100 warheads yet.        
	Pakistan is thought to have produced approximately 2,000kg of highly enriched uranium and 90kg of separated military plutonium by early 2008, it said.        
	The country is also expanding its capabilities to reprocess plutonium, it added.         
	Harpoon inspection        
	Islamabad has agreed to mutual inspections of the US- made Harpoon missiles after America accused Pakistan of making illegal modifications in the weapons system which could be used to target India.        
	P.J. Crowley, the assistant secretary of state for public affairs, made the announcement today.

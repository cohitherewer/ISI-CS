                                                                                                               Alert for pilgrims to Pakistan
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 27: The Centre today advised Indians, particularly Sikh pilgrims, to avoid visiting Pakistan because of the deteriorating security situation there.        
	The home ministry advisory in Delhi came hours after some pilgrims were stopped in Punjab from crossing the border after three phone intercepts. The intercepts suggested the Hizb-ul Mujahideen could carry out terror attacks in Pakistans Punjab province, with the visitors as possible targets. The province is home to many gurudwaras.        
	The move upset the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee, which plans to send a batch of pilgrims to Pakistan soon.        
	The government advises all Indian citizens to avoid undertaking any visit to Pakistan till the security situation improves, said the advisory.         
	Sources in the ministry said the Centre also had in mind the fact that several attacks had already taken place in Punjab province.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Left-ADMK poll rift
                                                                                                               Left-ADMK poll rift
          G.C. SHEKHAR                                            
	Chennai, July 25: The CPM and the CPI have defied the ADMKs call to boycott the five Assembly byelections slated for August 18 and will contest against the ruling DMK-Congress alliance.        
	The executive committees of the two Left parties met in Tiruchy yesterday and decided to contest two seats each, leaving the fifth to an ally.        
	Two other allies of the ADMK-led front, the PMK and the MDMK, have supported Jayalalithaas boycott call, saying rigging by the ruling DMK prevent an equal contest.        
	This is the first time a major party will boycott elections to Assembly seats in Tamil Nadu. In the past, the ADMK has stayed away from the polls to the Chennai Corporation and elections to co-operative bodies. The reasons have been the same.        
	Although Tamil Nadus chief electoral officer, Naresh Gupta, has promised free and fair poll, with new EVMs and booth monitoring by central staff, Jayalalithaa has stuck to her boycott move.        
	CPM secretary M. Varadarajan felt staying away wouldnt help matters. Although we accept the ADMKs fears that the elections will not be free and fair, we would rather fight it out on the battlefront. Staying away will only help the ruling party have a cakewalk.        
	He was, however, quick to dispel suggestions of a rift, saying the Left wasnt cutting ties with the ADMK. Contesting the polls, Varadarajan argued, was a tactical issue on which the two sides had taken a different stand. We actually seek the support of local ADMK functionaries for the victory of our candidates, he added.         
	CPI state secretary D. Pandian said the elections would help the Left highlight many issues, such as price rise. Like Varadarajan, he asserted that the CPIs ties with the ADMK were intact.        
	With the Left parties joining the fray, actor Vijayakanths DMDK would continue to be the third player if he decides to field his candidates.        
	The DMK and the Congress are holding parleys on seat-sharing. But indications are that the Congress may contest only the Srivaikuntam seat, which fell vacant after its sitting MLA died recently.        
	The other four seats fell vacant after the defection of two MDMK legislators and one DMK MLA and the resignation of an ADMK legislator elected to the Lok Sabha. The DMK may contest all the four.

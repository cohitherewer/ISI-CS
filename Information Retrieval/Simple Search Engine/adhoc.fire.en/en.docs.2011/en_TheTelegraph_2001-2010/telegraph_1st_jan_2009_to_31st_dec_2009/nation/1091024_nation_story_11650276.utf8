The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | PIL plea for court vigil
                                                                                                               PIL plea for court vigil
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Cuttack, Oct. 23: Judicial intervention into the Rs 110-crore Orissa manganese mining scam gathered impetus with the high court deciding to consider monitoring the ongoing state vigilance department probe into the case.         
	The decision was taken after an additional PIL was filed regarding the scam that involves illegal extraction and smuggling of ore from Keonjhar.         
	P.C. Rout, a Cuttack lawyer, had filed the PIL, admitted on September 14. Responding to it, the bench fixed November 4 as the date for a hearing, said Durga Charan Mohanty, the petitioner counsel, to The Telegraph today. Our plea is for periodic submission of status reports of the probe in the court, he added.         
	So far, the court has admitted three PILs seeking CBI probes into the scam. The two others were filed by Subrat Tripathy, a Berhampur resident, and Rini Rath, a Bhubaneswar lawyer. The petitions pleaded that the powers of the state vigilance department were limited and that weakness could hamper investigation as the role of railway and port authorities and transporters needed to be investigated.        
	The petitions had further tried to drive home the point that mining in Orissa was mostly illegal and being run by people in power. The way the state is dealing with the issue raises the suspicion that it is trying to cover up for some persons.         
	A CBI probe will be rapid and fair. The scam deals with involvement of people across states and violates IPC and Arms Act sections and sections under Orissa Minerals Rules-2007, the petitions had pleaded.         
	The court had issued notices to 23 persons, including the transport commissioner, the secretary of forest and environment department, chairman of the railways and chairman of the Paradip port trust.         
	Eight government officials have been arrested and later released on bail.

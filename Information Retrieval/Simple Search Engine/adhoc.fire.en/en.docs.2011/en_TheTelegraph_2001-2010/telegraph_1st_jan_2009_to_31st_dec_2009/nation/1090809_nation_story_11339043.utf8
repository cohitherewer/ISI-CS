                                                                                                               Fracture after school ragging
                            
	Kapurthala, Aug. 8 (PTI): A Class IX student of a Sainik school was allegedly beaten with sticks and belts by his seniors, fracturing his left arm after which four students were suspended.         
	The incident, which took place last night, came to the notice of victim Lovepreet Singhs father Sukhpal Singh, a resident of Tarn Tarn in Punjab, when he visited the army-run school today for the parents day meet.         
	All parents complained to the school principal, Col Satbir Singh, about alleged indiscipline in the school.         
	The principal suspended four boys of Class XII who were allegedly responsible for the attack on Lovepreet and asked them to bring their parents within seven days. Otherwise, they would be expelled.         
	He assured the parents that the senior boys who ragged the victim would be dealt with strictly.         
	Lovepreet, who had joined the school three years ago, was given first aid at a private hospital this morning when the school authorities came to know of the assault.        
	The boy told journalists that he had complained to house master Yadvinder Singh that some seniors were harassing him last evening. At night, the seniors attacked him.         
	Lovepreet remained unattended throughout the night, his father said.         
	The principal admitted that some seniors used to ask the juniors to bring their clothes from the laundry but denied any ragging earlier.        
	Satbir Singh said he had formed a three-member committee to inquire into the incident and suggest measures to avoid such incidents in future.         
	Lovepreets parents have taken him to Tarn Tarn for treatment.

                                                                                                               Recovery agency boss denied bail
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 11: The Supreme Court today rejected the anticipatory bail plea of the owner of a Delhi-based recovery agency who is facing charges of murdering one of his collection agents.         
	Vikas Mahendiratta, facing murder charges under Section 302 of the IPC, will have to surrender before the trial court and seek regular bail.        
	Mahendiratta was initially charged with abetting suicide after Sajauddin, the recovery agent, fell to his death from the building in Jhandewalan that houses the agency Oxford Management Services. Sajauddin fell on May 13, 2008, and died four days later in hospital.        
	At that time, Mahendiratta had claimed that Sajauddin had jumped out of a window after sustained questioning from other employees about a loan of Rs 22,000 he had recovered from a debtor for HSBC, but had failed to account for.         
	HSBC Noida had called Surender Saini, one of the agencys staff, to inform that they had not received payment of Rs 22,000 from the agency although records showed that it had been collected from the debtor. The agency found that a receipt for the amount was issued by Sajauddin.

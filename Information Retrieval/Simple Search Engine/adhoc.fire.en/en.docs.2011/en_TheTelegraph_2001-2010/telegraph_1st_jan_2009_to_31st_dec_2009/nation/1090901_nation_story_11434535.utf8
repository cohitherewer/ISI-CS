	New Delhi, Aug. 31: Elections in Maharashtra, Haryana and Arunachal Pradesh will be held on October 13, the Election Commission said today. The counting of votes will be held on October 22 and the results declared the same day.        
	With the announcement of the poll dates, the model code of conduct comes into immediate effect, chief election commissioner Navin Chawla said. The provisions of the model code will apply to all candidates, political parties, the state governments concerned and the Union government from today itself.        
	He urged all parties and candidates to abide by the code, which bars them from making appeals for votes based on caste or communal feelings. The code also forbids the Centre and the state governments from making populist announcements that could influence voters.        
	All officials in the states will be treated as being on deputation to the poll panel till the election process is over on October 25, Chawla said.         
	He said electronic voting machines would be used in all three states.         
	Haryana and Maharashtra will go to the polls on the basis of constituencies formed after delimitation. In Arunachal, where delimitation has been deferred, voting will be based on old seats.         
	The Arunachal Assemblys term ends on October 24 and Maharashtras on November 3.         
	The Haryana House, whose term was to end in March next year, was dissolved by the governor on August 21 on the recommendation of the Congress government, which decided to go in for early polls.

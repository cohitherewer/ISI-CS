The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sibal learns lesson in silence
                                                                                                               Sibal learns lesson in silence
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, July 6: Pranab Mukherjees silence in his budget on the education reforms proposed by human resource development minister Kapil Sibal has triggered concerns whether the ministry can meet its 100-day agenda.        
	Mukherjee mentioned no fresh education scheme, in stark contrast to the reforms proposed by Sibal, many of which are a part of the HRD ministrys short-term plans.        
	The budget allocations for the existing schemes and the long-pending schemes may prove inadequate to meet the governments expansion targets, ministry officials said.        
	As part of his 100-day agenda, Sibal had mentioned the National Commission for Higher Education and Research (NCHER), which would act as an overarching regulator and eventually replace the existing regulators such as the University Grants Commission (UGC).        
	At the time Sibal didnt specifically say he would complete the process of setting it up within 100 days, but has on other occasions indicated he would. But the absence of even a mention of the NCHER in the budget has triggered apprehensions about meeting the target.        
	Mukherjee was also silent on the proposed right to education bill, which too is part of Sibals 100-day agenda. Given the whirlwind promises made by the HRD minister, the budgets silence on the proposed reforms is surprising. It casts a cloud on the 100-day plan, a ministry official said.        
	Sources said the NCHER and other reform proposals might be introduced in the supplementary budget, usually presented for Parliaments approval halfway through the fiscal year. But the 100-day deadline will be over by then.        
	Mukherjee, however, has increased the allocation for the UGC by almost Rs 2,000 crore, indicating the government does not see the commissions role in higher education ending anytime soon.        
	Compared with the interim budget, higher education has been allocated Rs 2,000 crore more . The allocation for new IITs is up from Rs 200 crore to Rs 400 crore. But the extra funds may prove inadequate, since a significant chunk will be used for OBC quota-related expansion.         
	A scheme to offer students interest subsidy on education loans  first promised in the UPAs 2004 common minimum programme and mentioned in all budgets since 2006  found mention today too. Progress on the scheme is likely soon, sources confirmed, but its implementation may still take time.

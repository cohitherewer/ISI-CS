The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | If its sugar, BJP plays daddy
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      If its sugar, BJP plays daddy
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                                          The farmers rsquo; rally in the capital to protest the ceiling on sugarcane prices. The farmers also demanded higher state-set prices for their crop. Picture by Prem Singh    
	New Delhi, Nov. 19: The sugar struggle has taken on a life of its own but the BJP wants to be at the centre of all the bitterness.        
	Party chief Rajnath Singh upped the ante and stressed that if the government didnt take back the ordinance for uniform pricing of cane, the BJP would keep stalling Parliament.        
	Government sources claimed that at a Lok Sabha business advisory committee meeting this evening, the BJPs representatives hinted they would be happy if the ordinance was amended to protect the interest of farmers.        
	The BJPs move to grab the initiative to try and emerge as the nucleus of Opposition unity in Parliament came even as the farmer struggle against the Centres pricing system, which discourages states from fixing a higher sugarcane price, gathered momentum on its own.         
	But the partys efforts appeared to have been somewhat thwarted by confusion over how far it should go. Unlike the Samajwadi Party, the Rashtriya Lok Dal or the Janata Dal (United), which could get disruptive without the encumbrance of appearing polite and responsible, it couldnt afford to jump into the well or call the government names. Especially after the criticism it had faced for stalling the House during the tenure of the previous government.        
	At best, we can only exercise the option of forcing an adjournment that we are doing, a source said.         
	Even the adjournment that was forced today was justified on the plea that the government had refused to accept the demand for an adjournment motion in the Lok Sabha and suspension of question hour in the Rajya Sabha for a discussion.        
	This morning, the BJP convened an NDA meeting. Dal(U) leader and NDA convener Sharad Yadav spoke to Mulayam Singh Yadav, while RLD chief Ajit Singh worked the channel to Lalu Prasad.        
	Samajwadi and RJD sources said they wouldnt like to do business directly with the BJP at a time both were working hard to regain Muslim support in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. But these sources also said if the BJP wanted to lend a hand on economic issues like this one, they wouldnt like to make a fetish of their anti-BJPism.        
	To try and soften the Opposition, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee has invited leaders of all parties to breakfast on Monday.         
	We would like to take everyone along and find out what issues they are concerned about. Once that is done, the ordinance can be amended, a government source said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rahul on amity rally
                                                                                                               Rahul on amity rally
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 30: Rahul Gandhi will kick off his election campaign from Maharashtras Wardha tomorrow with the message of communal amity as his cousin Varun Gandhi faces the prospect of a long stint in the cooler.        
	Congress sources said Wardha was picked because of its association with Mahatma Gandhi and Acharya Vinoba Bhave.         
	The Sevagram Ashram on Rahuls stopover list was home to the Mahatma and the venue of a Congress session in 1934. Bhave lived in a village, Pavanar, near Wardha.         
	Wardhas symbolism stands out in the present circumstances. One party (the BJP) is preaching hatred and violence most virulently through the voice of its latest pawn, Varun. He has become a guinea pig in the laboratory of communalism. We want to give a soothing touch through Rahulji, a general secretary said.

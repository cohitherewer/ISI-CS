The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Modi team confirms mega loan for Nano
                                                                                                               Modi team confirms mega loan for Nano
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          State benefits                                  
	Ahmedabad, Jan. 20: The Narendra Modi government has given a loan of Rs 9,500 crore to the Tatas at 0.1 per cent interest to get the Nano project relocated to Sanand, it has been confirmed.         
	Three months after Tata Motors decided to shift the plant from Bengal to Gujarat, and after putting a veil of secrecy over the deal, the state government has finally put on record the incentives it offered to the company for producing the worlds cheapest car. The company proposes to invest Rs 2,000 crore in the project.         
	The details have been made known through a government resolution dated January 1, 2009, listing the incentives offered to the Tatas. The group has been given 1,100 acres in Sanand, 35km west of Ahmedabad.         
	The resolution says: In view of the large investment, potential benefits that this project would provide to the economy of Gujarat and making it an auto hub, the state has offered everything that an industrialist would want to set up a project starting from land, soft loan, water supply and infrastructure facilities.        
	According to the agreement with Tata Motors, the government has decided to give the company a loan of Rs 9,500 crore for 20 years at 0.1 per cent rate of interest.         
	By contrast, the CPM regime in Bengal had offered a subsidy package which included subsidies on land, power, tax paybacks and a soft loan of Rs 200 crore.         
	But the Tatas will have to pay the total price of the Sanand land in eight instalments at an interest rate of 8 per cent per annum, but it will not be liable to pay stamp duty. The rate prevailing at the time of signing the deal was around Rs 36 lakh per acre. This means the Tatas would have to fork out around Rs 400 crore only for the land.        
	The Bengal government had offered lease rental at Rs 1 crore per annum for the first five years, to go up incrementally till the ninetieth year for the 997 acres it had committed to the company.        
	The Gujarat resolution is, however, silent on the existing policy of the state on 85 per cent job opportunities to local people.

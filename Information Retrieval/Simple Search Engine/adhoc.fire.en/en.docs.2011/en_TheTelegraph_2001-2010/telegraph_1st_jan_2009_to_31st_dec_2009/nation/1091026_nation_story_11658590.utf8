The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | PM to Wen: Dalai a guest
                                                                                                               PM to Wen: Dalai a guest
          OUR BUREAU AND AGENCIES                              
	Oct. 25: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has politely indicated to China he will not bar the Dalai Lama from travelling to Arunachal Pradesh, telling Premier Wen Jiabao the Tibetan spiritual leader was an honoured guest.        
	But keeping Chinese sensitivities in mind, he stressed that New Delhi did not allow Tibetans to do politics from Indian soil.        
	I explained to Premier Wen that the Dalai Lama is our honoured guest. He is a religious leader, Singh said today in Hua Hin, a day after he and Wen had met on the sidelines of the Asean-India summit in the Thai town.        
	He added: We do not allow the Tibetan refugees to indulge in political activities and proof of that is that we took resolute action against some Tibetans during (the) Olympics (torch relay) last year following reports that some Tibetan refugees might create problems.        
	The Dalai Lama plans a weeklong visit in early November to Arunachal, a state Singh too visited earlier this month drawing protests from China, which claims that the northeastern state is its territory. Beijing reviles the Dalai Lama as a dangerous separatist, and his proposed visit to Arunachal was cancelled last year following persistent protests by China.        
	Asked if the plan for the Dalai Lamas visit had changed this year, Singh said he was not aware of the monks travel arrangements  an apparent indication that the Tibetan leader still had the green light.        
	Arunachal chief minister Dorjee Khandu, however, said in Itanagar that the foreign ministry had not yet cleared the visit, awaited eagerly in the state.        
	Though the district administration of Tawang had received an intimation from Dharamsala (the seat of the Tibetan government-in-exile in Himachal Pradesh) on the scheduled visit of the Dalai Lama, we are waiting for security clearance from the Centre. Nothing can be said in certain terms until the Centres approval comes, Khandu said.        
	The trip schedule provided by the Tawang administration on Friday says the Dalai Lama will arrive in Tawang on November 8. He is scheduled to visit Bomdila and Itanagar too before leaving for Guwahati.        
	If the visit happens, this will be the monks fifth trip to Tawang, which lay on his escape route from Tibet to India in 1959.        
	Contrary to the Indian sides claim yesterday that Arunachal and the Dalai Lama did not figure in the Singh-Wen talks, the Prime Minister today said: All issues were discussed.        
	He said the boundary problem is a complex issue and cannot be wished away and added he and Wen had agreed that both countries have an obligation to maintain peace and tranquillity along the borders.        
	Singh, who wound up his two-day Thailand visit today, said the two foreign ministers would discuss the problem in Bangalore on Tuesday.        
	CPM general secretary Prakash Karat today said Arunachal is a part of India voicing the partys official but seldom publicised position and hoped Singh and Wen would sort the problems out.        
	As far as our stand is concerned, Arunachal Pradesh is part of India, he said in answer to a question at a news conference after a three-day central committee meeting in Delhi.

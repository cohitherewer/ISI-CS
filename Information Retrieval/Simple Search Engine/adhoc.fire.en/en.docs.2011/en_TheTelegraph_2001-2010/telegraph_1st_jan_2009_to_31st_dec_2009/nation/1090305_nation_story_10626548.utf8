          OUR BUREAU                              
	New Delhi, March 4: Suspense shrouded the outcome of a test of an advanced version of Indias sole cruise missile, Brahmos, tonight with defence scientists and army officials unwilling to disclose whether the missile had struck its target.         
	More than eight hours after the planned 150-second test flight of the Brahmos-Mark II cruise missile in Rajasthans Pokhran firing range, army sources said they were still evaluating whether the 290km-range missile had hit its intended target.         
	The Brahmos supersonic cruise missile  a weapon designed to home onto targets with the help of sophisticated software  has been developed under a joint project between Indias Defence Research and Development Organisation and a Russian company.         
	Several tests of the first generation of Brahmos have already been successfully conducted. The army has already raised a regiment of this first version: Brahmos Mark I.         
	A test of an advanced Brahmos Mark II on January 20 had failed in mid-flight after a successful launch.         
	A few hours after todays test, DRDO sources declared it as largely successful while army sources said they were evaluating whether the mission had met all the general staff quality requirements.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Shashi flutter in US
                                                                                                               Shashi flutter in US
          K.P.NAYAR                          Tharoor in Delhi on Thursday. (Rajesh Kumar)                                  
	New York, May 22: At the UN headquarters here, it feels as if Indias massive exercise in adult franchise is merely confined to one constituency: Thiruvananthapuram.        
	Except at the UN department of political affairs dealing with South Asia, where they look at the big picture, the sole interest among many UN officials in the Indian elections is in the new Lok Sabha MP from Keralas capital, Shashi Tharoor.        
	Last week, as India was waiting for the general election results, this correspondent was peppered with questions about the outcome of polling in Thiruvananthapuram at UN offices that are sprinkled along and off New Yorks First Avenue.        
	The queries turned into long discussions whenever I told someone I was born in Thiruvananthapuram.        
	The questions came from friends and former colleagues of Tharoor, who might have become their boss two years ago, had it not been for a US veto against the Indians candidature to be the eighth secretary-general of the UN.        
	This week, at the Ambassador Lounge at the Millennium UN Plaza Hotel, the popular watering hole for UN officials and diplomats from the permanent missions of 192 UN member states, the chatter, whenever an Indian was spotted, was about Tharoors inclusion in Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs new cabinet.        
	On the 38th floor of the UN building, where the secretary-general has his office, the joke is that Vijay Nambiar, the senior-most Indian official in the world body, readily accepted an impossible assignment to travel to strife-torn Sri Lanka last week because he got tired of answering questions about Tharoor.        
	Nambiar is chef de cabinet to secretary-general Ban Ki-moon and his visit to Colombo was the second since Sri Lanka became a big trouble spot for the UN on account of humanitarian crisis from civil war.        
	If the grapevine here is to be believed, elections in India have figured even in conversations at Bans home. This is because Bans younger daughter, Hyun Hee Ban, is married to a Bengali, Siddarth Chatterjee.        
	Chatterjee volunteered to work in Baghdad as chief of staff to the UN secretary-generals special representative to Iraq, Staffan de Mistura. But UN officials would not confirm, for security reasons, if the Indian was still based in Baghdad, where, as the saying goes, angels fear to tread.        
	On blogs here, there are intense and lively discussions about the likelihood of Tharoor joining the cabinet  and Indias need for a world citizen like Tharoor in the ministry.        
	One blogger, obviously unaware that only citizens can contest elections in India, wrote within hours of Tharoor winning from Thiruvananthapuram: New Yorker or not, American or not, Shri Shashi Tharoor is eminently qualified... show me a better or equally qualified member in the Indian Parliament. I hope he becomes Foreign Minister.        
	Mike Ghouse wrote: I hope to the wisdom of Indian politics will make Shashi the Foreign Minister.        
	Former Indian ambassador T.P. Sreenivasan, who professionally interacted with Tharoor for decades at the UN wrote a column on the day of Tharoors election, which is being widely circulated in north America on the Internet.        
	Sreenivasan, who now lives in Thiruvananthapuram makes the point that never before has any one not born in Kerala or not educated there or not proficient in Malayalam registered an electoral victory in the state.        
	V.K. Krishna Menon and K.R. Narayanan claimed victories on the basis of their accomplishments abroad, but they had their places of birth and educational institutions in Kerala to speak of and they spoke reasonable Malayalam. More significantly, Tharoor has never worked for India or represented India at any international forum. He came, he saw, he conquered.        
	On Tuesday, The Wall Street Journal prominently carried an article by a Malayali banker in New York who took leave from his job to campaign for Tharoor in Thiruvananthapuram.        
	Many readers of the Journal do not recall the newspaper ever carrying an article about campaign experience in one constituency in any country.        
	Tharoors core (campaign) staff comprised of other Keralities who came in from Liberia, Dubai, New York, California, Geneva, Keerthik Sasidharan wrote.        
	About Tharoors future plans, Sasidharan wrote: Should he need us, he can be rest assured that we will still be around for him and India. We, his fellow outsiders.        
	From Nizamabad in Andhra Pradesh, a New York-based non-resident Indian, Madhu Yaskhi, was elected on a Congress ticket, but there is not even a mention of him anywhere in the US.

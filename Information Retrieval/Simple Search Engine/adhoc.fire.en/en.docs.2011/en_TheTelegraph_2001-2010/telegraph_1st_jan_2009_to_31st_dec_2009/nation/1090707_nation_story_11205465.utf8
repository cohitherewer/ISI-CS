	New Delhi, July 6: The Supreme Court today recalled a judgment rejecting a Muslim students right to keep a beard in violation of school rules and referred it to the Chief Justice to be heard again.         
	Justice Markandey Katju, who had said he didnt want Talibans in the country while hearing Mohammed Salims petition, also tendered an apology.         
	Salim had said no one had the right to interfere with religious beliefs in a secular country and sought quashing of the school regulation requiring students to be clean shaven. But Justice Katju said: We dont want to have Talibans in the country.         
	When lawyer B.A. Khan argued that sporting a beard was a fundamental tenet of Islam, the judge said: But you dont sport a beard.         
	A high court verdict supporting the decision of Nirmala Convent Higher Secondary School, Bhopal, to expel Salim for defying rules was upheld.        
	The apex court today said: During the hearing, certain observations were made by one of us. His intentions were not to offend anyone. However, if anyones feelings have been hurt he apologises and expresses his regret in the matter.         
	An apology of this sort is rare in the courts annals. The last time, the apex court had been forced to do that was when a judge had acquitted a rapist on the ground that the victim was a woman of loose morals.         
	Salims petition will now be heard afresh by a bench picked by the CJI.               
	 Srinagar: A 50-year-old father has been arrested for allegedly raping his 13-year-old daughter in Kathua district of Jammu. Chanda Ram, a labourer at a sawmill, chained his minor son before raping his daughter, police said. He has been arrested and a case under section 376 RPC has been registered, an officer said. Chanda had raped the girl at least three times earlier but she did not complain to the police fearing her father, the officer said. Medical tests have confirmed rape.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Judge cries off riot case
                                                                                                               Judge cries off riot case
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Ahmedabad, Feb. 19: A Gujarat High Court judge today refused to hear a plea to cancel the anticipatory bail of a riot-accused minister in the Narendra Modi government.        
	When the matter came up before Justice A.S. Dave, he said: Not before me.        
	Daves refusal means the petition to scrap Maya Kodnanis anticipatory bail, which has become a politically sensitive issue, will have to be heard by a new judge.        
	While a judge is not duty-bound to reveal the reasons for not hearing a case, it is a reprieve for the high-profile junior minister accused of instigating people during the 2002 riots.        
	Kodnanis advocate Mitesh Amin said the minister might be able to attend the entire budget session of the Assembly which gets over on February 27, indicating that the case may not come up for sometime.        
	In effect, the minister got some time, said a leading high court advocate. But its not a permanent solution.        
	The Supreme Court-appointed special investigation team (SIT) had argued in its affidavit that the lower court had not applied its mind while granting bail to the minister of state for women and child development.        
	The SIT had declared the minister and another high-profile accused, former VHP state general secretary Jaideep Patel, absconders after both chose not to respond to summons that were served twice  on January 29 and 31.        
	They surfaced only after the sessions court granted them conditional bail on February 5.         
	The minister told a TV channel she was very much in the ministerial enclave in Gandhinagar.        
	While Patel is a Modi loyalist, Kodnani is known as a protg of L.K. Advani.        
	Kodnani, a three-time MLA from Naroda, is an accused in the Naroda Gam and Naroda-Patia riot cases. Over 90 people were killed in the post-Godhra massacres in these two places.

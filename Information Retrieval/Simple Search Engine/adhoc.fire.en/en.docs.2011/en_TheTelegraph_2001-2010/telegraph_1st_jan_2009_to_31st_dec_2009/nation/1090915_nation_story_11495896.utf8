The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Schools reject girl quota proposal 
                                                                                                               Schools reject girl quota proposal 
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, Sept. 14: The Kendriya Vidyalayas have rejected a central panels proposal to reserve 50 per cent seats for girls and suggested alternative affirmative action, exposing rare differences within the government over quotas.         
	The Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (KVS), which governs 981 schools catering to over a million children, has suggested fee waivers and scholarships instead of quotas to help girl students.         
	The suggestions were put forward during the last meeting of the KVS board of governors.         
	The rejection of the quota proposal was accepted by human resource development minister Kapil Sibal, who conducted the meeting as chairperson of the KVS, top sources on the board said.         
	The minister accepting the rejection of the quota plan suggests that he agrees that strategies of affirmative action other than quotas need exploration, a source said.         
	The quota had been suggested by a panel appointed by Sibals predecessor Arjun Singh to implement a curriculum framework in the KVS.         
	The National Council for Educational Research and Training had in 2005 unveiled a National Curriculum Framework which forms the blueprint for textbooks spanning various subjects across the country.         
	The framework details teaching techniques that teachers, schools and education administrators must focus on to meet students needs.         
	Arjun Singh set up the panel under NCERT director Krishna Kumar to prepare a strategy for the implementation of the framework in the KVS.         
	The idea behind the move, said veteran education administrators, was to make the KVs role models in the implementation of the curriculum framework of 2005.         
	The Kumar panel, in recommendations to help increase enrolment and retention of girl students, suggested that each KV reserve 50 per cent entry-level seats for girls.         
	The schools already enforce quotas for students from the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes. The HRD minister, in addition, has a discretionary quota of 1,400 seats a year.         
	Each MP  543 in the Lok Sabha and 250 in the Rajya Sabha  is entitled to recommend students to two seats, blocking another 1,586 seats.         
	The Kumar panel had recommended that the 50 per cent quota for girls be implemented across existing quotas  half the SC/ST seats would be reserved for girls from these communities, for instance.         
	But the board of governors, a source said, felt the imposition of a gender-based quota would complicate existing reservations and could lead to seats lying vacant.         
	Instead, the board decided to evolve an alternative mechanism. This mechanism should include monetary incentives such as fee waivers and scholarships, it said.

                                                                                                               Singh scores despite nuke block
                                          
	India is learnt to have made a few key bilateral breakthroughs in the direction of neutralising any adverse consequences of the recent G8 resolve to block enrichment and reprocessing technologies unless New Delhi signs the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT).         
	Sources said France had indicated to India during the visit of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh (at the NAM summit in picture on left) to Paris as guest of honour at the Bastille Day parade that nothing in the G8 resolution would be allowed to come in the way of civil nuclear cooperation between the two countries.         
	France was the first nation with which India signed a nuclear co-operation deal after the NSG safeguards clearance and the initialling of the Indo-US civilian nuclear deal last year. The sources also said the Russians, with whom too India has signed a co-operation agreement, have given similar assurances.         
	Thought to be a setback, India has not officially reacted to the G8 proliferation statement adopted at the recent LAquila summit in Italy  We are studying the text of the statement has been the only formal word.         
	Off record, however, senior officials have downplayed adverse implications of the G8 decision and maintained it will not impact Indias progress on the front, especially with regard to nuclear fuel. In any event, we are not seeking ENR facilities from abroad, officials have explained. We have our own ENR facilities.

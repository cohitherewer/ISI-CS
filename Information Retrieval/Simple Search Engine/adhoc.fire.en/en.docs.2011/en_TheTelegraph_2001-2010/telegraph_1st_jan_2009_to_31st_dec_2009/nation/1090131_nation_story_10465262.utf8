The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Milk curdles for Kurien: glare on car, cook amp; guard
                                                                                                               Milk curdles for Kurien: glare on car, cook amp; guard
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Kurien                                  
	Ahmedabad, Jan. 30: Indias milkman could find the cream skimmed off if the Gujarat cooperatives department has its way.         
	Verghese Kurien, the architect of the white revolution and the man behind Amul, may now be stripped of his perks  car, cook and security guard  following a notice to the Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation. The 87-year-old had founded the federation in the mid-70s and headed it for over three decades until he was forced to resign in 2006.         
	The notice, issued by the states registrar of cooperatives, says the facilities should be withdrawn as Kurien is no longer the chairman of the federation.        
	After his retirement, the federations management had decided to continue to offer basic facilities to Kurien, who transformed India into the worlds largest milk producer, as a goodwill gesture. Sources said he continued to offer honorary services to organisations he built like the National Dairy Development Board, Institute of Rural Management, Anand, and the National Cooperative Dairy Federation of India.         
	Kurien, who stays in a modest house in Anand, could not be reached for comment.         
	Sources said the car Kurien uses is a six-year-old Honda Accord. His last drawn monthly salary from the federation was Rs 5,000 which was 29 years ago, said a source. He stopped drawing his salary when he turned 58, the source added.         
	The government, however, appeared to be at odds on the notice with its spokesperson Jaynarayan Vyas claiming they had nothing to do with it.         
	But cooperatives minister Dilip Sanghani not only confirmed but also defended the notice, saying the federation should discontinue the facilities and perks extended to Kurien as he is not entitled to them after his resignation.        
	According to the cooperative act, there is no provision under which a founder-member or chairman can continue to get the facilities after he resigns, Sanghani said.         
	He said the act, which has been in place in Gujarat since 1963, does not mention any such facilities.         
	After the notice was issued, BJP legislator Madhu Srivastav, considered to be a Narendra Modi loyalist and who is also the chairman of Baroda Dairy, proposed that the federations board implement the directive at the earliest.         
	Srivastav, who had made the headlines for allegedly threatening Zahira Sheikh, the Best Bakery case witness, suggested in a recent meeting of the federation board that if the state governments directive is not followed, the board could be dissolved.         
	Mehsana Dairy Cooperative Union chairman Vipul Chaudhary, who had earlier appointed Kurien as adviser, said: The selfless contribution by Kurien should be recognised.

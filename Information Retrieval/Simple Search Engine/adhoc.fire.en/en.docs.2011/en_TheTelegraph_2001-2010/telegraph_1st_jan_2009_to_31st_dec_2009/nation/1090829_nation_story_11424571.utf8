The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Court snubs Shivraj surya namaskar 
                                                                                                               Court snubs Shivraj surya namaskar 
          RASHEED KIDWAI                          Shivraj Singh Chauhan                                  
	Bhopal, Aug. 28: Madhya Pradesh High Court today told the Shivraj Singh Chauhan government not to force students to do surya namaskar after a church body said the BJP-led regime was imposing itself on even minority institutions despite an interim order.        
	In a petition, the Madhya Pradesh Catholic Church said the state government had recently made surya namaskar (sun worship) and pranayam (yogic breathing exercises) compulsory in all schools, including those run by minority institutions, flouting a January 2007 court order.        
	Petitioner Anand Muttungal also sought action against education department officials for the July directive that made surya namaskar compulsory every Saturday morning.        
	A division bench headed by Chief Justice A.K. Patnaik served notices on the states chief secretary, the principal secretary in the education department and others, and asked them to respond within four weeks.        
	Although the petition was against the July directive, sources said the immediate trigger was the threat by education officials in two districts  Jhabua and Rajgarh  to visit two Christian schools to inspect if the order was being followed.        
	The education officials also told the Catholic Mission School, Jhabua, and St Joseph High School, Rajgarh, to keep them posted.         
	Christian and Muslim organisations in the state insist that such directives went against the Constitution, which gives minority institutions freedom to practise their religion.        
	State education minister Archana Chitnis refused comment, saying she would study the court order before responding.        
	Surya namaskar in schools is, however, just one of the issues over which Christian education institutions and the state education department have clashed since the BJP came to power in Madhya Pradesh in 2003.        
	Another subject of conflict is bhojan mantra before government-sponsored midday meals at schools. Chitnis is determined to make bhojan mantra compulsory from Teachers Day (September 5) this year.        
	Christian as well as Muslim leaders are against the move. Bhopal qazi Abdul Latif said he would oppose it tooth and nail as some of the mantras wordings run contrary to Islamic faith.        
	According to Islamic faith, every child learns to say bismillah (I begin in the name of Allah) before eating anything. I dont understand the need for bhojan mantra, he said.        
	Chitnis rejected the claim that the bhojan mantra had a saffron agenda. According to Indian culture, she said, eating food (bhojan) goes beyond just nourishment of the body and influences ones mental and spiritual development.        
	These two aspects emphasising the importance of physical and mental nourishment are captured in the format of a bhojan mantra, which has been selected from the Yajur Veda, she said.         
	Chitnis has another plan, too. About five lakh teachers in the state would soon flaunt Rashtra Rishi badges. Chitnis believes these identity cards will restore the status they once enjoyed in society.        
	The minister is no stranger to controversies. A few years ago, when she was a junior minister under Uma Bharti, Chitnis sent rakhis on Raksha Bandhan to some 21,000 people.        
	While her department bore the expenses, she had teachers up in arms because she got them to act as couriers.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, March 1: Jurists have expressed concern over the plight of senior citizens in the country hoping that proper implementation of Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007, will be able to ensure their right to live with dignity.         
	What they (senior citizens) do not need are old-age homes, but their own homes, where care for the elderly is a part of a familys value system, said Justice Arijit Pasayat, a Supreme Court judge and executive chairman of National Legal Service Authority.        
	Delivering the inaugural address at a seminar Justice Pasayat said the act grants senior citizens the right to apply to a maintenance tribunal seeking a monthly allowance from their children or heirs. There can be nothing more shameful than the fact that such a law had to be brought in, said Justice Pasayat.         
	The chief justice of Orissa High Court was also present at the occasion.

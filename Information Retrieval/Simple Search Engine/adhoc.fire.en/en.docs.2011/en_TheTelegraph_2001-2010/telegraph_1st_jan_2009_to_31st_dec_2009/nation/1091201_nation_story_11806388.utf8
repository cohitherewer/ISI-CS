                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Kaiga probe finds 3-hour window
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Nov. 30: Investigators have apparently narrowed down to a three-hour window the alleged sabotage of a water cooler at a nuclear plant that led to higher radiation levels in employees last week.        
	The investigators are questioning several employees of the Kaiga nuclear power plant, 450km from Bangalore, and have zeroed in on those present on the operating island on November 23-24 night, sources said.        
	All agencies are looking into the matter. Somebody from the lab, who had access to the water cooler, had done it between 3am and 6am (on November 24), junior minister for atomic energy Prithviraj Chavan said.        
	A Kaiga official said the interrogators included nuclear scientists and that plant authorities had written to police too.        
	Nuclear power authorities have said a mischief-maker added heavy water containing the radioactive tritium, possibly from a heavy water sampling vial, through the coolers overflow tube. The probe is looking into the possible involvement of a disgruntled employee.        
	(People) are allowed to enter the plant premises with valid photo passes only, Kaiga station director J.P. Gupta said, adding that checks were done through smart cards based on biometry and radio-frequency identification technology.        
	The computerised access control system has a record of all the personnel who have entered the operating island, he said.        
	The water cooler was located outside the plants first reactor, which has been shut down for annual maintenance since October 20. The area has only a surveillance camera that does not store pictures, a Nuclear Power Corporation (NPC) official said.        
	We will increase the number of cameras and install recordable ones, NPC chairman and managing director S.K. Jain said.        
	He said the CISF intelligence wing and Intelli- gence Bureau were among the investigators. He added that the offence was punish- able with life imprisonment under the Department of Atomic Energy Act and Weapons of Mass Destruction Act.        
	Fifty-odd employees had drunk from the cooler but after flush-out treatment with diuretics, only two showed a minor rise above specified levels of tritium, authorities had said yesterday.         
	Today, the station director said only one had a tritium level close to the specified limit.        
	Karnataka police, who are assisting the probe, said the Kaiga authorities were likely to lodge a formal complaint tomorrow after which a first information report would be registered.        
	Kakodkar retires        
	Today was the last day in office for Atomic Energy Commission chairman Anil Kakodkar. Calcutta-born Srikumar Banerjee, director of the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre in Mumbai and an IIT Kharagpur alumnus, will take over as the new chairman tomorrow.

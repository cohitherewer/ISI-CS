	Shillong, March 18: The Centre today decided to impose Presidents rule in Meghalaya and place the Assembly in suspended animation.        
	Speaker Bindo Lanong confirmed being told the Assembly would be in suspended animation, a parliamentary practice under which the House is kept alive but its activities suspended.        
	This will allow the governor to give the majority group time to form a new government.        
	Governor R.S. Mooshahary sent a report to the Centre last night recommending Presidents rule on the grounds of a constitutional breakdown. The Union cabinet acted on the advice.         
	However, President Pratibha Patil has yet to give her assent to the cabinet decision.         
	The ruling Meghalaya Progressive Alliance had won a confidence vote with the help of the Speakers casting vote, but the governor told the Centre this could not be accepted because of the unconstitutional suspension of five members.        
	Before the trust vote, the Speaker had disqualified five MLAs who had deserted the ruling alliance.         
	With the House in suspended animation, the Congress claimed it had the majority with 32 votes and hoped it would be able to form the government. In the trust vote, each side had got 27 votes.        
	Before staking claim, the Congress is waiting for the Gauhati High Court order on the petition of four MLAs who have challenged their disqualification.         
	The state government has decided to write to Patil against the recommendation to impose Presidents rule. It is also planing to move the Supreme Court.

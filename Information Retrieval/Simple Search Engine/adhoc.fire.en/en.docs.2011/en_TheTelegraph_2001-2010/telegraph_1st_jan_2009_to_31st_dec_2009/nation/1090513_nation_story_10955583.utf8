The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Row over computer as poll bait
                                                                                                               Row over computer as poll bait
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chennai, May 12: Leave alone liquor or money, an Independent candidate from Tiruppur has been arrested for allegedly wooing voters with computers.        
	On a complaint from an ADMK worker, A.M. Karthikeyan was picked up by police yesterday apparently trying to cart a computer for distribution in the Tamil Nadu seat.         
	The machine, which has graduated into a pre-poll sop from a gadget once hated on the ground it would gobble up jobs, was seized.        
	Karthikeyan, freed on bail today, claimed this was a conspiracy by the ADMK, the DMK and a regional party scared of his popularity.        
	He said the machine belonged to one of the Makkal Sevai Mayyam centres, where people were taught computers and yoga. He had started 120 such centres in the past month.         
	When I was coming out of the centre on Monday, a group assaulted me, pulled out a computer from the centre, placed it in the car, took a photo and called police, he claimed.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | In plane amp; out, PM riddle chases Rajnath
                                                                                                               In plane amp; out, PM riddle chases Rajnath
          SANJAY K. JHA                        Rajnath: UP bother				                                 
	Frantic efforts to contact Rajnath Singh yield little result. Captain Gulab Singh Tomar, stationed at Delhi airport to ensure a smooth takeoff for BJP leaders on the campaign trail, looks upset.        
	Rajnathji was supposed to fly at 11am and there is still no trace of him, says Tomar, a local BJP leader who is in the aviation industry. He orders his boys to look out for Hema Malini, who would have reached the airport.        
	Hema appears almost immediately and makes towards the tarmac with a couple of reporters who are to accompany her on a daylong tour of the Mathura-Agra region.        
	Tomars boys, ready with boarding passes, look a little relieved. One of them says: Advaniji, Jaitleyji and Hemaji have gone and now only Rajnathji is left.        
	Jaitley has left for Baroda and L.K. Advani, for whom one small aircraft is always on stand-by, for Karnataka.        
	Tomar asks his boys to be ready since Rajnathji is about to reach the airport. He reveals that the BJP chief had got delayed because he had to record an appeal to voters at All India Radio and Doordarshan.        
	Rajnath appears worried: his first rally was to start at noon but its already 12.15 and he hasnt left Delhi yet.        
	On his way to the private aircraft, he hurriedly asks his secretary, KP, to dial the leaders who were trying to contact him while he was at AIR and DD. The conversation, mostly requests for electioneering from the various states, continues till the plane takes off.        
	Inside the aircraft, its time to ask Rajnath the most obvious question. It relates to Arun Shouries declaration that Narendra Modi would be the BJPs candidate for Prime Minister after Advani.        
	The party president is clearly uneasy: It wont be wise for me to react.        
	He sticks to this stand, thereby also avoiding endorsing Shouries views. Instead, he tries to deflect the question: We are completely focused on crowning Advaniji. I have talked to him in the morning; the report about his sanyas (retirement if the NDA loses this election) is wrong.        
	Rajnath requests the comely flight attendant to serve lunch quickly since he would be landing in 30 minutes. He takes two rotis and small amounts of dal and vegetables in addition to a glass of apple juice.        
	The plane lands in Gwalior, where a small helicopter is waiting to take him to Bhind. He holds a brief conversation with his son Pankaj, who is managing Rajnaths own election in Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh, before takeoff.        
	In 25 minutes, the chopper lands in Bhind. Rajnath speaks briefly on the rising food prices, terrorism and the need for a strong government  and climbs back into the chopper.        
	The next flight is longer. Its a 90-minute journey to Ashok Nagar in Guna constituency, where the Congresss Jyotiraditya Scindia is a formidable opponent. Rajnath downs a few sweets from the food packets forcibly left behind in the chopper by BJP workers in Bhind and goes off to sleep.        
	He is up again in less than half an hour, probably awakened by his worries about his own constituency. He narrates how the Samajwadi Party opted out of the fray in Ghaziabad to help the Congress, which holds the seat. Ghaziabad has around four lakh Muslim voters, and Rajnath was banking on their votes getting split among the Samajwadis, the BSP and the Congress.         
	But before he can think up ways to handle the problem, the chopper lands, alerting him to the challenges in Guna.         
	Rajnath almost repeats the Bhind speech but adds a few new sentences  for instance, on the absence of a dynastic tradition in the BJP.        
	He stresses that most top BJP leaders come from ordinary families  a point that needs to be made as Jyotiraditya is fighting on the plank of his father Madhavrao Scindias legacy.        
	Rajnath cannot make the same point later in his journey, though. In Gwalior, Yashodhara Raje, BJP candidate and Jyotiradityas aunt, is also claiming the royal Scindia legacy.        
	Rajnath holds a news conference in Gwalior, where the Modi question returns to haunt him. He has by then been informed that Modi has said Advani would be Prime Minister after the next election, too.        
	Yet Rajnath is in a dilemma. Its not just his own ambitions, he knows that none of the second-rung leaders would forgive him if he gave any preferential treatment to Modi.        
	He meets BJP workers at a hotel before addressing the 9pm rally, his last of the day.        
	On the way back, his secretary tells him people are waiting at his residence, and advises him to have his dinner on the plane. He asks for rice, dal and a few gulab jamoons.        
	As he leaves the airport for home around 11pm, Rajnath asks his secretary: Kal kab nikalna hai (When do I have to set off tomorrow)?        
	The reply is quick: Nine clock.        
	 Bhind, Guna and Gwalior vote on April 30; Ghaziabad on May 7

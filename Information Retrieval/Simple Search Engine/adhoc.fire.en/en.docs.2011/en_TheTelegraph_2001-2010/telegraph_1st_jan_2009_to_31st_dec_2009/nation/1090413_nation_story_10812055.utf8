          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                               
	Bhubaneswar, April 12: Orissas politicians are promising the people rice at the lowest possible rates even as prices of other essential food items hit the roof.        
	The Congress and the BJP have mentioned rice in their manifestos, concerned that chief minister Naveen Patnaiks Rs 2-a-kg rice for below poverty line (BPL) ration card holders may give him an unfair advantage. Each cardholder gets 25kg of rice every month.        
	The Congress changed its manifesto after declaring that it would provide rice at Rs 3 per kg, overlooking the fact that it was already being given at Rs 2. The party realised the gaffe, but only after being mocked at by CPM general secretary Prakash Karat.        
	After the revisions, the Congress announced rice at Re 1 per kg. To spice up the promise, it added salt and onion and pulses to the list of sops, to be offered at just prices.        
	But many are questioning the promises. The Congress was in power in the state for over 15 years, why didnt the idea strike the party then? asked Bijay Kumar Dhir of the NGO Orissa Orissa.        
	Congress chief minister-aspirant K.P. Singhdeo has accused Naveen of trying to claim credit in an unfair manner. He claims the Centre has been waiving Rs 11 on every kg of BPL rice  assuming a market rate of Rs 14  being supplied in the state at Rs 2 a kg, with the state subsidising only the remaining amount. How can the BJD (Naveens party) claim credit for it?         
	The Congress placed ads in Oriya dailies giving a break-up of the way the scheme has been funded. But some said it was too late. The state will hold the Lok Sabha and Assembly polls on April 16 and 23.         
	In many ways, the BJP sparked the price war, promising rice at Re 1 per kg, dal at Rs 5 per kg and free salt to the BPL families on March 30  five days before the Congress offered similar baits.        
	The BJD, which parted ways with the BJP last month, had said: How can the BJP promise rice at Re 1 a kg in Orissa when it did not think of implementing the scheme in states ruled by the party?        
	While the politicians remain obsessed with rice, potatoes cost Rs 11 a kg and onions Rs 15. None of the pulses is available at less than Rs 50 a kg. Cooking oil prices start from Rs 38 while sugar is Rs 24 a kg.

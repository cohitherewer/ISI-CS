	Melbourne, June 29 (PTI): An expectant Indian-origin mother fell off a luxury cruiser and drowned off the coast of Tweed Heads in Australia.        
	Police divers found the body of Prashila Wilson, 37, near the cruiser from which she had disappeared last weekend, the Herald Sun reported today.        
	Superintendent of police Michael Kenny said Wilson could not swim and her companion had reported her missing on Saturday.        
	The police said the couple, from Robina on the Gold Coast, spent a lot of time on their cruiser.         
	Sailor missing        
	A sailor from Kerala working in a container ship has apparently fallen into the sea off the coast of Iran.        
	The Iranian navy has launched a search operation to trace 33-year-old Liju K. Philip after a request from the Indian government.        
	One of the employees on the ship was said to have seen Liju lose his balance and fall into the sea.

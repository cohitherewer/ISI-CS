	Mumbai, Dec. 7 (PTI): Two contract workers have been arrested for allegedly trying to take computer parts out of the Tarapur Atomic Power Station, but plant officials denied any security breach.        
	Prashant More of Jena Engineering and Amit Shelke of Yash Tours and Travels were found carrying the computer power supply parts in a vehicle on November 1 without a valid gate pass from the high-security nuclear plant. Recently, a mischief maker contaminated a cooler with radioactive Tritium at the Kaiga nuclear plant in Karnataka.

          SHEENA K.                          A file picture of Sonmoni Bohra                                  
	Raipur, Nov. 2: Government proposes, chief minister disposes  and the hapless bureaucrat is somewhere in the middle.        
	A senior bureaucrat in Chhattisgarh and his family had to face humiliation when the state government debarred him from accepting an administrative award, for which he was chosen by the administration earlier.        
	Sonmoni Borah, the Bilaspur district collector, was selected for Shahid Veer Narayan Singh Award for his exemplary service in the field of development among tribal and backward communities.         
	The award is conferred every year on the states Foundation Day, which is celebrated on November 1.         
	Borah and his family reached Raipur yesterday evening to receive the award at the Foundation Day function, being held on Science College grounds late in the evening.        
	However, the family, which was in a celebratory mood, was informed of the slight change in plans seconds before the function was to begin.         
	Borah is an IAS officer of the 1999-batch.         
	Sources said that Borahs name was deleted at the last moment following strong resentment expressed by chief minister Raman Singh, who believed that it was not proper for government officials to receive awards for their job.         
	Singh was in South Africa when the selection committee finalised recipients of the state awards.         
	He returned to the state capital yesterday afternoon.        
	And when he was informed about the recipients, he took strong note of the decision to include Borah in the list.         
	Bureaucrats soon swung into action and debarred the IAS official from the list.         
	Chief minister Raman Singh defended his stand and said he did not wish to set a precedent in the state by giving awards to bureaucrats.         
	What the officer (Borah) did was a part of his duty, as he works for an implementing agency, the government, which aims to formulate and implement schemes for the benefit of the people, said Singh while talking to reporters today.         
	And bagging the award for discharging duties was not appropriate or justifiable, he added.         
	In future, the government will see to it that just mistake is not committed again, the chief minister added.         
	Borah, who hails from Assam, had taken a number of initiatives for the welfare of children belonging to tribal and backward communities.         
	As a district collector of Kawardha and Raipur, he was responsible for admitting a large number of children of the deprived communities to expensive public schools under different government schemes.        
	Borah was also preparing a few students for the engineering and medical entrance examinations.

	New Delhi, July 28: A change in the planned use of land acquired for a public purpose does not invalidate the acquisition, the Supreme Court has ruled, reports our legal correspondent.        
	Once land has been legally acquired, it becomes the property of the state which, if it wants, can use it for a public purpose different from the one originally announced, a two-judge bench said last week.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rahul and Montek on PMs mind   PC likely to stay at home
                                                                                                               Rahul and Montek on PMs mind     PC likely to stay at home
          RASHEED KIDWAI                          Priyanka and Rahul Gandhi after receiving his victory certificate for Amethi. (PTI)                                        
	New Delhi, May 16: Till late tonight, Manmohan Singh was contemplating two crucial matters: how to persuade Rahul Gandhi to join his council of ministers and who to pick as his finance minister.        
	For most part of the day, the Prime Minister had been worried about the Sivaganga verdict and kept asking his aides about P. Chidambaram, who trailed till late afternoon before wresting the seat.        
	That over, Manmohan reportedly voiced his desire that Chidambaram should continue in North Block instead of moving to the finance ministry where he had served from 2004 to 2008.         
	Sources said Manmohan appeared more than keen to assign the home portfolio to Chidambaram where he had initiated many critical measures to check terror and militancy.        
	The Prime Minister was of the view that Chidambaram alone would provide the push required to tone up the security and intelligence apparatus. Indications were that Sonia Gandhi shared his perception.        
	The top two also appeared unanimous that Pranab Mukherjees deft handling of foreign policy matters called for his continuation in the external affairs ministry.        
	As leader of the House in the Lok Sabha, Pranab will, in any case, continue to head a large number of ministerial panels and groups.        
	For finance minister, Manmohan has several names in mind. His first choice is Montek Singh Ahluwalia, now the deputy chairman of the Planning Commission.        
	Sources said the Prime Minister felt Montek  he shares Manmohans vision on key economic issues  was best equipped to deal with the challenges brought by the economic slowdown.        
	Monteks lack of political profile could, however, come in the way. But Manmohans camp sounded confident that given a free hand, Montek would move to finance.        
	Congress leaders said if Monteks candidature hit a roadblock, Manmohan might pitch for C. Rangarajan. But like Montek, he too has an apolitical face.        
	Sources said there were other aspirants in the Congress for finance such as Kamal Nath, Kapil Sibal and Prithviraj Chavan.        
	Defence, the fourth key portfolio, appeared open to negotiation. Although the Congress would retain it given a chance, sources said NCP boss Sharad Pawar could stake claim if he wanted an elevation from the agriculture portfolio.        
	There was also a growing feeling that Sonia-Manmohan should drop senior ministers like Arjun Singh, A.R. Antulay and Sis Ram Ola and bring in new faces like Digvijay Singh, Salman Khursheed and others.        
	Newly elected MPs from Uttar Pradesh were reportedly hoping for a fair representation in the council of ministers so that the Congresss past glory in the Hindi heartland could be regained. Sources said Lok Sabha MPs from Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh shared the same sentiment.        
	Other ministers like Sibal, Ambika Soni, Chavan and Oscar Fernandes, too, were hoping for better portfolios.        
	There was a view that the leadership should make use of the experience of some Congress chief ministers, but sources said Sonia would take the final decision.        
	Sources said Mamata Banerjee could be eyeing railways and two minister-of-state berths and the DMK hoping for cabinet posts for Kanimozhi, Dayanidhi Maran and Azhagiri.         
	DMK chief M. Karunanidhi is expected to land in Delhi on Monday to meet Sonia.

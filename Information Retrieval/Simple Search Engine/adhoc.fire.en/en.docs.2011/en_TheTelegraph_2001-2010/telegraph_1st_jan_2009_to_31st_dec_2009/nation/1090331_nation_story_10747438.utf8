The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | JD(U) veteran quits party
                                                                                                               JD(U) veteran quits party
                            
	Patna, March 30 (PTI): The JD(U) in Bihar received a jolt today when three-time chief minister Jagannath Mishra severed his ties with the party and decided to work towards the formation of a secular government at the Centre.        
	I will not hesitate to share a platform with the RJD and the LJP or for that matter with Congress leaders party and the Left, said Mishra addressing reporters. My motive after quitting my post as the national president of JD(U)s farmers cell will be to defeat NDA candidates in Bihar and form of a secular government at the Centre, he said.         
	Mishras son, Nitish Mishra, the minister of state for disaster management, had already resigned from the Nitish Kumar-led cabinet alleging that the Brahmins received a raw deal in ticket distribution by the JD(U).         
	Endorsing his sons stance about the partys decision not to nominate a single Brahmin for the Lok Sabha election, the veteran leader said though the community constitutes about 9 per cent of votes and had voted in favour of the NDA in 2004, the JD(U) did not field a single candidate from the community.        
	Nitish was disturbed after the JD(U) denied tickets to Brahmin candidates in Jhanjharpur, Madhubani or Darbhanga, Mishra said.        
	Stating he would campaign individually for any secular candidate, Mishra asserted: I have been a secular person and will campaign for a secular candidate. I have conveyed my thoughts to Lalu (Prasad) and leaders of other secular parties including the Left.        
	Mishra rued that he was never invited to any JD(U) functions, including the partys brainstorming session in Rajgir in 2008, and so he viewed himself as a man free from obligations. Mishra said his decision also stemmed from the fact that seasoned JD(U) politicians were all denied tickets.        
	When such leaders have no place in the party, the JD(U) is bound to be doomed, Mishra said.        
	He also blamed the slip-shod relief work promoted by the Nitish Kumar-led government after the 2008 Kosi floods.

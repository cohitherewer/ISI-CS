The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Experts seek land ceiling like Bengal
                                                                                                               Experts seek land ceiling like Bengal
          CITHARA PAUL                                          
	New Delhi, Oct. 24: The Centre has been asked to impose the Bengal model of land distribution across the country by a panel it appointed to suggest land reforms.        
	The non-binding advice, which recommends rural land ceilings more stringent than those in Bengal, comes at a time the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government has tried to raise those limits to promote industry but seen its efforts stalled.        
	The panel, set up by the rural development ministry, also discourages the use of farmland for industry.        
	Stating that land ceiling as a re-distributive programme is of as much relevance today as it was 50 years ago, the committee has recommended limiting personal landholdings to 5-10 acres of irrigated land or 10-15 acres of non-irrigated land.        
	In Bengal, the ceiling in non-irrigated areas is 17 acres and in irrigated areas, 12 acres. Left-ruled Bengal, Kerala and Tripura are the only states with rural land ceilings, the limit for irrigated land in Kerala being 15 acres. Some other states have tried and failed to enact land ceilings.        
	So, although the report on State Agrarian Relations and the Unfinished Task in Land Reforms was handed in last January, the Centre has been unwilling to reveal its contents given their controversial nature.        
	The standard reply from officials has been: The ministry is going through the recommendations and will reveal them at the appropriate time.        
	The commission was formed as a follow-up to the National Land Reforms Council, set up by the Prime Minister in 2008. It was headed by rural development minister C.P. Joshi and included experts such as A.K. Singh of Lucknows Giri Institute of Development Studies, B.K. Sinha of the National Institute of Rural Development and P.K. Jha of the School of Economic Sciences and Planning, JNU.        
	Although the recommendations are not binding, sources said, the report is significant since the rural development minister heads the committee.        
	The panel has not mentioned the debate over whether smaller landholdings  a necessary impact of a ceiling  bring down productivity in the long run.         
	Many economists believe the debate has been clinched as Bengal, Kerala and Tripura witnessed marked rise in productivity after land reforms. After the land re-distribution in Bengal in the late 1970s, the yield had increased 60 per cent, with economists attributing it to the extensive cultivation possible on smaller plots and the new owners enthusiasm.         
	However, some others still argue that smaller holdings make it uneconomical to use expensive farm technology, such as tractors. But that argument applies only to advanced capital-intensive agriculture, a very small part of Indias agrarian economy.        
	Bengals Left Front government, the architect of the land reforms in the state, recently tabled a bill in the Assembly to relax the rural ceiling to facilitate commercial farming, farm products business and other industry. The bill has been sent to a House panel that has not been able to take a decision yet.        
	Joshis panel has made a slew of other recommendations (see chart). A potentially controversial one is the suggestion to scrap the exemptions to religious, educational, charitable and industrial organisations.        
	Various educational and religious institutions have been acquiring land across the country using the exemptions granted by state governments. The panel says religious institutions should be allowed only a single unit of 15 acres.        
	Criticising the widespread conversion of farmland for non-agriculture purposes, the committee says this has led to a fall in food production.        
	The inequitable distribution of benefits from the new land use, insufficient quantity of compensation, and rehabilitation not operationalised properly are leading to enormous dissatisfaction among the project-affected people. This ultimately is leading to gruesome social unrest as witnessed across the country and such violence can escalate and spread if the conversion of land is not addressed relevantly, it says.        
	It recommends that cultivable land should be the last option when acquisition is done, and if such land has to be taken over, the consent of all stakeholders is a must.        
	The committee has also questioned the land re-distribution initiatives undertaken by various state governments apart from Bengal, Kerala and Tripura. It says the land assigned to the poor were mostly uncultivable, and where cultivable lands have been assigned they were not under their possession.        
	It adds that the Bhoodan movement initiated by Acharya Vinoba Bhave in the 1950s faced major blocks since most of the land donated was not good enough for cultivation and in most cases, much of the donated land did not reach the poor. It asks state governments to do a survey to ascertain the current status of these plots.        
	Suggesting a new round of land redistribution, the committee says the list of beneficiaries in fresh assignments should be selected by (the) gram sabha. It has suggested a single-window approach to redistribution of ceiling-surplus land.        
	The panel has also cited the massive encroachments on government land in the Sunderbans in Bengal and the Aravalli and Satpura regions of Madhya Pradesh.        
	The panel is also concerned that the corpus of tribal land is in serious danger of erosion. It says 4.3 million hectares of forestland have been diverted for non-forest use and that 55 per cent of this diversion has taken place after 2001.        
	It recommends that the gram sabhas be recognised as the competent authority for all matters relating to transfer of tribal land.        
	According to the panel, the autonomous district councils in the Northeast have failed to perform their task. There is an urgent need for codification of the traditional rights of the village councils.

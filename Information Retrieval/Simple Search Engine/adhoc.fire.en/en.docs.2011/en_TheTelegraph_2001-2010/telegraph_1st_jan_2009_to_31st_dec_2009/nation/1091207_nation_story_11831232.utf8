The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Ulfa Barua back in China 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Ulfa Barua back in China 
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 6: Ulfa commander-in-chief Paresh Barua slipped back into China from Myanmar last week, sources said.        
	Barua was in touch with his contacts in Assam through a satellite phone while staying in Myanmars Kachin state till December 2, the sources said.         
	He moved into Chinas Yunan province with help from his contacts which, according to the sources, may be from within the Peoples Liberation Army.         
	Over the past year, Barua has been moving in and out of China, from which other insurgent groups like the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah) are said to have received help in the past.        
	But ironically, a senior NSCN (IM) leader today questioned Baruas hardline stand. If Paresh Barua continues to have contacts with other terrorist organisations, how will the government of India talk to him? the NSCN leader said over phone from Dimapur.         
	Violent methods are not good always, he should try something else, the NSCN leader added.

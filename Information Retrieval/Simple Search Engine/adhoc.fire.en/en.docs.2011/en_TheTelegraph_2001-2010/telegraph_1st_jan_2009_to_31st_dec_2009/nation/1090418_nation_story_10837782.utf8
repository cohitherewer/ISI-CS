The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cong, BJP confident of win
                                                                                                               Cong, BJP confident of win
          SHEENA K.                               
	Raipur, April 17: The summer heat and poll hours being cut shorter attributed to a lukewarm turnout at Chhattisgarh booths.         
	In all, 52 per cent of the 15.4 million eligible voters exercised their franchise in yesterdays polls, state election officials said in Raipur after compiling the final figure today. In the last Lok Sabha elections, held in 2004, the state had recorded 52.09 per cent polling.         
	The turnout seems especially weak if one takes the Assembly elections into consideration. The election that concluded six months ago (in November) saw 70 per cent of the states voters come out to vote. Political parties were ready to blame Mother Nature and the Election Commission (EC) for the less-than-average polling in the state.         
	Scorching heat prevented people to come out of their homes and cast their votes, said BJP state general secretary Shivratan Sharma.         
	Moreover, the EC did not publicise the new polling hours after it was cut short by an hour. Many voters did not know that they had an hour less to travel to their booth and waited till the heat was less, Sharma added. He predicted that the summer heat made many venture out after 3pm and they reached later than the polling time. The EC could have launched an extensive campaign to make the voters aware of the change in timings, the leader rued.         
	The turnout may have left them disappointed, but leaders of the main political parties BJP and Congress  were sure that the average polling was in favour of their candidates.         
	Chief minister Raman Singh said he was confident that the BJP would bag maximum seats. Pradesh Congress Committee President Dhanendra Sahu established that voters were fed-up with the BJP rule. He was confident that the vote, sealed in the electronic voting machines were all in favour of the Congress.

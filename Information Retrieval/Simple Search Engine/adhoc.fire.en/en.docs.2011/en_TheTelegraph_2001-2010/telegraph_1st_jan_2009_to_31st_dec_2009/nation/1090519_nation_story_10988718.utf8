The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Vote share shatters myth of invincible Modi
                                                                                                               Vote share shatters myth of invincible Modi
          BASANT RAWAT                                            
	Ahmedabad, May 18: The election results from Gujarat have exploded the myth of Narendra Modis invincibility.         
	The chief minister, who was being billed to lead the party nationally in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, suddenly looks vulnerable on what was touted as his impenetrable bastion, losing a substantial chunk of his vote share to the Congress.        
	Modis publicity machinery argues that his aura remains intact  the BJPs tally has gone up, even if by one, to 15. The Congress, in comparison, has lost a seat, ending up with 11.         
	But a scrutiny of the poll data released by the Election Commission shows that the BJPs vote share in the 18 months since the 2007 Assembly elections has come down from 49.12 per cent to 46.52 per cent  a drop of 2.6 percentage points. It is also lower than what the party had polled in the 2004 general election when it secured 47.37 per cent.         
	In contrast, the Congress, a house divided in the state, has increased its vote share substantially. It got 43.38 per cent this time, a jump of more than five percentage points over the 2007 figure of 38.        
	Even the number of votes polled by the two parties is revealing. The BJP has its nose ahead but only just, securing around 5.5 lakh votes more than the Congress across the states 26 constituencies.         
	Congress sources admitted the tally could have been different had the party set aside internal differences and worked out a clear strategy, as it did in Uttar Pradesh. The Congress lost three seats  Panchmahal, Junagadh and Amreli  primarily because of overconfidence, lack of co-ordination and infighting.        
	In several booths in Panchmahal, from where textiles minister Shankersinh Vaghela contested, the Congress did not even have polling agents. Vaghela lost to the BJP by a mere 2,069 votes. Infighting also cost the party in Junagadh and Amreli, seats it had won in 2004.        
	While the Congress lost two seats, it wrested three in Patel-dominated Saurashtra, considered a BJP stronghold, where the ruling partys share has dipped by five percentage points. In Rajkot, the BJPs vote share crashed by as much as 15.99 percentage points, from 59.52 per cent in 2004 to 43.53 this year. The BJP lost the seat for the first time in two decades.         
	The biggest setback for Modi was the defeat of his handpicked Congress defectors in Surendranagar, Patan, Dahod, Kheda and Rajkot. There was a feeling of aversion among the workers who did not work for them, said a BJP source.         
	Loyalists accept that the results have put the brakes on Modis national ambitions. His image has got diluted. It will take a few years before he can re-establish himself. He will have to work out his strategy afresh, said a BJP leader close to Modi.

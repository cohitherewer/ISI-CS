The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Heady fragrance of lotus in Maratha hub
                                                                                                               Heady fragrance of lotus in Maratha hub
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI IN BEED                                            
	As the BJP campaign vehicle passed by, loudly seeking votes, an animated Ganesh Thulaiyya jumped from his seat at his family telephone booth.        
	Munde! Munde jeetenge; kamal khilega (Munde will win; the lotus will bloom), he screamed.        
	Around him no one seemed to mind  many others too appeared caught up in similar, though less vocal, excitement.        
	If Aurangabad is the head of the Marathwada region of Maharashtra, Beed is its heart, and saffron support here is almost heady.        
	The BJPs most prominent leader in the state, Gopinath Munde, is from Beed and is contesting his first Lok Sabha election here this time, making his maiden foray into national politics.        
	The Other Backward Classes leader is the favourite here. Even the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), which holds the seat and is contesting against Munde, concedes it has a lower chance of winning here than Sharad Pawar has of becoming Prime Minister.        
	But the real challenge for the BJP-Shiv Sena alliance is to translate Mundes popularity in Beed into seats across its traditional Marathwada stronghold.        
	The region, as its name suggests, carries its Maratha identity on its sleeve and, for the past two decades, has supported the Shiv Sena and the BJP in repeated elections for their perceived support to the Maratha cause.        
	Marathwada is made up of eight districts  Aurangabad, Jalna, Beed, Parbhani, Hingoli, Nanded, Latur and Osmanabad  each a parliamentary constituency.        
	In 2004, the BJP-Sena combine won six of the eight seats, sharing them equally. The NCP captured the remaining two, Hingoli and Beed, blanking the Congress.        
	The BJP, which had won Latur in 2004, is this time pitted against the Congresss Jaywant Awale, who may be the favourite thanks to former chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukhs determination to win back his fief for his party. But BJP ally Shiv Sena stands to do well in Hingoli, which voted on April 16.        
	Hingoli sitting MP Suryakanta Patil of the NCP, the Union minister of state for rural development, faces a tough challenge from Sena MLA Subhash Wankhede, regarded as one of the most unconventional yet powerful political orators in Marathi. The NCP is making last-minute efforts to salvage the seat but accepts that Wankhede has the edge.        
	Osmanabad promises to offer the most nail-biting fight in this region  between former state home minister Padamsinh Patil of the NCP and Ravi Gaekwad of the Sena.        
	The Congress holds power in the zilla parishad and most municipal councils in this district and was adamant about contesting the seat this time. But Pawars party squeezed the seat out for itself in the sharing arrangement between the two parties.        
	Local Congress workers, many of whom refused to attend a Pawar rally in support of Patil here recently, threaten to play spoiler for the NCP.         
	In Jalna, the Sena-BJP and Munde in particular appear to be striking a chord with voters using the argument that neither the Congress nor the NCP even wanted the seat.        
	In the tussle over Osmanabad, which the NCP had lost in 2004, the Congress had offered Jalna this time in a swap. The Congress had lost Jalna in 2004. The NCP refused and the Congress remains saddled with Jalna. Its candidate is Kalyan Kale.        
	If the Congress doesnt want Jalna, why should Jalna want the Congress? Thats our theme here, a local BJP leader said.        
	The Senas Chandrakant Khaire, sitting MP from Aurangabad, is contesting from the seat again, against Uttam Singh Patil of the Congress. Khaire had won with a massive margin in 2004, polling 52.37 of the votes compared with runner-up Congresss 39.01 per cent.         
	Although Munde, brother-in-law of the late BJP leader Pramod Mahajan, is contesting his first Lok Sabha election, he is touring all Marathwada constituencies, campaigning for the BJP-Sena alliance and drawing massive crowds. He was in Latur on Monday, and in Parbhani and Nanded before that.        
	Maharashtras 48 seats  the most any state sends to the Lok Sabha after Uttar Pradesh  are currently shared equally by the Congress-NCP-Republican Party of India alliance and the BJP-Sena coalition.        
	How Marathwada votes could play a key role in deciding whether either combine corners a larger share of the pie this time.              
	 Hingoli, Parbhani and Nanded voted on April 16; Aurangabad, Beed, Latur, Jalna and Osmanabad go to the polls on April 23

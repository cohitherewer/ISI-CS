	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 22: On the outskirts of Bhubaneswar at Mission Ashra, some of the organisations members are busy searching for a name for a baby boy. Finally, they find the right name  Aditya.         
	Adityas mother, a mentally ill woman, was found in an advanced stage of pregnancy at the Capital Hospital by authorities, who called in Ashra.        
	The yet to be identified woman is just one of many women who live as beggars after being abandoned by their families. They are thrown in to a vulnerable life of diseases, sexual exploitation and poverty.        
	Her baby is not the first one arriving at the shelter and it houses as many as 12 children along with their mothers who undergo treatment at the shelter. With Aditya, the number of children has now risen to 13. Although the children stay in the same campus in Ashra, they are kept in separate quarters and are allowed to meet mothers as and when required. Often the child helps the recovery of the mother leading her to a normal life.         
	The baby was born at Capital Hospital and authorities there wanted us to keep the mother and child, said programme manager Nibedita Mohapatra.         
	The new mother was reportedly found unconscious on the hospitals veranda. The authorities do not know how she reached the hospital, but attendants carried her to the maternity ward where she gave birth, said Mohapatra.        
	We did a general check up and found that her (mothers) condition was not stable. We are keeping a watch, said Zair, a staff. He went to add that in many cases families accept the children if and when they are identified, if it is a male child.         
	The mission also helps terminate pregnancies if they see that the pregnancy would prove to be harmful to the woman. We go in for abortions if the foetus is less than three months and if it is not risky for the mother, said Mohapatra, adding that in most cases the mission tries to bring in the children into the world healthy and safe.         
	Till date, the home has rescued 221 mentally ill women from the street. Of them 155 women are still being treated, while 55 women have been reunited with their families.         
	The oldest kid in the mission is 10-year-old.         
	Missions children go to a nearby anganwadi school and are taken care of by two in-charges.

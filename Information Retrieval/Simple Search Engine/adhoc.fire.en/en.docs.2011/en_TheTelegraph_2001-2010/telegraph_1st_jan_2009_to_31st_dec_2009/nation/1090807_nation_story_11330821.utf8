The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | For forest land, ask panchayat 
                                                                                                               For forest land, ask panchayat 
          CITHARA PAUL                               
	New Delhi, Aug. 6: If you need forest land for projects, knock on the doors of gram panchayats before the state governments.        
	The Centre has for the first time made the approval of local administrative bodies mandatory for use of forest land in a multi-layered process that so far involved only forest departments of states.         
	The directive, which also applies to government plans, has been sent through a letter that the Union ministry of environment and forests has written to all state governments. But existing projects will be out of the new norm.        
	The move meets a long-standing demand of tribal activists and the tribal affairs ministry, which believe such powers will give local people greater say in their areas development.        
	The letter, sent to state chief secretaries on August 3, says written consent from each gram sabha in the area where forest land is to be used will be a must for the final sanction from the Centre.        
	We had been demanding this for some time as this would give gram sabhas and tribals more say in what is happening around them, a tribal affairs ministry official said.        
	The environment ministrys letter is in tune with the spirit of the forest rights act, which aims to protect the interests of tribals and other forest dwellers, the official said.        
	To ensure that people in such areas understand what has been put before them, the Centre has said that full details of the project and its implications, in local languages, should be given to gram sabhas. The sabhas, too, must state in their consent letters that they have understood the purpose for which the forest land is to be used.        
	More important, the environment ministrys letter says all discussions and decisions on such proposals must be held with a minimum quorum of 50 per cent  that is 50 per cent of all gram sabha members must be present.         
	The letter also says forest land can be used for other purposes only after those affected have been resettled in another area of the forest.        
	The new directive is likely to affect the mining industry the most. The states with the highest forest cover  Jharkhand, Orissa and Chhattisgarh  also have the countrys largest coal reserves.         
	The move is a shot in the arm for panchayats which till now were mere onlookers. This was especially in case of panchayats where tribals were in a majority, said tribal activist Krishnadas Gopal.        
	He urged the government, however, to ensure the tribal panchayat members, who may not fathom the complex legalities of the process, are not hoodwinked by mine barons.

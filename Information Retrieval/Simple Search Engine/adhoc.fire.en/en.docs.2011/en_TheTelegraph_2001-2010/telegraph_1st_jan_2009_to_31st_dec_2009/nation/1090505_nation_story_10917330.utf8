The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | MP paves Nitish path
                                                                                                               MP paves Nitish path
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                          Nitish: Old friend of Left                                  
	New Delhi, May 4: If Nitish Kumar and Sharad Yadav have dropped hints that they might split with the BJP, it was a party MP who prepared the ground.        
	Ejaz Ali, who says he is not scared of disciplinary action, has been going across Bihar campaigning against the BJP under the banner of the All India Dalit Muslim Morcha.        
	I have been asking people to vote for anyone who will prevent (L.K.) Advani from becoming Prime Minister, the Janata Dal (United) leader told The Telegraph.        
	Both Nitish and Sharad have sparked speculation about post-poll realignments. While Sharad, asked if his party was thinking of alliance talks with the Congress, said he was currently with the NDA, Nitish has asserted his commitment to the coalition but also said nobody knows about tomorrow.        
	The Bihar chief minister today added more fodder for speculation when he said the Left and his party were old friends.        
	The Left and we are old friends. We have been with the Left for a long time, since the days of the Janata Dal and we have a lot of experience with them, he told a television channel.        
	Both parties are of the same opinion on the nuclear deal and many other issues, he added, hinting at ideological proximity between the two.        
	Nitish may not have spoken about his ambitions but party leader Shivanand Tiwari recently said the chief minister was a fit candidate for Prime Minister.        
	Not only that, comparison within party circles with Gujarats Narendra Modi had showed Nitish the way ahead, sources said.        
	Sharad, too, has warned against projecting Modi as a candidate for Prime Minister when a consensus had been reached on Advanis name.        
	Ali, who has so far escaped disciplinary action though his party shares power with the BJP in Bihar, says the Dal (U) should have snapped the alliance before the elections got underway.        
	Even when the last Parliament session was on earlier this year, the Rajya Sabha MP hadnt tried too hard to keep his views to himself.        
	Ali also told journalists and fellow Muslim MPs what he wanted: reservation for Dalit Muslims which, he said, Advani had rejected outright.

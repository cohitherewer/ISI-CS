   Cloud on site to dump silt 
          SAMBIT SAHA                                                  
	Calcutta, Sept. 16: The ghost of Nandigram is threatening the Haldia Ports future by denying the dock authorities a stretch to dump the silt scooped out to ensure the river remains navigable.        
	The Calcutta Port Trust (CPT), which runs the Haldia port, had asked for 2,500 acres near Nandigram in 2006 but the Bengal government, wary after the farmland fiasco, hasnt given it the land so far. If it had, the sludge could have been deposited on the stretch.         
	At present, dredgers sail up to five hours to dump the silt at the mouth of the river near Sagar island. It will take less than an hour if the dumping is done near Nandigram. (See graphic)        
	Besides, according to some studies, 14 per cent of all silt drawn out of Auckland and Jellingham, the name for the two main guiding channels for ships, flows back after being dumped near Sagar island. This problem will not occur in Nandigram since silt will be dumped on the shore.        
	More important is the time lost. After every one-and-a-half hours of dredging  a vessel must empty its load of silt after this  the dredger has to travel three to five hours on an average, depending on the exact dumping location, to the area near Sagar island.        
	If land was made available near Nandigram, the dredgers would have spent more time shovelling out mud than carrying it. The six dredgers would have been enough, port officials said.        
	The CPT had considered dumping only 40 per cent of the mud on the shores of Nandigram. Every year, the port dredges 22 million square metres of sludge from the channels and throws it aside. If dumped on the shore, the silt will need around 1,100 acres a year.        
	Port officials arent looking at the Nandigram option anymore. Where is the land? And there has been siltation near the shore at Nandigram and Jellingham, too. But we still could have made way had there been certainty over land, one official said.         
	Ramakant Burman, co-ordinator of the Haldia Dock Bachao Committee, said the port could only be saved by opening a new channel, tentatively called Eden.        
	As the land logjam continues, the mud-fed monster is threatening to choke the shipping channel along the Hooghly. Yesterday, the gap between the water surface and the riverbed fell by 0.4 metres, setting of alarm bells.        
	Many ships were said to be stuck at Sandheads waiting for the tide to rise  they hope it will happen tomorrow  and sail in. But acting CPT chairman Anindya Majumdar said the Haldia port was functioning almost normally.        
	Union minister of state for shipping Mukul Roy, whose Trinamul Congress won polls by making Nandigram a campaign theme, admitted the lack of dumping land on the shore was a problem, but offered little hope of a solution.        
	The problem of Haldia is a problem of any other riverine port of the world. Here you cannot do much but to maintain whatever is there. There cannot be any dramatic improvement, he said.        
	Roy said the port had no choice but to carry on the dredging the way it has been doing. We cant put the silt on the shore because of (lack of) land.         
	Roy promised more dredgers. One is coming from Paradip. And we will hire two more, he said.         
	But some have blamed the minister for allowing one dredger, said to be one of the more efficient ones, to leave Haldia last month. Since then, silting has increased rapidly, reducing the depth from 4.3 to 4 metres.        
	Dibyendu Bose, the managing director of TM International Logistics Ltd, which has a berth in Haldia, said the ships were bringing 10 per cent less cargo than they used to two years ago.

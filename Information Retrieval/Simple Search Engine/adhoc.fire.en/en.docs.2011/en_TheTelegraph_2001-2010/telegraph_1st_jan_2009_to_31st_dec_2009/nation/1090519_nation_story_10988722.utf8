The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Arjun cabinet wish
                                                                                                               Arjun cabinet wish
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, May 18: Arjun Singh today hinted that he wished for a cabinet post and ruled out retirement from politics despite his poor health and clear isolation in the party.         
	The senior Congress leader, who was the HRD minister in the previous cabinet, also said he was not invited to a meeting of the Congress core group, of which he is a member, yesterday to discuss the partys strategy after its victory in the elections.         
	I am neither hurt nor elated... if you can understand that state of mind, Arjun said about the Lok Sabha election win, his eyes twinkling when asked if he was pained with his isolation in the party.         
	The 78-year-old veterans admission that he was not elated by the Congresss best performance in almost two decades revealed his alienation.         
	Arjun, however, added: I have three years left in the Rajya Sabha. I do not plan to retire from politics. His current six-year Rajya Sabha term started in March 2006.         
	Asked if he wanted a cabinet post, Arjun hinted that he was waiting for the Congress high command to correspond with him. That (the question of portfolio) is for the high command to decide, he said.         
	As his isolation from the party leadership grew over the past few years, Arjun repeatedly displayed his potential to embarrass Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.         
	In the midst of the Congress-Left bickering over the Indo-US nuclear deal, Arjun pitched Rahul Gandhis name as candidate for the Prime Ministers job. The party distanced itself from Arjuns statement and Sonia was said to have reprimanded him.

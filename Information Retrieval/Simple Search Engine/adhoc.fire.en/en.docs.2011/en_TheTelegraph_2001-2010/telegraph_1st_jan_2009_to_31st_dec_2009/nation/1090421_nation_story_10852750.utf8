The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pawar plays Shivaji card to guard besieged fort
                                                                                                               Pawar plays Shivaji card to guard besieged fort
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI IN KOLHAPUR/SATARA                                              The Shalini Palace in Kolhapur where Chattrapati Sambhajiraje Bhosle lives.       
	Chattrapati Sambhajiraje Bhosles campaign placards show the 38-year-old striding confidently ahead of his party boss Sharad Pawar, whos almost relegated to the backdrop.   
	It isnt uncommon for royalty to be accused of arrogance. But in Kolhapur, the pre-eminence of Sambhajiraje  the prince of Kolhapur and descendant of Chattrapati Shivaji  in the poll campaign reflects an earthy reality.   
	The NCP and the Congress are banking on two ex-royals of warrior heritage to defend their sugar fortress in western Maharashtra, under greater threat than ever in the recent past.         
	Sambhajiraje and his cousin Udyanraje Bhosle are the NCPs candidates from Kolhapur and Satara, princely states carved at the start of the 18th century following an intra-Maratha feud for power after Shivajis death.        
	Both candidates have made it clear their political ambitions  unleashed for the first time these elections  are not bound by long-term commitment to any party.         
	But they could hold the key to the Congress-NCP alliances prospects of retaining its dominance in a region where it has held control even when strongholds like Vidarbha were crumbling.         
	The NCP is banking on their royal heritage and the voters loyalty to the name of Shivaji to draw enough votes to win, a party leader said.         
	Its true that the NCP is depending on us to deliver. But for me entering politics was crucial to carry forward the legacy of my ancestors, says Sambhajiraje, driving out of the family palace in Kolhapur.         
	The western Maharashtra region is synonymous with sugarcane, the main crop here. Grapes, jowar, bajra and bananas are also grown.         
	The region consists of six districts  Ahmednagar, Pune, Satara, Solapur, Kolhapur and Sangli  and contributes 12 Lok Sabha seats, the maximum from any of Maharashtras regions.         
	In 2004, when the Congress-NCP-RPI alliance won just three out of 19 seats in Vidarbha and Marathwada, it won 10 out of the 12 seats in western Maharashtra, losing only Solapur and Khed. Six of the 10 victors won absolute majorities.         
	But the cracks are showing this time, threatening to widen enough to allow the BJP-Shiv Sena alliance a chance to force its way through.         
	In the past, the biggest threat to the Congress-NCP-RPI alliance here has come from rebels denied tickets.         
	This time, too, the alliance faces rebellion in several seats. But it also faces, perhaps for the first time, the prospect of a popular revolt against many candidates from increasingly disgruntled voters.         
	In Solapur, Union power minister Sushil Kumar Shinde of the Congress is struggling to win a seat that his wife lost in 2004.         
	What has Shinde done when he was chief minister? asks Milind Deshpande, a newspaper stall owner.         
	Shindes pre-election move to provide electrical pump sets to farmers hasnt cut much ice with voters either, says grape farmer Rajubhai Bansode 25km outside Solapur town.         
	The electricity is gone for most of the day. Is Shinde sahib now going to give us generators to run these pump-sets? Bansode mocks.         
	In Hatkanangale constituency, sitting NCP MP Nivedita Mane is fighting a close battle with the Shiv Senas Raghunathdada Patil. Patil has demanded better milk procurement prices, winning him popularity, NCP leaders said.         
	In Sangli, the Congress has been embarrassed by a revolt against its official candidate Pratik Patil from rebel leader Ajit Ghorpade. The BJP has withdrawn its candidate and decided to publicly back the rebel against the Congress.         
	In Ahmednagar, the sitting NCP MP Tukaram Gadakh has rebelled after he was denied a ticket  Shivaji Kardile is the NCP candidate. Gadakh has gone to the BSP, but the real beneficiary could be the BJPs Dilip Gandhi.         
	In Kolhapur, Sambhajirajes candidature has triggered rebellion in the NCP. Sitting MP Sadashivrao Mandlik, denied a ticket, is contesting independently.         
	Hes a king. He (Sambhajiraje) doesnt know how poor people live. He doesnt meet people. Compared to him, Mandlik is better, rages auto-rickshaw driver Raju More, suggesting the NCPs royal card might not be a winner.         
	The ex-royal faces other criticism, too. Visitors to his palace need to pay Rs 10 to see the monument. Auto drivers complain that guests who use their services to go to Sambhajirajes nearby farmhouse often refuse to pay for the trip.         
	What kind of leader asks people to pay to come to see him? asks More.         
	Sambhajiraje, however, says: They (his opponents) have to raise some issue. But the truth is that I am extremely accessible.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Naveen sure of hat-trick 
                                                                                                               Naveen sure of hat-trick 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, April 23: Confident that his party would score a hat-trick this time, chief minister Naveen Patnaik today ruled out his partys support to any BJP-led or Congress-led formation after the polls.         
	I hope that my party wins impressive number of seats in both Assembly and Lok Sabha polls. We will form our government on our own in Orissa, Naveen told reporters outside a polling booth in Aerodrome area in Bhubaneswar. BJD had formed a government in 2000 and 2004 with the backing of its long-time ally, BJP.         
	But this time, BJD is contesting polls against BJP and has entered into seat adjustment with NCP, CPI and CPM. The final round of polling for 11 Lok Sabha and 77 Assembly seats were held in the central and north Orissa today.         
	Naveen walked to booth number-76 set up at Aerodrome Colony Upgraded Upper Primary School to cast his vote around 7am. We are fortunate that we belong to the largest democracy, where everyone has the power and the freedom to decide a government, he said.         
	My partys stand is quite clear. It will not provide support to either Congress or a BJP-led government at the Centre, he said.        
	We would only consider those parties and alliances that would fulfil long-standing demands of the state, said the BJD chief.         
	Naveen added that his party would not take the support of the former ally, BJP, even if fell short of majority in the Assembly. We are confident that we will secure a majority on our own, he said.

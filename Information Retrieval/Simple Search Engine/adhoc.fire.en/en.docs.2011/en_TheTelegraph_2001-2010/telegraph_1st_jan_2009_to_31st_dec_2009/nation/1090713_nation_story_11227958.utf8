          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Firepower to police                                  
	Bhubaneswar, July 12: Perturbed by the growing Maoist menace in the state, the standing committee of the home department has recommended the provision of Rs 6.5 crore in the budget for procurement of imported arms to combat rebels.         
	Police forces urgently require modern arms and state-of-the-art equipment to fight out heavily-armed rebels, stated the committee chairman, R.C. Chyaupatnaik, in a report.        
	Maoist menace has assumed an alarming proportion in the state that has affected as many as 17 of the total 30 districts. Last year, more than 60 police personnel were killed by the Maoists.         
	Keeping in view the sophisticated arms and other equipment available with the Maoists, the committee suggested to equip the police personnel with modern arms and ammunitions, including imported weapons. The Rs 6.5 crore may be provided to procure imported arms like SIG-551 assault rifles, glocks, UBGL and MBGL and indigenous weapons such as light machine guns, Insas rifles, rocket launchers and 51mm mortars, said the standing committee.        
	The committee further recommended the provision of funds for bullet-proof jackets and helmets to the police.         
	In order to improve the efficiency of the force, the committee appreciated the need for latest communication system with facility to link all police posts, so that there is no rupture communication and there is instantaneous flow of information to tackle law and order situation, particularly in inaccessible areas.        
	Reiterating the need for expeditious steps to fill up all vacant base-level and promotion posts immediately, the committee report observed: Under no circumstances, should the vacancy in the police department remain empty in view of the law situation and security threat.         
	The committee emphasised on the need to provide residential accommodation to the personnel who are working at odd hours in Maoist-affected areas. The funds allocated for 2009-10 is quite insufficient to meet the requirements for construction and repair of buildings, it noted, while recommending for provision of adequate funds in the next supplementary budget.         
	In order to boost the morale and public image of the police, the committee felt that adequate funds be provided in the budget for sufficient supply of uniforms.         
	It also recommended for provision of adequate funds for purchase of new vehicles, replacement of old and condemned vehicles and meet the fuel expenses.

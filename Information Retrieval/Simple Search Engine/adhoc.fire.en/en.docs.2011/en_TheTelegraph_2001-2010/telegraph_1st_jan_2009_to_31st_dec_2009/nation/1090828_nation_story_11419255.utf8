                                                                                                               Student loan relief cleared
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Aug. 27: The cabinet today approved a scheme to subsidise the interest on education loans for poor students pursing professional higher education courses, fulfilling a promise the UPA had first made in its 2004 common minimum programme.         
	Under the scheme, the government will pay the interest on education loans for all students from families with an annual income below Rs 4.5 lakh during a moratorium period.         
	The moratorium period will cover the duration of the course, and a year after its completion if the student is unable to find employment.         
	If the student finds employment, he has to start paying interest six months from the completion of the course.         
	The scheme will be started this financial year and will be applicable to students who have, or will, join professional courses this year, human resource development minister Kapil Sibal told reporters at a briefing after the cabinet meeting.         
	The scheme will be implemented through Canara Bank, which will receive 1 per cent interest from the government on every Rs 1,000 of loan sanctioned. The loan will be offered at the banks basic lending rate, Sibal said.         
	The cabinet also approved seven new IIMs, of which six  for Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir, Tamil Nadu, Chhattisgarh, Uttarakhand and Jharkhand  were promised under the Eleventh Five-Year Plan (2007-12).         
	The seventh, for Rajasthan, was not planned but will be set up as finance minister Pranab Mukherjee mistakenly promised the state an IIM in his interim budget speech in February this year.         
	The IIMs in Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Tamil Nadu and Haryana will be set up over the next few months, and are likely to start classes only next year. The remaining three institutes are likely to start classes in 2011.         
	As reported by The Telegraph today, the new IIMs will not offer the flagship post-graduate diploma in management (PGDM) programme in their first year, the HRD ministry said today. Instead, they will offer courses for working executives initially before expanding to offer PGDM courses.

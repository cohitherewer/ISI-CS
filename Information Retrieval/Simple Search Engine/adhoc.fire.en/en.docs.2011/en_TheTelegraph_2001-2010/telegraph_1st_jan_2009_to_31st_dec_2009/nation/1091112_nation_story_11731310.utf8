	New Delhi, Nov. 11: If the Congress is talking about a dramatic surge in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, its mainly because of Rahul Gandhis decision to end alliances in these states.        
	The party is now openly critical of the cautious approach that led it to the safe route of coalitions in these crucial states, which send 120 members to the Lok Sabha.        
	Party spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi today said the benefits of Rahuls long-term thinking were visible everywhere. Rahul Gandhi is not afraid to experiment. He believes status quo is a bigger risk.        
	The tussle between risk-takers and those in favour of maintaining status quo has been the subject of behind-the-scenes discussions. The decision to talk about it publicly is being viewed as Rahuls nudge to those who opt for safe options.        
	The visible and invisible hands of Rahul Gandhi, his message and his style of work are present everywhere. His strategy is long and medium term, Singhvi said, indicating that the Congress would rely on allies only under extreme compulsions and continue with alliances in some states to achieve short-term objectives.         
	Senior leaders ruled out reversing the anti-alliance policy in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar in the future.         
	While former Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao first decided to strike an alliance with the BSP in Uttar Pradesh, the party never fought any election with the Samajwadi Party as an ally though Sonia Gandhi supported the Mulayam Singh Yadav government twice, almost making the Congress a junior partner.        
	In Bihar, Sonia had almost outsourced the Congress to Lalu Prasad.         
	Congress leaders say the party was weaker during the early stages of Sonias leadership. Sonia was under tremendous pressure to align with the Samajwadis against her wishes. Even now, there are some leaders who are happy with power at the Centre and dont want to strengthen the party at the cost of allies, a senior leader said.        
	Uttar Pradesh will go to polls in 2012 and Bihar in 2010. Before the Assembly elections in these two states, the organisational elections, in addition to Rahuls Youth Congress and NSUI elections, will be completed. But it is true the party apparatus in both states needs to be toned up, a leader said.

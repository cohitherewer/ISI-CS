          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Chand in Gurgaon on Saturday. (PTI)                                   
	Chandigarh, Jan. 31: Four days after he went missing, former Haryana deputy chief minister Chander Mohan resurfaced in Gurgaon to say he longed to be back with his first family.        
	Mohan, who became Chand Mohammad after embracing Islam to marry a second wife, now appears to have had a change of heart.         
	I love Seema (his first wife) and my children, Mohan said, adding that he longed to be back with them. The 43-year-old has a teenage son and daughter.        
	Mohan asserted he had not been abducted, as claimed by Fiza  his second wife  but had left home of his own.         
	I respect her (Fiza). She knows where I am. There is no misunderstanding with Fiza. There is no pressure on me. But I love Seema a lot, Mohan said, a day after Fiza was released from hospital following an apparent suicide bid.        
	Mohan, the son of former chief minister Bhajan Lal, also clarified that he had had no tiff with Fiza that may have forced him to leave her home. She has never said anything that has hurt me, he said.        
	Fiza, who also embraced Islam before the wedding, reiterated that Mohans claims today were part of the abduction script penned by his family.        
	Whatever he has told the media has been scripted by none other than (his brother) Kuldeep, she said outside her house in Chandigarh.        
	Fiza appeared to be clinging on to her belief that Mohan would yet come back to her. I will wait for him till my last breath, she said.        
	But she indicated she would not give in without a fight. Asked whether she would take legal action against Mohan, Fiza quipped: Wait and watch.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Trounced at home, Lalu admits alliance blunder
                                                                                                               Trounced at home, Lalu admits alliance blunder
          NALIN VERMA                          Lalu Prasad at his Patna residence. (PTI)                                  
	Patna, May 16: Lalu Prasad lost his crown in Bihar three-and-a-half years ago; today he ceased to be a king-maker in Delhi.        
	A gloomy Rashtriya Janata Dal chief, whose tally of MPs is down from 24 to four, acknowledged: The decision to contest without the Congress on our side was a big blunder. The fourth front has been rejected by the people of Bihar. I humbly accept the peoples verdict.        
	Lalu Prasads ally Lok Janshakti Party has drawn a blank, with Ram Vilas Paswan and his filmmaker candidate, Prakash Jha, losing in Hajipur and West Champaran.        
	The outgoing railway minister himself suffered a humiliating defeat at the hands of friend-turned-rival Ranjan Yadav of the Janata Dal (United) in Pataliputra, by 29,000 votes, although he won from Saran, trouncing the BJPs Rajiv Pratap Rudy by a margin of 52,000.        
	Now he must wait to see if Manmohan Singh, armed with higher-than-expected numbers, welcomes him into the new cabinet with a senior post.        
	Lalu Prasad, however, declared great happiness at the UPAs showing and said he would continue to be part of the alliance. Our relations with the Congress remain as they were before the polls.        
	As trends trickled in this morning, a pall descended on Lalu Prasads 10 Circular Road home. He shut himself indoors as journalists waited outside. Few visitors were seen around the house.        
	At the end of counting, however, Lalu Prasad appeared before the media. But the man known for his irrepressible wit and steadfast good humour looked downcast. The secular votes got divided between the RJD and the Congress, he claimed.        
	This can be confirmed only when detailed vote shares come in, but the fact remains that the RJD came second in 20-odd seats and the Congress  which has won two seats  in over a dozen. In 2004, as a Congress ally, the RJD had won 22 seats in Bihar and two in Jharkhand, while the Congress won three and the LJP four. This time, Lalu Prasad had angered the Congress by offering just three seats, prompting it to contest all 40.        
	The RJD, however, seems to have maintained its grip over the Yadavs, the largest caste in Bihar, and sections of Muslims and Rajputs. The Congress seems to have received sizeable support from Muslims and Bramins.        
	Lalu Prasad may now be facing the biggest battle of his career. His rival Nitish Kumar, riding his development with justice plank, has led the Dal (United) to 21 seats while partner BJP has garnered 13.        
	Nitishs decision to carve an Extremely Backward Classes category out of Lalu Prasads Other Backward Classes base has succeeded in a big way with all his EBC candidates winning. Even flood-ravaged Kosi has backed Nitish, with his party chief Sharad Yadav wresting Madhepura from the RJD, and don Pappu Yadavs wife and mother losing to BJP-JD(U) rivals in Purnea and Supaul.        
	Im strong enough even when alone, Lalu Prasad said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, July 17: People of the state would witness a colourful and a messy campaign in the 2010 Assembly elections if Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar is allowed to have his way.        
	The chief minister has decided to convene an all-party meeting on a proposed amendment to the Defacement of Property Act, 1985.         
	The amendment will allow home owners to put up banners, posters and write slogans on houses and properties in favour of political parties and candidates of their choice during campaign period.        
	The states hinterlands and even urban areas did not show any sign of elections with the people preferring not to put up symbols and hoarding of the parties of their choice ever since the government amended the property act in 2005 declaring the practice as illegal.        
	However, CPM MLA Ramdeo Verma drew attention of the government through a call attention motion in the Assembly today towards the denial of the democratic rights of the people by prohibiting them from putting up banners and hoarding in favour of their candidates during the polls.        
	Taking a cue from his CPM counterparts call attention motion, RJDs Ramchandra Purve, too, demanded the government to re-consider the amendment executed in property act which allegedly robbed the colour and the shine of the democratic exercise besides infringing upon the electorates democratic rights.        
	Responding, Nitish Kumar said that he agreed to their contention and promised that he would convene an all party meeting with a view to create a consensus on amend the act allowing the people to put up banners and poster, as they did in the past.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Congress and DMK   in tighter embrace
                                                                                                               Congress and DMK   in tighter embrace
          G.C. SHEKHAR                                                    Azad (top) and Karunanidhi      
	Chennai, March 2: The Congress today put its alliance with the DMK on a firmer footing after Ghulam Nabi Azad met chief minister M. Karunanidhi in Chennai.        
	There was no room for speculation about the alliance, the Congress general secretary said after the 50-minute talks during which, sources said, he asked for 18 of Tamil Nadus 39 seats.        
	Azad described his partys alliance with the DMK as one of its most successful ones. He said: We have seen total co-ordination between the two sides and this will continue during the coming elections as well.        
	Committees appointed by the two parties will finalise the seat shares, but Azad put in a request for eight extra seats other than the 10 the Congress had contested and won five years ago. In 2004, these eight seats had been allotted to the two Left parties and the MDMK, which have quit the alliance.        
	The Congress may, however, offer a few of these additional seats to actor Vijayakanths DMDK to lure him into the UPA fold. Asked if Vijayakanth was part of the Congresss equations, Azad merely said: All like-minded parties are welcome to join our front.        
	Vijayakanth has been advocating a poll boycott, ostensibly for the Lankan Tamil cause but mainly to keep his independence intact by avoiding a tie-up with either the DMK or the ADMK. If he joins the Congress alliance, the PMK is almost certain to walk out.        
	The PMK and the DMDK cannot coexist in the same front, and PMK leader Ramadoss is waiting before he makes his final choice. Since Tamil Nadu goes to the polls in the last phase on May 13, he has ample time to play his cards.        
	Azad, who met Congress officials for over three hours this morning, heard out groups that favoured an alliance with the ADMK.

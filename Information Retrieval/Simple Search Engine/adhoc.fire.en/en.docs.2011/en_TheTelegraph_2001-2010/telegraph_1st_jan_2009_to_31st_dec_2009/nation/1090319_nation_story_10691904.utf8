      29 DAYS TO GO*                              
	 Kanpur: Hold on brides and grooms, elections are near.          
	Weddings could be put on poll pause in this Uttar Pradesh city, whose voting day on April 30 has fallen right in the middle of a marriage season starting 15 days before.          
	Guesthouses and banquet halls, which would have otherwise been booked for back-to-back weddings, will now turn into camps housing security personnel on poll duty.           
	The authorities are said to have already reserved at least 1,200 such venues, tying up many a wedding plan in knots.          
	Priests say April 17 27, 28 and 29 are the most auspicious dates. Guesthouses have been booked for polls from April 26 to May 2. Guesthouse owners, many of them now having to refund advances, said around 1,500 weddings fixed during the period could be affected.          
	 New Delhi: The writing on the wall: 233 cases in 10 days.          
	Delhi police have removed over 2,400 poll posters and banners from the citys walls, leading to 233 cases being filed in the past 10 days for defacement of public property.          Offenders can be arrested without a warrant under the Delhi Prevention of Defacement of Property Act, 2007. They can be jailed for up to a year or fined Rs 50,000, or both.          
	According to city police chief Y.S. Dadwal, around 1,462 posters, 984 banners and 588 hoardings were taken off during this period. Around 136 wall writings were erased.           The number of such FIRs at the end of this poll season could top the 366 cases filed during the 2004 elections.          
	 New Delhi: The Election Commission has ordered the transfer of Andhra director-general of police S.S.P. Yadav who reportedly praised chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy during an official tour.           
	The commission also sought a panel of names from the state government by Friday for his replacement, a poll panel spokesperson said.          
	The state chief electoral officer had earlier sought an explanation from the DGP for allegedly violating the model code of conduct by speaking in favour of the quot;ruling party and the government quot; during his tour of Kurnool and Mahabubnagar districts after the poll dates were announced.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Party sticks to script but spirit goes astray
                                                                                                               Party sticks to script but spirit goes astray
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Sonia (left), Mayavati                                  
	New Delhi, July 16: Rita Bahuguna Joshis remarks might have been a seamless strand in Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhis script for the Congresss revival in Uttar Pradesh had she not departed from its spirit.        
	Last Sunday, a Congress leader had expressed concern about the increasing instances of rape in the state, more so of Dalit women and said it would have been more humane had Mayavati stressed on fast-tracking the trial of the accused instead of directing the police chief to heli-hop and dole out cash compensation.        
	The Congress believes it is on the right course in projecting the issue, one of the many it raised against the chief minister as part of a campaign to undermine her credibility and base.        
	Last night, when Sonia heard of Ritas speech, sources said, the Congress chief was aghast. Rita was not just another Congress worker. As the Uttar Pradesh Congress president, who was supposed to have Rahuls ears, she was the partys public face.        
	The sources said the Congress president made up her mind last night itself that she would distance the party from Ritas comments in Parliament and outside. It was decided that when Parliament met on Thursday morning, either Pawan Kumar Bansal, the parliamentary affairs minister or his deputy, Prtihviraj Chavan, would make a statement.        
	However, matters spun out of control with a crowd setting fire to Ritas house in Lucknow and she was arrested in Ghaziabad. The two developments prompted Congress workers in the state to take to the streets.        
	At such moments, nobody thinks of the finer points or the implications of issues. Our workers have been told that the Congress should not pass up a single chance to take on Mayavati and they faithfully obeyed the order, a source said.        
	Sonia and Rahul, the source said, were convinced that with the BJP in a shambles and the Samajwadi Party yet to get its act together, the Congress should appropriate the opposition space and emerge as the BSPs principal challenger by 2013 when the state goes to polls.        
	The Congress started playing by the ear. Sensing how agitated its workers were, its spokespersons, like Manish Tewari and Jayanthi Natarajan, went on the offensive. With the kind of lawlessness that prevails, you can make out a case for anybody, for anything. Ransacking the house of the UPCC chief is going to be the last nail in the Mayavati governments coffin, said Tewari.         
	When Mayavatis confidant and Rajya Sabha MP, Satish Mishra, and later the chief minister herself sought to draw Sonia into the controversy and demanded an apology in Parliament  both Houses were repeatedly adjourned  the Congresss script faltered a little. Bansal couldt make the statement in the House that Sonia wanted.        
	Janardhan Dwivedi, the general secretary who heads the media cell, called the spokespersons and directed them to delink the party from Ritas utterances.        
	Dwivedis statement  it was drafted by a close aide of Sonia  reflected the Congresss eagerness to do a balancing act.        
	The statement said: The Congress stands for highest standards in public debate in issues that touch the people. The values bequeathed to it by its founders are explicit in the civilised engagement it has traditionally had with political adversaries no matter which party they belong to.        
	The party regretted the personal element in Ritas allusions to Mayavati. The Congress holds all women in the highest esteem and does not believe in crossing the limits of sobriety.        
	The rap on Rita was followed by a warning to the chief minister: The credibility and fairness of the Mayavati regime would also be on test in the way it deals with arsonists who in a deeply condemnable incident set Smt. Joshis house on fire.        
	Asked if Ritas job was on the line, Dwivedi said: Any party considers all aspects of an issue before taking a decision. Nothing will be done in a hurry. He added that Ritas version would be heard once she was out of jail before anything was done.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nitish sends Kosi SOS
                                                                                                               Nitish sends Kosi SOS
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Patna, March 2: Flood victims from Nepals villages have stopped working on the project to plug a breach in the Kosi embankment at Kusaha in the Himalayan state, compelling chief minister Nitish Kumar to draw the attention of external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee.         
	The chief minister, in a letter to Mukherjee today, said: The work to plug the breach stands completely disrupted since February 20 because of protracted agitation of the disgruntled flood-affected Nepalese people at Kusaha.        
	The agitators have cut, according to the letter, the supply lines to the breach site, resulting in an acute shortage of essential fuel and material goods required to carry on with the important work. The movement of men and vehicles too stands paralysed.        
	Nitish said that the Bihar government had also apprised the Union ministry of water resources and the Indian embassy in Nepal about the gravity of the situation.         
	The government of Bihar accords high priority to these works and considers adherence to the time schedule critical where every single day lost is fraught with serious consequences, the letter said.         
	The breach in Kosi embankment at Kusaha caused unprecedented floods in Nepals Sunsari district besides five other districts in Bihar last year marooning millions of people who have yet to be rehabilitated.        
	The chief minister, while lamenting that his efforts with the officials of Nepal, Indian embassy in Nepal and Union water resources ministry had so far failed to yield results, has requested the external affairs minister to immediately intervene in the matter, ensuring commencement of the work on the breached embankment.

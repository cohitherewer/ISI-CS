          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Feb. 17: A retired government official, chargesheeted in a disproportionate assets case a decade ago, has challenged the Orissa Special Courts Act, 2006, in Orissa High Court.         
	The Biju Patnaik government (1990-95) had formulated the Orissa Special Courts Act, 1990, and enforced it in July 1992 for the trial of corrupt politicians and bureaucrats, however, it was repealed in August 1995 when the Congress government, headed by J.B. Patnaik, came to power.         
	Nearly 12 years later, the Navin Patnaik government has resurrected the repealed act with necessary modifications and consequently the Orissa Special Courts Act, 2006, was enacted in 2007.         
	Sarat Kumar Mohanty, 72, the retired government official, however, has questioned its constitutional validity on the ground that it is a draconian piece of legislation.        
	Over 13 years ago, when Mohanty was the deputy director of agriculture, land and water management in Bhadrak, vigilance officers raided his residence. Though a criminal case was registered against him in 1994 under the Prevention of Corruption Act, the chargesheet was filed in 1998.         
	The case was initiated before the Special Judge (vigilance) in Bhubaneswar.        
	But in 2007 it was transferred to the Special Judge Vigilance in Balasore. After enactment of the Special Courts Act, the state home department transferred his case to the Special Court in Cuttack through a notification.         
	Although the act aims to curtail and eradicate corruption in political and public offices, in reality, the sole objective is to fix political opponents and officials, who are not pliant, the petition has alleged. The act, the PIL further alleges, runs contrary to the rule of law and is against principles and tenets of democracy.         
	High court sources said the advocate-generals office on Monday sought instructions from the home, law and general administration departments on the case.

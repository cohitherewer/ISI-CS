          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 9: A wristwatch belonging to Lal Bahadur Shastri, which marked an essential chapter in Indias post-Independence history, was stolen from a memorial in his name in the capital.        
	The gold watch, presented to the then Prime Minister Shastri by his Russian counterpart Alexei Kosygin in 1966 during the Tashkent conference, has been missing since September 3, memorial officials said. The watch was kept in a glass case in the memorial next to Sonia Gandhis residence.         
	The theft occurred on September 3, but the authorities of the Lal Bahadur Shastri Memorial reported the matter four days later. Memorial director A.K. Das approached Tughlaq Road police station on Monday after conducting an internal enquiry, which has hampered investigations. The security guard of the memorial was on leave when the incident occurred, said Shankar Das, additional commissioner of police, New Delhi district.        
	According to police sources, a group of visitors was being shown around the memorial on the day the watch, worth Rs 1 crore, disappeared.        
	One of the staff members, while showing the visitors around, noticed that the watch was missing.         
	Das said the main suspect was a couple who, memorial staff said, had taken more than the usual time on the premises. They said the couple had shown particular interest in the gold watch.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Fiza clings to letters
                                                                                                               Fiza clings to letters
          GAJINDER SINGH                          Fiza after she was discharged from hospital on Friday. (PTI)                                   
	Chandigarh, Jan. 30: Moments after Fiza returned home from hospital, the postman arrived to deliver letters addressed to her missing husband Chander Mohan alias Chand Mohammad.         
	The letters are addressed to Chander Mohan at this address, the postman said, as he pushed them inside the letterbox of Fizas home in Sector 48C.        
	For the 37-year-old lady, the letters are proof that her husband, a former deputy chief minister of Haryana who has been missing for the past three days, has not deserted her.         
	Fiza believes Mohan, the son of the powerful former chief minister Bhajan Lal, has been abducted at the behest of his family.         
	I still do not consider Chands mysterious disappearance as a betrayal of any sort. Till the moment I speak to him, I will continue to love him as I have done always, said Fiza, who was discharged from the General Medical College and Hospital this morning after an alleged suicide bid yesterday.         
	Clad in light blue jeans and white top with blue jacket, Fiza confronted the curious media in the park opposite her home in full glare of dozens of neighbours.         
	I did not try to commit suicide, she pleaded and proffered an explanation for being taken to hospital. I did not have anything to eat and was not feeling well. So I took a sleeping tablet and fell ill I have been taking medicines and it could have been an overdose as I have been mentally upset over my husbands abduction.        
	Fiza was rushed to hospital yesterday in critical condition after consuming what relatives said were sleeping pills. A day earlier she had created a stir by accusing Bhajan Lal and Mohans brother Kuldeep Bishnoi of kidnapping her husband from the house.        
	Mohan, 43, has, however, denied he has been abducted and said he left home on his own.        
	Fiza, who appeared mellowed today, hinted that there was pressure on her husband to break the marriage. The two had got married a couple of months ago after embracing Islam and changing their names.         
	Despite denying, Bhajan Lal had always kept in touch with Mohan and the two used to talk often on the phone. We have never had a fight since we got married, Fiza said.        
	Mohan, she said, had spoken to her once during the three past three days. He sounded different. I have not been able to contact him again. From the tone and tenor of his voice it seemed he was under pressure.         
	Lal family sources, while denying they had abducted Mohan, revealed that Bhajan Lal had told his son the family would welcome him back if he chose to leave Fiza.        
	Mohan has been going through a financial crisis. He had gifted all his property to his first wife Seema and children before marrying Fiza and had approached his father for help. But he was told he would have to come back first, a family aide said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | More police for Kandhamal
                                                                                                               More police for Kandhamal
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 10: Security has been beefed up in Kandhamal and adjoining areas before Janmashtami and the first death anniversary of VHP leader Swami Laxmananda Saraswati.        
	The seer and four of his associates were killed by a group of armed assailants at Jaleshpeta ashram in Kandhamal during Janmashtami on August 23, 2008, triggering large-scale violence in Kandhamal.        
	Forty people, mostly Christians, were killed while houses, churches, missionary schools and hostels were damaged in the riots. A nun was raped and paraded half-naked by a mob. More than 25,000 residents fled home and had to take shelter in government-run relief camps. The incidents were criticised both in national and international circles, prompting Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to call it a national shame.        
	We have alerted all police stations and asked officers to keep a close watch on the situation, said home secretary A.P. Padhi to reporters today. Additional 12 platoons of armed police will be deployed at Kandhamal in addition to one company of CRPF already deployed, said Padhi.        
	Besides, 500 special police officers have been posted in Kandhamal and 250 more have been requisitioned from neighbouring Gajapati and Rayagada, he added.        
	Director-general of police has been asked to deploy as many officers as the situation demands.        
	VHP has decided to organise two meetings at Bhubaneswar and in Kandhamal on August 13 in memory of Laxmananda, said VHP state general secretary Gouri Prasad Rath. Besides, VHP will hold prayer meetings at Jaleshpeta and Chakapad ashrams  where the seer was cremated. We will hold week-long events to mark the day, said the leader while coming down heavily on the government for its failure to nabbing the real killers and conspirators behind the murder. This may create tension, feared Orissa Secular Forum president Swarupananda Patra.        
	Asked if the government was planning to ban rallies and meetings on the occasion of Swamijis death anniversary, the home secretary replied in negative. The district administration will take action depending upon the situation, he said.        
	Minority leaders had last month announced that they would observe August 23 as the day for peace and harmony. Leaders had asked the government and the UN to declare and observe the day as a Global Day for Peace and Harmony.        
	They had urged the government to provide religious minorities security. The state must see that the lives, property, institutions, places of worship are protected, said Archbishop of Cuttack-Bhubaneswar diocese, Raphael Cheenath.

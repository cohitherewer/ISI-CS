          NALIN VERMA                              
	Patna, Nov. 25: A woman delivered a boy on a running train and named the newborn, Lalu Prasad.        
	The former railway minister has been a source of inspiration for Gayatri Devi (25), who wants her son to be like Lalu Prasad.         
	Gayatri, travelling in a sleeper class coach of the 5651 Lohit Express, delivered her son at Desri railway station under East Central Railways Sonepur division with assistance of women passengers on Tuesday.        
	Sonepur railway division public relations officer B. Ram said: The woman went into labour when the train reached Desri railway station in north Bihars Vaishali district. We stopped the train for 30 minutes to allow the woman have a safe delivery.        
	Normally, the train stops there for 10 minutes only.         
	Gayatri was shifted to a nearby private hospital where she and her child were said to be in good health.        
	Gayatri Devi is a resident of Garkha village in Saran Lok Sabha constituency, which Lalu Prasad represents in the Lok Sabha.         
	Gayatri had gone to Siliguri in Bengal where her husband works.        
	The would-be mother was on way home in the express train that runs between Guwahati and Jammu.         
	We are very grateful to the railway staff and the passengers who helped me deliver my first son in the train, Gayatri said.        
	She said her entire family had high regard for Lalu Prasad for his contribution to the poor and his manner of talking to the people in a language of villagers. That is why I have named my son Lalu Prasad, she said.        
	On his part, public relations officer Ram, too, thanked passengers and the railway staff for their co-operation.

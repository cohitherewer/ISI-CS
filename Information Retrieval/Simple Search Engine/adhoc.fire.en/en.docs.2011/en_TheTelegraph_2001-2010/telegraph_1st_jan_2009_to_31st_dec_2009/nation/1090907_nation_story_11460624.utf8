The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | China envoy? Nirupama Raa, says govt 
                                                                                                               China envoy? Nirupama Raa, says govt 
          K.P. NAYAR                       Nirupama Rao                          
	Washington, Sept. 6: The commerce ministry does not believe that like charity, clarity, accuracy or any variation of the old saying, begins at home.        
	Commerce minister Anand Sharma has been hobnobbing most of last week with 35 of his foreign counterparts and more than 70 of their top aides, but his ministry does not appear to know who Indias foreign secretary is.        
	In a communication by the commerce ministry sent to Beijing for the guidance of Chinese commerce minister Chen Deming, who attended last weeks New Delhi meeting to kick-start global trade negotiations, Indias ambassador to China was listed as Smt. Nirupama Raa.        
	The communication, which is with this correspondent, was prepared in case Chen or his senior officials wanted to consult the Indians prior to leaving for New Delhi.        
	S. Jaishankar is Indias ambassador to China. Nirupama Rao was his predecessor and became foreign secretary at a widely publicised ceremony in South Block on August 1.        
	Actually, Chen and his two aides, who came to New Delhi last week, would not have been the only foreign delegation to have been given a rude jolt by Sharmas ministry.        
	Chiles new foreign minister Mariano Fernandez Amunategui, who was ambassador here until recently, was told by the commerce ministry that he or his officials could contact Nengcha Lhouvum Mukhopadhaya at the Indian embassy in Santiago for guidance about the New Delhi meeting.        
	Unknown to the commerce ministry, of course, the Indian government had issued a press release, just over a fortnight before world trade ministers gathered in New Delhi, appointing Mukhopadhaya as Indias new ambassador to Serbia.        
	The truth, however, is that Mukhopadhaya has never worked at the Indian embassy in Chile. She is moving to Belgrade from Beirut, where she was posted as ambassador on October 18, 2004.        
	Yet another participant in the New Delhi meeting, whom the commerce ministry managed to puzzle, must have been Venezuelas foreign minister Nicolas Maduro.        
	He was told prior to leaving for New Delhi to contact Y.K. Sinha, ambassador in Caracas. Sinha is actually in New Delhi and, in a commendable start to Raos foreign secretaryship, has been picked by her to head South Blocks dealings with Pakistan.        
	Sinha cut his teeth in hardcore diplomacy as deputy secretary in charge of Pakistan in the 1990s. He was later deputy high commissioner in Islamabad, both reasons for choosing him to pursue the nitty-gritty of Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs planned initiatives on Pakistan.        
	As in the case of Chile, the left hand of the Indian government does not appear to know what its right hand is doing about Venezuela. On August 12, more than three weeks before trade ministers began arriving in New Delhi, the government announced a new ambassador in Caracas, Lal Dingliana, now envoy in Bulgaria.        
	Pakistan downgraded its representation at the meeting: instead of commerce minister Amin Fahim, it decided at the 11th hour to send only its commerce secretary Suleman Ghani.        
	South Block officials were saying in a lighter vein that Islamabads decision was made after reading the commerce ministry document.        
	Islamabad has been pressing for a meeting between the foreign secretaries and, as the joke goes, it is peeved that New Delhi was using its commerce ministry to confuse Pakistan even about who its foreign secretary is.        
	The commerce ministrys faux pas is surprising since the commerce minister met Shashi Tharoor, the minister of state for external affairs, on August 17 and had detailed discussions on co-ordinating the governments foreign and trade policies in the context of the New Delhi meeting.        
	Besides, the commerce ministry has an Indian Foreign Service officer, Amarendra Khatua, on deputation, who could have corrected the mistakes.        
	Sources in Delhi said Khatua was made co-ordinator only for logistics for the meeting. They said most of the documents for the meeting were micro-managed in Sharmas office and not referred to or vetted by others who could have spotted the errors.

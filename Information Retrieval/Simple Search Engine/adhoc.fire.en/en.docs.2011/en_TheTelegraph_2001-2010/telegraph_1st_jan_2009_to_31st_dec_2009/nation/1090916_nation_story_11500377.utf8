The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Mollah wants the top rectified 
                                                                                                               Mollah wants the top rectified 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 15: Land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah today said the rectification drive in the CPM should begin from the top as it was the leaders who were running the show, not the rank and file.        
	The minister, who described himself as a cog in the wheel, said a communist party should stay away from promoters, dealers or contractors.        
	The ministers comments come at a time the Vedic Village controversy has swivelled the spotlight on his department amid allegations of land grab by the resorts promoters. The land department had entered into an out-of-court settlement under which vested land was handed over to the Vedic promoters for a song.         
	After what has been happening in recent months, particularly after the Vedic Village incident, there is a need for rectification at all levels in our party. But it should certainly begin from the top as they are the ones who are running the show. Hitting out at those in the lower rungs wouldnt help solve the problem our party faces now, Mollah said at Writers Buildings.        
	The politburo is now working on a draft rectification document which, sources said, would be placed at a meeting of the panel on October 11.        
	Mollah, a state committee member, said a communist party doesnt have place for promoters, dealers or contractors. If some of them are in the party or associated with it, they should be caught by the scruff of their necks and thrown out. Our leadership has to decide whose place is where in the party. A person meant to stay in the balcony or in the forecourt of a house cannot be given accommodation in the master bedroom.        
	Asked if he had submitted his views to the party in writing, the minister said: My handwriting is not good. So I did not give it in writing. But I have been telling the party since the fourth panchayat polls in 1993 that opportunists and those not following communist ideals should be thrown out. But the party didnt listen and thats why its paying for that.         
	But Mollah said he was just a cog in the wheel, when asked if he didnt feel it necessary to advise the party after the recent debacles. I am not the engine that runs the vehicle.        
	Asked if by engine he meant chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee or state party chief Biman Bose, Mollah said: That I wont say. But the engine needs adequate coal and water to run.        
	The minister said the CPM had failed to convince the masses that it was a party for the poor. Actually, it has become a middle-class party. We need to pick up poor people.

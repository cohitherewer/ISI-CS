	March 22: Conspiracy theories, spiced with suggestions of political intrigue, are flying like runs off the bat after the decision to shift the Indian Premier League out of the country.        
	The guesses range from the UPA governments keenness to avoid a security nightmare to the need to get even with a troublesome ally to the organisers refusal to accept political advertisements.        
	On the whole, the NDA-ruled states seemed less reluctant to hold the matches compared with those governed by the Congress, which stands to lose the most in the general election in case of any terror strike on IPL matches.        
	IPL organisers insistence that no political advertising would be allowed  either in the stadiums or on TV  too had rubbed the political establishment the wrong way, a source in Delhi said.        
	For the political parties, the IPL was a great vehicle to reach out to the masses. But the organisers refused to play ball, which may have made the political establishment take a hard stand on security, the source said.        
	But Gujarat Cricket Association president Narhari Amin, a Congress leader, rubbished the charge. It is wrong to allege that our governments created hurdles for the IPL because of the ban on political advertising as we are not the only party advertising itself. The BJP too will be as affected as us, if not more, Amin said.        
	Much of the grist for the political rumour mill has been provided by Congress-ruled Maharashtras flip-flop on promising security. The state initially agreed to provide security but later backed out.        
	Some see this as the Congresss way of settling scores with ally and BCCI strongman Sharad Pawar, who has been giving the ruling party a trying time over seat-sharing while dropping hints of flirting with the Shiv Sena.                  
	The Congress-Pawar tussle over the IPL was clear from the confusing signals coming out of Mumbai of late.         
	Jayant Patil, the Maharashtra home minister who is from Pawars NCP, had been issuing daily statements that the tournament was on track. He even contradicted S. Chakravarti, a police officer of director-general rank in charge of poll security.        
	Chief minister Ashok Chavans statement yesterday that the state could not provide security was as much a blow to the IPL as a snub to Patil.        
	Asked about the alleged divide between the Congress and the NCP, Chavan said: It is not about parties. But the security of the state and the nation is important. The IPL dates were clashing with the elections and thats why it is not possible to provide security for the matches.         
	On Chavans stand, Patil said: I dont want to comment. I would leave the general public to think about it. I am of the opinion that we are capable of conducting any event despite 26/11. I discussed it with the DGP and the Mumbai police commissioner and all of us were of the opinion that we can show to the world that Mumbai is still secure.         
	But NCP spokesperson Madan Bafna hit a different note. How is it possible to organise IPL matches in the middle of the elections? Lakhs of people come for the matches along with VIPs and IPL organisers thought it was difficult to handle. So, politics had nothing to do with it.         
	Cricket board president Shashank Manohar today specifically identified the Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra governments as those which changed their stand. The AP government revoked its earlier permission... and the Maharashtra chief minister wrote a letter that we cant host matches in that state until May 13, Manohar said, adding that the cricket body was not holding it against the governments.        
	The criticism prompted Andhras Congress chief minister to issue a quick defence. Y.S.R. Reddy said the state faced simultaneous Lok Sabha and Assembly polls, and so providing security to IPL matches would have been a problem.        
	Security is of utmost significance for the elections. We cannot take any risk, even an iota of it, he said.

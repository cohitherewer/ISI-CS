The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bid to save CPM heads
                                                                                                               Bid to save CPM heads
  - Biman voice drowns in Kerala faction fight         JAYANTH JACOB                                    
	New Delhi, May 18: The poll soul-search at the CPM politburo today threw up differences between Bengals Biman Bose and Keralas V.S. Achuthanandan but the final word was that individual heads should not roll as all decisions were taken collectively.        
	After CPM general secretary Prakash Karat set the tone by saying talks should be deep and without any prejudice, Bose is reported to have listed two chief reasons for the debacle.        
	Sources said the Bengal party secretary attributed the defeat to the prevailing mood in favour of a stable and secular government and to the failure of the third front to project itself well enough to catch the peoples fancy.        
	Bose said the front was not seen by the people, especially in states like Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, as a credible and viable alternative to the secular Congress-led coalition.        
	The Bengal leaders were also of the view that though the Left had split with the UPA over the Indo-US civilian nuclear deal, it was not able to work the issue into a campaign plank that directly affected the people.        
	The argument about the third fronts ineffectiveness, however, did not get the support of most of the members, sources said. The Kerala lobby questioned the logic, pointing out that the Congress remains the main opponent of the party in Bengal and Kerala.        
	The Bengal leaders also faced questions about the erosion in its traditional vote base, neutral votes not falling into its kitty as in the past and the inability of the state leadership to gauge the change in the mood of the people.        
	There were queries about the Bengal units failure to counter the misinformation campaign on Singur and Nandigram and it being ultimately translated into votes for rival parties.        
	Some members suggested that the Left had underestimated the real strength of the Trinamul- Congress combine.        
	When reporters later asked Bose for his take on the Bengal whitewash, he shot back: Why all the seven seats in Delhi went to Congress? Out of 10 seats, nine went to Congress in Haryana. Why it happened in Andhra Pradesh where Naidu, one of the exponents of the third front, is there? You get all these answers, then you will get the reason.        
	Kerala chief minister Achuthanandan was much calmer when his turn came. Without mincing words, he said many of his suggestions had been overruled by the party and that the election results were not a reflection of the three years of his regime.        
	According to sources, Achuthanandan pointed out that the electoral understanding with the PDP had backfired. He made no bones about the fact that his rival and Kerala state secretary Pinarayi Vijayan had been at the forefront of the decision.         
	The decision had gone wrong because it ensured that Muslim votes went to the Congress and its ally Indian Union Muslim League, he pointed out.        
	The CPM central committee is scheduled to meet in the third week of June for further talks.

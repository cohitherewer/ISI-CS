          PTI AND OUR BUREAU                              
	Dec. 8: The Directorate General of Civil Aviation today decided to probe reports that a helicopter carrying Rahul Gandhi landed in poor visibility conditions in Uttar Pradeshs Sitapur last evening.         
	Rahul had earlier virtually snubbed Uttar Pradesh Congress president Rita Bahuguna Joshi who suggested  as a sign of the young leaders commitment  he had forced the pilot to land.         
	I am a pilot and I am absolutely aware of the dangers of flying in low visibility conditions. I will be the last person to do it. The PCC president is not a pilot, Rahul said.        
	On the references to Atal Bihari Vajpayee in the Liberhan report, Rahul said in response to repeated questions: I am not a judge. I dont know. All I say is that as far as I am concerned, Vajpayeeji is a senior politician and he is a senior person. As a young person and as a person who is nowhere near the experience of Vajpayeeji. in our tradition, I owe him a certain deal of respect, which I give.

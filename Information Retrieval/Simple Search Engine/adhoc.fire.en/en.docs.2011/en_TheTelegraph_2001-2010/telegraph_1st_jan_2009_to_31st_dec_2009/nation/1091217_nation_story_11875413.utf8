          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Dec. 16: Chief minister Naveen Patnaik today stressed on industrial development with public participation, during his visit to Kalinga Nagar Industrial Complex, the upcoming steel hub.        
	For the overall development of the state, industrialisation along with the growth of agriculture sector is essential. It will generate revenue, which will help carry forward developmental and welfare schemes, said Naveen while inaugurating a high-tech police station in the industrial complex.        
	Highlighting the rapid industrialisation in the state, the chief minister said industrial investment proposals to the tune of Rs 6 lakh crore had been lined up, while industrial projects involving investment to the tune of Rs 3 lakh crore were under implementation.        
	Naveen sought peoples cooperation for the rapid industrialisation and hoped Kalinga Nagar would become the industrial capital of the state. Direct and indirect employment opportunities for more than 50,000 people have already been created in steel sector alone, he said.        
	Claiming that the states resettlement and rehabilitation policy has been adjudged one of the best in the country, Naveen said utmost importance had been given to the interest of displaced persons.        
	This was his first visit to Kalinga Nagar after the infamous police firing on January 2, 2006, in which 14 tribals were killed while resisting construction of boundary for the proposed Tata Steel plant. Its unfortunate that Naveen did not bother to visit our villages and talk to us, said Rabindra Jarika, the secretary of Visthapan Virodhi Jana Manch, which has been spearheading anti-displacement agitation in Kalinga Nagar.         
	The chief ministers meeting was held around 8km from the epicentre of the anti-steel plant agitation.

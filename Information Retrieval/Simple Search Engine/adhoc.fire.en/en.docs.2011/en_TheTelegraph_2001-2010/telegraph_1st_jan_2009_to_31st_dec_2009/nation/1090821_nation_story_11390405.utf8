	New Delhi, Aug. 20: The government couldnt rename its flagship rural job scheme after Rajiv Gandhi, so it has settled for the second-best option.        
	An assembly hall named Rajiv Gandhi Seva Kendra will be built in each of Indias 2.52 lakh panchayats for all official and semi-official work relating to the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS), indirectly stamping the programme with the former Prime Ministers name.        
	The rural development ministry made the announcement today coinciding with Rajivs 65th birth anniversary, handing the country its 176th welfare scheme named after a Nehru-Gandhi.        
	Every panchayat will have a Rajiv Gandhi Seva Kendra in three years time. It will play the role of a mini-secretariat where issues related to the development of the village will discussed, rural development minister C.P. Joshi said.        
	The Congress-led government had initially toyed with the idea of renaming the rural job scheme after Rajiv. But since the scheme had come into effect under an act of Parliament (the NREGA), it proved difficult to tinker with the name.        
	So Joshi and his junior Pradip Jain Aditya  both said to be handpicked by Rahul Gandhi  thought of the seva kendra plan.        
	Although the NREGS was the brainchild of the previous UPA government, some in the Congress felt that others, including state governments (not run by the party) could hijack the scheme as their own. They believe that if a Gandhi stamp is stuck to it, the scheme would always remain the Congresss, a ministry official said.        
	Each kendra will be a forum for discussion on the scheme, will keep records, and act as a single window to provide information on the scheme. All the kendras would be built as NREGS projects.                        Rahul Gandhi with his niece Meira at Vir Bhumi on Thursday. Picture by Rajesh Kumar      
	Further strengthening the link with Rajiv, the rural development ministry will carry out a review of the scheme on August 20 every year. It today organised a national workshop on the scheme on the occasion of Rajivs birth anniversary, with Rahul Gandhi as guest of honour.        
	The ministry has struck a partnership with the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIAI), which will provide a Unique ID (UID) to all members of below-poverty-line (BPL) families that can be used for various purposes, including the opening of bank accounts.        
	UIAI chief Nandan Nilekani said the UID would help eliminate duplicate job cards and authenticate workers presence at a job site. It will also help the NREGS worker to have more mobility in the sense that he will be able to opt for NREGS work anywhere in the country, Nilekani said.        
	Ten new kinds of work will be brought under the scheme, now limited mainly to unskilled manual labour. Projects under the scheme may now be divided into two broad categories: social infrastructure and social services.        
	Social infrastructure building will include the construction of roads, of houses and toilets for BPL families, of playgrounds, mini-stadiums and anganwadi schools.        
	The social services category will include the cooking of midday meals at schools  and meals for children below three years at adjoining anganwadis  the running of crches and the like.        
	Since work under the social services category would not require hard labour and would be more in the nature of part-time services, it should be reserved for old age persons with disability/destitution, preferably women, living alone without succour, the ministry said.        
	The Centre has taken several other decisions to improve the working of the scheme. One of them is to appoint permanent lok sevaks at every panchayat to safeguard the rights of NREGS workers, many of whom are illiterate. The lok sevaks will take up all the complaints and follow them up.

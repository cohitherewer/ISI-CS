	June 23: Opposition leader Partha Chatterjee was today waylaid by CPM cadres in Burdwan, triggering a stand-off that dragged on until finance minister Pranab Mukherjee intervened over phone after apparently being alerted by Mamata Banerjee.        
	Chatterjee went on a dharna for six hours at Burdwans Kheria village after CPM cadres armed with rods encircled his vehicle. The Trinamul leader was on his way to meet party workers allegedly attacked by CPM workers.        
	The dharna was called off after Mukherjee, who was in Bengal, spoke to Chatterjee. Pranabda called me after Mamata Banerjee briefed him about the armed CPM cadres. He told me that the Centre had taken a note of the incident and requested me to return to Calcutta, Chatterjee said.        
	Two other Trinamul leaders, Sudip Bandopadhyay and Madan Mitra, had tried in vain on June 18 to visit the same area in Burdwan, where a CPM leader was murdered.

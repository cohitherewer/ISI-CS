          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, June 7: A 35-year-old man who developed fever two days after arriving in Delhi from New York has tested positive for the H1N1 swine flu, raising Indias number of confirmed cases to 10.         
	The passenger, who had arrived on a New York-Delhi Air India flight (AI 102) on June 2, has been placed under home quarantine and provided the anti-viral drug oseltamivir, health officials said today.         
	He has mild symptoms and there is no need to isolate him in a medical facility, a senior official said. Persons who have had close contact with him have also been provided the drug as a preventive measure, the official said.         
	A leading virologist said isolation would be of little use now because the man could have been shedding the virus before he was confirmed as positive for H1N1.         
	Health authorities also reported today that a 25-year-old man in Hyderabad who had shared air cabin space on a British Airways flight with another man infected with the H1N1 virus had also picked up the infection.         
	Hyderabad has had seven patients with H1N1, Coimbatore has reported two.         
	All patients here have had very mild disease that responds fast to treatment, said Subhakar Kandi, a chest physician who has been treating patients in Hyderabad. No one has had the symptoms beyond three or four days.         
	Early studies on the H1N1 virus in other countries have indicated that for every 10 persons infected, there would be 12 to 16 secondary cases. The virus, detected in Mexico in April, has spread to 69 countries, infected 21,940 people and killed 125.         
	In Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy requested the Centre to arrange for personal protection equipment for air passengers.         
	The National Institute of Communicable Disease (NICD) said people travelling to India from swine flu-hit countries should undergo tests before entering the country.

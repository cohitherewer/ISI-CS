The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Big guns boom for Orissa votes
                                                                                                               Big guns boom for Orissa votes
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY IN BHUBANESWAR                              
	The average Oriya voter is being wooed like never before. If the Congress has flown in leaders like Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Ghulam Nabi Azad to swing the tide, so has the BJP.        
	L.K. Advani, Narendra Modi and Rajnath Singh have all come peddling their partys brand of aggressive Hindutva, a novelty in deeply religious but subdued Orissa. Chandan Mitra, the partys state in-charge, has been camping here.        
	If the Congress and the BJP have gone all out, chief minister Naveen Patnaik, the ruling BJDs star campaigner, has been covering each and every Assembly stretch.        
	Sources said he had covered almost every single segment, not a mean feat. The state has 147 Assembly and 21 Lok Sabha seats.        
	The Congress, which loves to hate him, swears that Naveen is buying off voters. The BJD is spending Rs 1,500 crore in this election, alleged Orissa Congress spokesperson Kailash Acharya. Others said Rs 100 crore would be a more reasonable guess.        
	The Congress, used to being in power, is getting itchy sitting out. Unfortunately, it has no state leader with even half of Naveens charisma.        
	The party has dumped former chief minister J.B. Patnaik after twin electoral reverses and party workers now talk condescendingly about him. No one wants him to campaign, a source said.         
	Chief minister aspirant K.P. Singh Deo is doing his bit but his appeal is limited to pocket borough Dhenkanal.        
	But it didnt stop him from proclaiming over the phone from a roadshow there that people dislike Naveen Patnaik. Hes a paper tiger propped up by the media. The Congress, he added, would win a majority, both in the Assembly and Parliament.         
	He, however, denied any chief ministerial ambitions. Thats for the party to decide.        
	The Congress never projects any candidate as chief minister, said spokesperson Acharya. The party will decide after the elections.        
	AICC general secretary Ghulam Nabi Azad parroted the same line when asked who would decide: the legislature party or the high command?         
	Each and every MLA is consulted and the consensus is conveyed to the high command, Azad said. The high command usually agrees to it.        
	The BJD, despite its good performance record, is not leaving anything to chance. The party has been shaken up by a string of high-profile defections, many of them blamed on Naveen Patnaiks emphasis on issuing tickets to newer, younger candidates.        
	The BJP, for one, is hoping to benefit from the desertions. We will win both in the Assembly and Parliament elections, state in-charge Mitra said rather overoptimistically.        
	The BJD laughs off his claims. The BJP brand of politics will not work in Orissa, spokesperson Narendra Swain said. Its brand of politics involves creating conditions for social strife. But the people want peace. They dont want places of worship looted, women raped and people killed.        
	 Orissas south-west voted on April 16 for the Assembly and the Lok Sabha. The rest of the state votes on April 23

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Intruder debunks Taliban buzz
                                                                                                               Intruder debunks Taliban buzz

	Srinagar, April 25: Sayeed Moinullah Shah says he is a Pashtun militant from Pakistan and had entered Kashmir a month ago with 119 others. But he also says he has no links with the Taliban.        
	The army today paraded the 20-plus young man before the media in an unusual move to debunk speculation of Taliban infiltration in Kashmir or Kargil-like incursions.        
	But as Sayeed waved to the large group of journalists at the army corps headquarters here and settled down calmly to spill the beans, it was easy to see why the late-March sneak-in by his group had raised such a buzz.        
	It was one of the most sophisticated intrusions ever, by an astonishingly large group, launched deliberately in a hostile season and through a most difficult route to avoid detection. The composition of the team was unusual too.        
	Sayeed, who is from Dhir district of Pakistans North West Frontier Province, said only 31 of the 120 infiltrators were militants. They were from the Hizb-ul Mujahideen, Lashkar-e-Toiba, Jaish-e- Mohammed and the Pir Panjal Regiment, a Hizb affiliate. He claimed the Taliban had no plans to come to Kashmir.        
	An officer said Sayeed had been fielded to nail the lies about Taliban arrival in the Valley. What better way to do it than through the mouth of a captured militant?        
	Brigadier Gurmeet Singh said that of the 31 militants, 12 had been killed by the security forces and six had died in an avalanche. The army had seized a huge war-like store of 10 AK-47s, 13,000 AK-47 bullets, 445 grenades and 32kg RDX, which needed 45 porters to ferry across the border.        
	So, 31 were militants and 45 were porters. Who were the rest? The rest were guides or labourers required for snow-beating and cutting, an officer said. The Line of Control is buried under 6 to 48 feet of snow, he added.        
	The LoC is packed with snow this time of the year. It will take 15 days for it to melt and the fence to come up. They chose the most inhospitable terrain and time.        
	Sayeed said he had joined Hizb after listening to a speech by a militant commander who described alleged army excesses in Kashmir. He was trained in the Manshera jungles and set off for the Valley on March 21, trekking through the Shamsbari range in north Kashmirs Gurez sector.        
	The porters, guides and labourers went back to Pakistan after the infiltration. Sayeed stayed in Bandiporas upper reaches for around 12 days before a local Kashmiri family turned him in to the army some 10 days ago.        
	Sources claimed two other rebels had also been captured but were not fielded at the news conference because they were not Pakistanis.        
	I wanted to go back because I did not find much need for jihad here, Sayeed said, contradicting his handlers claims on army atrocities.        
	No commanders accompanied us. We were not on a mission and were asked to take orders from the commanders here, he added, not fumbling once before the volley of questions. He was not allowed to take every query.        
	Army sources said this year had seen an unprecedented militant push into Kashmir before the elections, but there was no question of terrorists occupying any area or Kargil-like intrusions.        
	Brigadier Singh said the other major infiltration bid took place in Kupwara, but 20 of the 25 militants who entered had been killed.        
	The preparations behind the two bids have surprised the army. Infiltration through Gurez takes five days and nights whereas the usual routes take a day or two, an officer said.        
	The LoC is 70km long in Gurez and we have only a brigade manning it. There are gaps and they occasionally exploit them. In this case, they followed a watershed between two valleys which is extremely difficult to trek through.        
	Before Kargil, the army left its posts vacant for up to six months in winter but the break has now been restricted to three months, from December to February. Infiltration is quite impossible during these months. It is still difficult to be there in March, an officer said.

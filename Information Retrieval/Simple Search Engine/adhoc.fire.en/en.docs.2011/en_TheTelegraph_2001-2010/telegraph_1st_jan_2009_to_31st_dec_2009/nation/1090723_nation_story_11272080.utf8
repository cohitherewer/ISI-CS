The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Clouds steal Taregnas show 
                                                                                                               Clouds steal Taregnas show 
          NALIN VERMA                              
	Taregna (Bihar), July 22: Taregna saw the darkness but missed the eclipse.        
	A lone star peeped out through a narrow gap between two black clouds in the southern sky as the world turned pitch dark a little over an hour after sunrise. Lights came on at homes, cacophonous crows flapped frenziedly back to their nests, and street dogs barked as if there was no tomorrow.        
	But the cloud cover played spoilsport in this village 25km south of Patna, whose billing as the best place for sighting the eclipse from India had drawn thousands from across the country and abroad.        
	Belgian Mitchell Mark, an eclipse chaser for 10 years, was philosophical. I missed a total solar eclipse in Europe in 1999 and missed it again this time, he rued. But at least we felt the impact of the total eclipse here. It was an amazing experience.        
	Five lakh people were out on the dusty lanes. They had come from everywhere  Britain, Ireland, the Netherlands, France. I had never seen such a huge crowd here, and so many foreigners, said local trader Ashok Gupta, 53.        
	The village, which usually goes to bed around 9pm, had stayed awake through the night, happy to see a clear sky at midnight. But by 3am, dark clouds stretched from horizon to horizon. Still, the light of dawn seeped through, although the sun stayed hidden. Then it began getting darker again at 5.29.        
	By 6.25, it was pitch black, and a chorused whoo rose from hundreds of panicky throats. Some women raised lighted lamps skywards from their rooftops. After nearly four minutes, it started getting lighter and by 7.30, it was a usual morning again.        
	Chief minister Nitish Kumar, who was at Taregna with his entourage, was not too disappointed. At least, we watched nature reveal itself in a different way. It was the experience of a lifetime, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Joburg in Modi flight path, then London
                                                                                                               Joburg in Modi flight path, then London
          AMIT ROY IN LONDON AND OUR BUREAU                          Modi: Hunt continues                                  
	March 23: The famed English weather has cast a cloud over the IPL finding a shelter in the home of cricket, making South Africa a strong contender to host the tournament.         
	IPL commissioner Lalit Modi, who was set to fly tonight to Johannesburg and then to London tomorrow, was quoted by CNN-IBN as saying the South African city was prepared to host IPL matches from April 10  the scheduled start of the tournament  which Lords couldnt.        
	Modi, who insisted both countries had a fair chance to host the tournament, told the channel he had two schedules ready, one beginning April 10 and the other in which the IPL would get under way on April 17. Tomorrow night we will have an answer, he said.        
	A top source in the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) said a team was flying out to Johannesburg this evening for talks with officials of Cricket South Africa (CSA).        
	However, England is very much in the race to host the tournament. If it is held in that country, we would like the IPL to begin at the Oval and end at Lords, the source said.        
	England was the clear front-runner until BCCI officials realised that the notorious English drizzle could play spoilsport.        
	Hotel accommodation could be an issue in England too. The London Marathon is scheduled for April 26, which would make it difficult to get hotel rooms for at least two or three days during that period.        
	Also, England has a packed domestic cricket season with the county season beginning April 15 and the West Indies touring in May.        
	The pro-South Africa lobby in the BCCI argues that the country is a better option as far as costs are concerned and also vis--vis television timings. Modi, who shares a good rapport with CSA chief executive Gerald Majola, yesterday promised Indian viewers matches at last seasons timings of 4pm and 8pm IST.         
	This would mean an 11.30am and 3.30pm (local time) start in England. For South Africa, the timings would be 12.30pm and 4.30pm.         
	Also, the BCCI source said, some English counties  notably Yorkshire  were not comfortable with a Twenty20 English premier league as it would clash with the county season. Even the International Cricket Council (ICC) is edgy about having the IPL till May 24 in England, which could affect gate receipts for the Twenty20 World Cup in the country from June 5.        
	Adding to the uncertainty are the googlies, doosras and chinamen looping through the air. Manoj Badale, UK-based chairman of reigning IPL champions Rajasthan Royals, has said the league belongs to India and he had not abandoned all hope that at the last minute there would be some deal with the government that would allow the tournament to be staged in India.        
	Home minister P. Chidambaram said there was no (such) suggestion when asked if he would tell the BCCI to reconsider the decision.        
	Officially, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) spokesperson is saying very little possibly because he knows very little. He does not know if ECB and IPL officials are meeting in London this week, which they will have to do if the 59 Twenty20 matches have to be fitted in over 45 days between April 10 and May 24.        
	ECB chief executive David Collier was reported yesterday to be flying back to England from the Caribbean.

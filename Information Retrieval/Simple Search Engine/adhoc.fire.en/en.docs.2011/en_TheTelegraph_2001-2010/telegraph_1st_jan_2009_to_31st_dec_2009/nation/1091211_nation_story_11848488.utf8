          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Dec. 10: The Opposition today, in a petition to the governor, accused the government and the Assembly secretariat of hampering proceedings related to the premature adjournment of the session sine die.        
	Opposition chief whip Prasad Harichandan said they had sought a meeting with the governor to urge him to call for video clippings to ascertain the truth.         
	Citing the sequence of events last Saturday, Harichandan said the House had taken up a statutory motion endorsing the proposed Orissa (Alteration of Name) Bill, 2009, in the afternoon session. After the adoption of the motion, the ICFAI University Bill was scheduled for discussions.        
	However, government chief whip R.N. Pani suddenly proposed to adjourn the Assembly session sine die with 11 working days left. Parliamentary affairs minister Raghunath Mohanty and law minister Bikram Keshari Arukh supported him. Without hearing the views of Opposition, the Speaker put the official motion for adjournment of the session sine die before the House, said Harichandan.        
	Though the Opposition demanded division (voting by slips), Speaker Pradip Kumar Amat did not listen to their demand and announced that the motion was passed by voice vote, Harichandan alleged.        
	However, Opposition demand for voting did not find mention in the Assembly proceedings. There was only a mention of pandemonium and interruption, deliberately done to mislead the governor who had called for the proceedings and the public opinion, Harichandan alleged.        
	However, parliamentary affairs minister Raghunath Mohanty refuted the allegation. The Opposition had not demanded voting and the official motion for adjournment of the session was passed by voice vote, said Mohanty.

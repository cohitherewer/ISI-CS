The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CPI N-punch to big brother
                                                                                                               CPI N-punch to big brother
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 7: The CPI today attacked its bigger partner, the CPM, saying withdrawal of support to the previous UPA regime should have been on livelihood issues, not on the nuclear deal.        
	Contrary to the CPMs view that breaking ties with the Congress-led coalition on the nuclear deal was correct, CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan said the majority at the national executive thought that the withdrawal should have taken place on issues of peoples livelihood and should have been in good time and not just a few months before elections. We were not left with much time to go to the people.        
	Bardhan, however, said he still believed that opposition to the nuclear deal was correct. Withdrawal of support was inevitable, imminent and unavoidable, he said. But it would have been better if the focus was on livelihood issues like price rise and farmer suicides.        
	The CPI also said the CPMs unilateral style of functioning in Bengal and Kerala led to the Lefts rout in the two states, adding insult to Karat and Co.s injury after the dismal showing in the recent elections.        
	The front junior partner wants this attitude to change and added that the relationship among Left parties should be based on equality.        
	 The Left Front, in both Kerala and Bengal, was not properly functioning as a front. There was unilateralism in its functioning, Bardhan said while briefing reporters on the three-day executive that ended on Sunday.        
	This attitude, he added, was one of the reasons for the Lefts Lok Sabha debacle.         
	Asked if he was alluding to the CPM, he said whoever is the largest party, it is its responsibility for ensuring that the front is run properly.        
	We have been seeing and witnessing it. There is no hiding it. It is true. The Left Front is a front of all Left parties. It has to be run collectively. It is obvious that it is not the RSP or the Forward Bloc which is responsible for this (for running the front). Nor is the CPI.        
	The CPI chiefs comments came in the wake of the criticism he faced from within his own party for playing second fiddle to his CPM counterpart Prakash Karat.         
	Bardhan today said in future, the relationship within the front would be based on equality.

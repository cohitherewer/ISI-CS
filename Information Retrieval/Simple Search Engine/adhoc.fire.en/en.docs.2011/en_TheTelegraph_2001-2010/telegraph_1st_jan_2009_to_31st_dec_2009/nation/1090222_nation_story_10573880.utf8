          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 21: Five dacoits walked into a house this evening, but minutes later four ran out while the fifth was caught by the schoolteacher they had set out to rob. Two of the four who fled were caught on the road outside.        
	Madhumita Roychowdhury, 48, was alone at her two-storey Anwar Shah Road home with two helps when the doorbell rang around 8.15pm.        
	The five men introduced themselves as house painters and Madhumita let them in.         
	The landlady, Madhumita Roychowdhury, was searching for some building painters for the past few days. Five youths, all in their 20s, came to the house around 8.15pm, said an officer of Lake police station.        
	The men followed her inside the house, where three ran up the stairs to the first floor while two followed behind with Madhumita, who teaches in a secondary school near Hindustan Park.         
	While she was still half-way up, she heard the first three ransacking a room, apparently in search of almirah keys.         
	I started to climb down the stairs screaming. The robbers came out and tried to gag me and flee. While four of them escaped, I managed to get hold of one, Madhumita said.         
	Suparna and Atul, a couple who work as servants in the house, rushed to help as one of the fleeing robbers hit Madhumita with a chopper on the hand. The injury was not serious. Hearing cries from the house, located at the busy Lords Bakery junction, the crowd outside caught two of the men.         
	Madhumitas husband, Avijeet Roychowdhury, is out of town on work. Her son Raman, 24, a musician, was not at home.        
	We are also investigating how the robbers got information that some building painters were required in the house, the officer said.

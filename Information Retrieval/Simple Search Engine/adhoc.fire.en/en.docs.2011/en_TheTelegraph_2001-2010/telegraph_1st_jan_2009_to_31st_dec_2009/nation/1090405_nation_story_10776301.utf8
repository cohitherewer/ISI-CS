                                                                                                               Five guilty of dud US visas for 90 Indians
                            
	Houston, April 4 (PTI): A federal jury has found five persons guilty of conspiring to obtain fraudulent work visas for nearly 90 Indians for at least $20,000 (Rs 9.9 lakh) per visa, the US attorneys office said.         
	Mahendrakumar Mack Patel, 55, Rakesh Patel, 36, twin brothers Alberto and Bernardo Pena, 38, and Marte Othon Villar Sr, 48, had hatched and executed the conspiracy, a statement from the attorneys Office said yesterday.         
	The jury found that Alberto and Bernardo from Brownsville, along with the co-defendants, had encouraged and induced 87 people from Gujarat to unlawfully enter the US on temporary H-2B visas, knowing it well that the Indians neither intended to work for the construction company that was used to get the visas nor did they plan to return to India when their 10-month visas expired, the statement said.         
	The twins also travelled to India to assist the Indians with the application process and visited and corresponded with the US consulate in Mumbai.         
	Two other co-defendants  Mack of Ft Worth and Rakesh, a Houston pharmacist  pleaded guilty for recruiting Indian citizens who were willing to pay $20,000 to $60,000 (Rs 29 lakh) in exchange for US visas. None of them ever worked at the US construction company.         
	Mack and Rakesh also collected payments for the visas in the form of cash as well as cashiers checks and money orders from immigrants after their arrival in Houston on fraudulently obtained visas.         
	Another co-defandant, Charles Keith Viscardi, 48, the owner and manager of a construction company located in New Iberia, is alleged to have enlisted AMEB Business Group Inc  a visa-facilitation firm owned and operated by the Pena brothers  to procure foreign manual labour under the H-2B visa programme.         
	An H-2B visa allows US employers to hire foreign workers for temporary non-agricultural work if the employer shows that there are no qualified US workers to perform the jobs. As many as 66,000 visas are issued every year under this programme.        
	The conspiracy generated an estimated $1.8 million in profit for the accused.         
	The twin brothers, who will be sentenced on June 26, face a maximum penalty of up to five years imprisonment and a $250,000 fine in connection with the conspiracy conviction and up to 10 years imprisonment and a $250,000 fine for each of 14 counts of inducing illegal immigration.         
	In addition, Bernardo also faces up to 20 years in jail and a $500,000 fine if convicted of money laundering for the purpose of concealment.         
	Both Mack and Alberto face up to 10 years imprisonment and up to a $250,000 fine if convicted of violating the money laundering statute.         
	Defendants Mack and Rakesh, who made their initial appearance before US magistrate judge Mary Milloy on Thursday, were released on a $50,000 bond and will be electronically monitored for pending trial. They will appear before magistrate judge Calvin Botley on April 15.         
	Alberto, who made his initial appearance before Milloy today and was released on a $50,000 bond, will also be subjected to electronic monitoring pending trial.

	 Chandigarh: Float a party to beat the meltdown, if you take Jaspal Bhatti seriously.          
	Televisions original funny man recently launched one himself  called the Recession Party, of course  and said he would fight the Lok Sabha election from Chandigarh, the 54-year-olds hometown.           
	The joke on the political class did not stop there, but whether he would indeed contest is not clear. Knowing Bhatti, it could all just be a joke.          
	Bhatti has a signature tune ready in keeping with the depressing economic situation  a parody of the Dev D hit number Tauba tera jalwa, tauba tera pyar, tera emotion al atyachar. When Bhatti sang, it became Tauba yeh recession, tauba yeh berozgaar, tera political atyachar.          
	The crowd of shoppers in the Sector 17 market plaza cheered.          
	Recession demands financial planning and Bhatti had done this too for his party.           
	Funds from any party that wants to cut their opponents votes are welcome. Those who want to make pre-poll alliance deals with our party may also fund us. I will not spend a single paisa from my pocket, Bhatti said, standing with wife Savita and members of his group, the Nonsense Club.          
	 Hyderabad: No ticket, no food.          
	A two-term Congress MLA is on an indefinite hunger strike after being denied a nomination.          ga Krishnamurthy, who represents Gunturs Gurajala, has rebuffed appeals from the district Congress chief to call off his fast that began on Friday.          
	Krishnamurthy is upset at having been short-changed by the party high command, which has decided to field a new candidate.          
	Krishnamurthy was said to be an influential leader, till the Congress bosses decided on a change. He had once been a member of Tirumala-Tirupati Devasthanams, the board that runs the countrys richest temple.

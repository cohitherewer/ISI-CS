The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Judge savours relief,   Centre gets headache
                                                                                                               Judge savours relief,   Centre gets headache
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                                                Liberhan at his office in Delhi on Tuesday. (PTI)      
	New Delhi, June 30: Justice M.S. Liberhan is a relieved man today  after plodding through 48 extensions spread over 17 years, 400 sittings, and spending between Rs 77 lakh and Rs 8 crore.        
	I am a relieved man, the usually tight-lipped Liberhan said shortly after he had handed over the political hot potato of his four-volume report to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, his namesake.         
	The panel he headed has admittedly had to wade through insurmountable heaps of documents and examine obdurate witnesses to get to this point  all at the cost of some crores.        
	His panel will go down in history if only for straddling the terms of four Prime Ministers and taking 48 extensions to complete its work as also for costing the exchequer only Rs 77 lakh, the official figure. But estimates accessed through the right to information suggest the expenses could be as high as Rs 8 crore.        
	The normally somnolent office and staff of the panel, housed in the imposing Vigyan Bhavan here, had reportedly burnt midnight oil.         
	The panel held 400 sittings, examining leaders of the BJP and its sister organisations such as L.K. Advani, M.M. Joshi, Kalyan Singh (now with the Samajwadi Party), Uma Bharti (not with BJP now), Sadhvi Rithambhara et al.         
	Even then, arguments concluded some two years ago. A fallout with the counsel helping the panel, Anupam Gupta  ostensibly over Advanis role  further set it back.         
	For some time, it seemed as if the panel was stalling.         
	Was it part of the unofficial terms of reference to wait till the storm blew over and some rationality returned to party polemics, or was it just plain delay, no one knew.         
	Old-timers privy to Justice Liberhans conduct as a judge, first in Punjab and Haryana High Court when he was picked up to head the panel, as also his later stints in Madras and Andhra High Courts swear by his honesty.         
	His transfer out of Madras High Court had prompted a strike by lawyers. He was then handling the case relating to special courts trying cases pending against Jayalalithaa.         
	Others swear that hes too meticulous and plods on and on. The delay, Liberhan said, was explained in the report. Will any explanation be enough, some wondered.         
	The contents of the report, which have had all parties in a huddle, are as yet unknown.         
	Liberhan, schooled in the old-world reticence of judges, holds his silence. I submitted the report to the PM I cant open my mouth on this. The report can speak when it comes out, was all he said.         
	For the government, though, his report is a headache in more ways than one. It gives a fresh lease of life to an issue that can only help the BJP regroup politically.         
	Tabling the report within six months, as mandated by the Commission of Inquiry Act, 1952, also has its pitfalls.         
	The report can only be tabled along with an action taken report. Not acting would anger Muslim groups calling for accountability. Moving in any way would mean playing into the BJPs hands.         
	Experts, however, quoted a Supreme Court judgment that the Centre could fall back on  a 1987 ruling clarified that a commission of inquiry report would not be invalidated only because it was not submitted within a time frame.         
	Conversely, the government would not be bound by the six-month time limit.         
	Another option, bordering on political adventurism, would be to table the report and ignore its recommendations. They are not binding on the government. Or move against those who have the least multiplier effect in politics now.

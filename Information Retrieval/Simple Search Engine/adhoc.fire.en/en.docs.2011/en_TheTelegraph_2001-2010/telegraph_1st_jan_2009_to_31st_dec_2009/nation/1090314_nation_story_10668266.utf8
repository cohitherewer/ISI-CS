The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CISF foot in mouth
                                                                                                               CISF foot in mouth
                            
	New Delhi, March 13 (PTI): The Central Industrial Security Force chief, N.R. Das, put the government in a spot when he said on Tuesday that 16 commandos had been sent to Islamabad to protect the Indian diplomats there.        
	They will perform VIP security duties after assessing the situation there, he said, adding the men had left 15 days ago.        
	Pakistan got in touch with India to find out when and how the commandos reached the country. When did they go? We have no information. At least they would have required visas, a high commission official here asked.         
	Yesterday, the CISF clarified that it planned to send 16 drivers and support staff, not commandos, to the Indian mission in Islamabad.         
	At present, police of the host country protects the diplomats.

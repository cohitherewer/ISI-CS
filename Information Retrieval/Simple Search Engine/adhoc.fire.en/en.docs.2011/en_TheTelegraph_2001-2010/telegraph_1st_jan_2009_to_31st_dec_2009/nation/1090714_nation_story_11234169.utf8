                                                                                                               Rebels planned strike for 3 months
          SHEENA K.                                            
	Raipur, July 13: Investigations into yesterdays Maoist attack on security personnel at Rajnandgaon, 90km from the state capital, has revealed that the strike was being planned over a span of three months.        
	In these months, the area had witnessed a steady rise in Maoist activity, leading to an increased presence of security personnel there.         
	The force, including slain superintendent of police Vinod Kumar Choubey, had been investigating the rise in Maoist presence in the thickly forested pockets of the state.         
	From the beginning, the rebels waited and watched, they did not attack the police parties. They studied the police strength, configuration and route in these three months, said a senior officer talking to The Telegraph.        
	Yesterday, after trapping and shooting two jawans, the rebels circulated a rumour of more than 1,000 rebels moving in the area, thus laying a trap for the personnel.         
	After bringing in the force into the thickly forested area, the cadre finally struck in the afternoon and killed 36 jawans including the SP.         
	Earlier, on March 15, 2007, rebels had attacked a camp in Ranibodli area and killed 55 personnel, who belonged to the Special Police Officer force.         
	Top officers said that the report of rebel presence made the security personnel rush into the operation, without checking status or facts first.        
	The first batch of personnel who entered the forests first was travelling on motorcycles. They were ambushed on the Madanwada-Maanpur road.         
	The military dalam of the rebels executed the operation, the officer said, adding that Choubeys convoy was right behind. Few jawans were killed in the ambush. By the time the SPs convoy reached the spot rebels had stopped firing. As Choubey and his team tried to remove the bodies, Maoists started to fire indiscriminately from all sides leaving no room for escape and no chance to the personnel to retaliate.         
	Five jawans who were a part of the operation are still missing. Though a massive search operation has been launched in the forest, no breakthrough has been reported, yet.        
	Meanwhile, Opposition Congress in Chhattisgarh has called for a state-wide bandh on Tuesday in protest against the Maoist act and alleged failure of state government in controlling the situation.

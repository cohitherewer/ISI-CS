          MUZAFFAR RAINA                        Opposition leader Mehbooba Mufti argues with Jammu and Kashmir Assembly Speaker Mohammad Akbar Lone				             Mehbooba lunges towards the Speaker rsquo;s podium, wrenches out a mike and hurls

  lady pulls back Mehbooba            Watched by two other ldquo;quaking rdquo; mikes on the legislators rsquo; desks, Mehbooba is escorted out of the House (PTI pictures)                                      
	Srinagar, July 27: Peoples Democratic Party chief Mehbooba Mufti today snatched the Speakers microphone in the Assembly and hurled it to the floor after he ordered marshals to take this woman out.        
	Mehbooba strode towards Speaker Mohammad Akbar Lone, lifted the mike off his table and, as Lone flinched apparently expecting her to throw the metal instrument at him, tossed it away.        
	The PDP chief then made a grab for some other stuff lying on Lones table, including a couple of other microphones, but was held back by a woman watch-and-ward employee.        
	Women marshals then hustled Mehbooba out of the House and soon all PDP members  who had been raising a din over the Shopian rape and murder  were dragged out of the Assembly.        
	Omar Abdullah, attending his first House session in summer capital Srinagar as chief minister, watched without a word, apparently enjoying the whole thing as an indignant Mehbooba later alleged.        
	The PDP chief had become furious after Lone refused to let her discuss the Shopian case, arguing the only business scheduled for the first day was obituary references.        
	He (the Speaker) should have had more patience. I had no other way. I never threw the mike at him; I just trashed the mike. I wanted to tell him that if you are ready to use force, we can also use force. This is not the way to behave with a lady, Mehbooba later said.        
	The worst incident of mike-throwing in an Indian legislature had happened in October 1997 in Uttar Pradesh, when MLAs wrenched the fixed microphones off their desks and hurled them at one another, with many getting injured.        
	Orissa, however, set an example for the country four years ago: when three Congress members yanked off the state Speakers microphone in August 2005, he fined each of them Rs 20,000.        
	As proceedings started today, the BJPs Ashok Khajuria raised the subject of a central university for Jammu and was told this wasnt the time to discuss it. Then ruling National Conference member Ramzan Chowdhary got up to speak about the storm havoc in Kupwara last night.        
	PDP members were quickly on their feet  some climbing on their benches  to shout slogans seeking justice for the Shopian victims. Soon, they rushed into the well.        
	Take them (the legislators) out take this woman out, the Speaker told his marshals, repeating the order several times. As her colleagues were being dragged out, Mehbooba rushed towards Lone.        
	Omar and the Speaker later condemned the PDP members behaviour. Mehbooba and her MLAs staged a sit-in outside the Assembly.        
	A PDP spokesman blamed the Speaker for pinpointing the leader of the largest Opposition party and asking the staff to drag this lady out.        
	BJP and National Conference leaders were allowed to speak but we were denied. It is a murder of democracy, Mehbooba said. The Speaker is biased, undemocratic and partisan. I have no regrets about what I did today.        
	Two women were raped and murdered in Shopian, and a police superintendent and three other policemen were arrested.

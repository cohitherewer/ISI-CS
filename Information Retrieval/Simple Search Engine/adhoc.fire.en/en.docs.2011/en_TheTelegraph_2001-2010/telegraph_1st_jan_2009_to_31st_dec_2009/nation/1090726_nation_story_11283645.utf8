The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Court hint at   in-camera trial 
                                                                                                               Court hint at   in-camera trial 
          NASIR JAFFRY                          Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi                                        
	Islamabad, July 25: A Pakistani court today hinted that the trial of the five Mumbai attack suspects might be held in camera following a request by Islamabad.        
	Judge Baqir Ali Rana heard the defence and the prosecution, which asked for the trial to be held away from the public eye, and posted the next hearing for August 29.        
	The anti-terrorist court seemed inclined to a request by the state to hold an in-camera trial, Shahbaz Rajput, counsel for accused Hamad Ameen Sadiq, told The Telegraph.        
	He said it would take some time for the charges to be formally framed. We are right now in the first pre-trial phase.        
	The pre-trial proceedings took place in a room set up as a court at Adiala prison in Rawalpindi. The defence lawyers  who include Sardar Tariq and Malik Rafiq, appointed counsel for the remaining four accused  sought details of the evidence against their clients.        
	We had a chance to meet our clients who were produced before the court today, Rajput said.        
	We hope the government will provide us the details as early as possible, enabling us to prepare the defence, he said, adding that the judge had asked the prosecution and the defence not to reveal details of the proceedings to the media.        
	Rajput criticised Pakistan interior minister Rehman Malik and the Indian authorities for saying the accused should be awarded stern punishment.        
	They should refrain from making such statements, which may influence the judicial process. We have full faith in our courts and India should respect the judicial proceedings that have now begun in Pakistan, he said. We are pretty confident that the trial will be transparent.        
	The accused, arrested by the Federal Investigation Agency, include alleged mastermind Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi, a top operative of the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Toiba whom India accuses of carrying out the November carnage. The remaining four are Sadiq, Mazhar Iqbal, Shahid Jamil and Zarar Shah alias Abdul Wajid.        
	Pakistani investigators have claimed that Iqbal was the Mumbai gunmens handler and Wajid their computer expert. Sadiq allegedly facilitated funds and hideouts while Jamil is believed to have trained the crew of the vessels that brought the gunmen from Karachi into Indian waters near Mumbai.        
	Pakistani law-enforcement agencies are chasing at least 13 more accused, declared proclaimed offenders.        
	Our clients are innocent and the government of Pakistan is acting under Indian pressure, Rajput said. The other two defence counsel and the prosecution lawyers were not available for comment.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pak 26/11 judge springs quit surprise
                                                                                                               Pak 26/11 judge springs quit surprise
          NASIR JAFFRY                              
	Islamabad, Oct. 21: The Pakistani anti-terrorist court judge holding the trial of the seven suspects accused by India of involvement in the Mumbai attacks wants to opt out.        
	Judge Baqir Ali Rana wrote to Lahore High Court chief justice yesterday expressing his inability to hear the case because of unavoidable reasons, a source told The Telegraph. The high court will take a decision on the request.        
	The source said Rana, was facing pressure from the suspects lawyers unhappy about the in-camera trial.         
	The lawyers had accused the judge of trying to indict the suspects on October 10 in their (lawyers) absence and that too after the court time. The suspects have also repeatedly expressed their distrust in the anti-terror court, the source said.         
	According to PTI, there are also reports of Rana having received threats from the Lashkar, blamed by India for the attack, after attempts to indict the suspects in their lawyers absence.        
	The October 10 hearing had coincided with the terror attack on the Pakistan Armys headquarters in Rawalpindi. Rana had reportedly said since the situation outside the court was uncertain, those who wanted to leave could do so. Once the lawyers left, he tried to indict the suspects. Their lawyers boycotted the next hearing on October 17.        
	The accused, taken into custody by the Federal Investigation Agency early this year, include top Lashkar operative and alleged attack mastermind Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi.         
	Asked if the hearing fixed for October 24 would take place, the source said it was not clear at the moment but added that there was a likelihood of the case being transferred to the court of another judge.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Namaste, Kasab tells judge, with a smile
                                                                                                               Namaste, Kasab tells judge, with a smile
          SATISH NANDGAONKAR                                           
	Mumbai, March 23: Mohammed Ajmal Kasab kept smiling during his first court hearing opened to the public eye.        
	Kasab was smiling throughout the hearing and said he was from Pakistan, special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam said of the lone Mumbai gunman caught alive after last Novembers strike.        
	The 21-year-old, dubbed the baby-faced killer after being caught on camera with an AK-47 on the night of November 26, flashed his smile at least thrice during his brief appearance before special court judge M.L. Tahilyani through video-conferencing from Arthur Road jail. The session ended with his remand being extended till next week.        
	Kasab smiled once and did a namaste when Tahilyani told him he would conduct his trial. When asked where he was from, Kasab grinned and said Pakistan, possibly realising the importance of his answer before an Indian court.         
	The young man is also said to have smiled when he was asked whether he had received the chargesheet.        
	This is the first time Kasab, wearing a grey T-shirt and a light stubble, has admitted before the special court that he is a Pakistani national from Faridkot village in Punjab province. Islamabad had repeatedly denied the Mumbai suspects were its nationals before admitting it under international pressure.         
	The question about his origin was asked for the first time today since the remand hearings began. Earlier, a magistrate and a prosecution lawyer conducted hearings in his crime branch lock-up. A closed-door hearing, through video link, was done from Arthur Road jail.        
	Because of threats to his life, Kasab has been physically produced in court only once, on November 27. This was the day after his arrest while the rampage by his nine associates was still on. Over 170 people died in the siege from November 26-29.        
	Kasab agreed to be represented by a government lawyer when the court asked him if he would like one. He had earlier written to the Pakistan high commission in Delhi to provide him consular access and legal representation as a Pakistan citizen. He has not got a response yet.         
	The Mumbai attack trial was to begin today. It has been delayed after the prosecution last week sought a postponement till fortification work at the jail  to prevent attacks on Kasab  is completed. The public works department, which has been carrying out the construction, has told the court it will need time till April 12.        
	Judge Tahilyani remanded Kasab in judicial custody till March 30. He said he would rule on the prosecutions application to push back the trial and on the appointment of a government lawyer for Kasab on that day.        
	The court accepted a prosecution plea to impose a gag order on airing and publishing transcripts of telephonic intercepts tapped by investigating agencies, and on revealing information related to the evidence and witnesses.        
	There are serious threats to Kasab. We suspect he is a Lashkar member. That is why any maps or site plans of jail premises where Kasab is lodged should not be public in the print or electronic media, Nikam said.        
	The prosecutor clarified the threats were not specifically from the Lashkar, but refused to divulge details.

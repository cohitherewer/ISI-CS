          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, March 21: The Congress has decided to press home the advantages accruing from a changing political landscape in its campaigns instead of lamenting over loss of friends in states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.        
	It seems unfazed at the prospect of the RJD and the Samajwadi Party coming together after Lalu Prasad and Mulayam Singh Yadav alleged that the Grand Old Party was conspiring to squeeze smaller groupings from the frame.        
	To hammer home the message to Lalu Prasad and Mulayam that it was quite capable of holding its own against them, the Congress has fielded Lalu Prasads brother-in-law Sadhu Yadav and other RJD rebels like Ramai Ram in Bihar.        
	In Uttar Pradesh, it has announced the names of 15 more candidates.        
	We are more concerned about the Congress than the United Progressive Alliance now. We have not taken the theka (contract) of keeping the secular flag flying aloft. Other parties, too, have a responsibility towards it, a general secretary said.        
	RJD and Samajwadi sources  who hoped the Congress would strategically field persons who could eat into the votes of the BJP-NDA or Mayavatis BSP and facilitate the victory of their candidates  were dismayed to see that in quite a few places it had put up Muslims and OBCs.        
	In a tight contest, if they take away 5,000 votes or so, it will make things difficult for us, an RJD MP acknowledged.        
	The only issue that worries the Congress is a Mulayam-Lalu Prasad reunion could catalyse a regrouping of the backward castes in the heartland and make the combine a force to reckon with after the polls.        
	But, on the other hand, a source said, by sticking with the Congress through thick and thin and falling foul of the Left, the two Yadavs had foreclosed the third front option.        
	Also, the presence of the BSP in Prakash Karats front means the doors are firmly shut on Mulayam and Ram Vilas Paswan. Paswan is the only Dalit competitor Mayavati has in the cow belt.        
	Logically, this means that this grouping or whatever you call it will have no choice but to come back to the Congress if they wish to share power after the polls, an official said.        
	Among the pluses the Congresss campaign will highlight are:        
	The electorates impatience and disgust with petty bargains the smaller parties would strike in an unwieldy coalition like the third front sans a strong nucleus.        
	The Lefts tally is bound to come down. So it cant hope to be a strong centre of gravity. We ran a successful, stable coalition for five years and can deliver an encore, a general secretary claimed        
	Manmohan Singhs image. He was a non-entity in 2004, but has acquired the image of a person of integrity and purposefulness, a source said.        
	In contrast, the BJPs Prime Minister-in-waiting L.K. Advani lacks the iconic stature of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and is no match for Manmohan        
	Sonia Gandhis image of a person who sacrificed office        
	The UPAs pro-poor programmes such as the rural employment scheme; and        
	The supposed consolidation of minority votes to a larger extent than in 2004.

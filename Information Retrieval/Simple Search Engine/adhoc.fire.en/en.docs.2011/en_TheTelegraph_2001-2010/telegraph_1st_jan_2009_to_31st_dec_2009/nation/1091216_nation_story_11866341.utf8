          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Dec. 15: Campus disorder seems to be the order of the day at Utkal University.        
	The premier varsity of the state has been witnessing violence for the past few months, crippling classes and exams like never before, forget government properties worth lakhs ransacked. In August, clashes between two factions of students led to violence, prompting authorities to close the varsity sine die before classes resumed in September.        
	Fresh incidents of tension were reported from the campus this morning, as several students burnt tyres and tried to block the NH-5. The students scuffled with policemen deployed on the campus, too.Two platoons of police have been put on duty after the fresh tension, said Prasant Behera, a senior officer of Sahid Nagar police station.        
	Parikshit Behera, a student, was attacked on December 8, triggering a spell of unrest on the campus with two groups of students blaming each other.        
	Members of the National Students Union of India (NSUI) alleged that their Biju Chhatra Janata Dal counterparts attacked Parikshit. The NSUI activists launched an indefinite dharna after Biju Chhatra Janata Dal state convener Ranjit Mohapatra was let off by the police after interrogation.        
	Ranjit had apparently proved that he was out of station the day Parikhit was attacked. NSUI activists, however, remained adamant demanding his arrest and had been staging blockades on NH-5 for the past couple of days.        
	Meanwhile, in a memorandum to Governor M.C. Bhandare  also the chancellor of the university  members of the Biju Chhatra Janata Dal demanded action against the culprits and appointment of an efficient administrator to restore peace on the campus.        
	The students have been sitting on a hunger strike near Raj Bhavan.         
	The image of our university has been continuously spoiled by a vested interest group of professional students and callous inefficient officials, Ranjit said.        
	The NSUI members also took to the streets protesting against police excess. Protests were also staged at Maharshi College and Rajdhani College.                          
	The NSUI has called for shutdown of all city colleges. With the situation virtually slipping out of control, the state government has decided to convene a high-level meeting to discuss the situation on December 17.        
	But many boarders  unwilling to take any side  at the university hostel were seen leaving, anticipating more unrest.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | In epitaph lies Pinarayis best hope for longevity
                                                                                                               In epitaph lies Pinarayis best hope for longevity
          MANINI CHATTERJEE IN KOZHIKODE                            Pinarayi, Achuthanandan: Battle for supremacy                                
	If V.S. Achuthanandan was the mascot of the Kerala Assembly elections in 2006, three years later it is his bete noire Pinarayi Vijayan who has become the central figure of the Lok Sabha elections that were held in the state today.         
	The bitterly fought election between the CPM-led LDF and the Congress-led UDF will not just have a big impact on the Congress versus third front fortunes in New Delhi a month from now. It is also a crucial test of CPM state secretary Pinarayis organisational clout and shrewd  some would say audacious  political experiments, the repercussions of which will be felt by the party long after the fifteenth Lok Sabha throws up a new central government.         
	In some ways, Pinarayis biggest advantage is that his epitaph has already been written.         
	For several months now, the conventional wisdom from Thiruvananthapuram to New Delhi has been that the LDF will be trounced in this election. The common refrain in television studio discussions and in the local media is that Kerala will witness a reversal of 2004 when the LDF won 18 of the 20 Lok Sabha seats and the Congress got zero. Congress leaders as well as media surveys give the LDF a maximum of five seats this time.         
	And all the reasons attributed for the LDFs expected poor showing are related, in some way or another, to Pinarayi. First and foremost is the SNC-Lavalin case in which Pinarayi is an accused. Although the CPM claims that the issue played no role in the election after it was settled by Pinarayi in course of his Nava Kerala Yatra two months ago, Congress leaders and CPM dissidents insist that it has had a substantial, if silent, impact on the voters psyche.         
	Second, the decision to take the support of the PDP and share the platform with its leader Abdul Madani is also being seen as a Pinarayi initiative which, UDF leaders feel, has led to a consolidation of Hindu and Christian votes in their favour.         
	Apart from these two factors, the UDFs hopes of sweeping the polls rest on intra-Left battles, all of which have Pinarayis imprint. The decision not to give the Kozhikode seat to sitting MP Veerendra Kumar of the JD(S) was pushed down the throat of the party by the state secretary, they claim, and the hostility of the JD(S) will cost the LDF dear in a number of seats in the Malabar region.         
	Similarly, his ruthless decimation of the Achuthanandan faction within the party has led to an outburst of rebellion which will not only affect the LDFs prospects in specific seats but also alienate a large section of party workers and sympathisers, Pinarayis critics believe.         
	The decision to field a number of youngsters in this election  many of them regarded as Pinarayis handpicked loyalists  could also boomerang, they reckon.                 
	Ironically, however, this Pinarayi-centric campaign by the Opposition UDF and the rebels within could end up helping him.         
	Given the low threshold of expectations, if the LDF manages to win just eight seats  which even the more cautious CPM leaders regard as a realistic estimate  Pinarayi can claim a political victory.         
	If it goes up to 10, it will be hailed as a resounding LDF victory. And in case it touches or crosses 12 seats, the position of Comrade Pinarayi will be unassailable and the CPM in Kerala, like in Bengal, will entrench itself for decades to come, a party insider asserted.         
	Unfazed by the high-decibel campaign in the Kerala media, the CPM rank and file is confident that a dozen-plus seats is very much within the LDFs grasp.         
	According to them, the fissures within the CPM and the LDF as well as the anti-Left chorus in the media imbued a do-or-die zeal in the last leg of the campaign which will ensure victory even in seats that were earlier considered tough or impossible. We started off on the defensive but things have steadily improved over the last few weeks, a senior CPM leader said.         
	The Congresss poor choice of candidates, the panic in the IUML over the CPMs inroads in its strongholds, the prospects of a third front government at the Centre and the gang-up of anti-Left forces reminiscent of the 1959 experience  all helped invigorate the organisation and enthuse the cadres, he said.         
	Just as the ills afflicting the LDF are blamed on Pinarayi, he will be hailed as a hero in the event of a good showing and his grip over the party organisation will further tighten. The pragmatic line, which has been resisted by the VS faction, will also get a fillip.         
	But if the LDF gets stuck with just half-a-dozen seats, it could unleash another bout of ideological and organisational churning within the CPM, party insiders feel.

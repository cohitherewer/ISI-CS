The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nudge to Pranab on budget for disabled 
                                                                                                               Nudge to Pranab on budget for disabled 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, June 25: The social justice and empowerment ministry has written to the finance minister asking him to keep the disabled in mind while preparing the budget.         
	It has sent a list of demands for the budget for the disabled to Pranab Mukherjee. These include more job programmes for the physically challenged, greater funding to ensure existing schools have better facilities for them and increased funds for more special schools. Another key demand is that all major government schemes should have special allocations for the disabled.        
	The requests come after the National Child Rights Commission last week called for a child budget.        
	The social justice ministry has also demanded a cess to fund the education of children with disabilities, like the education cess now in force. It wants all ministries to draw up a plan for the disabled and set aside at least 3 per cent of their allocations for it.        
	Funds have also been sought for a survey to collect data on the physically challenged.         
	Also on the ministry wish list is the request to lower income tax rates for employees with disabilities  they pay the tax at rates applicable to others now  and total tax exemption for aids and devices that are used by such persons.        
	The ministry has pointed out that while there are an estimated 90 million persons with disabilities, only 1.5 per cent of the beneficiaries of poverty alleviation and welfare schemes are from this section of the population.        
	Better incentives have been sought for private firms that employ people with disabilities. The ministry has said there is a need for a fresh look at the incentive scheme proposed in the last budget for employers who hire disabled people. The aim was to provide 100,000 jobs but the incentives, such as tax breaks for firms, were not found to be attractive.

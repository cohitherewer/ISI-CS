The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Advani fires six security posers
                                                                                                               Advani fires six security posers
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Advani in Nagpur. (PTI)                                  
	Nagpur, Feb. 8: The BJP today announced internal security would be the crux of its poll campaign that would also dwell on governance, development, the Ram temple and the Congresss dynastic control.        
	Senior leader L.K. Advani put six questions to Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh in his concluding remarks at the BJP national council to stress why internal security issues were paramount in the time of terror.        
	The questions were:         
	Why was a commission of inquiry not set up on the Mumbai attacks?        
	At whose behest was Shivraj Patil, ultimately removed for incompetence, retained as home minister for four and a half years?        
	Why was even the mildest of diplomatic options (snapping trade relations) not used despite talks of all options being open against Pakistan?        
	Will the Prime Minister admit he erred by not making special anti-terror laws for four years and Sonia accept her mistake in opposing Pota?        
	Why has Afzal Guru (Parliament attack convict) not been hanged?        
	Why did the government ignore the Supreme Courts directive for measures to curb infiltration from Bangladesh?         
	Advani, who declared a Ram temple would be built in Ayodhya if the BJP came to power, explained how the BJP was not opposed to Muslims or Christians.        
	He said the BJP believed in true secularism against the pseudo-secularism of the Congress, which used Muslims as a vote bank. He outlined five points, including investment in infrastructure projects and agriculture, that would determine the NDAs agenda.        
	Stressing that the message from Nagpur was Onward to victory, Advani warned leaders against party rifts that would lead to self-goals.         
	To prevent such feuds, he distributed election work among senior leaders by dismantling the centralised control system that was set in place initially.        
	He said he wanted all senior leaders to contest elections, but clarified that Arun Jaitley and Venkaiah Naidu would not join the fray. Jaitley, he said, had some poll-handling expertise that none in the party had and would be given such jobs, while Naidu did not want to contest.        
	Naidu, earlier heading the central election management committee, would look after Andhra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Jaitley will be in charge of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Punjab and Delhi.        
	Advani wrapped up his speech by recalling his close association with Atal Bihari Vajpayee, choking as he spoke of his deteriorating health. He said the national council wished him quick recovery so that he could return to guide the party.

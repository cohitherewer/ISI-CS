The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Trust vote notice to Speaker
                                                                                                               Trust vote notice to Speaker
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, March 25: The controversy over the trust vote, which BJD president and chief minister Naveen Patnaik won in the Assembly, gathered fresh momentum today with Orissa High Court issuing notice to the Speaker and calling for records of the special session held for it on March 11.        
	The high court issued the direction while admitting a writ petition seeking disqualification of three BJP members of the Assembly on grounds of defection to BJD and declared void any proceedings they had participated thereof.        
	Karendra Majhi, the BJP legislator from Baliguda, filed the petition.         
	The three MLAs named in the petition include Mahesh Sahu (Talcher), Dhaneswar Majhi (Kesinga) and Pramila Giri (Baisinga).        
	The division bench of justices I.M. Qudussi and B.N. Mohapatra, after preliminary hearing on the petition, directed the Speaker for submission of all the records related to the proceedings of the House during the special session by April 7, petitioners counsel Sushanta Das said.        
	The bench fixed April 7 for hearing and disposal of the case, Das said.        
	The petition has been filed under Schedule X of the Constitution (anti-defection law) on the ground that the three MLAs had voluntarily given up their membership of BJP and joined the BJD.        
	The membership of the three MLAs was not declared as disqualified and on the other hand, they were allowed to participate in the proceedings of the confidence motion. Hence, the confidence motion, as was moved in the House, has to be declared as illegal, the petition contends.        
	The high courts decision to proceed with the writ petition seeking judicial intervention on the contentious issue assumes significance as a dispute related to the trust vote is pending before the governor for decision. The special session was convened as per the direction of the governor after the Naveen government lost majority following the withdrawal of support by the BJP.        
	Even when Naveen won the trust vote, controversy sparked off when the Congress and the BJP members raised objections over the manner in which the confidence motion moved by him was passed by voice vote and staged a walkout.         
	Later, both the Congress and BJP took the issue to Governor Murlidhar Chandrakant Bhandare and demanded imposition of Presidents rule in the state.        
	Speaker Kishore Mohanty maintained no illegality was committed, while clarifying that no debate was allowed on the motion as model code of conduct was in force.

	New Delhi, Aug. 25: Delhi police today picked up a Jammu youth they were waiting for and who they claimed was an operative of a Lashkar-e-Toiba module after an alert about the Pakistan-based terror groups plans to strike during the festival season.        
	Mohammad Salim was nabbed at New Delhi station with 5kg of explosives, detonators and timers concealed in packets of sweets, investigators said. Special cell sleuths, who also claimed to have found a Pakistani passport and a Jammu voter ID on the 27-year-old, said the explosives could be RDX, which have been sent for tests.        
	Salim is from Jammus Rajouri, the police said, adding the passport was issued in 2008 from Sheikhupura in Pakistan. He was on his way to Maharashtras Nanded, having earlier arrived from Jammu.        
	The sleuths, the police said, had been waiting for Salim for the past three days. The officers intercepted him at the station and searched his handbag and suitcase  in full view of the public and TV cameras.        
	Salim was to take the Sachkhand Express to Nanded, the police said. The sleuths are looking for two others who they believe were with him, police sources said.        
	Special cell deputy commissioner Alok Kumar said 5kg of explosives, four detonators and two timers were seized. The sources said these items had been kept in some of the six boxes of sweets, bought from a popular sweet shop in central Jammu.        
	The sources said initial interrogation revealed that Salim had received training in 2004 in Pakistan to use arms and make explosive devices. He was also put through sermons on jihad, they added.        
	Salim is the third alleged terrorist arrested by Delhi police this month since an intelligence warning of a strike in Delhi, Calcutta and Hyderabad around Independence Day.         
	On August 6, two alleged Hizb-ul Mujahideen militants were held with AK-47 rifles and grenades on the suspicion that they were plotting strikes ahead of August 15.         
	The duo were dubbed Hizbul militants within 15 minutes of their arrest. But now, 20 days later, the police havent mentioned what their targets were. Also unknown so far are the plans of Mohammad Omar Madni, the alleged Lashkar scout arrested in June.

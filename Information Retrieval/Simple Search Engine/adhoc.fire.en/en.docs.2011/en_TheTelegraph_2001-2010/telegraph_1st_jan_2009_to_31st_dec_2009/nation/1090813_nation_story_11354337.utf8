The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Paswan slams govt, media
                                                                                                               Paswan slams govt, media
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Gaya, Aug. 12: Former Union minister and LJP chief Ram Vilas Paswan today accused chief minister Nitish Kumar of pursuing divisive politics and causing rifts among disadvantaged sections, including Dalits.        
	Inaugurating a three-day training camp of party workers at Bodh Gaya today, LJP chief labelled the Nitish Kumar-constituted Mahadalit Commission a sham and said that the chief minister was trying to weaken the Dalit movement by creating artificial distinctions between disadvantaged groups.        
	The LJP chief also called all Dalits to unite and defeat what he called the clever agenda of manuwadis (believers of Hindu caste system).         
	He said that it was up to the Dalits to see through the game plan.        
	The LJP chief also came down heavily on the media accusing it of concealing facts and ground reality and unquestioned buying of the false claims made by the government. He had a word of advice for the media asking it to not put its credibility at stake by prompting what he called a non-performing government.        
	Paswan criticised the government for employing the so-called Mahadalits as sanitation workers at less than nominal wages.         
	The workers, he said, were being pushed out of their regular jobs with a respectable salary, security and were being forced to work on a contractual basis on a paltry salary of Rs 1,200 by Nitish Kumar-led government.        
	While depriving the workers of regular job and remuneration, the government was offering them transistors worth Rs 300. Instead, give them a regular salary according to the recommendations of the pay commission, said Paswan.        
	The LJP boss also came down heavily on the government regarding the ati pichra ayog (Extremely Backward Commission) and the land reforms commission, labelling all eyewash.         
	The list of demands did not end there as he demanded a CBI inquiry into the recent breach in the Bagmati and contradicted the states claim that the contract for the bandh protection was awarded during the tenure of former Bihar Governor Buta Singh. He added that the MoU was signed on December 19, 2005, a month after the installation of the Nitish Kumar government and the approval was granted on April 10, 2008.

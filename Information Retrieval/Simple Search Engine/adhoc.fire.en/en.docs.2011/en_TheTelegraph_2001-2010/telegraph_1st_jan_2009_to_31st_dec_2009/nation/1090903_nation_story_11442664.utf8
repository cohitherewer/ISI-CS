                                                                                                               Manmohan to visit Bihar
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, Sept. 2: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has agreed to visit Bihar to assess both the drought and flood situations in the state.        
	The Prime Minister has accepted my invitation, said chief minister Nitish Kumar, who met Manmohan Singh yesterday at his 7 Race Course residence.        
	But, details of the state visit are yet to be chalked out. He (PM) has asked his office to work out a suitable date, the chief minister said.        
	In course of his meeting, Nitish reminded Manmohan Singh about Bihars demand of Rs 23,071 crore to carry out relief operations in 26 drought-hit districts.         
	Besides, he requested the Prime Minister to arrange for rehabilitation of the region devastated by the Kosi floods, caused by a breach in the rivers embankment at Kusaha in Nepal on a pattern, which the Centre adopted to rehabilitate the Tsunami-affected areas in 2004.        
	The chief minister also reminded the PM of the states demand of Rs 14,808 crore for rebuilding the areas in the Kosi region, still pending with the Centre. The Kosi devastation had displaced over 30-lakh people in 2008.         
	Manmohan has reportedly assured Nitish of all possible assistance with regard to the states demand, but, the quantum of assistance from the PMO is yet to be known.        
	Nitish also apprised the office that Rs 711 crore had been already spent by Bihar repairing national highways in the state and that the state was yet to be reimbursed for that. He demanded that the Prime Minister reimburse the amount as maintenance and upkeep of national highways is the Centres responsibility.

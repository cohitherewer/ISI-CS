The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Swords in sheath, succession ball rolls
                                                                                                               Swords in sheath, succession ball rolls
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Advani: No more fighting                                   
	New Delhi, Aug. 30: The BJP has called a ceasefire and decided to douse its mutinies until the autumn polls in Maharashtra, Haryana and Arunachal Pradesh, a day after the RSS read the riot act.        
	However, the succession process set in motion for the posts of party president and leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha will not be put on hold.         
	Sources said while there was no way Rajnath Singh could hope to secure an extension as party president, Advani would have to step down as leader of the Opposition by October end  before the next session of Parliament starts on November 9.         
	We do not want the Congress and the others to start baying for his blood over the Kandahar mess. If he remains, we will be paralysed in the House, a source said.        
	The back-to-business posture was reflected in BJP spokesperson Prakash Javdekars announcement this afternoon that the BJP-Shiv Sena had sealed their seat-sharing pact in Maharashtra  to be announced on Monday  and were ready to take on the ruling 10-year-old Congress-NCP combine.         
	Javdekar also advised Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to be less concerned about the BJP infighting and fight his own battles against drought and price rise.         
	The Sangh acted on its sermon of unity and brotherhood when its chief, Mohan Bhagwat went to L.K. Advanis house for breakfast today with colleagues Suresh Soni and Madandas Devi.         
	Bhagwats luncheon meet yesterday with Advanis bug-bear, Murli Manohar Joshi, was seen as a putdown of the leader of the Opposition, who is said to have reluctantly gone all the way to meet the RSS chief last evening.        
	Sangh sources said Bhagwats gesture of meeting Advani at his home this morning was meant to reassure the BJP veteran and his adherents that in his impending and inevitable exit, the RSS would stay neutral even if it was not necessarily hands-off.         
	After the breakfast meeting, Devi told reporters that the Sangh felt assured the BJP leaders would stand united, face their problems and emerge stronger.         
	On changing the current leadership, Devi echoed Bhagwats stand and insisted that the BJP would take a decision by itself.         
	A close of aide of Bhagwat said the Sanghs first priority was to ensure that the BJP bloodletting stopped.         
	After that, with our help, the leaders can put their heads together and sort out the succession issues. Until the heat and dust settle down and the decision-makers start thinking coolly and rationally, we do not think this (handling matters related to succession) is possible. The trust deficit between the factions has to be plugged and a core of sincerity and conviction has to be formed in each leader, the aide said.        
	However, Sangh sources, speaking on Bhagwats behalf, emphasised that the intense factional feelings between what was loosely called the Advani and the Rajnath factions had narrowed, if not eliminated the prospect of the camps followers to become party president.         
	They said while the quartet of Arun Jaitley, Sushma Swaraj, M. Venkaiah Naidu and Ananth Kumar might have seemed a picture of fusion when they had posed for the cameras on Friday night after meeting Bhagwat, few were befooled with the appearance.        
	Everyone knows that Jaitley and Sushma have no love lost for each other. If Jaitley were to become president and Sushma leader of the Opposition in Advanis place, it will trigger another battle for supremacy, a source said.

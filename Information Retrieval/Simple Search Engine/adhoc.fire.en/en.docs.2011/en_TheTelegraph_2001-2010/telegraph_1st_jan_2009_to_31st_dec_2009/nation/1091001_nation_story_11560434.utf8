  - Plate robbers audacity rankles sleuths          RASHEED KIDWAI                          Jyotiraditya at Gwaliors Jai Vilas Palace during Dussehra celebrations. (Saeed Faruqui)                                               
	Bhopal, Sept. 30: Dozens of private detectives and forensic experts have descended on the palatial home of royal scion Jyotiraditya Scindia  to catch a thief.        
	The item missing: a silver plate.        
	But more than the theft, what seems to have rankled more is the thiefs temerity: the intruder had the gall to enter the bedroom of the Maharaja of Gwalior.        
	So the army of sleuths, headed by a former CBI officer, is scouring the heavily fortified Jai Vilas Palace for clues.        
	The theft  its exact date has not been revealed  came to light months after police complaints were filed on behalf of the Union minister and his aunt Yashodhara Raje over dozens of missing items from the palace, styled on the Palais de Versailles.        
	In a complaint filed on May 19, Yashodharas assistant Satish Jaiswal listed 91 antiques and precious silver utensils as missing from the palaces eastern wing, where the late Rajmata Vijayaraje Scindia, Jyotiradityas grandmother, used to stay.        
	Jyotiradityas secretary Vijay Phalke also filed a complaint, but police are yet to crack the case.        
	The cops, however, found that no locks had been broken and the alleged thefts were carried out with keys. A Gwalior resident went to the extent of saying that someone influential may have been selling the antiques and the burglaries were nothing but a cover for the clandestine sale.        
	Jyotiraditya was in his palace on Monday for Dussehra celebrations and some claimed that he seemed upset over the loss of the silver plate, studded with precious stones and marked with Rajasthans traditional meenakari art of decorating metal with enamelling.        
	His supporters, however, claimed that the young minister was more upset that the thief  or thieves had dared to enter his private chambers.        
	The Scindia household is tight-lipped about the latest incident of theft, but sources said four domestic helps  Pancham, Mukesh, Rajendra and Rajak  had been detained for interrogation. For the record, however, Gwalior police have denied making any formal arrests.        
	Its a petty theft compared with the past theft, Gwalior superintendent of police A. Sai Manohar said, trying to play down the incident.         
	The nature of crime is totally different and has taken place in a room, where a small souvenir, a silver plate, has been stolen. We have recorded statements of the caretakers and are investigating the case.        
	Sources said the private detectives had advised Jyotiraditya to set up an electronic security system with a closed-circuit television set.        
	Sounds a good advice  only the royal bedroom will be open to plebeian eyes.

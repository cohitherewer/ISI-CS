The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Single malt: a double-barrelled English plan 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Single malt: a double-barrelled English plan 
          AMIT ROY                            David Fitt, the distillery manager of the English Whisky Company. (Below) The logo of the company                                
	London, Nov. 28: Single malt whisky drinkers in Calcutta, Mumbai, Delhi and Bangalore, who meet monthly to try out bottles presented by one of the assembled, can look forward to a new experience  the first single malt produced in England for more than a century.        
	It comes courtesy of the English Whisky Company, whose distillery is based in Roudham, Norfolk, and appears to overturn the notion that a single malt or a whisky for that matter isnt the real thing unless it comes from Scotland.        
	That is wrong, insisted Andrew Nelstrop, managing director of the English Whisky Company, whose current annual output is only 150,000 bottles, of which some will be left in casks for up to 20 years.        
	What is patented is the word Scotch, not whisky, he argued.        
	After maturing for only three years, which is the minimum period before the fermented liquor can legally be sold as whisky, a bottle of single malt from the English Whisky Company is now retailing for 35 (Rs 2,685), Nelstrop told The Telegraph today.        
	The firms logo shows St George slaying the dragon  which the Scots may think is a dig at them though it may not have been intended thus.        
	The big question  will it be available in Calcutta?        
	The answer, happily, is yes but perhaps not immediately (unless hand-carried by Calcutta-bound passengers for family or friends).        
	We have very good relations with Amrut (a Bangalore-based Indian distillery), said Nelstrop. We are talking to a few people in India. It will cost more than 35 in India, of course, because of the 150 per cent duty. So it may be two years before it is available in India.        
	For a whisky to be called a single malt, it has to be made from barley and come from an individual distillery.        
	That is exactly right, confirmed Nelstrop. We cannot blend with a malt from any other distillery because we are the only one in England.        
	He described his own single malt as quite smooth, not fiery, easy to drink.        
	Asked whether it would go well with a cigar, since this is how the connoisseurs of Calcutta like to enjoy their single malts, Nelstrop was reassuring: All whiskies go well with cigars  we sell cigars, too, it so happens.        
	According to David Fitt, Nelstrops distillery manager, by the 19th century, whisky production was on the increase and spreading. Distilleries were being built in Wales, England, India and even Australia. Sadly, though, the end of the 19th century saw the end of whisky production in England. The English Whisky Company is very proud to be putting England back on the whisky map in the 21st century with the development of St Georges Distillery.        
	Fitt revealed that his distillery produced its first run on December 12, 2006. It was with much excitement and with an enormous sense of achievement that we filled the first barrel of St Georges whisky. We now produce on average 13 casks a week, building up a good stock of delicious English malt spirit. Our spirit has to sit in barrels for three years before it can be called whisky.        
	The litigious Scottish Whisky Association may not share Nelstrops views on what constitutes a whisky and what can legally be called a single malt.        
	When Vijay Mallya of Indias United Breweries tried to sell his product as Indian whisky in Europe, he got into trouble with the Scottish Whisky Association. But the poacher turned gamekeeper with Mallyas 2007 acquisition of Whyte amp; Mackay, a famous Scottish distillery, for 600 million.        
	The feelings of the Scots are reflected in a news report in todays Daily Mail, headlined: A wee dram of English whisky, by George... or how the first single malt from south of the border for 100 years has left Scots seeing red.

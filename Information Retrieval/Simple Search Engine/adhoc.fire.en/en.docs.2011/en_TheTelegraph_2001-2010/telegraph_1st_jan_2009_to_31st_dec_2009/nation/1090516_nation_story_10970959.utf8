The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cong talks to Naveen
                                                                                                               Cong talks to Naveen
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Where is he headed?                                  
	Bhubaneswar, May 15: While UPA leaders are busy trying to get the support of regional parties, senior Congress leader Kamal Nath spoke to chief minister and BJD boss Naveen Patnaik today.         
	Kamal Nath and Naveen are old friends from Doon School days. So, their talk over the telephone is not unusual, said a senior BJD leader, confirming the conversation on condition of anonymity.         
	However, Naveen is now more concerned about forming a government in the state, rather than indulge in alliance talk, he said. We will consider extending support to any coalition at the Centre that will protect Orissas interest, said the leader.         
	He, however, ruled out any tie up with the NDA.         
	BJD strategist and Rajya Sabha member Pyari Mohan Mohapatra denied any secret deal being formed between any national party and the BJD.         
	However, its natural that the major national parties will seek BJD support to form a government at the Centre, he told the local media.         
	We are 100 per cent confident that we will secure absolute majority in the Assembly and form the government on our own. So, there is no question of seeking support of any national party to form the Orissa government, said Mohapatra. There are reports that several Congress leaders are trying to keep the channel open with the BJD.         
	PCC president K.P. Singhdeo, who returned from New Delhi this afternoon after meeting Congress president Sonia Gandhi and other senior leaders, said: We have kept all options open. He, however, did not deny or confirm conversations between Naveen and Kamal Nath.         
	Veteran Congress leader and former chief minister J.B. Patnaik said the possibility of a tie-up with BJD and Congress could not be ruled out. Nothing is impossible in politics, said he.         
	Earlier, Naveen had ruled out his partys support to any Congress-led or BJP-led government at the Centre.

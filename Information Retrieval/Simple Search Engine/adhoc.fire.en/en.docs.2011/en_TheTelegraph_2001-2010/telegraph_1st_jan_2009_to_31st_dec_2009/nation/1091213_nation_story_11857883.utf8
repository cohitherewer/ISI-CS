	Kathmandu, Dec. 12: Much of the Nepali establishments mistrust of the Maoists stems from its suspicion that under the shadow of the current deadlock, the Reds are well on their way to creating a state within a state. It doesnt relieve their chagrin that they are unable to contain the rapidly expanding Maoist spheres of influence.        
	From confiscating land and harvests in the countryside to establishing street sway in urban centres, Maoists have gone fairly unchallenged, the state and other political parties have mostly watched aghast.         
	It is beyond debate the Maoists are the fastest-growing force in the country, concedes Shekhar Koirala of the Nepali Congress, once the nations dominant party, the Catch-22 is the more they are kept out of the power equation, the more they will gain.        
	More conservative and right-wing elements of the Nepali polity are patently alarmist on prospects. They are convinced the final objective of Maoists is the capture of the state. Says a top leader of Koiralas own party: Nobody should be fooled what the Maoists are up to, they are at work politically, leading the national agenda, and they have the YCL (Young Communist League) and the PLA (Peoples Liberation Army) soldiers to back their aims, we got enough indications of their takeover intentions during Prachandas nine months in power.         
	Asked what political competition, such as his Nepali Congress, was doing to contest the Maoist march, he merely shrugged. Instead, he went on elaborate his fears. They do have a state in a sense, an army, the YCL as their police, their extensive party and political network to fill in key roles of governance.        
	To top echelons of the Nepali Army, widely seen by the defensive Nepali conservatives as the only bulwark against Maoist takeover after the abolition of monarchy, it has become a necessity to stop the Maoists politically and militarily. Arguing that Maoist philosophy is intrinsically totalitarian, an angry Nepali Army general told The Telegraph: The current drift in Nepal is just helping them edge closer to a takeover. The political parties are idle and ineffective, in fact they are assisting the Maoists. Why, for instance, is the PLA being trained at state expense? Why are PLA soldiers being paid salaries? We are the Nepali Army, not they. The consequences of this will be disastrous.         
	The general offered suo motu denials on the possibility of a conservative coup by the Nepali Army  We remain apolitical, under the command of the elected government - but warned of a intensifying tussle for power outside the sphere of democratic competition.         
	The Maoists are not democrats and make no bones about it. They have not given up violence as a tool of politics. When in power, they actually tried to completely take over the army. Anyone who thinks they are just like any other party is fooling himself and others.         
	He went on to list moves by the erstwhile Prachanda government that he saw as a takeover bid  their dogged resistance to fresh army recruitments, their refusal to promote senior officers, their plans for drastic downsizing of ranks by retiring beyond 30 years of service, their attempt to enter the PLA as a separate team in the Nepali National Games, and finally, their failed bid to sack General Rukumangad Katuwal, which triggered the Prachanda governments fall.         
	It is very clear from all these moves that the Maoists were constantly trying to weaken the National Army and promote the PLA, at the very least they saw both forces on a par, that cannot happen in a democracy, you cannot have two competing armies. And the Maoists actually want to replace the existing army with an indoctrinated force which the PLA is, the General fumed.        
	The PLAs integration into the Nepali Army is probably the most contentious of the unfinished agendas of the comprehensive peace agreement that ended the civil war in late 2006. Of late, the Nepali Army, backed by the influential Indian mission, has hardened its position against integration. It has quarrels on many issues  that the Maoists have exaggerated their strength, that the PLA is a political force, that it will answer to the Maoists rather than the military command, even that integration really means integration in society, not necessarily the armed forces.         
	But there is enough to indicate that although they make a point of it, the Maoists themselves are not too hurried on the integration question.        
	Why should they? argues a senior bureaucrat-turned-civil society player, They are getting training at state expense, they are getting paid, why should the Maoists just lose their army to the National Army at such a fluid juncture, they want to retain their striking arms, and understandably.         
	A seasoned civil society observer of Nepals slow and troubled transition concurs with such understanding of Maoist intents and purposes. In a very dispassionate way, it has to be said that the Maoists have arrived here to change the nature of the state, and that goes beyond merely creating a republic. They will upset the status quo, and they are. The issue really is how radical those changes will be and how they will be made. The more you try to frustrate and delay their participation in power, the harder they will come down, they may attempt at some point a swift and radical transformation, a bloody urban-rural insurrection, if you will.         
	Maoist leaders are officially shy of affirming plans for such an insurrection are in the works; what they seldom deny is that the essential aim of their existence is to fundamentally change the nature of the Nepali state.         
	Ganesh Man Pun, boss of the powerful YCL, offers a sneak sense of what that state may be like: We will allow limited political competition under our progressive hegemony, but there will be no role for imperialist and feudal parties or regressive monarchist forces.

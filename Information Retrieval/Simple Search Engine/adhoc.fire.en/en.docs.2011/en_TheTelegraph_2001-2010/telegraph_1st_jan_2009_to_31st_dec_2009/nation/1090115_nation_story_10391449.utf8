                                                                                                               100 per cent FDI in print
                            
	New Delhi, Jan. 14: The Centre today allowed 100 per cent foreign direct investment (FDI) in entities publishing facsimile editions of international dailies in India, reports our special correspondent.         
	The move, which is being seen as an important piece of policy reform in media ownership rules, will pave the way for editions of global papers, including The Wall Street Journal, in India. The earlier FDI limit was 26 per cent.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Third front a house of cards: Sonia
                                                                                                               Third front a house of cards: Sonia
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chennai, May 10: Congress chief Sonia Gandhi today said the third front would collapse like a house of cards and urged the people of Tamil Nadu to vote for the Congress-DMK front.         
	In her only election meeting in the state, Sonia shared the dais with Tamil Nadu chief minister and DMK chief of the M. Karunanidhi.        
	Sonia pointed out how some of the parties who fought with us in 2004  the Left, PMK and MDMK  have formed a new front in an opportunistic alliance, the so-called third front.         
	I want to ask you and I am sure you will be able to make up your mind about them, how can an alliance in which each party has such contradictory views and interests hold together? This front will collapse like a house of cards even before the results are out, she said.         
	Sonias affirmation of the Congresss alliance with the DMK came in the backdrop of a flutter created by Rahul Gandhi recently when he hinted that Jayalalithaas ADMK was a like-minded party.        
	She tried to tug the heartstrings of the voters by recalling their emotional attachment with Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi, who was assassinated in Tamil Nadu during an election campaign in May 1991.         
	She also made the right noises on Sri Lanka, asserting that the Congress was determined to see that all people in the war zone on the island move to safety. The stand of the Congress for 30 years has been to secure the Lankan Tamils equal rights and status in the framework of the Indo-Sri Lankan Accord of 1987, she said.                     
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had yesterday rubbished the talk of sending troops to Sri Lanka, saying it was not easy to march armies into sovereign nations.

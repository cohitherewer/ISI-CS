The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rift aids Iron Man despite loss of grip   Dividends from deep divide
                                                                                                               Rift aids Iron Man despite loss of grip     -  Dividends from deep divide
          SANJAY K. JHA                          Advani at a BJP rally in Delhi on Saturday. (PTI)                                        
	New Delhi, July 18: The endless feuding among the BJPs second-rung leaders appears to suit L.K. Advani for now.        
	Although it exposes his weakening grip over the organisation, it also strengthens the case for him to continue as leader of the Opposition on the ground that the younger generation is not yet ready to take over.        
	Immediately after the poll defeat, this rivalry had given Advani an excuse to continue in the Parliament post. The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh too had thought a smooth transition was not possible in that volatile situation and agreed to let Advani carry on for some time.        
	Now the strife has intensified and sources say Advani is unlikely to step aside under these circumstances, although the initial impression had been that he would give up the post by the year-end.        
	Many in the party, though, believe that it may not be easy for Advani to stay on since the Sangh wants the BJP to prepare for the next election in 2014 with a clean slate. Although Advani has declared his plan to undertake a nation-wide yatra, indicating he is not going to retire soon, few expect him to lead the party five years on at the age of 87.        
	Sources say that Arun Shouries piercing critique of the partys functioning has reinforced the Sangh perception that the BJP needs an overhaul. Some senior Sangh leaders have said the issues Shourie has raised should be thoroughly discussed, indicating they favour change.        
	The sources said many Sangh leaders had congratulated Shourie for his analysis, in his newspaper articles, of the leadership crisis in the BJP.         
	Although the BJP has dismissed the criticism as Shouries personal views, many leaders do support his offensive.         
	Shourie has argued that personal ambition and jealousy have been playing a bigger role than ideology in the running of the party. He claims top BJP leaders rely more on intrigue than on dialogue or merit in making their decisions.        
	Many BJP leaders concede in private that Shouries attack was prompted by Advanis defence of Arun Jaitley, the partys chief strategist for the general elections, and his efforts to maintain status quo in the leadership structure.        
	Although some BJP leaders say Shourie should have used party forums to raise these issues, others feel that honest debates are not allowed at these forums with the entrenched interests crushing any dissent.        
	Many recall how the party bosses handled the last national executive meeting, and cite the editorial in the latest issue of party mouthpiece Kamal Sandesh as proof that the leadership is not interested in honest debates.        
	The editorial says the central theme of the deliberations at the national executive was the need for unity. It says Kadam mila kar chalna hoga (we must walk together) and extols the virtues of commitment to the party, discipline and sacrifice. There is no mention of the questions raised by senior leaders about what went wrong in the elections.        
	Many see this as a desperate attempt by Advani to suppress dissent. The editorial mentions Sunderlal Patwas arguments as reflective of the mood at the national executive without referring to the views expressed by the likes of Shourie, Jaswant Singh and Maneka Gandhi.        
	Even Yashwant Sinhas letter, which claimed the election management was flawed, has been ignored. Patwa had been fielded specifically to counter the rebels.

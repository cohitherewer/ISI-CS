The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Spy appetite gives govt ache
                                                                                                               Spy appetite gives govt ache
          MANJEET SEHGAL WARRIOR                              
	Dharamsala, Oct. 2: Chinese looking for a good life in India had better not apply for an employee visa.        
	They need to just turn up as a spy and enjoy VIP hospitality, complete with chow mein and momos twice a day and an entourage during their evening outings.        
	Thats what has happened with young Li Suan, 28, who was caught without valid travel documents in Dharamsala last December.        
	At a time New Delhi is tightening visa rules for Chinese workers, Li is being accorded VIP treatment by Dharamsala police, who have been racking their brains on how to get rid of their expensive, unwanted guest.        
	Li was arrested on December 12 under the foreigners act for travelling without valid documents and also charged with spying, Kangra superintendent of police Atul Phulzhele said.         
	On September 15, however, a local court ordered Lis release and asked the state government to deport him. The court said the nine months the young man had spent in jail was enough punishment for violating the foreigners act, but did not say anything on the spying charges, conviction on which would have sent Li to jail for years.        
	The Dharamsala police last week took Li to the Chinese embassy, which not only refused to take him back but asked the police to arrange the money for his return ticket.        
	The state government will take the matter up with the home ministry. The authorities will decide whether he will be deported through a land route or by air, Phulzhele said.        
	Li has been put up in the police lines and has become a headache for us. He only eats Chinese food and insists that it be served hot. According him VIP status is beyond the means of the Dharamsala police.        
	Another officer, who requested anonymity, said: We take him to the market where he eats chow mein and momos. He also demands costly food for lunch and dinner and creates a ruckus in the evenings if we fail to take him out for a stroll.        
	Li is surrounded by three to four policemen when he goes out for a walk in the evening. He appears like a VIP while walking with the police escorts, sources said.        
	He is likely to enjoy police hospitality for another month or so while the process to arrange money for his deportation continues, the sources added.        
	Dharamsala is the headquarters of the Dalai Lamas government-in-exile and many Chinese and Tibetans are believed to come there to spy on its activities.        
	Usually, Chinese caught without valid papers are deported with the money in their possession, but Li was penniless when he was arrested.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nervous Orissa speeds up Posco rehab plans 
                                                                                                               Nervous Orissa speeds up Posco rehab plans 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Oct. 23: The Orissa government today woke up to the need for an immediate meeting of the Rehabilitation and Periphery Development Advisory Committee, three years after it was first constituted to finalise the resettlement and rehabilitation (R amp;R) of people to be affected by the proposed Posco steel project.        
	The delayed move was taken apparently to smooth out wrinkles before the South Korea President Lee-Myung Bak visits the state in January. The advisory committee for Posco project, which had been constituted in June 21, 2006, has not met once since inception, apparently due to law and order problems.         
	The committee is mandated to finalise the R amp;R package for the project-affected people.        
	Posco had signed an MoU with the government on June 22, 2005, to set up a 12MTPA plant with an investment of Rs 51,000 crore near Paradip port.        
	However, the project, billed as the biggest FDI project, virtually remained a non-starter with the administration failing to acquire land due to persistent agitation by residents in the past four years.        
	A meeting chaired by chief secretary T.K. Mishra and attended by senior officials of Union steel ministry today reviewed the Posco progress and felt that an advisory meeting was mandatory.        
	Revenue divisional commissioner of the central division who heads the committee was asked to convene the meeting in November in order to start another dialogue with the residents again, said steel and mines secretary A. Dalwai clarifying that the government did not want to use force to execute the project.        
	We think there will be no difficulty in going ahead once the project-affected people are convinced that the project would not hinder their progress in any way, he said.        
	Posco has already given a signal that it is willing to go beyond its draft R amp;R package and extend benefits to even those who have encroached upon government land, said the steel and mines secretary.         
	Joint secretary of Union steel ministry U.P. Singh, who attended todays meeting convened at the Centres instance, said President Bak had expressed willingness to visit the site during his visit to India in January.         
	Sources said that the Centre asked the Orissa government to create a cordial atmosphere conducive to change before the Presidents visit.        
	State director-general of police M.M. Praharaj reportedly said that the situation in the project-affected areas was quiet at present. He said steps were being taken to normalise the situation completely with residents co-operation.        
	The review revealed that though the government delivered around 500 acres, the company was yet to take possession due to the unrest. Out of a total requirement of 4,004 acres, 2,958 acres would come from forestland and 436 acres were owned by private persons. The rest were encroached government land.        
	Supreme Court granted stage-I clearance to diversion of forestland identified for the project and the process for stage-II clearance is on. The Posco project has also been delayed due to legal wrangle over the grant of iron mines lease.         
	Orissa government had earlier asked the Centre to release Khandadhar ore mines in favour of Posco.         
	However, the decision was challenged in the court by Kudremukh Iron Ore Corporation Limited. Essar Steels, Geomin Minerals and Bhusan Steel Limited also challenged the request, subsequently.         
	The dispute dragged on in the court for five months and is presently pending in Orissa High Court.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Isro to host moon craft science review 
                                                                                                               Isro to host moon craft science review 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 27: India will host this week the first review of science achieved so far by the Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft which includes the detection of X-ray signatures from the moon and mapping one-tenth of the lunar surface.         
	Scientists from India, Europe, North America and Japan will attend the review meeting at the Isro Satellite Centre in Bangalore on Thursday to assess the performance of the spacecrafts 10 instruments.         
	An Indian-made Terrain Mapping Camera (TMC) is designed to create the first-ever three-dimensional map of the lunar surface at a resolution that allows it to distinguish lunar features five metres in dimension.         
	Were mapping and exploring regions of the lunar surface in a way that no other lunar mission has done so far, Mylswamy Annadurai, project director of Chandrayaan-1, told The Telegraph today.         
	The TMC is likely to have already covered about 10 per cent of the lunar surface, he said. The images from the TMC will be combined with data from another instrument  the Lunar Laser Ranging Instrument  to help build the elevation map of the moon.        
	Chandrayaan-1, launched on October 22 last year, is in an orbit 100km above the lunar surface. It carries four Indian scientific payloads and six instruments built by scientists in Europe and North America.         
	An X-ray camera, jointly developed by the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in the UK and Isro, has already detected X-ray signatures from the moon. Its performance has proven that it is the most sensitive X-ray spectrometer in history, said Shyama Narendranath, instrument operations scientist at Isro.        
	Distinct elements have unique X-ray signatures, and scientists hope to use X-ray emissions to map the surface composition of the moon.

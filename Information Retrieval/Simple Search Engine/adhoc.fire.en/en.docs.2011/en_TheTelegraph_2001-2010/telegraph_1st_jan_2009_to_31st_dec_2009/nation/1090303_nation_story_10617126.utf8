	Bhubaneswar, March 2: Maritime boards will be set up in coastal states to monitor security measures against the backdrop of the 26/11 terrorist attacks on Mumbai through sea route.        
	Flag officer commanding-in-chief (east) Vice-Admiral Nirmal Verma told reporters that there would be joint coastal management by coast guard, navy, customs, marine police and state forest and fisheries departments.         
	Vice-Admiral Verma, who attended a meeting here today, said coastal security was a complex matter and a large number of players were using the sea.         
	A joint operation room would be set up at Visakhapatnam on the east coast to monitor the actions based on information available from various agencies and sources.

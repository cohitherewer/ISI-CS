          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Azmi being taken to court. (PTI)                                  
	Lucknow, Jan. 22: An Azamgarh engineer who allegedly helped put together the bombs for last Mays Jaipur blasts and later escaped during Delhis Jamianagar shootout has been arrested.        
	Mohammad Sarwar Azmi, part of Simi earlier and now an Indian Mujahideen member, was picked up last night from Lucknow on a warrant issued by Jaipur police, Uttar Pradesh anti-terror squad IG A.K. Jain said.        
	Azmi, 25, used to travel to Jaipur to supervise the bomb-making while on a job with an Indore company. He went missing since the blasts on May 13 last year, which killed over 60 people and injured 200.        
	He is alleged to have arranged for the Jaipur bombs and detonators, using his skills as an electrical engineer.        
	A Jaipur police team is interrogating Azmi and will take him to Rajasthan after he is produced in a court here.        
	Azmi is the 16th suspect arrested in the case. A Patna engineer was mistakenly picked up by Jaipur police immediately after the blasts and released after three days.        
	The Uttar Pradesh ATS zeroed in on Azmi after the arrest of his associate Mohammad Haqim from Azamgarh last October in connection with the Jamianagar shootout.        
	Haqim is said to have told interrogators that Azmi was involved in the Jaipur blasts and that both had escaped during last Septembers shootout in Delhi. The ATSs Jain said they had been tapping Azmis mobile phone.        
	Azmi was also wanted by Delhi police, who had announced a reward of Rs 1 lakh for any information on him.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cut for polls: fares and convention
                                                                                                               Cut for polls: fares and convention

	New Delhi, Feb. 13: The interim railway budget has proposed a 2 per cent cut in fares above Rs 50 and promised 43 new trains, veering off its prefix and chasing voters in an election year.        
	I have decided to reduce the fares of AC First Class, AC II-tier and AC III-tier and AC Chair Car by 2 per cent, railway minister Lalu Prasad said in the budget speech.        
	With air travel apparently taking a hit from the economic downturn, Lalu Prasad perhaps had little incentive to go beyond the flat reduction he announced for all classes.         
	From April 1, a Rajdhani ride from Howrah to New Delhi will cost Rs 4,287 instead of Rs 4,375 (First AC), Rs 2,288 instead of Rs 2,335 (Second AC) and Rs 1,529 instead of Rs 1,560 (Third AC). Air fares on the route now range between Rs 4,500 and Rs 5,500, the last hike announced early this week by many airlines.        
	A Re 1 reduction in ordinary passenger fares has been proposed for rides costing up to Rs 50 for journeys above 10km.        
	Freight rates, which contribute the bulk of the earnings, have been kept unchanged.        
	Going by convention, interim budgets are not supposed to unveil any new measures. It is good for only three months because the next government will have to approve the plans in a new budget.        
	But Lalu Prasad made it clear he had tomorrow firmly fixed on his radar. He turned to his colleagues and said: Wada hai mera tum se ai mere humsafar, jari rahega kal bhi tarakki ka silsila (Its my promise, fellow travellers, we will continue our progress tomorrow too).         
	In the interim budget, Lalu Prasad tried his best to make good that promise to his fellow UPA members.        
	As many as 10 of the 43 new trains will run from, or pass through, his home state, Bihar. Rajasthan, which the Congress wrested from the BJP in December, has bagged five trains. Madhya Pradesh, where the Congress is locked in a fight with the ruling BJP, has also got five.         
	These include trains in commerce minister Kamal Naths constituency Chindwara and in Gwalior, junior communications minister Jyotiraditya Scindias hometown. Maharashtra, ruled by a Congress-NCP alliance, got six trains.        
	Other than the three new trains that have come Bengals way, the state is expected to benefit from a decision by the railways to take over PSU wagon-makers Burn Standard and Braithwaite. The two firms, now under the heavy industries ministry and in a rough patch for the past few years, should get more orders.        
	Another boost for Bengal could come from the eastern freight corridor, work on which has already started. The corridor, initially planned from Ludhiana to Sonnagar in Bihar, will be extended to Dankuni, near Calcutta.         
	As Lalu Prasad announced the extension, seen as a sop to the Left, he turned towards the CPMs Basudev Acharya, MP and chairman of the railway standing committee, as if to suggest that he should take note. The corridors are meant to reduce pressure on existing tracks.        
	The slowdown has told on railway finances, though, as have higher salaries and pensions as part of the sixth pay panel recommendations. The result: profits have dipped to Rs 19,320 crore in 2008-09 from Rs 25,006 crore in 2007-08.        
	Lalu Prasad later said catering contractors have been asked to do away with items like soup, chips and other sundry items and instead serve more solid food... ghar ka khana like rice, dal, puri, vegetables.

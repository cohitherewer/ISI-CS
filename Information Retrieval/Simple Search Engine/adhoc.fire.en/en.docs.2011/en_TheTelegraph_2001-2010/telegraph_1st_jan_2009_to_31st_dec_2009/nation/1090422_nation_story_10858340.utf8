The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Supriyas worry: not victory but blind faith
                                                                                                               Supriyas worry: not victory but blind faith
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI IN BARAMATI/MADHA                            Pawar, Sule                          
	Her voters say she is going to win, but Supriya Sule feels like a student before an exam.        
	Its the expectations people have from her  blind faith, as she puts it  that worries her.        
	Sharad Pawars daughter isnt exaggerating. Take, for example, what Sharada Raut has to say.        
	The villager in Dallaj, Baramati, is upset with Pawar for leaving his constituency for another, Madha. She is concerned about the water shortage in Baramati, but will vote for Supriya.         
	Pawarsaab should have stayed here. I wish we were Madha today but Im sure Supriyatai will carry forward her fathers work, she says.        
	In Madha, 78-year-old Sagarrao Patil is dreaming of finally seeing videsh  while sitting at home. Baramati is like videsh. I expect Pawarsaab to do for Madha what he did for Baramati, says Patil in Sangola taluka, as his granddaughter fanned him in the afternoon heat.        
	As the Pawars prepare for a fresh electoral start  with the NCP boss contesting from Madha and Supriya from Baramati  nobody here doubts they will win. But expectations from the father and daughter are so high that they verge on blind faith, despite the water shortage, water pollution and the pests gorging on the pomegranate harvest.        
	Thats what worries me their blind faith in me, in my family. It places such huge responsibility on me. I know Ill try my best, but problems will not be sorted out overnight, Supriya says, speaking between two campaign sabhas in Baramati.        
	Dressed in a simple white and sea blue salwar kameez with a lemon green dupatta, Supriya says she is not tired though she had started campaigning here in January.        
	But the microbiology graduate, who had only last year joined the Rajya Sabha, revealed signs of nervousness.        
	I feel like one does before an exam. As the date of the exam approaches, you start wondering whether youve covered all that you had to. Whether youve missed something, whether youve made a mistake.        
	So what is this blind faith based on?        
	Her fathers hard work, dedication, honesty and connect with the people. But, she admits, there is a larger reason. The less known building blocks that have helped Pawar construct an empire so strong that he can expect a landslide win in his new constituency almost without campaigning. Pawar has visited Madha just once.        
	Take away the support of the dozen or so sugar barons and their families that have built the co-operative movement here over the past four decades, and the task before Pawar and Supriya wont be easy.        
	To understand these building blocks of Pawars empire, consider Aknuj, a village transformed into a modern town, located in Solapur district but a part of Madha constituency.         
	As farmers poured out their woes on water shortage at his home, Ranjitsinh Mohite-Patil listened intently, clarifying their doubts, before settling down with them to a meal of khakra and lavishly spiced mutton.        
	The meal over, Ranjitsinh boarded his SUV, ready to hit the campaign trail  not for himself, or for any family member, but for Pawar.        
	Ranjitsinh is the heir to the movement his grandfather Shankarrao had started in the 1960s, when Malshiras, the taluka where Aknuj is located, was drought prone.        
	Shankarrao, a sugarcane farmer, wanted to sell his produce to a private factory but was turned away. So he decided to start a co-operative factory.        
	He cycled across the taluka, urging sugarcane farmers to buy Rs 100 shares in the venture. Some didnt have the money, but mortgaged their land to buy the shares, according to Ranjitsinh.        
	Yashwantrao Chavan, the first chief minister of Maharashtra, persuaded Shankarrao to join the Congress on hearing of his growing popularity. But my grandfather had two conditions  a sugar factory, and a canal must be built here for this drought-prone area, he demanded, says Ranjitsinh.                  
	A 220km canal was dug from Pune district. Today, Aknuj is lush green, with neat rows of crops decorating farms.        
	Shankarrao started a poultry farm and selected Houston and Jersey cows from Bangalore to bring to this region. Aknuj now produces more eggs than any other taluka in Maharashtra and squeezes 2 lakh litres of milk daily out of its cows udders. The crushing capacity of Shankarraos sugar factory has gone up five fold from when it started.        
	So when Shankarraos son Vijasinh  briefly deputy chief minister in 2003  and grandson ask for votes for Pawar, its hard to refuse, says Ravi Shetty, who runs a tea stall on the highway.         
	Shankarrao is known here as Sahkar Maharishi (the guiding spirit of the co-operative movement) and the success of Aknuj is because of the work he and his family have done over the years. How can we vote against their wishes?        
	 Madha and Baramati vote on April 23

                                                                                                               Speaker withdraws MP rebuke 
                            
	New Delhi, Feb. 20 (PTI): Speaker Somnath Chatterjee today withdrew his remarks against MPs disrupting Lok Sabha proceedings, saying he had made them in little frustration.        
	Chatterjee said yesterday: I hope that all of you are defeated in the election. I hope the people will give their verdict properly. You have to be taught a lesson.        
	As soon as the Lok Sabha met today, the RJDs Ram Kripal Yadav requested Chatterjee to withdraw his comments. Several others joined him.         
	Yesterday, I made some comments out of little frustration. I want all of you, who are standing here, to come back if people support you, Chatterjee said, adding that he was ready to pardon them if they behaved well.        
	He said the MPs had been sent by the people as their representatives for five years, and would not like to witness such behaviour.         
	Sometimes I get exasperated and say something. I have withdrawn (my words) today and wished them best of luck, Chatterjee later told reporters.

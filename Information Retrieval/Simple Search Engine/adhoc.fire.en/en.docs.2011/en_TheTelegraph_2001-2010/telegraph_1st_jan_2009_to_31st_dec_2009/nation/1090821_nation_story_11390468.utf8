The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rout finger at strong leader campaign   Spotlight swivels to Advani and camp
                                                                                                               Rout finger at strong leader campaign     Spotlight swivels to Advani and camp
          SANJAY K. JHA                                    (From top) Advani, Modi, Jaitley				                                       
	New Delhi, Aug. 20: The BJP chintan baithak has turned the spotlight on the partys L.K. Advani-centric poll campaign, identifying it as the primary reason for the Lok Sabha poll defeat.        
	The essence of the discussions on the first two days at the Shimla meet was that the voters had rejected the partys central campaign theme of majboot neta, nirnayak sarkar (strong leader, decisive government).        
	Many leaders felt the party should not have based its campaign on an individual in a desperate bid to establish Advanis leadership.        
	The other causes the meet identified were: disunity among top leaders, confusion on ideological position, the personal attacks on Manmohan Singh, the Varun Gandhi controversy, emergence of Narendra Modis name as possible candidate for Prime Minister in the middle of the campaign, and the unexpected collapse of the third front.        
	The focus on campaign strategy brought Advani and Arun Jaitley under scrutiny although the discussions were extremely sombre following Jaswant Singhs expulsion.        
	Sources said a party panel the Bal Apte committee too had identified the failure of the Advani-centric campaign as one of the main reasons for the defeat. But the party leadership got so rattled by the leak that BJP president Rajnath Singh issued a statement denying the existence of such a report.        
	If the baithak was overshadowed by Jaswants expulsion on the first day, the leak of the Apte report created a furore on Day II, the sources said.         
	The sources, however, added that there indeed was a report that, apart from briefly identifying the reasons for the defeat, made suggestions for the future. It apparently put the top leadership in the dock and provided a base on which disgruntled delegates built their criticism of the campaign strategy.        
	The complaints are hardly new: even RSS mouthpiece Organiser had blamed the election rout on bad poll management and the BJPs failure to articulate its ideological position.        
	At the baithak, many BJP leaders said the central election cell had been of little help to the candidates in the field --- its main obsession was media management. Many of the participants expressed shock at the ideological confusion among the leaders, pointing out that it was the Ayodhya movement that had enabled the BJP to form a government at the Centre.        
	Sources said some leaders supported a moderate agenda while others suggested a swift return to the basics. The baithak may finally come up with an appeal to strengthen the ideological position and stress the need to invent new idioms to communicate the message of Hindutva to the younger generation.

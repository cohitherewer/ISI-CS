The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CTBT prod to Delhi
                                                                                                               CTBT prod to Delhi
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 26: India came under fresh pressure to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty before a May 2010 global review of nuclear non-proliferation but Delhi dismissed such overtures as discriminatory.        
	A source in the foreign ministry said it was India that had put global disarmament at the forefront before nations when Rajiv Gandhi was Prime Minister. We stand by it. But regimes such as the CTBT discriminate against the nuclear have-nots.        
	The prod to sign the CTBT came at the East Asia Summit that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh attended yesterday.        
	We encourage those EAS (East Asia Summit) participating countries that have not acceded to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty to do so as it would serve as an impetus for having a successful NPT Review Conference, Thailand Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva said in a statement.        
	Besides the 10-member Association of South East Asian Nations, India, China, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea and Japan are part of the East Asian Summit.        
	Vejjajiva, who chaired the fourth summit of the 16 Asia-Pacific countries, also noted that the Philippines intended to start wide and transparent consultations ahead of the May NPT Review Conference.

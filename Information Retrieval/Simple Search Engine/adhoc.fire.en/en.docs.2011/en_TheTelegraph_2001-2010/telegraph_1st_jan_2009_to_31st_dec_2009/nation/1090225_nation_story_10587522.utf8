          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 24: Young researchers are expected to take advantage of the government policy change that will allow them to partner knowledge-driven ventures.        
	Its our young researchers whore most likely to take advantage of the new proposals, said Ashok Jhunjhunwala, professor of electrical engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, who has helped commercialise wireless technologies.        
	The relatively older generation has gotten used to doing things in a certain way... its young people who could take this up. We may see the impact of these proposals five to 10 years from now, Jhunjhunwala said.        
	A key objective of the proposals is to retain young scientists in India during their most productive years  the years just after the doctorate degree. Post-doctoral scientists sometimes have great innovative ideas, but when they pursue post-doctoral positions abroad  either in universities or in technology companies  India loses out, said an official associated with the policy change.        
	Now post-doctoral scientists could find positions in research institutions and be part of technology companies right here in India, the official said. Such knowledge-driven companies could seek start-up funds from government schemes or venture capital.        
	Other officials said the proposals are modelled on the mechanisms available at leading US universities such as Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Stanford University or the University of California, Berkeley.        
	A study in the late-1990s had shown that graduates and faculty from MIT had set up more than 4,000 companies, employed 1.1 million people and generated global sales worth $235 billion.

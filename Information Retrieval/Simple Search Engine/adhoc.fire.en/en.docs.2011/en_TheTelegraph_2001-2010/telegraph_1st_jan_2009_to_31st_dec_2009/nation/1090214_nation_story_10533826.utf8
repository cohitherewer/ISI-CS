          OUR BUREAU                      Mukherjee outside Parliament. (PTI)                                
	New Delhi/Islamabad, Feb. 13: India today avoided any hint of excitement at Pakistans revelations on the Mumbai attacks and outlined a series of further tasks it needs to do lest Islamabad, and the world, think it had already done enough.        
	Pakistans admission yesterday that the Mumbai attacks were partly plotted on its soil has had its media in self-congratulatory mode, with newspapers calling it a seismic shift in policy that should inspire the worlds confidence.        
	If foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee too thought so  some of his Congress colleagues have expressed similar thoughts in private  his statements betrayed no sign of it. Speaking in the Lok Sabha, he kept up the pressure.        
	He acknowledged Islamabads admission as a positive development but added that the primary onus of responsibility lies on Pakistan to fully unveil the conspiracy, punish the guilty and dismantle the terror network within its borders.        
	It is imperative, Mukherjee said, that it act with sincerity and act effectively against the licence that terrorist groups enjoy on its territory. It is essential that the assurances given to us repeatedly at the highest level by Pakistan leaders are implemented as solemn commitments.        
	Mukherjee underscored that Islamabads admission had come under Indian and international pressure: The international community has also worked with us using its influence on Pakistan.        
	Islamabad, however, said it would wait for Delhi to answer the questions it has raised  especially on the alleged role of Indian nationals in the carnage  before trying the six persons it has arrested and the two others it is looking for.        
	There are many unanswered questions and we hope to get Indias reply to at least 30 questions so as to start the trial, an official told The Telegraph in Islamabad, confirming the trial would be held away from the public eye in Rawalpindis Adiyala Jail. But first of all, we would like to know the persons who played a role in the carnage in India.        
	Foreign ministry spokesperson Abdul Basit asked India to expose the names of persons and entities in India who were also responsible for acts of commission and omission, in a transparent manner.        
	Mukherjee said Delhi would examine the issues Pakistan had raised. After the examination, we will share whatever we can with Pakistan.        
	He, however, put the onus on Pakistan to act, saying: The authorities in Pakistan have to choose the kind of relationship they want with India in the future. Much depends on actions in the Mumbai case reaching their logical conclusion.        
	Mukherjee said the future of the now-halted composite dialogue was at grave risk since it was premised on commitments given by Pakistan that territory under its control would not be used for terrorism in any manner.        
	He tried to pre-empt any blame on India for the strain in ties by suggesting Delhi looked at Pakistans government and its people differently.                                
	We have no quarrel with the people of Pakistan, he said. We do not think they should be held responsible or face the consequences of this situation. We have, therefore, consciously and after due deliberation, not thought it necessary or fit to curtail people-to-people contacts, trains and road links.

	New Delhi, May 9 (PTI): The Telengana Rashtra Samiti, a constituent of the third front, has said its chief would attend an NDA rally tomorrow.        
	We got an invitation from the Shiromani Akali Dal chief and Punjab chief minister Parkash Singh Badal to attend the rally tomorrow. Our party chief has accepted the invitation, senior TRS leader Vinod Kumar said. The Shiromani Akali Dal is a BJP ally.        
	Asked if TRS chief K. Chandrasekhar Raos presence at the Ludhiana rally meant the party had joined the NDA, Kumar played safe. An official decision will be taken after the results are announced on May 16. He, however, said the TRS would ally with any formation that supports the cause of a separate Telengana state.

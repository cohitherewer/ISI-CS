          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, June 19: It is time to spare the rod in schools.         
	Report on the Study on Child Abuse-2007 released by the Union ministry of woman and child development have come up with alarming data that show that corporal punishment and abuse are part of the lives of several students in the country. Following the findings Learn Without Fear  a Campaign Against Corporal Punishment was launched here today.         
	The campaign is about preventing all forms of violence against children in schools, including corporal punishment, sexual abuse, neglect, verbal and emotional abuse, bullying, peer to peer violence, use of weapons and harassment in school and on the journey to and from school.        
	Two out of three school-going children in the country are victims of some form of corporal punishment. Sixty-two per cent of the punishment takes place in government and municipal schools, while 53.22 per cent children reportedly face one or more forms of sexual abuse and most do not report the matter to anyone. The study conducted among 1,500 children in 41 schools shows that such punishment leads to high dropout rates, damaged self-esteem and personality problems.        
	The situation in Orissa is no different. Plan India, that organised a similar survey across Mayurbhanj, Keonjhar, Gajapati and Puri, found that corporal punishment, bullying, neglect and discrimination often led to a high dropout rate. Students present at the event handed over a charter of demands to education minister Pratap Jena.         
	They also put up an exhibition titled Voices of children highlighting on the issue.         
	While the corporal punishment was banned in the 1986 National Policy, it is not widely implemented.        
	If we wear a colourful dress to school on a non-uniform day, the teacher punishes us later, said Sunita, a student of a Keonjhar school.        
	We are beaten in school. Sometimes so badly that we are unable to sit properly, said Bijay Beuria, another student of the same school.        
	A survey conducted by Children Consultation, another organisation, in 1,352 villages to assess the situation as regards to corporal punishment revealed that children have reported nearly 33 different types of punishment.         
	The more severe of these included pupils being kicked, being tied to chairs and then beaten and being assigned physically strenuous labour.         
	Surprisingly, children felt it was alright to be beaten, said Tushar Das, the programme co-ordinator of Plan India.

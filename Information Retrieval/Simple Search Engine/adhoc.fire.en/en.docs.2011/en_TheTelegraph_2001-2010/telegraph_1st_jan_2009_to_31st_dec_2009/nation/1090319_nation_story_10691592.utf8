	London, March 18 (PTI): Mahasweta Devi and V.S. Naipaul are among 14 authors short-listed for the 60,000 Man Booker International Prize that recognises the lifetime achievement of a writer.        
	The Man Booker International Prize, awarded once every two years, differs from the annual Man Booker Prize for Fiction in that it highlights one writers continued creativity, development and overall contribution to fiction on the world stage. The writers shortlisted are from 12 countries and the works of seven have been translated.         
	Judges for the third edition of the award include Indian writer Amit Chaudhuri, Jane Smiley and Andrey Kurkov. Judging the Man Booker International Prize has made us all aware of how unusual and astonishing the literary world really is, Smiley said.

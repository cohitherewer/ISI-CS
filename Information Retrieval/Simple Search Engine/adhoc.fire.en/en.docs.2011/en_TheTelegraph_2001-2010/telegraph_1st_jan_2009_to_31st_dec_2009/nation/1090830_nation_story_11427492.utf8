The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Church ire at politics in study bill
                                                                                                               Church ire at politics in study bill
          CITHARA PAUL                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 29: Church leaders in India across ecclesiastical divides are readying to protest the right to education bill as they feel one clause in the legislation has left room for political interference.        
	A senior Church member said the bill  passed earlier this month by Parliament and now waiting for the Presidents signature  was a great step forward, but they were against Clause 21, which says local elected representatives will be part of school committees.        
	So different sections of the Church have come together and decided to submit a joint petition to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress chief Sonia Gandhi for deleting the clause.        
	Fr Simon Christopher, of the National Council of Churches in India, the largest conglomerate of Protestant and Orthodox churches in the country, said the NCCI was very much in favour of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Bill.        
	It is a great step forward in universalising education. But this particular provision in the bill is bound to have severe repercussions as it will leave room for political interference. We are against any move to politicise the educational system.        
	Similar provisions, Christopher added, had harmed the education system in states like Kerala, where the Church and the Left-led government have clashed over mandatory representation of local panchayat members in school management bodies.        
	Joseph Cherian, of the Catholic Bishops Conference of India (CBCI), said having politicians in school management committees would mean nothing but political intervention.        
	What contribution will a politician make to the running of a school apart from making the system more political? It is an absurd suggestion and we want the Prime Minister to understand the implications of this clause on the ground, he said.        
	The CBCI and the CNI, an umbrella body of Protestant churches of north India, together run nearly 25,000 educational institutions in the country.        
	The Church has already approached the human resource development ministry. We had brought the issue to the notice of HRD minister Kapil Sibal. But he was non-committal, so we have decided to take the issue to a higher level, Cherian said.        
	Muslim leaders, too, have a problem with the bill, but for a different reason.        
	The provision to reserve 25 per cent seats for students from weaker sections, they say, is an infringement on minority rights.        
	Hameed Ansari, of the Muslim Education Society (MES), cited Article 30 of the Constitution. The article says: All minorities, whether based on religion or language, shall have the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice.        
	Muslim leaders also pointed to Article 29, which allows minorities to conserve all aspects of their culture, language or script.        
	Ansari said the MES, an umbrella organisation of Muslim educational institutions, would go to court along with Church bodies if the government didnt address their grievances.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CPMs ally ache worsens in Kerala
                                                                                                               CPMs ally ache worsens in Kerala
          JOHN MARY                              
	Thiruvananthapuram, March 16: The lone Janata Dal (Secular) cabinet minister in Kerala resigned today after the CPM took over the Kozhikode seat from the ally, embarrassing the Left in the middle of efforts to cobble together a third front and appease another partner over seat-sharing.        
	Transport minister Mathew T. Thomas of H.D. Deve Gowdas JD(S) quit the cabinet without waiting for the state committee to take the final stand on Wednesday.         
	The resignation of Thomas came after CPM state secretary Pinarayi Vijayan told JD(S) leader K. Krishnan Kutty that this time we are keeping Kozhikode with us.        
	An angry Kerala JD(S) chief and media baron Veerendra Kumar dubbed the CPM move politically immoral. He said the bigger party had been told the JD(S) would pull out its minister if it was forced to give up Kozhikode and take Wayanad.        
	This is political immorality. The CPM cant cite delimitation changes and ask us to shift to Wayanad from Kozhikode. Delimitation has changed the character of all 20 seats in Kerala, he said.        
	To insist on particular candidates as a precondition for seats is against coalition propriety. This is arrogance the CPM behaviour in Kerala flies in the face of what Prakash Karat said at the third front rally in Karnataka about the responsibilities of the CPM as the major party in Kerala, Tripura and West Bengal.         
	Two-time legislator Thomas, who has an unblemished track record, has been caught in the crossfire between Vijayan and his party boss.         
	Vijayan is miffed that Kumar took an independent editorial stand in his newspaper, Mathrubhumi, during the tussle between the CPM state secretary and V.S. Achuthanandan.         
	The focus is now on whether the CPI can assert its claim on the Ponnani seat. CPI assistant state secretary K.E. Ismail said the CPM-backed Independent, Hussein Randathani, was unacceptable to the party, but hoped all issues would be resolved during talks in the next two days.         
	In New Delhi, CPI national secretary D. Raja took comfort in the CPM declaring that Ponnani belonged to the CPI. He hoped the statement implied the CPI would have the option of deciding its candidate.        
	A way out of the imbroglio is for the CPM to give the CPI a seat in Malabar in exchange for Ponnani. But the CPM, better placed in other seats, is unlikely to consider that.        
	The unilateral decision to wrest seats from allies comes from the CPMs estimation of its grassroots support.        
	At the party state committee today, district units reported their assessments of allies electoral claims and the respective support bases in constituencies.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Naveen nod to Mohanty return
                                                                                                               Naveen nod to Mohanty return
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Respite for B.B. Mohanty                                  
	Bhubaneswar, May 13: Orissas senior most IPS officer, B.B. Mohanti, who was suspended some 20 months ago after a Rajasthan court issued a non-bailable warrant against him for allegedly helping his rape convict son Bitihotra jump parole, joined duty today following revocation of his suspension.        
	Mohanti submitted his joining report to home secretary Aditya Prasad Padhi at the state secretariat.         
	His suspension order was revoked by chief minister Naveen Patnaik after a disciplinary committee, headed by the chief secretary, recommended the same to the home secretary.         
	However, disciplinary proceedings pending against the senior most officer will continue, affirmed Padhi.        
	Last night, Naveen Patnaik had cleared the file concerning the revocation of Mohantis suspension and had forwarded it to the home ministry. The move comes before the end of the BJD governments term, following the Assembly elections.         
	Mohanti, who was suspended on August 24, 2007, looked relaxed today while joining duty.         
	Describing his suspension as a cruel joke of destiny, the top personnel said he had never harmed anybody and yet had to face such an ordeal.         
	Though he remains the senior most IPS officer in the Orissa cadre, Mohanti could not become the director-general of police because of his suspension and a Rajasthan courts charge of helping his son jump parole from jail.         
	He was also put behind bars for some days.         
	To a query as to whether injustice has been meted out to him, Mohanti said: I dont want to blame anybody. Its up to the people to decide.         
	His son, Bitihotra, was convicted by a Rajasthan fast-track court for raping a German woman at a hotel in 2006.         
	Weeks later, Bitihotra, was granted a 15-day parole, on November 20, 2006, till December 4 to see his ailing mother at Cuttack. However, Bitihotra did not return to the jail after the stipulated 15 days.         
	As the Rajasthan police failed to trace the rape convict, a team visited his Cuttack residence a number of times to know his whereabouts.         
	It was then that the senior Mohanti was accused of evading arrest by the Rajasthan police team.         
	A Jaipur court issued a non-bailable warrant against the top police officer, who finally surrendered before the court on January 10, 2008, and was later released on bail.        
	Earlier, the former director-general of home guards was accused of not only evading the Rajasthan police, but also of not responding to several letters sent by the Orissa government in connection with the case.        
	As he had virtually gone into hiding from May 28, 2007, the government was forced to issue public notices through newspapers and paste copies of notice at prominent places of Cuttack city asking Mohanti to receive his chargesheet and suspension order and appear before the Jaipur court on or before January 10, 2008.        
	When quizzed about the whereabouts of his estranged son, Mohanti said: I do not know if Biti is alive. I suspect he might not be. From day one I have made it clear that I have committed no crime. My son was a major. Why should I be punished for the crime he committed ? he said.        
	Mohanti, referred to as the architect of prison reforms in Orissa during his tenure as inspector-general, said he would like to strengthen the home guard wing of Orissa police. I do not where I will be posted. But, I will like the home guard wing of Orissa police, he told reporters after meeting home secretary A.P. Padhi.

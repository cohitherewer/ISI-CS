The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Kasab cold in court 
                                                                                                               Kasab cold in court 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Saeed after his release on Tuesday. (AP)                                  
	Mumbai, June 3: Pakistani gunman Ajmal Kasab today stared blankly when the court touched on the release of 26/11 prime suspect Hafiz Saeed from house arrest yesterday.        
	Special court judge M.L. Tahiliyani mentioned the Jamaat-ud Dawa founder during an argument on 145 articles seized from the trawler Kasab and his accomplices had sailed in on the night of the Mumbai attacks.        
	Kasab stubbornly refused to recognise any of the items recovered, but a witness, Gorakh Nalawade, identified almost 110 of them.        
	When special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam asked Nalawade if there had been any manufacture marks on eight empty 55-litre diesel cans, he said he had noticed Made in Pakistan labels.        
	Nikam urged the judge to bring Nalawades answer on record as a crucial piece of evidence. Asked why, Nikam said Pakistan had once questioned how the gunmen could have sailed from Karachi to Mumbai without refuelling.        
	It was now clear, Nikam added, that the terrorists had carried diesel cans bearing the address Karachi head office, plot no 8, Sulaagh Kong Industrial area, Karachi, Pakistan.        
	But Hafiz Saeed has already been released, Tahiliyani said in English, glancing at Kasab. The 21-year-old showed no emotion.        
	 Kasabs confession had mentioned the mentor-like role Saeed played when he was being trained in Lashkar camps.

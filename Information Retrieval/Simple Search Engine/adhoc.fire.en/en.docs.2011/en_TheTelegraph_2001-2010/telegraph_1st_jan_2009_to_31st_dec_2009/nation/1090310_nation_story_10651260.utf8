          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 9: Magazines choice, Rahul. Moms choice, Manmohan.        
	The Congresss in-house magazine, Sandesh, has said in its latest issue that party workers want Rahul Gandhi to be projected as Prime Minister.        
	Praising Rahul for infusing new hope in the hearts of the youth by his hard work, the editorial said this was precisely the reason party workers across the country would like to see him as Prime Minister in the near future. It didnt mention Manmohan Singh at all. Asked why, editor Anil Shastri said: We are reflecting the wishes of the Congress workers.        
	Sonia Gandhis letter to Congress workers, printed on the opening page, however, said we all look forward to his (Singhs) continued services to the party and the country.

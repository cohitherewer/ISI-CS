The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | To villages, to revive dying lantern
                                                                                                               To villages, to revive dying lantern
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                           Lalu Prasad: Back to people                                  
	New Delhi, May 24: He could hang a lalten (the RJDs lamp) round a dogs neck and make it a winner, Lalu Prasad had once bragged. But after the Lok Sabha results, the lalten, it would seem, has blown out.         
	With just four MPs, Lalu Prasad has no hope of making it to the cabinet. In Bihar, the RJD faces the scary prospect of losing grassroots workers who are no longer willing to brave police lathis.        
	The former railway minister is bracing for some bitter truths on May 28 at a meeting of MLAs, MPs and several losing candidates in Patna.         
	Today, he told a meeting in rural Patna that he would go to the villages to revive the flame of his lamp. I will go to the people in villages and devote my full time to the revival of my party. I will spend an entire year in villages across Bihar among the poor. I have weathered many a political storm. In politics, todays winner is tomorrows loser. Victory and defeat are normal, PTI quoted him as saying.        
	RJD workers, however, are not as philosophical about the defeat. They believe that an over-dependence on caste equations as well as Lalu Prasads inability to reach out to the masses cost the party dearly.         
	Having lost a sizeable chunk of Yadav votes to rebels and a percentage of Muslim votes to the Congress and small parties, Lalu Prasads caste engineering seems to be in a shambles.        
	The RJD winners list is itself an example. Lalu Prasad is the only Yadav winner on it  he won Saran but lost Pataliputra. The other three are Rajputs.         
	 He is not ready to concede that Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar had showcased a visibly improved model of governance and blended it with his social engineering to win.         
	Asked how he lost all the Kosi belt seats, the former railway minister took a crack at Nitish. He said when he asked supporters why the RJD was wiped out in the region, they pointed to quintal baba. Nitish Kumar promised a quintal of grain to each flood victim family. Now that they have all eaten it up, they realise their folly of supporting the NDA, he said.        
	But an RJD insider said: Laluji and his family are so used to power and the good life in Delhi that they do not come to Patna. We cannot return to the streets and march in the sun and brave rounds of lathicharge like earlier days.         
	Lalu Prasads wife and former chief minister Rabri Devi is hardly seen in Patna, although she is leader of the Opposition in the Assembly. She was more by her husbands side in Delhi.         
	Some RJD workers still hope Congress chief Sonia Gandhi may show magnanimity and grant Lalu Prasad a token berth, but he says becoming a minister is not an issue.         
	The rout has not cured Lalu Prasad of bragging, though. At the rally in Patna, he said: Today, there are only four RJD MPs in the House, but I am sufficient enough to protect the states interests.        
	He said the poor had forgotten his aid to the Kosi flood victims. Often in politics, those who do good work lose and those who merely brag about reaching fruits of development to the people win.

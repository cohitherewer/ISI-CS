The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | NDA takes grouse to Pratibha
                                                                                                               NDA takes grouse to Pratibha
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, July 28: The NDA today complained to President Pratibha Patil that the UPA government had compromised Indias independent foreign policy and requested her to intervene.        
	Our demand to the President was that she should intervene and give correct advice to the government, leader of the Opposition L.K. Advani, who led a delegation of 146 MPs, said after submitting a memorandum.        
	The memorandum, which touches on contentious topics like the Indo-Pak joint statement in Egypt, the end-use monitoring arrangement with the US and the nuclear deal, accuses the government of reversing Indias strategic and foreign policy positions to the detriment of the nation.        
	The timing of the memorandum, submitted a day before Manmohan Singh explains his position on the issues in Parliament, is being seen as an attempt by the BJP, which leads the NDA, to dilute the effects of the Prime Ministers explanation tomorrow.

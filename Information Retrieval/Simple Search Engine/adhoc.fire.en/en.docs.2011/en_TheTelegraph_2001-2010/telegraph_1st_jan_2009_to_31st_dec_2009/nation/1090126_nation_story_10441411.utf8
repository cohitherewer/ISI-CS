The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | PMO-Sonia link man gets World Bank call
                                                                                                               PMO-Sonia link man gets World Bank call
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 25: A key official in the Prime Ministers Office is leaving for a three-year assignment with the World Bank  the departure spelling the end of a vital link between the government and Sonia Gandhi.        
	Pulok Chatterjee, secretary in the Prime Ministers Office (PMO), is expected to shortly hand over charge to M.N. Prasad, a Bihar cadre officer who was a secretary in the minority affairs department.        
	Chatterjee, an Uttar Pradesh cadre IAS officer, won the Nehru-Gandhi familys trust back in the Eighties when Sanjay Gandhi wanted a new district magistrate for Sultanpur (under which Amethi falls). Sanjay Gandhi was keen on a bureaucrat who was not originally from Uttar Pradesh to ensure that the official was not part of the entrenched caste-based interests running the states administration.        
	By a process of elimination, the then chief minister, V.P. Singh, zeroed in on Chatterjee. But before Chatterjee met Sanjay Gandhi, he was killed in a plane crash.         
	But the chance discovery marked the start of a long relationship for Chatterjee with the Nehru-Gandhis. Rajiv Gandhi took to Chatterjee because of his low-key style, his personal integrity and his talent for discretion.         
	He did stints in the Rajiv PMO, in the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation and as an officer on special duty to Sonia when she was the leader of the Opposition before he was inducted in the Manmohan PMO to essentially serve as a link between the Prime Minister and the UPA chairperson.        
	Chatterjees stated responsibilities also included a role in the appointments committee of the cabinet which decided the nomination of civil servants above the rank of joint secretary.        
	Sources said his successor Prasad was unlikely to leverage the kind of clout Chatterjee wielded in an unobtrusive manner.        
	It appears that Prithviraj Chavan, the minister of state in the PMO, will take on part of Chatterjees mandate and function as the conduit between the Prime Minister and Sonia. Chavan is doing much of the political liaison with the UPA constituents on the Prime Ministers behalf.        
	Chatterjee also monitored the implementation of the UPAs common minimum programme and the thrust areas of governance, a euphemism for the flagship social schemes pushed by Sonia.         
	So long as Sonia headed the National Advisory Council (NAC), she was in a position to keep track on her own of the progress of the programmes.        
	After the NAC post was deemed to be an office of profit and by implication, conflicting with her status as a member of Parliament, she resigned. The body became defunct and was wound up in 2008.        
	The Manmohan PMO, which tried to reflect the spirit of the common minimum programme by inducting officials with a social conscience, lost one in the category last year. Joint secretary Javed Usmani, who was principally responsible for getting the Sachar report on minorities in place, left for the US on another World Bank job.

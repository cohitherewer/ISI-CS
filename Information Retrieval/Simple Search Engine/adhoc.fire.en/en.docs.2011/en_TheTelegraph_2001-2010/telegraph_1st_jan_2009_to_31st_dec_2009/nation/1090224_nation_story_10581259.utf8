The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Chennai knew it was the day
                                                                                                               Chennai knew it was the day
          G.C. SHEKHAR                              
	Chennai, Feb. 23: The Oscar announcement was only a formality for A.R. Rahmans neighbours and students of his latest experiment  a music school. They had stocked cakes and firecrackers on Sunday evening itself.        
	The moment his name was announced for the best original score, a collective whoop of joy rent the air inside the small auditorium at the music school. Students leapt into the air and hugged each other, shouting Jai Ho, the Slumdog signature song. Ditto when Rahman grabbed the second statuette, for the best original score.        
	Outside the walls of his residence at Kodambakkam, neighbours burst thousands of crackers. Soon, the students were cutting the cakes and distributing them around. For us, just being his neighbour was such a proud thing. Now that he has won two Oscars, we will be on cloud nine. As for AR, he would always be the shy and humble person that he has been since his Roja days, said Dr Pravin, a neighbour.        
	Every Diwali, his family would send sweets to Rahmans home and the Rahmans would reciprocate with specially made vegetable biryani and halwa during Ramzan, Pravin recalled.        
	The 15 students of the A.R. Rahman Music Conservatory never doubted their guru would walk away with both awards. Yet we were so excited we were up at 4am and sitting before the TV playing his songs from Slumdog and Delhi-6. With the Oscars, Rahman sir has raised the benchmark not only for Indian film music but also world music, said Ganesh, who plays the keyboard.        
	Rahmans sister Rehana was speechless for a few minutes as she hugged her son G.V. Prakash, a promising young music director himself. We are all so proud. There are no words to explain our feelings, Prakash said.        
	Across Tamil Nadu, college students burst crackers and distributed sweets once TV channels flashed the news.        
	Actor-director Kamal Haasan pointed out that the musician had raised Indian cinema to a new level. He and Resul Pookutty (who got an Oscar for the best sound mixing in Slumdog) have proved that Indian technicians are on a par with some of the big names in Hollywood, the actor said.        
	Haasans guru and veteran director K. Balachandar, who produced Rahmans debut movie Roja, was ecstatic. When I first heard Rojas songs, I knew his work would revolutionise music in Tamil cinema. I underestimated his genius, for he has brought a new dimension to Indian film music and now to world film music.

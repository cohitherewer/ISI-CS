	Lucknow, March 28: L.K. Advani railed at the Prime Minister for not tackling terror efficiently and challenged Sonia Gandhi to a television debate, but Varun Gandhi was not mentioned.        
	At Maharajganj in eastern Uttar Pradesh when Advani blamed Manmohan Singh and his government for the Mumbai attacks, at Pilibhit, about 300km away, Varun Gandhi surrendered to police for his alleged anti-Muslim remarks.        
	In Padrauna, also in Uttar Pradesh, Advani said he was keen to have a debate on television with Singh. If the Prime Minister is not willing, he can ask the Congress president, PTI quoted him as saying.

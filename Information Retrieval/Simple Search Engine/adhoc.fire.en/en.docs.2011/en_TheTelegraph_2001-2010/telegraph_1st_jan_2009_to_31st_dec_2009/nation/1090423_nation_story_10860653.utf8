The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Spoiler Raj has Sena on edge
                                                                                                               Spoiler Raj has Sena on edge
  - Nashik test for dadagiri slogan          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI IN NASHIK                          Bhujbal (second from left) campaigns in Nashik                                        
	At the Shiv Sena headquarters in this pilgrim town, workers sat watching a television, switching between channels showing simultaneous roadshows by Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief Raj Thackeray and Nationalist Congress Party candidate Sameer Bhujbal.        
	As one Marathi channel lingered on the Raj rally, on the outskirts of the city, Ramesh Kamat, one of those watching, stood up, shook his head and chided his mates for watching. What are you watching that for? To lose hope? he mocked.        
	Most senior leaders of the BJP-Sena alliance in this constituency reflect the sentiments expressed by Kamat.        
	Bhujbal and the Congress-NCP alliance are the principal challengers for the Sena candidate, Datta Gaikwad.        
	But the lotus (BJP) and the bow and arrow (Sena) are focused more on the engine  the symbol of Rajs party and its potential to guzzle up their votes as fuel to gain momentum for the future.        
	The MNS is not expected, even by its own workers, to win any seat in this election.         
	But politicians across the spectrum, both in the state and outside, are closely following the MNS to see just how much of an impact Rajs anti-north Indian tirade will have on the electorate.        
	And nowhere in Maharashtra is that impact likely to be more pronounced than here in Nashik, possibly Rajs strongest base. The town, around 190km from Mumbai, is close to the famous Shirdi temple.        
	Shankar Parkar, an NCP worker from Dhule district (north of Nashik) who is here to campaign for Bhujbal, nodded his head in agreement when asked whether Rajs arguments against migrants in Maharashtra held any merit.        
	There is certainly truth in what he says. These people from northern states are welcome to stay here. But they should not indulge in dadagiri, he said. He had no concrete examples or statistics to back his claim of north Indian dadagiri, but Parkar insisted it was the truth.        
	To autorickshaw driver Chandra Bhan, born in Allahabad but working here for the past decade, claims like Parkars reinforce his fear that he is under serious threat.         
	The NCP (they hold the seat) hasnt done anything great for Nashik. But at least they dont discriminate between Marathis and non-Marathis, Bhan said.        
	For the Sena, which has built itself through the past four decades using the Marathi-outsider divide, Rajs success in hijacking support based on this divide means losing key votes.        
	And the Senas ally, the BJP, is troubled by the fear that its alliance may consolidate the north Indian votes in constituencies like Nashik behind the Congress and the NCP.                     
	This election will be a test for both us and for Raj. How many votes his candidates attract, and how well we cope despite his cutting into some votes, these are the questions this election will answer, a senior Sena leader said.         
	But while the saffron alliance is worried, it is brimming with confidence about its overall prospects in northwestern Maharashtra, known as the Khandesh region, headquartered in Nashik.         
	The region consisting of four districts  Nashik, Nandurbar, Dhule and Jalgaon will contribute six Lok Sabha seats this time. (It had seven seats in 2004, but has lost one to the urban clusters around Mumbai after delimitation.)         
	Nashik district has two seats: Nashik and Dindori. Dindori is reserved for scheduled tribes. Jalgaon district has Raver as a second seat.        
	In 2004, this region witnessed the closest battle between the two major alliances. While the BJP-Sena swept Vidarbha, Marathwada and Konkan (excluding Mumbai), the Congress-NCP alliance held sway over western Maharashtra and Mumbai.        
	In Nashik, the Congress-NCP team just pipped its rivals 4-3. But this time, Congress leaders admit that their prospects in at least two of the four seats they won appear shaky.        
	In Nandurbar, where senior Congress leader and sitting MP Manikrao Gavit is contesting, the party is hoping Sonia Gandhi proves more effective than Narendra Modi did. Gavit was seen as the favourite till Modi campaigned earlier this month for BJP candidate Pratap Natavadkar.         
	Modi changed the mood of the election and we have been struggling since then, a Congress leader from Nandurbar said.         
	Party chief Sonia Gandhi campaigned for Gavit yesterday, and the Congress hopes her visit may negate Modis influence. In Dhule, again held by the Congress, BJP candidate Pratapdada Sonawane has the edge because of public perception that sitting MP Bapu Hari Chaure did little for the constituency, both Congress and BJP leaders said.         
	The Congress has fielded Amrish Patel, former minister and chancellor of the Mumbai-based Narsee Monji Institute of Management Sciences, instead of Chaure.         
	With no time left for campaigning, the Congress and the NCP can now only hope that their perceptions of their chances in Khandesh are off the mark.               
	 Nashik votes on April 23

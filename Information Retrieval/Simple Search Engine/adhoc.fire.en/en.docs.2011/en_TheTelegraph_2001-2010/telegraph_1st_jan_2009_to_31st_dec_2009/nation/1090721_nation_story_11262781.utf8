                                                                                                               Night of terror narrated in court
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, July 20: Ajmal Kasab today sought to wash his hands of the blood of the 26/11 victims while giving details of the terror attack in court.         
	I was firing and Abu Ismail (Kasabs module partner) was hurling hand grenades. I was in front of Abu who had taken such a position that no one could see him. I fired at a policemen after which there was no firing from the police side, Kasab described their attack at the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus.        
	The terrorist also kept referring to instructions from his Lashkar-e-Toiba handlers Abu Hamza and Abu Al Kafa at every stage. Abu Al Kafa told us to first fire into one room (if they entered a hotel)then go to the other rooms. He said do not stay at one platform for a long time. That is the reason why I kept moving, Kasab told special court judge M.L. Tahilyani.        
	He said at one point their magazine ran out and they had to sit down and reload. Then they crossed the road outside the CST and moved towards Cama hospital.        
	Kasab said once they came out of Cama Hospital, they started looking for a vehicle. We were hiding behind a window when a vehicle came and firing started in our direction. We retaliated. I was hit in both hands. When the firing stopped, Abu Ismail took a look inside the car, he said.        
	Kasab said they found all the policemen, including Karkare, Vijay Salaskar and Ashok Kamte, dead.        
	Hamney tab unke lashon ko gaadi se bahar phenka aur gaadi leke bhage (We dumped the bodies outside and sped off with the vehicle), Kasab said.        
	The vehicle broke down after a while and they stole another car. They drove till Girgaum Chowpatty where they hit a divider while trying to skirt a police barricade. Ismail, said Kasab, opened fire, leading to the shootout.        
	Kasab said he had started as a decorator at Rawalpindi but did not earn enough money. So, he decided to team up with another person to become a robber.         
	We needed weapons, so we went to the Lashkar office where we were given money and recruited as jihadis. I and many others were trained in using arms and ammunition in jungles.

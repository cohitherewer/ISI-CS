The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Poll strategy menu for Nitishs NDA lunch
                                                                                                               Poll strategy menu for Nitishs NDA lunch
  - Optimistic leaders predict Assembly election win        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT      
	Patna, Oct. 18: Steps to strategise a success saga after the defeat in the recently concluded bypolls were part of the menu at the lunch hosted by Nitish Kumar on Diwali.        
	This was the first joint meeting of the JD(U)-BJP leaders after NDAs debacle in the polls. The NDA had won only five seats against 13 bagged by the RJD-LJP combination and the Congress.        
	Sources pointed out that the meeting was convened at the suggestion of deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi (BJP) and was attended by nearly all the top leaders, state BJP chief Radhamohan Singh, state NDA convenor Nandkishore Yadav, state JD(U) chief Lallan Singh and Nitish Kumar.        
	The stellar gathering, however, failed to provide a reason as to why the NDA suffered a loss for the first time since November 2005 when Nitish Kumar was elected as the chief minister.         
	Allegedly, NDA strategists felt that the alliance had its vote bank intact in the states hinterland.         
	There is no reason for the voters to turn against the NDA and go towards the RJD-LJP combination or the Congress, a senior JD(U) leader said, adding: The Nitish-led government has been carrying out development work and has kept a check on the law and order situation.        
	Lallan Singh pointed out that local factors may have played a part in the debacle, however, he like the rest of the party, remained optimistic that the NDA would come out with a robust performance in the Assembly polls next year.        
	Nitish reportedly asked legislators, ministers, senior party leaders and cadre to stay in touch with voters and keep a tab on their pulses and address their grievances in the run-up to the Assembly polls.        
	Top brass of the NDA believes that people who voted Lalu-Rabri regime out of power in 2005 still dont prefer the jungle raaj.         
	The NDA still enjoys the anti-Lalu space. Moreover, our positive performance has added to our support base, said Sushil Kumar Modi, describing the defeat an accident.        
	A section of leaders also felt that despite its splendid performance in the April-May Lok Sabha polls, the NDA failed to form its government at the Centre for the Congress-led UPA staged a comeback. NDAs failure to replace the UPA at the Centre might have had a demoralising effect on cadre and supporters.        
	However, most senior leaders observed that the impact would lessen in days to follow and that the NDA would eventually recover its winning streak.

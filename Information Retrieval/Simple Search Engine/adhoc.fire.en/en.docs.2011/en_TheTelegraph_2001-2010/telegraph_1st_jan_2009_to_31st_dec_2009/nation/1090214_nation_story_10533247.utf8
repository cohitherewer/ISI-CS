Then the judge called in a Marshal asking him to take the lawyer into custody and issued a showcause notice asking the lawyer to explain why he should not be sentenced to a two-day imprisonment for interrupting the court.        
	However, the courts action infuriated lawyers, who gathering outside the courtroom where Jha was being held.

	The judges left court shortly afterwards. In the evening the situation cooled down as the lawyer, Luv Kush, offered an apology and the judge withdrew his order.

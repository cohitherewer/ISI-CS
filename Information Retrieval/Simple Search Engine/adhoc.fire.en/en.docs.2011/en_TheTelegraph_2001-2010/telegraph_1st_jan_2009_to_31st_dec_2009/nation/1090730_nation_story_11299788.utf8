The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Talking, does it involve surrender?
                                                                                                               Talking, does it involve surrender?
                                          
	Excerpts from the Prime Ministers speech in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday. The sentences in bold are The Telegraphs, not from the speech              
	Benefit of doubt to the Pakistani establishment: I was told that Mumbai was the work of non-state actors. I said that this gave little satisfac- tion and that it was the duty of their government to ensure that such acts were not perpetrated. I believe that it is as much in Pakistans vital interest as it is in ours to make peace. Pakistan must defeat terrorism, before being consumed by it. I believe the current leadership there understands the need for action.              
	Why direct talks: Unless we talk directly to Pakistan, we will have to rely on third parties to do so. That route... has very severe limitations as to its effectiveness, and for the longer term the involvement of foreign powers in South Asia is not something to our liking.              
	Talking isnt surrendering: We have agreed that the foreign secretaries will meet as of- ten as necessary and report to the two foreign ministers who will meet on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly. The two foreign ministers have met even before the joint statement in Trieste. I met President Zardari in Russia. So, in operational terms, the effect of the statement th-at the two foreign secretaries will meet as often as necessary followed by the foreign ministers is no more than what we are doing at present. Does it involve surrender or a sign of weakness?        
	Mumbai attacks and action: The attack on Mumbai last November outraged our nation and cast a deep shadow over our relations with Pakistan. The reality and the horror of it were brought into Indian homes over three traumatic days that still haunt us.        
	The latest dossier is a 34-page document that gives de- t-ails of the planning and sequence of events.        
	The Pakistan dossier states that the investigation has established beyond doubt that LeT (Lashkar-e-Toiba) activists conspired, financed and ex-ecuted the attacks. Five of the accused have been arrested, including Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi and Zarar Shah, and 13 others have been declared proclaimed offenders.        
	This is the first time that Pakistan has ever formally briefed us on the results of an investigation into a terrorist attack in India. It has never happened before and I repeat this is the first time. It is also the first time that they have admitted that their nationals and a terrorist organisation based in Pakistan carried out a ghastly terrorist act in India.               
	Terror and talks: An interpretation has been sought to be given to the joint statement that we will continue to engage in a composite dialogue whether Pakistan takes action against terrorism or not. This is not correct. The statement emphasised that action on terrorism cannot be linked to dialogue. Pakistan knows very well that with terrorism being such a mortal and global threat, no civilised country can set conditions for rooting it out. It is an absolute and compelling imperative that cannot be dependent on resumption of the composite dialogue.              
	Sharing Atals vision: Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee took a decision of political courage to visit Lahore in 1999. Then came Kargil and the hijacking of an Indian Airlines plane to Kandahar. Yet, he invited General Musharraf to Agra and again tried to make peace. The nation witnessed the terrible attack on Parliament in 2001. There followed an extremely difficult phase in our relationship. The armed forces... stood fully mobilised.        
	But, to his great credit, Shri Vajpayee was not deterred, as a statesman should not be. In 2004, he went to Islamabad, where a joint statement was issued that set out a vision for a co-operative relationship. I must remind the House that Opposition parties supported these bold steps. I, for one, share Shri Vajpayees vision, and I have also felt his frustration in dealing with Pakistan.               
	Defeat mutual enemies of peace: I believe that there is a large constituency for peace in both countries.... But in the past there have been hurdles in a consistent pursuit of this path. As a result, the enemies of peace have flourished. They want to make our alienation permanent we must not let this happen. As neighbours, its our obligation to keep our channels open.

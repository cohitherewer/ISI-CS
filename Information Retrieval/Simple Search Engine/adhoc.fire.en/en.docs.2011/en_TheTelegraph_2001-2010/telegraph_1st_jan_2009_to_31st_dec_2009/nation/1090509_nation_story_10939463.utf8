The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rising son fights own image
                                                                                                               Rising son fights own image
          G.C. SHEKHAR IN MADURAI                            Azhagiri (in jeep wearing glasses) campaigns in Madurai. (Below) A young supporter waits to welcome the DMK leader                                 
	If the son doesnt rise, blame it on his image. M.K. Azhagiri, the scion of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) dynasty of M. Karunanidhi, has more than his reputation to defend as he makes his electoral debut from Madurai, 475km from Chennai.        
	The challenge from the Opposition  the CPMs P. Mohan, a two-time victor and no mean rival  is redoubtable. But Azhagiri, 58, is battling more than a political opponent.         
	Karunanidhis eldest son has to shrug off his image of a bully who muscles his way through. It is also a fight for family prestige: if he wins, he can quickly consolidate his position in the DMK and his family.         
	A defeat would not just be a loss of face but also a setback to his future plans to emerge as the undisputed leader of the party by overcoming the challenge from younger brother M.K. Stalin. Karunanidhi has entrusted the campaigning for southern Tamil Nadu, which has around 10-odd seats, to his eldest son.         
	Azhagiri is no newcomer to the hurly burly of electoral bouts, though. He has fought many for others, taking charge of their campaigns and winning three successive Assembly byelections in and around Madurai, overwhelming the Opposition with money and manpower.         
	But from being a backroom operator to a challenger is a different ball game. Azhagiri knows that and his appeal to voters is direct.         
	I have come to you so many times seeking votes for others. This is the first time I am seeking votes for myself. Will you make me win with the largest margin ever?         
	The question is straight. The crowd cheers and the women shout: We will.         
	The assurance got, Azhagiris campaign van snakes into the narrow bylanes of Simmakkal in central Madurai.        
	Our annan (elder brother) made each of the Assembly candidates win by more than 20,000 votes in the byelections. So nothing less than a margin of 3 lakhs would suffice for him, says D. Sudhakaran, the local functionary at Simmakkal, as he barks last-minute instructions to cadres lining up to receive Azhagiri.         
	That is easier said than done. Azhagiri, called anjaanenjan (braveheart) by admirers, has to first live down his image of being a brazen extra-constitutional authority and allegations of dadagiri hurled by critics.         
	Azhagiri has been trying to rid himself of the tag. He was acquitted in the murder of a former DMK minister. He has also patched up with the Maran brothers  his powerful cousins  after they accused him of unleashing his supporters on the office of the Maran-owned Tamil daily Dinakaran in May 2007, in which three employees died in the ensuing fire.         
	But the image is too strong to simply evaporate.        
	Traders in Madurai  the town famous for its Meenakshi temple  are nervous about voting for him considering the forcible collection his followers resorted to frequently. Allegations are that refusal to contribute would lead to the civic corporation digging up huge trenches in front of their shops under the guise of cleaning up sewers.         
	If we vote for him, it would legalise all the illegal things he has done so far. If we vote against him, we will become the target of his anger, says a medical shop owner.        
	Azhagiri hopes to overcome this image by some deft micro-management.         
	Every street comes under the direct supervision of a party functionary who has enumerated every voter there, gets familiar with them on a first name basis and has also procured their mobile numbers to keep tabs that their votes reach the DMKs kitty.         
	All this, sneers Opposition parties, is in return for money and other goodies. Azhagiri may have money power, but the ultimate people power will go against him since the public view him only as a riffraff and his sidekicks as extortionists, says P. Jeeva, a CPM activist.         
	Azhagiri refutes he has refined the money-for-vote culture.        
	Will the Election Commission remain a mute spectator if we distribute money? They have imposed so many restrictions on DMK candidates following such baseless allegations. The same CPM candidate, P. Mohan, needed my support to win in 2004. But this time he is accusing me of goondagiri and bribery, fumes Azhagiri.        
	The son hopes to ride on the popularity of the welfare measures implemented by his fathers government and lists them in simple and direct Tamil, shorn of Dravidian rhetoric.        
	Dont forget that it is on the free colour TVs given by my father Kalaignar that you watch your favourite serials, he points out.         
	The CPMs campaign, on the other hand, has been handicapped by the sudden hospitalisation of Mohan due to ulcers, forcing its cadres to resort to indirect campaign through handbills listing their candidates achievements during his 10-year tenure.         
	Voters in Madurais sprawling slums, however, believe that Azhagiri, with his clout in the DMK, may be able to bring better infrastructure and industrialisation to the district. He will definitely become minister if the UPA wins, which will be good for us, says R. Palanisamy, a brick merchant.

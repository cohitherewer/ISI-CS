          ARCHIS MOHAN                            Sitaram Yechury, Brinda Karat                          
	New Delhi, Dec. 11: Opposition to a Telangana state can cost support in the historic cradle of revolution. A thumbs-up can facilitate the division of modern-day bastion Bengal.        
	The CPM is undecided on how to vote when the statehood resolution comes up in the Andhra Assembly, despite being the lone party to consistently oppose Telangana statehood  on the ground that it subverts the linguistic basis of redrawing state boundaries.        
	How can we decide now about the resolution? Let us see what kind of plan the Congress comes up with. Thanks to the Congress, the situation at present is in a complete mess, said CPM leader Brinda Karat.        
	The Marxists know that by continuing to oppose statehood they risk the sizeable support they have had in the region (along with the CPI), thanks to the Telangana rebellion led by P. Sundarayya in the late 1940s.        
	Five of the CPMs eight Assembly seats in Andhra are in Telangana, as also the lone Lok Sabha seat it won from the state in 2004.        
	But the threat of Bengal being partitioned to create Gorkhaland too looms. Telangana will encourage similar demands for smaller states and will weaken the federal structure, Sitaram Yechury said.        
	He seemed resigned, noting that the CPMs opposition did not stop the creation of Jharkhand, Uttarakhand and Chhattisgarh. What he left unsaid was that the CPMs stakes are far higher in Bengal and Andhra.

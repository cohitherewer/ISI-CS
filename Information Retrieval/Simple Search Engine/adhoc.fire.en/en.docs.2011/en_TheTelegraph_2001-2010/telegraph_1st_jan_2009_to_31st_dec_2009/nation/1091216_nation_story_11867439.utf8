	Bhubaneswar, Dec. 15: Orissa, infamous for acute malnutrition, has reason to cheer. The number of children suffering from malnutrition has gone down by 10 per cent over the last few years.        
	As revealed in the National Family Health Survey report, the number of malnourished children in Orissa was 54.4 per cent during the first survey conducted in 1998-99. The number of such children had declined to 44 per cent during the 2005-06 survey.        
	At the national level, the number of malnourished children was 47 per cent during 1998-99, which registered a slight decline to 45.9 per cent in 2005-06. Children in the age group of 0-3 were covered under the survey.        
	As malnutrition among children was one of the major areas of concern, the government initiated several measures to address it. At least Rs 14.78 crore was released from the Chief Ministers Relief Fund to improve nutritional level of children. Under this programme, vitamins and food supplements were provided to children suffering from Grade III and IV malnutrition, on doctors prescription. So far, 44,651 malnourished children have been covered under it, said officials in the women and child development department.        
	The programme is being implemented in 326 integrated child development scheme (ICDS) blocks. While reviewing its progress, chief minister Naveen Patnaik today stressed on implementation of the scheme in all districts, especially in tribal-populated districts vigorously.

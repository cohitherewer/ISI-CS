          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bangalore, June 12: The search for the missing scientific officer from Kaiga Atomic Energy Station proved futile for the fourth day today.        
	The officer, Loganathan Mahalingam, 47, had gone for a walk early Monday morning and has been missing since.        
	Police said the information available to them suggests that Mahalingam could have gone on his own volition or may have met with a tragedy in the forests surrounding the residential township where employees of the Kaiga plant stay.         
	An officer described Mahalingam as a person with a spiritual bent of mind. He had once gone on a pilgrimage to Tirupati without informing anyone during a posting at Kalpakkam atomic station in Tamil Nadu several years ago, the officer recalled.        
	Mahalingam, who has been working at Kaiga for about 10 years, had not taken his mobile phone with him on Monday. The forest department has also joined in the search for Mahalingam.        
	The Nuclear Power Corporation of India, which operates the Kaiga plant, clarified that it did not deal with strategic programmes, an attempt to scotch speculation that Mahalingam had access to sensitive information.

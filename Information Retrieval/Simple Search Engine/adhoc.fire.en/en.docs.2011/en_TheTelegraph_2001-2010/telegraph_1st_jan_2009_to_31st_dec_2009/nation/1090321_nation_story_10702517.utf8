          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, March 20: Maharashtra home minister Jayant Patil today said the chargesheet against Mohammed Ajmal Kasab had sought the death penalty, days before the trial of the lone Mumbai gunman caught alive begins.        
	Kasab will face trial at the high-security Arthur Road jail, along with Indian Lashkar-e-Toiba operatives Faheem Ansari and Sabahuddin Ahmed. The last two were arrested by the special task force of Uttar Pradesh police last year.         
	A 200-strong team of Indo-Tibetan Border Police, a central force, has been deployed at the jail to provide security to Kasab. The government is fortifying the area in the jail where Kasab is housed to prevent attacks by Pakistan-based terror groups.         
	Officials said the construction wasnt likely to be over by Monday, which could result in a delay in the trial due to begin on March 23. Kasab will be produced before the special judge M.L. Tahilyani through video conferencing.        
	Patil made the disclosure about the death penalty while on a tour in Sangli.

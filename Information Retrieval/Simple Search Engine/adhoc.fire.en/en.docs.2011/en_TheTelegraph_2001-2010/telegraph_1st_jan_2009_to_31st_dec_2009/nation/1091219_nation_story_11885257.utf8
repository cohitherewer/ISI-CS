          RASHEED KIDWAI                            Amrita Pancholi (top) and the house on IIM Indore campus where she lived                          
	Dec. 18: A young woman teacher at the Indian Institute of Management in Indore was found murdered with over a dozen stab wounds at her campus residence, the brutality sparking suspicion that she may have been killed for revenge.        
	Amrita Pancholi, a 32-year-old associate professor from Udaipur in Rajasthan, had been working at the institute for the past year and a half. She was single.        
	Pancholis body was found around 8.30am at her quarters on the heavily guarded campus.        
	Officially, police were tight-lipped but sources in the force said the brutality had led to suspicion that it could be a crime of passion.        
	All her personal belongings were scattered at the scene of the crime, said an investigating officer who did not wish to be named.        
	The plan seems to have been to pass it off as attempted robbery leading to murder, but we suspect something more as multiple stabs reflect a degree of vindictiveness, he said.        
	Police sources believe the victim knew the murderer.        
	Pancholis relatives, who arrived from Udaipur and Delhi, said she had been receiving phone calls that had been bothering her a lot.        
	She had brought the matter to the notice of the local police, the relatives claimed. But officers handling the case said they were not in a position to confirm or deny this.        
	A post-mortem has been conducted and the report was expected late tonight, officers added.        
	Over 60 guards have been patrolling the campus.        
	Initially, suspicion had fallen on five students who were facing disciplinary action over a late-night drinking binge in a hostel.        
	The IIM faculty, however, is believed to have told the police today that Pancholi had nothing to do with the incident. The dean of the institute had apparently taken care of the matter after summoning the parents of these students.        
	In addition to her teaching duties, Pancholi, who had a doctorate in organisational behaviour and had specialised in human resource management, worked for at least three corporate organisations as a consultant on behalf of IIM Indore.        
	Her neighbours informed the police after the door of Pancholis residence stayed closed till 8am. She usually left her quarters early in the morning for work. Officers said she was last seen at 8.30pm yesterday by a neighbour.        
	The institute, established in 1996, is the sixth in the IIM family.        
	Last week, it played host to former President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, who delivered a lecture on Leadership for the Billion.

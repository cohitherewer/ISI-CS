	Washington, June 6 (PTI): A key aide to President Barack Obama has dismissed reports that the new US administration has kept the nuclear deal with India on the back burner.        
	Senator Obama voted for the US-India civil nuclear deal last fall and he has made it clear that he wants to see it implemented, Bruce Riedel, a former CIA official, said.

          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                            (Top) Mayavati, Maneka: Mother fight                                 
	Lucknow, April 4: The mother of millions has hit back at a jailed sons angry mother by invoking a symbol of universal motherhood  Mother Teresa.        
	In a spat fast shaping up to be the mother of all verbal duels, Mayavati today tore into Maneka Gandhi for suggesting that she could never realise the pain of a mother.        
	The Uttar Pradesh chief minister, who is not married, said having a child was not the only definition of motherhood and cited the example of the late Albanian nun who was mother to the whole world.        
	I know the pain of millions of children rather than Maneka, who has become blind in the love of her child who has pushed the country into the throes of communal violence, she told reporters.        
	The comment came in response to Manekas remark after the Etah district administration refused to hand over home food to her son Varun, jailed for his alleged hate speech against Muslims last month.        
	Under jail norms, Maneka was also not allowed to meet Varun yesterday as she had already met him twice.         
	Mayavati cannot understand the value of relationships... only a mother can realise the pain of a mother, she had said after being refused permission.        
	Mayavati, who said she was the mother of millions of children in India, demanded an apology from Maneka for her shameful comments. Varun, she added with a touch of sarcasm, would not have been in jail had his mother taught him good values.        
	Maneka should have known the pain of other children of the country against whom Varun had spewed venom, she said. She must apologise not only to me but to the entire nation for her shameful and unfortunate comments.        
	Mayavati also referred to BJP leader A.B. Vajpayee, saying he too was unmarried.

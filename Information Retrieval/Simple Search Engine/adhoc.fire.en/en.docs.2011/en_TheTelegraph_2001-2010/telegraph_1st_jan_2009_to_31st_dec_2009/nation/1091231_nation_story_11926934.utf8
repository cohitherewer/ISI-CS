The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Andhra astir and adrift
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Andhra astir and adrift
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA IN HYDERABAD                                            
	 The future of 85 lakh students from the poor and backward classes of Andhra Pradesh has been put in peril because of a delay in release of their tuition fee reimbursements, due on December 18, worth Rs 230 crore.        
	 On December 24, the government said the pace of irrigation had been stymied because of non-release of pending bills of Rs 4,200 crore.        
	 Last week, chief minister K. Rosaiah announced a loss of daily revenue of Rs 100 crore to the exchequer because of the Telangana agitation.        
	 The failure of implementation of departmental promotion committee recommendations threatened payment of benefits of pension and gratuity to 120 senior employees who are retiring by the end of the month. Rosaiah exercised his special powers to clear the payment.              
	The Telangana agitation has had a crippling impact on the Andhra Pradesh administration, which, under a new chief minister since September 3, was yet to take a grip on governance.        
	For almost a month, ministers refused to co-operate with Rosaiah, anticipating that Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy, the son of Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy who died in a helicopter crash on September 1, would take over the reins any day.         
	The party high command appears to have settled the matter in favour of Rosaiah for the time being, but the tug of war continues.        
	The statehood strife has increased the friction within the cabinet. The Telangana ministers see Rosaiah as an outsider since he hails from Guntur, in Rayalaseema. The ministers from coastal Andhra consider their boss a lightweight and a puppet of the Centre since he has little mass support  Rosaiah is a member of the legislative council and not the Assembly.        
	What we have here is a government whose head is Delhi, its arms and legs are paralysed and its heart is in an incubator, said senior Telugu Desam leader K. Yerran Naidu.        
	All parties blamed the violent agitation on the inefficient handling of the situation by the Rosaiah regime. The appointment of former Intelligence Bureau director E.S.L. Narasimhan as acting governor in place of the scandal-hit Narain Datt Tiwari is being seen as an exercise at enforcing Presidents rule as the administration had failed to contain the agitation.        
	A cursory check on the attendance in government offices and the state secretariat is a pointer to the toll the agitation has taken on governance.         
	Ever since the Telangana movement struck Andhra, government employees have also struck work, said Ramana Reddy, a senior civil contractor who is doing the rounds of the secretariat every day for his bills.        
	According to sources in the finance and planning departments, nearly 28,000 files, including 7,450 crucial ones, are stuck. We are facing a cascading impact on administration since the death of YSR, lamented Nirmala Gowd, a senior section officer.        
	The local bodies and the administration in the districts have collapsed under the weight of the agitation as bureaucrats sitting at Hyderabad and Vijayawada have taken strong positions for and against Telangana.         
	Although the (19) ministers demanding an integrated Andhra did not resign, they failed to attend office for almost 20 days, said a senior official in the chief ministers office.         
	The 13 Telangana ministers, though they have sent their resignation letters to Congress president Sonia Gandhi and not the chief minister, have been abstaining from work for almost 10 days.        
	Rosaiah, who held the finance portfolio before taking the hot seat, is said to have told close associates that his immediate task was to hold fort till the high command chose a successor to YSR.         
	The agitation paralysed the administration in the revenue earning districts of coastal Andhra, disrupting movement of heavy vehicles towards Howrah, Bhubaneswar, Bangalore and Chennai, causing a damage of around Rs 15 crore per day because of the loss of entry tax and VAT.

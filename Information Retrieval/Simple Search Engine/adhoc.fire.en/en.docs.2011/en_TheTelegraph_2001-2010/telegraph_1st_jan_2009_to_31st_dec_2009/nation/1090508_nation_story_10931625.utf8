	Patna, May 7: Presiding officers and polling officials at four booths in Adbul Samad Urdu Girls School admitted that by 3pm today they were thoroughly bored, as few voters turned up despite Samanpura being a thickly populated area.         
	We are puzzled. We did see people loitering around on the streets, but very few actually turned up to vote, said a police inspector on duty at the school. He added: And here we were taking extra precaution so that the citizens could exercise their franchise. At the four booths, only 1,150 of the total 5,167 voters had cast their votes by 3pm when The Telegraph team visited them.         
	Three Lok Sabha constituencies  Patna Saheb, Pataliputra and Nalanda  went to polls today in the fourth and final phase of election in Bihar. Though it was poll day today, Patna people made it look like a holiday with most of the roads wearing a deserted look, no vehicles moving at all and all shops and business establishments closed.        
	In Bihar, the total turnout today was touted at a dismal 37 per cent, against 41 per cent in the first phase, 44 per cent in second phase and 48 per cent in the third phase.         
	In the state, the turnout was lowest in Nalanda  the home constituency of Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar  for people on as many as 24 polling stations boycotted the polls for lack of roads, sanitation and drinking waters in their areas.         
	However, officials interpreted the low numbers as a positive sign. Voters are now at least protesting in places where there is a lack of amenities. Some years ago, development and infrastructure were not on poll agenda. It was more to do with power, said a senior official.         
	The chief minister took the train to Bhaktiyarpur to cast his vote, while Lalu Prasad, accompanied by his wife and daughter, arrived at the Patna veterinary college and cast their votes.         
	Lalu, known for his media savvy image, suddenly lost his cool on spotting a horde of camerapersons and got them out of the booth.        
	Principal secretary (home) Afzal Amanullah described todays polling by and large free from untoward incidents, fair and peaceful.         
	In stray incidents, anti-social elements tried to capture a booth in Masaurhi segment of Pataliputra constituency. But, security forces thwarted the attempt with batons and lathis dispersing the mob almost immediately. Police arrested some 158 people for trying to disturb the process.

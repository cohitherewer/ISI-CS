The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | SC judges decide to be transparent
                                                                                                               SC judges decide to be transparent
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                          Balakrishnan                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 26: Judges of the countrys top court today agreed to put their assets in the public domain, highly placed sources said, after months of debate that had roiled the judiciary as well as Parliament.        
	The decision, ostensibly to silence criticism of the Supreme Courts perceived reluctance to be more transparent, was taken at a meeting of all 23 judges, the sources said.        
	The court has a sanctioned judge strength of 31 but eight posts are vacant.        
	A decision in principle has been taken on the issue at a meeting convened by Chief Justice of India (CJI) K.G. Balakrishnan and the details of the assets to be declared by the judges would be put on the Supreme Court website, an apex court source told PTI.         
	The details of the assets would be available on the courts official website supremecourtofindia.nic.in.        
	The sources said not one judge demurred during the deliberations but actuating the move could take time. Although all Supreme Court judges now routinely declare their assets to the CJI as do high court judges to their respective chief justices  there is no standard format in which they do so.        
	So a common format would have to be drawn up first, they said. A formal resolution would also have to be issued declaring the intent, the sources added.         
	Chief Justice Balakrishnan had been under pressure from all quarters  the public, members of the judicial fraternity, former CJIs and parliamentarians  to set an example of transparency by making available details of judges assets to the public.         
	He had resisted the move, saying a law would have to be first enacted to protect judges. Otherwise, such information could be misused by vested interests to pressure judges, eventually eroding the independence of the judiciary.         
	The government had acted according to his wishes and introduced a bill that had a clause that kept such information out of the public domain. But it had to drop the bill after members opposed it as an anomaly in an age of transparency.         
	Days later, the CJI came under fresh pressure as a Karnataka High Court judge threw him a challenge by openly declaring his assets in a letter to some lawyers and activists clamouring for more transparency in the judiciary.        
	Former CJI J.S. Verma said placing judges assets in the public domain would go a long way in ensuring accountability. I am ashamed that an impression is being given that the Supreme Court has something to hide, he had said.        
	Balakrishnan said he was trying to evolve a consensus on the issue among Supreme Court judges. The consensus came after two hours of deliberations today.        
	Activist lawyer Shanti Bhushan welcomed the move but wished it had come earlier.        
	Its better late than never, said former attorney general Soli J. Sorabjee.

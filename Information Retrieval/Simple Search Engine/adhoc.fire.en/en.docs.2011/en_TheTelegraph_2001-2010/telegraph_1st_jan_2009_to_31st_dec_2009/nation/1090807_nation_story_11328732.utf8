          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT      
	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 6: Even as swine flu scare swept across the state, the government today advised people not to panic as Orissa, so far, seemed free of flu.         
	There is no reason to panic as no case has been found positive and measures have been taken to fight the flu, said chief minister Naveen Patnaik after a meeting.        
	Director of medical education and training Dr P.K. Das today assured that four samples that were sent to National Institute of Virology (Pune) had tested negative. So far, 577 swine flu cases have been detected in the country, but none from Orissa.        
	However, Naveen directed the health administration not to be complacent, sources said. He advised officials to publicise symptoms and remedies within the media in Oriya and instructed officials to keep strict vigil on patients under treatment at all hospitals.         
	A special round-the-clock control room has been set up at the state health directorate, while arrangements have been made for diagnostic tests and treatment at SCB Medical College and Hospital (Cuttack) and MKCG Medical College and Hospital (Berhampur).        
	Two groups have been constituted at the two hospitals, headed by respective superintendents.        
	Guidelines were sent to medical colleges and headquarters hospitals today, issued by the Centre following the death of a Patna student.        
	Advisories have been issued to schools and colleges to take measures in hostels. Adequate medicines and equipment have been stocked, said an official. A close vigil is being maintained on tourists arriving at Bhubaneswar airport and at Paradip port.

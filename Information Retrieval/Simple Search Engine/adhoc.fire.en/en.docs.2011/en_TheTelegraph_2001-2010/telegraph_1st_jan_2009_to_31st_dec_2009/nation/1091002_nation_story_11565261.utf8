                                                                                                               SC dig at minting lawyers
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 1: The Supreme Court today accused senior lawyers of being reluctant to give up their lucrative practice to become judges, citing it as one reason for the lack of quality candidates to fill up judges posts.        
	You people (advocates) are too busy minting money here to go and be a judge (in any other part of the country), the court said. If you ask advocates to go as judges, they wont go.        
	Even after the recent threefold rise in the higher judiciarys salaries, a senior Supreme Court lawyer stands to earn in a day  mostly from high-stakes corporate litigation what a judge earns in a month.        
	The Government of India spends Rs 6 to 7 lakh per judge. If you include the cost of the official accommodation allotted to a judge, the figure is over Rs 25 lakh. What more do you want? How can you call it a sacrifice? a two-judge bench observed.        
	The bench was reacting to a suggestion that the judge-population ratio be improved to cut down the backlog of cases in courts.        
	It is not even possible to get 20 good candidates for the subordinate courts at one go, the court said. Where do you get the manpower? If you get second and third-grade candidates (to fill up these posts), where will the institution go?        
	The country needs around 124,800 judges to clear the current backlog, the bench observed.        
	To have a democracy you have to have a strong and independent judiciary that will stand up to the government, the bench said. If you have good people at the bar (lawyers), you have to have good people at the bench (judges) too.        
	The court observed that several judges had resigned recently even after the pay hike.        
	Neeraj Kishan Kaul, who has quit as a Delhi High Court judge to return to his legal practice, however, had his own views on the subject.        
	Money is not a factor, he said, blaming it instead on the pedestrian nature of a judges work. A judge has to read hundreds of files daily. Its backbreaking and boring. Compared to that, litigation is more exciting.        
	Kaul said: One knows what one is getting into (when one becomes a judge). You are not unaware of the facts (low pay). No one is such a fool, Kaul, who held the post of additional judge for a few months, said.        
	After the pay hike, the Chief Justice of India gets Rs 1 lakh a month, other Supreme Court judges and high court chief justices are paid Rs 90,000, and other high court judges Rs 80,000. The corresponding figures earlier were Rs 33,000, Rs 30,000 and Rs 26,000.

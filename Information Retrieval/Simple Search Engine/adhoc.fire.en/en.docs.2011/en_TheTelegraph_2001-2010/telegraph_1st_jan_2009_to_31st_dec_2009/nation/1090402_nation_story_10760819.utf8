The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | G8 on Cong Karnataka list
                                                                                                               G8 on Cong Karnataka list
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              (Top) Alva, Krishna: Heavyweights				                                 
	New Delhi, April 1: Five months after she was shown the door, Margaret Alva has been rehabilitated with a Lok Sabha ticket from North Kannada in Karnataka.        
	Alva, who was a general secretary minding several states and a Congress Working Committee member, lost her posts after she accused two of her colleagues, Digvijay Singh and Prithviraj Chavan, of hawking tickets in the Karnataka elections last year.         
	She had made the charge just before the Assembly elections in Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Delhi, threatening to damage the Congresss credibility at a critical juncture.        
	Alva was upset with the party for refusing her son Nivedith, a Youth Congress activist in Bangalore, a ticket from Karnataka. She was told she could get a nomination, not Nivedith, sources said.         
	This time, Alva herself is among the eight heavyweights fighting the polls in Karnataka. The others include three former chief ministers  Dharam Singh, S. Bangarappa and M. Veerappa Moily.        
	The list also has leader of the Opposition in the Assembly, Mallikarjun Kharge, former Union minister and one of the Congress best-known Muslim faces, C.K. Jaffer Sharief, and current central minister K.H. Muniappa.        
	Another former chief minister, S.M. Krishna, is believed to be working overtime to wrench Mandya for which a candidate has not been named yet.         
	Sonia Gandhi has decided not to give Rajya Sabha members  Krishna is one  a Lok Sabha ticket. But a fellow MP from Karnataka said: With Krishna, you can never tell. He has a knack of getting norms overturned to his advantage.        
	Mandya is Krishnas turf. The only time he appeared to have lost his grip was in the last years state polls, when all his relatives lost.         
	Their defeat was seen as a sign of his waning clout as a leader of the dominant Vokkaligas and the emergence of H.D. Deve Gowda and his son H.D. Kumaraswamy. Even if he gets the ticket, its hard to say if he will make it, a source said.        
	Krishna has other losers for company in Karnatakas G8  as the phalanx of Lok Sabha aspirants is being described pejoratively.         
	Barring Bangarappa  who contested the 2004 elections on a Samajwadi Party ticket  Muniappa and Dharam Singh, all the others lost in one of the Congresss worst showings in Karnataka.        
	Dharam Singhs luck ran out when he was trounced in the 2008 state polls.         
	Asked why the Congress persisted in pushing proven losers and over-the-hill politicos  Bangarappa and Sharief are 76 and Dharam Singh is 73  a source replied in a word: Grandstanding.         
	The source said that after these leaders lost, Siddharamaiah, who had left the Janata Dal (Secular) to join the Congress, allegedly boasted he was the Congresss only lifeline. We have to prove to him our veterans are alive and kicking, the source said.

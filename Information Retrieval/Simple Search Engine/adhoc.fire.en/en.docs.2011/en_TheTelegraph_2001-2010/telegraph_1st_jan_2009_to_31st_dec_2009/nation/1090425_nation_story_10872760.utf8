The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | UGC choice fuels protests 
                                                                                                               UGC choice fuels protests 
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                       Ved Prakash                          
	New Delhi, April 24: The human resource development ministry has finalised the appointment of a new second-in-command for Indias higher education system despite allegations of poll code violation, inviting criticism from academics and displeasure from within the government.         
	A selection team handpicked by HRD minister Arjun Singh on April 21 finalised the appointment of senior education administrator Ved Prakash as vice-chairman of the University Grants Commission.         
	The appointment was finalised despite a petition filed with the Central Election Commission against the selection process, arguing that the move was tantamount to violating the election model code of conduct.         
	The HRD ministry, it is learnt, had even succeeded in convincing the Election Commission that the appointment did not violate the model code.         
	But a group of senior academics has approached new chief election commissioner Navin Chawla to quash the selection less than a week after the first complaint, alleging that the appointment was made to influence voters.         
	The academics, in their fresh complaints to Chawla, have alleged that the appointment of senior education administrator Ved Prakash as vice-chairman of the University Grants Commission is aimed at influencing Jat voters.         
	Prakash belongs to this community, which enjoys significant numerical clout in Haryana, Delhi, and areas neighbouring the national capital.         
	Chawla is expected to study the allegations early next week, sources said.         
	But Arjuns troubles over the appointment are not limited to the complaints filed with the Election Commission.         
	The cabinet secretariat, it is learnt, has conveyed its displeasure over the rushed attempts to appoint a vice-chairman of the UGC in the middle of the Lok Sabha elections.         
	The cabinet secretariat has, however, not written formally to the HRD ministry on the matter, a senior official clarified.         
	As reported first by The Telegraph on April 19, the HRD ministry set up a selection panel to appoint a UGC vice-chairman after the Election Commission declared the model code of conduct on March 2.         
	The vice-chairmans post fell vacant on February 28.         
	On April 17, a former registrar at the National University for Educational Planning and Administration (NUEPA) wrote to then chief election commissioner N. Gopalaswami complaining against the selection process.         
	The former registrar, P.R.R Nair, alleged that the selection was being rushed to appoint Prakash, seen by many in the academic fraternity as close to HRD minister Arjun Singh.         
	HRD ministry officials had, however, rejected Nairs allegations, arguing that the UGC appointment was a standard one which could not, and need not, be stalled because of elections.

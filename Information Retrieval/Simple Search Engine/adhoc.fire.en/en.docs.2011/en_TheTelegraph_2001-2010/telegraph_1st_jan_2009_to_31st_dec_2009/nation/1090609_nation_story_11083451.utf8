The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | JD-U asks Sharad Yadav to loosen up
                                                                                                               JD-U asks Sharad Yadav to loosen up

	Patna, June 8: Socrates had to consume poison to usher in a revolution, said Sharad Yadav, the JD(U) national president, while obliquely referring to a probability of him taking a similar stand to oppose the present womens quota bill in the Lok Sabha.        
	Closer home, the bosss remark has left Nitish Kumar and associates uneasy, as the state unit is yet to decide its stand. Though Sharad clarified later that he was just quoting Socrates and did not refer to himself, he has stuck to his demand of reservation for women from Backward Class within the womens quota and said that he would oppose the current format to the hilt. His Bihar colleagues seem less adamant.         
	JD(U) national general secretary and spokesperson Shivanand Tiwary told The Telegraph: The party has not decided its stand. We will sit together to decide.         
	Tiwary was sitting beside chief minister and state JD(U) chief Nitish Kumar when this correspondent spoke to him.         
	Nitish has so far maintained a studied silence on Sharads utterances in the Lok Sabha.         
	However, sources reveal that the chief minister does not wish to create a hindrance on the path to bill clearance.        
	The Nitish-led government has reserved 50 per cent seats in local bodies for women. There is, of course, a reservation within the quota in Bihar.        
	Out of the 50 per cent seats reserved for women, there is a 50 per cent reservation for SC, ST, EBCs and OBCs. Sharad Yadav has been demanding something similar to the Bihar model which the Manmohan Singh government has refused, creating a constitutional bottleneck.        
	Experts believe that the adoption of a Bihar model in the Lok Sabha and state legislatures is untenable, as there are no reservations for EBCs and OBCs in the Lok Sabha or in the state legislatures. Constitution entails only SCs and STs reservation in the Lok Sabha and in the state Assemblies.        
	How can seats be reserved for women from Backward Classes when there is no reservation for Backward Classes in the Lok Sabha and Assemblies, said a Patna High Court lawyer, Dinesh Kumar Singh, adding: The demand is not tenable in the constitutional scheme.        
	Sources state that Nitish called Sharad requesting him to loosen up his hard-line stance following which the JD(U) president toned down his tenor a bit before the media. Moreover, Sharads hard-line stand does not fit well with Nitishs new mantra of all-inclusive growth and emphasis on empowerment of women in the state. The chief minister has been referring to the all-inclusive growth in all his vikas yatras these days.         
	Nitish has fortified his position among the EBCs by giving them job reservation in most local bodies, besides implementing welfare schemes.        
	He has also tried to maximise his support base and include upper castes, too, in measures to ensure benefit to all women and school girls (all sections) in the run-up to the Assembly polls in 2010.

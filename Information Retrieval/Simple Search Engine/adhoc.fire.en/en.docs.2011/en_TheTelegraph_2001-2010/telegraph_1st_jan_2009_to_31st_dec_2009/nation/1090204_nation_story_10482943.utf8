          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                                          The six-year-old girl being assaulted by the two policemen in Etawah for allegedly stealing a wallet. (PTI)				                                       
	Lucknow, Feb. 3: A police inspector was sacked and another suspended today for allegedly thrashing a Dalit girl, who television channels showed being lifted by her hair amid a torrent of abuse for allegedly stealing a wallet.        
	The police superintendent of Etawah, where the incident occurred yesterday and which happens to be former chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadavs home district, has been asked to personally apologise to the six-year-old. He had initially tried to justify the brutality.         
	Senior sub-inspector Shyamlal Yadav has been sacked and station house officer Chandrabhan Singh suspended. Criminal cases have been filed against both, Uttar Pradesh police chief Vikram Singh said this evening.        
	The police assault came in a state ruled by Mayavati, a Dalit.         
	The cases, filed under the Prevention of Atrocities against SC/ST Act, may lead to the arrest of the two inspectors involved as well as the four policemen who remained mute spectators, additional director-general Brij Lal said.        
	The inspectors allegedly beat up and abused the girl after a woman, said to be known to the police officers, complained she had stolen her wallet. The girls mother denied the charges in an FIR and claimed she was innocent.        
	TV channels showed Yadav holding the girl up by her hair, threatening her and forcing her to admit she stole the cash as his colleagues, including SHO Singh, looked on.        
	Anju Katharia took the girl, Komal, to Jaswantpur police station, alleging the child had stolen the Rs 280 from her wallet and given it to a boy. The mother claimed the police picked up the wrong person. My daughter saw somebody running away with a wallet but the police caught my daughter, she said in the FIR.        
	The incident has come under the glare of the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights, which has written to the state police chief seeking strong action against those involved in the atrocity.         
	Commission chairperson Shanta Sinha, speaking in Delhi, condemned the incident and said there was a need to sensitise the police against committing such crimes.                     Mayavati      
	Local rights activists suggested such police atrocities could force people to turn into bandits, whose menace Etawah, bordering the Chambal region, has long lived with.        
	The police were unable to differentiate between an offence by dacoits in the (Chambal) ravines and a small impoverished girl who might or might not have been involved in the crime. They are so insensitive. This is how they have produced dacoits. Torture sagas create rebels. Dont forget the district is known for women dacoits, too, said Satish Jaiswal, a rights activist in Kanpur.        
	Etawah SP Kripa Shankar Singh had initially said the policemen were only trying to get a confession. She was handed over to the police by the person whose money was stolen. What would the police do? he had said, adding the inspectors had even seized the stolen cash from her.

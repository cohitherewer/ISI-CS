The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP in Nepal temple protest
                                                                                                               BJP in Nepal temple protest
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           The Pashupatinath temple                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 3: The BJP leadership has lodged its protest with the Nepal government against the forced replacement of Indian priests in the Pashupatinath temple.         
	Yesterday, the Maoist government in Nepal deployed riot police in large numbers at the temple and cadres stormed the shrine, escorting their newly appointed priest into the complex. The move was in defiance of a Nepal Supreme Court order.        
	The BJP today complained that the Maoists were showing scant regard to the centuries-old tradition of the Pashupatinath temple and Indo-Nepal cultural ties.         
	Party president Rajnath Singh in a telephone conversation with Nepali President Ram Baran Yadav and Prime Minster Prachanda sought immediate resolution to the problem. They are said to have assured Rajnath of necessary steps after a thorough probe.         
	Rajnath said: It is a holy shrine visited by thousands of devotees every year from India, Nepal and other countries of the world. The Indian priests have led prayers at the historic Pashupatinath temple for the past three centuries and this tradition signifies the cultural bonds shared by India and Nepal. The ongoing crisis has resulted in an unprecedented situation at the temple and even regular prayer was disrupted because of it.         
	Referring to the order of the Nepal Supreme Court, Rajnath said: The removal of the Indian priests from the temple is not only in complete defiance of the Supreme Court order, it has also hurt the sentiments of people in India.        
	The BJP was never comfortable with the Maoist takeover. The party viewed the advent of ultra-Left power in the neighbourhood both in terms of a cultural and political threat. It was hesitant in welcoming constitutional democracy in Nepal and was critical of the Indian government for not playing any active role in protecting the monarchy.         
	Changing times, however, have compelled the Sangh parivar to revisit its foreign policy as manifested in the unusual development of sending a delegation to China.         
	A delegation of the RSS, BJP and the Shiv Sena leaders will leave for China tomorrow. This is the first Sangh delegation going to China on an invitation from the ruling Communist Party there.         
	The delegation, led by RSS leader Bal Apte, will include Sangh spokesperson Ram Madhav, BJP Rajya Sabha member Balbir Punj and Sena MP Suresh Prabhu and journalist Chandan Mitra.

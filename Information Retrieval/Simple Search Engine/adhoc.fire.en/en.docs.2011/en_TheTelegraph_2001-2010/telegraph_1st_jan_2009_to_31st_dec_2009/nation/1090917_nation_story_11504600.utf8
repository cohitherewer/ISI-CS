The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Fine sting in malaria fight
                                                                                                               Fine sting in malaria fight
          RASHEED KIDWAI                              
	Bhopal, Sept. 16: The BJP government of Madhya Pradesh is planning to slap a fine of Rs 500 on house owners who allow mosquitoes to breed on their premises.        
	The move, health authorities say, will be part of their measures to check the outbreak of malaria, dengue and chikungunya, all mosquito-borne diseases they have been struggling to contain.        
	State health director Ashok Sharma said that the law to penalise citizens dated back to 1999. It is just that in an epidemic-like situation (as is the case now), we will enforce it, he added.        
	In case of apartments, the penalty will be imposed on the society that runs the complex. But the plan has sparked howls of protests from residents, who say the fine is draconian and blame civic authorities for the problem.         
	What about the Bhopal Municipal Corporation, which is unable to perform its cleanliness duties? asked Waseem Qureshi, who lives in an apartment here.        
	Bhopals mayor Sunil Sood, who is from the Congress and whose corporation is being blamed for the outbreak, dubbed the idea ridiculous and said the diseases were a seasonal phenomenon.        
	The Shivraj Singh Chauhan cabinet appeared divided on the move. Minister for urban administration Babulal Gaur said he didnt believe in punishing residents.         
	I am not in favour of harassing citizens, Gaur, who was chief minister in 2004-05, said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | New party floated
                                                                                                               New party floated
                            
	New Delhi, Feb. 15 (PTI): With Lok Sabha polls drawing nearer, a new party has been floated in Bihar by a former JD(U) leader.        
	The Rashtriya Samata Party, with Upendra Kuswaha as its president and Rambihari Singh as its general secretary, will focus on farmers issues and on unemployment, while working out caste combinations in the state.        
	Even though the Nitish Kumar-led government has been hailed on the development front, he has ignored the issues of farmers and those unemployed, Kuswaha, who was the leader of the Opposition from the JD(U) during the previous RJD rule. The community to which the leader belongs constitutes nearly 10 per cent of Bihars population.        
	Besides, the Nitish governments initiatives to form Mahadalit commission and lure Muslim community are hard to digest for the upper community and in the changed circumstances, the newly-floated party strives to win over the section.         
	All sections that have not received justice, will be taken into consideration in the changed scenario, said Kuswaha, also a former NCP member.

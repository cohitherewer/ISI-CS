The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Indo-Pak step into Iraq with Jaipur Foot
                                                                                                               Indo-Pak step into Iraq with Jaipur Foot
          RAKHEE ROY TALUKDAR                              
	Jaipur, July 26: India and Pakistan are linking up to provide limbs  the miracle Jaipur Foot  to war-torn Iraq.        
	A 20-member team of 15 Indians and five Pakistanis will shortly organise a camp in Iraq for fitting 1,000 artificial limbs, the Jaipur Foot, to thousands of landmine victims and other physically challenged people.        
	A two-member team of D.R. Mehta, the founder-patron of Bhagwan Mahaveer Viklang Sahayata Samiti, which manufactures the foot, and its chief technical consultant, Dr M.K. Mathur, will leave for Iraq to work out the modalities of the camp with representatives of local social organisations and hospitals.         
	The camp is expected to be held in Baghdad within the next two months.        
	Mehta said a social group from Iraq represented by Tamara Chalabi approached his organisation to hold a camp in the country ravaged by strife.         
	The camp would be the first by the Samiti in Iraq, though the organisation has worked in war-hit countries like Afghanistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nigeria, Somalia and Lebanon.        
	The Samiti has two associate centres in Islamabad and Karachi, where camps had been held in 2007.         
	Local Pakistani technicians run these centres, though the raw material for the limbs are supplied from India.        
	Mehta said when the Pakistan centres heard about the offer from Iraq, they too offered to chip in.         
	We decided to include five Pakistani technicians in our team.         
	The beauty of the project would be that members from two rival countries would be joining hands in this humanitarian cause for a third warring nation.         
	It is a simple people-to-people contact programme to reach out to the needy, overlooking political and warring angles, Mehta said.         
	The Jaipur Foot proposed to be fitted in Iraq would have some special features which would take care of cultural and religious needs of the people like bending to offer namaaz.        
	With the help of the Jaipur Foot, a person can not only walk without a stick but also run and climb trees and ride a bicycle.

	Patna, Sept. 2: Maoists abducted four securitymen of a road construction company and torched three of its trucks and a pay loader at Chakai in Jamui on the Bihar-Jharkhand border, 200km from here, last night.        
	Additional director-general of police headquarters Neelmani said that the rebels attacked SMPLs camp office near Chakai under Chandramandi police station area setting the trucks and the pay loader on fire. Then, they captured four men and decamped into the forests, Neelmani said. The abducted men have not been found.        
	For now, deputy inspector-general (Munger) Amit Kumar, SAP and paramilitary forces are camping at the site. The forces have cordoned off the jungle and are conducting a combing operation, Neelmani said.

	New Delhi, March 19: Sulking BJP general secretary Arun Jaitleys decision to attend a meeting at party president Rajnath Singhs home this morning triggered speculation of a patch-up, but sources said the two leaders clashed again.         
	Party spokesperson Balbir Punj described Jaitleys presence at the meeting to select candidates for Delhi and a few seats in Bihar as a narrowing down of differences, but others said the rift might have deepened after Rajnath overruled him on the choice of the nominee for Darbhanga.        
	Jaitley, who is in charge of both Delhi and Bihar, made a strong push for Sanjay Jha from the Darbhanga seat but Rajnath put his foot down and cleared former cricketer Kirti Azads name.        
	Jha is a controversial member of the Bihar Legislative Council and many in the party see in him a potential Sudhanshu Mittal  the businessman whose appointment as co-in-charge of party affairs in Assam had made Jaitley see red.        
	When candidates for Bihar were discussed a couple of days ago by the central election committee  whose meetings Jaitley has been boycotting to protest Mittals appointment  Jhas name evoked a strong response from top leaders. Sources said committee members described him as Nitish Kumars mole in the BJP, forcing L.K. Advani and Rajnath to keep the seat on hold.         
	Sources said Jaitley felt Azad had become unpopular and that Jha was the winnable candidate. But Rajnath, armed with the committees majority opinion, refused to clear Jhas candidature.         
	Jaitleys support to his claim became the subject of discussion in BJP circles today as many leaders saw an irony in his moral positioning on Mittal, whom he is quoted as describing as a power broker. Mittal has now gone ahead and set up an election war room in Guwahati.         
	Jaitleys aides said nothing should be read into his visit to Rajnaths home, arguing that Jaitley was not fighting a personal battle against the party president.         
	He has taken a principled stand and that will continue, one of his supporters said, hinting that Jaitley would continue to stay away from meetings of the central election committee.        
	Neutral observers in the BJP, however, saw Jaitleys visit as a conciliatory gesture and hoped the crisis would now blow over. They said the general secretary had realised his protest looked odd and had shown the maturity to try and normalise relations on his own.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Singh war on terror havens
                                                                                                               Singh war on terror havens
          G.C. SHEKHAR AND JOHN MARY                          Singh with former UN undersecretary-general Shashi Tharoor at the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas. (Jay Mandal/On Assignment)                                  
	Chennai/Kannur, Jan. 8: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today said India would work with the international community to ensure there were no safe havens for terrorists and urged the navy to prepare for increasing threats from the oceans.        
	If the focus was on terror, Singh also dwelt on the economic downturn but assured the global Indian community that the fundamentals of the countrys economy remained strong.        
	Singh, who inaugurated the seventh edition of the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas in Chennai, said there were many who wouldnt like to see India succeed. But we have shown, over and over again, that we will not allow the forces of terrorism and extremism to destabilise us, he said, alluding to the Mumbai attacks last November.        
	He told the 1,500-odd delegates from over 50 countries that his government had taken several measures to strengthen security. India, he added, will continue to work with the international community to ensure that there are no safe havens and launching pads for terrorists.        
	Later in the day, as he opened a naval academy in Kerala, he said India faced threats not only in the Arabian Sea but also in the Indian Ocean, and it was essential for the navy, coast guard and intelligence agencies to co-ordinate their efforts more closely.        
	He said there had been a marked increase in attempts by terrorist and other groups to use the waters around India for their nefarious purposes.        
	The sea is increasingly becoming relevant in the context of Indias security interests and we must re-adjust our military preparedness to this fast changing environment. We have in place an ambitious plan for force modernisation of the navy which will contribute to the navys emergence as a three-dimensional force, Singh said at the academy in Ezhimla, some 35km from Kannur.        
	Earlier, at the Pravasi Divas, foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee said even over a month after the Mumbai carnage, there continues to be recalcitrance (on Pakistans part) in bringing the perpetrators to justice.         
	On Indias economy, Singh said: We expect to achieve a growth rate of about seven per cent this year, which will be the highest in the world.

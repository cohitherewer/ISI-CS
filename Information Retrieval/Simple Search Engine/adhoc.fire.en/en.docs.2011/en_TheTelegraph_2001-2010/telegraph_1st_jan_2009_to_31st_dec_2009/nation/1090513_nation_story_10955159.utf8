The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Lanka masks personality clash 
                                                                                                               Lanka masks personality clash 
  - Elections in Tamil Nadu are about Jaya vs Karunanidhi, not issues        G.C. SHEKHAR IN CHENNAI                             Jayalalithaa, Karunanidhi                                       
	For a state known for its extreme political swings  it voted 39 MPs of the DMK-led front in 2004  Tamil Nadu is a divided house this time.         
	Decimated five years ago when it drew a blank, the ADMK has regrouped. Keeping electoral arithmetic in mind, Jayalalithaa shunned the BJP and roped in the MDMK, the Left and finally the PMK, which together make up a formidable alliance given their committed votebank.         
	In 2004, the PMK, MDMK and the Left were part of the DMK-led front which bagged a little over 57 per cent of the votes. The Congress was with it as well, giving credence to the theory that whichever regional outfit it supports goes on to win the electoral bout.         
	The equation could go wrong this time. The DMK, short of friends, and the Congress have clung to each other in spite of differences over the Lankan issue. But the alliance has little else going for it.         
	In the absence of any serious issue and as the war on the LTTE nears its end in the island nation across the seas, political parties expectedly kept the pot boiling on the plight of the Sri Lankan Tamils in the hope that it would fetch them more votes.         
	Every election move by Karunanidhi and Jayalalithaa  from fasting protests to calling LTTE chief V. Prabhakaran a friend and promising to send the Indian army to liberate Eelam  was dictated by how the events unfolded in Sri Lanka which they perceived would impact the way Tamil voters would chose their MPs.         
	In this, however, the seasoned politicians appear to have got it wrong. The average voter is focused more on local issues like power cuts, price rise, roads and bus services and the past performance of MPs.         
	In Virudhunagar in southern Tamil Nadu, for example, from where MDMK leader Vaiko  a persistent protagonist of the Eelam cause  is contesting, it is his past record as an MP from Sivavkasi that is holding him in good stead and not his excitable rhetoric on Sri Lanka.         
	He has been talking about Eelam and its Tamils for over two decades. But we would rather vote for him for bringing the broad gauge line and conducting periodical medical camps here. Also Vaiko has a good record of protesting on genuine issues, like mechanisation of the match industry, which has earned him enormous goodwill, says R. Manoharan, a ration shop worker in Virudhunagar town, about 450km from Chennai.         
	Thuglak editor and political commentator Cho Ramaswamy reasons that the average Tamil Nadu voter has never been swayed by the Lankan Tamil issue.         
	If the Lankan Tamil issue was such an emotive issue that influences elections, then Vaikos MDMK should be one of the strongest political parties in the state. Instead its vote share has been shrinking with every election, says Ramaswamy.         
	Shorn of Sri Lanka, therefore, the elections are not such much about the Congress or the BJP than they are about Karunanidhi and Jayalalithaa.         
	The DMK has been showcasing its own welfare measures like cheap rice and free colour TV rather than those of the UPA government. Jayalalithaas target has not been Sonia Gandhi or Manmohan Singh but Karunanidhi and his family members and the misgovernance of the minority DMK government.         
	At 85, Karunanidhis inability to campaign due to ill health and the gradual weakening of the Congress at the grassroots level has not helped the DMK front. Also the distribution of money to voters in Madurai and the ill-advised move by the DMK government to drop bus fares only to hike them after being caught out by the Election Commission further betrayed its nervousness. The DMK hopes that the voter would repay in kind for the freebies and welfare measures dished out by its government.         
	If anything could spoil the ADMKs calculation, it would be the performance of actor Vijayakanths DMDK if it continues to split the anti-DMK votes as it had during the past three Assembly byelections.         
	A surprise package could be the BJP winning the Kanyakumari seat, due to a three-way split in the Christian votes in the southern tip. If that happens the electoral divide would be complete.         
	In an election which is more about numbers than any real issue, the alliance stitched together by the ADMK appears to have its nose ahead.

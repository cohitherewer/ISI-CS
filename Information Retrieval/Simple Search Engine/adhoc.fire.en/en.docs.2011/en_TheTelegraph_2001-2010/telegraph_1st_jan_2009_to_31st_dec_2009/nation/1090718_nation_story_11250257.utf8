The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Court admits PIL
                                                                                                               Court admits PIL
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Cuttack, July 17: Orissa High Court today admitted a PIL challenging the election of senior BJD leader and finance minister Prafulla Ghadei from Sukinda Assembly constituency.         
	Former minister and senior Congress leader Sarat Rout had filed the petition alleging that his rival had won because of double voting by at least 3,000 BJD supporters. There were double entries of names of as many as 5,000 voters in the electoral roll and 3,000 votes were registered twice within the constituency in favour of the BJD in violation of Section 62 of the Representation of Peoples Act, 1951, the petition alleged.         
	Ghadei had defeated Rout by 2,403 votes in April.         
	The single bench of Justice R.N. Biswal after a preliminary hearing on the petition issued notices to finance minister Prafulla Ghadei and other candidates who had contested from the Sukinda seat, petitioner counsel Advocate Bidyadhar Mishra told The Telegraph today.         
	The court fixed August 3 for the hearing, Mishra added.         
	The PIL has further alleged that the acceptance of the nomination of BJP nominee Dolagivinda Mahanta was improper as he had not subscribed his oath.

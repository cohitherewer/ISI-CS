	New Delhi, Sept. 13: A coach of the Delhi Metro derailed this morning, the second such instance in just over a month that raises questions about maintenance of the capitals showpiece utility.        
	No one was injured in the accident near the Yamuna Bank station in east Delhi but service was disrupted for some time.         
	A junior engineer has been suspended.        
	On August 12, a coach of a train had gone off the tracks on the Dwarka-Indraprastha route. Around 40 passengers were in the train at that time. No one was injured.        
	Two wheels of the front coach of the train went off the tracks today at 6am, causing panic among the passengers. Fourteen passengers were in the train at that time and no one was injured. The number of commuters was low as this was the first service (for the day) on the route (Yamuna Bank-Indraprastha-Dwarka), a Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) official said.        
	DMRC spokesperson Anuj Dayal said a high-level committee had been formed to probe the incident. Prima facie, the derailment seems to have occurred because of problems related to the tracks, so the junior engineer in charge of track maintenance has been suspended, he said.        
	The inquiry panel has three officials  general manager (maintenance), general manager (rolling stock) and general manager (signalling and telecom)  from the operations and maintenance department of the DMRC, he added.        
	The service on the route has been temporarily suspended as Metro maintenance teams are working at the site, Dayal said.        
	An expert said derailments such as this could not be blamed on project deadline pressure.        
	This is sheer lapse in maintenance. The DMRC should tighten supervising as far as maintenance is concerned. This kind of thing doesnt happen because one has a deadline to meet. Routine checks are the only way one can avoid such incidents, said Indian Building Congress member S.K. Biz, who is a former Railway Board member.        
	Others said lack of maintenance could lead to wear and tear of the tracks. Nuts and bolts could also turn loose if not properly checked and maintained. This can eventually lead to derailment, an expert said.        
	Delhi Metro had come under fire after an under-construction bridge collapsed, killing six workers in July.         
	DMRC managing director E. Sreedharan had conducted a review meeting of the Metros operations and maintenance wing two months ago to examine the safety systems of Metro structures, stations and trains.        
	Sreedharan had also directed a full-time safety organisation to be set up by the DMRC for the operation and maintenance wing. The organisation is supposed to review safety procedures being followed by the DMRC.

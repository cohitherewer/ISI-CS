          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 4: Small hotels in the twin cities of Cuttack and Bhubaneswar have recently become the favourite haunt of criminals.        
	In a raid at Hotel Mayfeel, in the posh Jaydev Vihar area, this morning, two persons were arrested and arms seized while a deal was reportedly being finalised.         
	Police sources said they had laid a trap using officers in plain clothes posing as potential customers.         
	The duo are being interrogated, said DCP Himanshu Lal.         
	Six persons had been arrested in a similar raid from the same hotel last month and ammunition seized.         
	The police had also raided Hotel Chandan at Master Canteen Square in November and arrested four criminals mostly hailing from Jharkhand and Bengal.         
	The police have increased vigils in city hotels  both big and small  to crack down criminals of late.         
	Hotels have been asked to step up security arrangements, besides installing security camera system, rigid parking restrictions and criminal background checks on customers.         
	The overhaul of the security system is intended to deter criminals from using hotels and also aid officers in identifying and apprehending those suspected of crime, a senior police officer said.         
	Hotels have been instructed to register all details of guests and inform the police if they find anything suspicious.        
	There are some reasonable ways to bring crime levels down. Hotel owners have supported our move and in the past, hotel staff have called the police after finding evidence of criminal activity. This is important, police commissioner B.K. Sharma said.

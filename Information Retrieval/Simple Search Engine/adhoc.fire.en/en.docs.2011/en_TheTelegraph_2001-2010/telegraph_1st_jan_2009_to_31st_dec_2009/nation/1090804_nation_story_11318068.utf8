                                                                                                               Babel in House
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug 3: Prices of Bundelkhand essential commodities butchered minorities cereals oil discrimination by Centre sit down please.        
	Confused? This was the babble heard in the Lok Sabha today as a hundred competing tongues created a jumbled din amid periodic announcements of adjournments.        
	While the CPMs Basudev Acharya was opening the debate on price rise, the Trinamul Congresss Sudip Bandyopadhyay was crying himself hoarse on alleged Left violence in Bengal and the Bahujan Samaj Partys Dara Singh Chauhan was protesting the proposed formation of a Bundelkhand development authority.        
	Members of all the three parties loudly supported their speakers. Amid the deafening noise, Deputy Speaker Karia Mundas hapless appeals for order went ignored. Several senior MPs and ministers also took to bullying the Chair to complete the anarchy.        
	Soon after the House had reassembled at 2pm, Deputy Speaker Munda called Acharya to open the debate on price rise. The CPM member promptly began his speech, triggering protests from Samajwadi Party members who wanted to raise the subject of the governments stance on the Ambani row.        
	Sushma then ordered Munda to let Mulayam ask two questions. Munda, a BJP member, promptly obliged.        
	Mulayam embarked on a lengthy speech during which he hurled allegations against Murli Deora as a stunned House listened in disbelief. He demanded that Deora be sacked and walked out of the House.        
	Mulayams exit didnt mean Acharya could now complete his speech in peace: the Trinamul members kicked up a ruckus till Sudip was allowed to speak. But then the incensed communists jumped into the ring, dubbing their rivals anti-social elements.        
	As bedlam engulfed the House for half an hour, a string of words would somehow float over the Babel from time to time, like a riddle. It would go somewhat like this: Dalits are arhar dal being killed by Centres decision on CPMs goondagardi in Bundelkhand.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | University rush to please ally
                                                                                                               University rush to please ally
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                           Karunanidhi                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 29: The UPA government has finalised the launch of a central university at the birthplace of DMK chief M. Karunanidhi, a key coalition ally, even before an ordinance for new central varsities is ratified into law.         
	Human resource development (HRD) minister Arjun Singh is scheduled to lay the foundation stone for the university at Tiruvarur in Tamil Nadu on February 14, The Telegraph has learnt.         
	Parliament meets for a new session starting February 12 and the HRD ministry plans to introduce the Central Universities Ordinance, 2008, for ratification to legally recognise 15 new varsities, including one for Tamil Nadu.         
	Unless both Houses ratify the ordinance in the two days of the session before February 14, Arjun will be laying the foundation stone for an institution yet to be cleared by Parliament.         
	Apart from Tiruvarur, only Bathinda (Punjab) has been finalised as a location for a new central university, sources said. Bathinda was finalised after the Centre dropped plans to convert Panjab University into a central university.         
	But Arjun has ordered his ministry to finalise sites for all the remaining new universities in 10 days  by February 8  the sources said.         
	The rush to formally start the process of building a university at Tiruvarur may help the Congress placate the DMK, which is issuing veiled threats of withdrawing from the coalition. The DMK has said it is concerned over Indias perceived silence on the plight of Tamil civilians caught in the crossfire between Sri Lankan troops and the LTTE during the ongoing assault on the Tigers.         
	Tamil Nadu is one of 16 states that at present do not have a central university. In the XIth Five Year Plan, the UPA announced it would start universities in each of these states under the Prime Ministers vision to convert India into a global knowledge hub.         
	Tiruvarur was Tamil Nadu chief minister M. Karunanidhis choice as venue for the central university in the state, top government officials confirmed.         
	Karunanidhi was born in 1924 at Thirukkuvalai village in what is today Tiruvarur district  it was then called Tanjore.         
	The site of the new university is 266km from Chennai, and nearly 200km from every other major city in the state.         
	Proximity to major centres and access to airports were cited as key factors in site selection for the new set of institutions of higher learning that the government is building.         
	Kota, proposed by the previous Rajasthan government of Vasundhra Raje Scindia as a site for an IIT, which the state was promised, was turned down primarily for these reasons.         
	The government is keen to start all 15 new central universities this academic session, but the Tiruvarur university carries greater political significance than the rest, a senior government representative said.         
	The university in Tiruvarur is a political decision. The hurry to found the institution is based on a simple fear. It is unofficially the first among equals in terms of anxiety to start it, and we do not want elections to interfere, the representative said.         
	The announcement of polls and the onset of the election model code of conduct could complicate efforts to start any new initiatives that may be seen as sops to voters.

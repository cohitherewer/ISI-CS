          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Feb. 4: An American was allegedly molested in an Iskcon guesthouse here, she said in a complaint that police claimed had initially mentioned rape.        
	Inspector Deepak Katkade of Juhu police station said medical tests had not confirmed rape, but claimed there were marks of physical assault on the 24-year-olds body.        
	We told her she needed to go through a medical examination but she refused and changed her complaint to molestation. But we still insisted on an examination as we wanted to be sure that she had not withdrawn the complaint under duress, said Katkade.        
	Deputy commissioner Niket Kaushik said the case was of molestation, with an additional section of attempt to rape since that was the suspected motive of the accused.         
	However, Iskcon authorities have brushed away both the rape and the molestation charges and believe that the allegations are an attempt to sully the institutions image.        
	The picture has become fuzzier since the American, who claimed the assault occurred on January 31, has left the guesthouse without leaving any address. The police, too, claim they arent sure about her whereabouts.         
	Deputy commissioner Kaushik, speaking on the basis of the complaint, said the woman had answered a knock on her door on January 31 night and a strange man barged in, pinned her down on the bed and molested her.         
	Iskcon zonal secretary Bhima Das said: This is an attempt to malign us. The girl is claiming different things to different people. She told us that someone tried to strangulate her. There is very high security. The man would not have been able to vanish in thin air.         
	Das didnt explain how the marks of assault, which the police claim she had on her body, could have been inflicted.

	Bhubaneswar, Sept. 15: Agricultural marketing in the state is entering a new era.        
	The state government, in its effort to create a farmer-friendly market and empower farmers, has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the National Spot Exchange Ltd (NSEL).        
	The MoU, intended for setting up electronic trading facilities for agriculture, will play a vital role in bridging the information and communication gap that exists in various pockets of the agricultural market of the country, said experts.        
	Explaining the system, Sinha said that the NSEL would provide an electronic platform, where farmers, traders, corporate entities, processors and importers could sell and buy at the best possible and competitive rates.         
	The farmers will deliver the material at the e-trading terminals that would be set up at the regional marketing committee (RMC)-level.         
	At the delivery centres, quality of the material would be checked according to the standards notified by NSEL and if the material delivered is accepted at the warehouse, the seller will be issued warehouse receipts.         
	If willing, the farmer can get his payments immediately or he will have the option of selling their produce after holding it for sometime so as to realise better price during lean season.        
	The farmers can also avail loan during the intervening period against pledge of warehouse receipts, Sinha said.        
	National Spot Exchange Ltd will also help farmers to find out right prices prevailing for their produce and thus facilitate small farmers to hedge their risk and discover the right prices for their commodities, he said.        
	Agriculture marketing in Orissa was not much advanced but there was a great deal of feasibility that could be explored, said agriculture minister Damodar Rout.

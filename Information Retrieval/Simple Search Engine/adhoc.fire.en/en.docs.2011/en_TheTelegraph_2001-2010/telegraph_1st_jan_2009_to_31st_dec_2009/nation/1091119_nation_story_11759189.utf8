The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | New norms to cleanse deemed varsities
                                                                                    Thursday , November 19 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                            New norms to cleanse deemed varsities
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, Nov. 18: The human resource development ministry is likely to propose mandatory rating for aspiring deemed universities and an end to the practice of awarding fledgling institutions the deemed tag under fresh guidelines for granting the controversial status.         
	Institutions will need to undergo accreditation to win deemed university status under new guidelines being drafted to act on the findings of a central review team, sources closely associated with the process said.        
	The guidelines  discussed yesterday between the ministry and the four-member review panel  are also likely to stipulate a minimum time period for which an institution must function before seeking deemed varsity status.        
	This rule would effectively end the practice of awarding deemed university status to newborn institutions claiming to provide expertise in cutting edge research areas  a trend widely followed when Arjun Singh was HRD minister.        
	The fresh guidelines are aimed at strengthening the regulatory framework governing the grant of deemed university status  a category of institutions tarnished with allegations of subverting standards through corruption  the sources said.        
	It is, however, unclear whether the new guidelines will specifically recommend action against deemed universities found undeserving of the tag by the central review team.        
	The proposed new guidelines will be presented to the Supreme Court  which is hearing a case questioning the need for the deemed university category of institutions  two months from now, the sources said.        
	Earlier this week, the court had adjourned a hearing in the case challenging the government on allowing dubious deemed universities to flourish across the country. Earlier this year, the apex court had questioned the very basis of the deemed university tag.        
	The HRD ministry is already working on a legislation which makes accreditation mandatory for all higher education institutions. The bill may be tabled this Parliament session and  under a best-case scenario  could be law by late next year.        
	But the guidelines  rules which the government must follow in awarding deemed university status in the future  could come into force as soon as they are approved by the Supreme Court.        
	Existing deemed universities are likely to be given a specific timeframe within which they must get themselves accredited in order to retain their deemed university status, under the new guidelines. India has 130 deemed universities in all.         
	The review team consisting of four leading academic experts  neurosurgeon P.N. Tandon, chemist Goverdhan Mehta, philosopher Mrinal Miri and civil engineer M. Anandakrishnan  submitted its report to HRD minister Kapil Sibal late last month.        
	The HRD ministry remains tight-lipped about both the contents of the report and on its planned action on deemed universities found undeserving of the tag.         
	But, as reported by The Telegraph on September 14, the review team found several private deemed universities below standards required for deemed universities.         
	Only universities and institutions created by Parliament or state legislatures, and deemed universities can offer degrees in India.        
	Deemed universities  granted the status without legislative approval  were created as a category to allow top research institutions like the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research to offer degrees while preserving their autonomy.        
	Guidelines were created which mandated that institutions must function for at least ten years before they became eligible for deemed university status.        
	But these guidelines were diluted, removing any minimum experience required for acquiring deemed university status  using the claim that the institution wanted to offer courses in new areas.        
	This category of institutions called de novo (new) flourished under Arjuns tenure as HRD minister.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Yet to hatch,   BJP counts
                                                                                                               Yet to hatch,   BJP counts
          SANJAY K. JHA                          Jaitley: Sniffing seats                                        
	New Delhi, April 16: The BJP today claimed it had emerged the most formidable player in Uttar Pradesh and would make large gains in the state that elects more MPs than any other.        
	Arun Jaitley said the BJP, which won only 10 of the states 80 seats in 2004, could now win 10 seats in the first phase itself that saw 16 Uttar Pradesh constituencies go to the polls. He attributed it to a dramatic swing in upper-caste votes.        
	The BSPs success in the 2007 Assembly polls was based on a negative vote as the people wanted to get rid of the discredited Mulayam (Singh Yadav) government, Jaitley, the party general secretary in charge of the state, said.        
	But Mayavatis failure to contain crime and corruption has compelled the voters to look elsewhere.        
	Jaitley agreed that the Congress, too, would benefit but claimed the BJP would be the biggest gainer with its stronger organisation in the state.        
	One factor that favoured Mayavati in the Assembly polls was her promise to punish criminals and put Samajwadi Party leaders Mulayam and Amar Singh in jail. The BJP says she not only failed to keep the promise but patronised criminals herself.        
	The BSP has fielded more candidates who face criminal charges than any other party, alienating the educated middle class whose members are mostly from the upper castes. The BJP has seized its chance, painting the Samajwadis and the BSP as two sides of the same coin.        
	The BSP had campaigned against the Mulayam government by saying: Chadh goonde ki chhati par/mohar laga do haathi par (mount the criminals chest and stamp on the BSP symbol, the elephant).        
	The BJP has turned the slogan around to say: Goonde chadh gaye haathi par/goli maare chhati par (criminals have mounted the elephant and are shooting people in the chest).        
	The BJP has generally avoided fielding candidates accused in criminal cases in Uttar Pradesh except for its Azamgarh nominee, who has polarised the Hindu voters in this Muslim-majority area.        
	The BJP, which had polled 22.17 per cent votes in the state in 2004, has the advantage of Ajit Singhs 4.49 per cent votes this time.

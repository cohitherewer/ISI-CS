  - Muslim artisans toil to meet Puja deadline          LALMOHAN PATNAIK                           An artisan completes a medha at the silver city on Sunday. (Badrika Nath Das)                                        
	Cuttack, Sept. 20: Hundreds of Muslim artisans, masters in their work, are adding finishing touches to medhas  decorative backdrops crafted out of zari and sholapith (Indian cork) for Durga Puja.        
	The artisans not only toiled day and night to meet the Puja deadline, all worked while fasting for Ramzan.         
	We have been working for two months and it is worth it. It is an overwhelming satisfaction when we see our creations in mandaps and see thousands appreciate our work, said Salim Khan, a leading craftsman.        
	Generations of Muslim craftsmen in the silver city have been working behind-the-scenes to make neighbourhood pujas a success. These artisans are the ones responsible for the ornate head wears for the goddess and exquisite ornaments made out of sholapith and zari.         
	Though some puja committees are now using chandi medhas (backdrop of silver filigree work), most mandaps still depend on zari-sholapith medhas that cost Rs 20,000 to Rs 80,000 depending on their size and design.        
	Salim Khan learnt the art from father Kabir Khan. I have been making medhas since I was a boy. It is our livelihood and pride, said the 55-year-old veteran at Banka Bazaar. His three sons have followed his footsteps.        
	The family receives contracts for mandaps at Meria Bazaar, Shikarpur-Gandarpur, College Square, Professor para, Sutahat, Oriya Bazaar and Bidyadharpur. Without these artisans and craftsmen, we cannot think of the medhas, said Manoranjan Sahoo, the secretary of College Square Puja Committee.         
	Sholapith is a milky-white sponge-wood that is carved into delicate objects of art almost similar to thermocol, which is artificially produced. However, sholapith is superior to thermocol in terms of malleability, texture, lustre and sponginess.        
	We complain that there is little understanding between communities, but the fact two communities work together to make a celebration a success, goes on to show that there is more understanding and co-relation than we realise, said S.M. Ansari, the president of Tinkonia Bagicha Puja Committee.        
	This year there will be 154 medhas across the city. With Naya Sarak Puja Mandap and Sarpa Durga Puja Mandap coming up with chandi medhas, number of committees decorating their pandals with silver filigree work goes up to 12.

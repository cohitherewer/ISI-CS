                          Sunidhi Chauhan                    
	Durban, July 19 (PTI): Playback singer Sunidhi Chauhan had her costume jewellery confiscated here on court orders after a Durban businessman complained she hadnt performed at his event eight years ago despite being paid.        
	Durban High Court had ordered the attachment of ornaments on the complaint of Sunil Singh, who sought help to recover about $5,300 (Rs 2.58 lakh) from the singer.        
	Sunidhi, also known as Desi Girl after her chartbuster from 2008 hit Dostana, was co-operative when the court-appointed sheriff walked into her greenroom to seize the jewellery moments before she was to take the stage two days back.        
	The costume jewellery, of unspecified value, was taken away because she didnt have much of personal ornaments with her.         
	Unfazed, the 26-year-old went ahead with that event as well as the entire tour that ended on Saturday.        
	In his complaint to the court, Singh claimed he had paid the singer in June 2001 but she put off the concert, slated for November, in the wake of the terrorist attack in the US on September 11 that year.        
	She refused to perform later despite several attempts to arrange her tour, Singh told the court.        
	Sunidhi did perform in South Africa in 2002, for another promoter, Singh said, adding she also turned down his requests in 2003 and 2004.        
	When Singh heard about her current concerts, he decided to recover his money. He told Durbans Sunday Tribune that despite talking to her lawyers since early last week, he was given no assurance. She has already been paid in full for her performance, Singh told the newspaper.         
	Sunidhis South African attorney, Ash Haripersad, told the newspaper that when court officials arrived at her room at the ICC centre in Durban with the attachment order, she received it and let them take what they could.

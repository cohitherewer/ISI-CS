The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | RSS stirs age pot on eve of meet
                                                                                                               RSS stirs age pot on eve of meet
          SANJAY K. JHA                           Mohan Bhagwat                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 18: Thousands of feet high, Shimlas cool climes promise little charm for BJP leaders when they sit down to introspect tomorrow.        
	Jaswant Singhs Jinnah has ensured that it is going to be humid. And hot, thanks to Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwats call for transition.        
	As if the election defeat wasnt enough, the new developments have brought the much hyped chintan baithak under additional pressure.        
	Party sources said Bhagwats strong pitch for change and suggestion to promote younger leaders on the eve of the introspective session was a not-so-subtle message to the leadership that has shown no sign of forward movement despite the defeat.        
	Ideology could also take centre stage, they added, following the row over Jaswants book, Jinnah: India, Partition, Independence, where the former Union minister says Pakistans founder was a secularist and not responsible for Partition.         
	BJP general secretary Vinay Katiyars reaction to the book summed up the mood in the party. Those who hail Jinnah should quit the BJP, settle in Pakistan and do politics there, he said. Those who hold Nehru and Patel responsible for Partition surely have no sense of history; they should get their mental balance checked in a hospital. We must decide at the chintan baithak whether the BJP will be run on Guru Golwalkars philosophy or on the views of those who do Jinnah idolatry.         
	Many leaders grabbed the opportunity to corner those who wanted a dilution of the Hindutva ideology. Even senior leaders like Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley felt compelled to denounce Jaswants findings.         
	The BJP leadership suspended two MLAs who had been spearheading the campaign to retain Vasundhara Raje as Opposition leader in the Rajasthan Assembly.        
	By evening, however, the focus had shifted to the question of leadership as a television channel showed Bhagwats interview. Bhagwat said the BJP took its own decisions but the RSS created the consciousness required for the right kind of decisions.        
	Sangh sources said this was a clear signal to the BJP that time was running out for an overhaul.         
	Though Bhagwat strongly denied that he had asked Advani to quit, he revealed that the RSS had been suggesting generational change in the BJP since 2003. He also said staying on as leader of the Opposition for five years was Advanis own decision.        
	Asked specifically if he saw Advani carrying on for another five years, Bhagwat said: That is what they will have to decide. If they come and ask for a suggestion, we will give it to them.         
	But Bhagwat did talk about too much infighting among senior leaders and the need for change at all levels in the BJP.         
	To a question about the ideal average age, he said 55-60, not more. This not only rules out the possibility of Advanis continuance, but also weakens the case of the many so-called second-generation leaders.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Zero support for rail minister in Lalu Tola
                                                                                                               Zero support for rail minister in Lalu Tola
          NALIN VERMA                              
	Lalu Tola (Saran), April 13: Lalu Tola, a small village on Chapra-Parsa road in Saran Lok Sabha constituency, is the venue for the Rs 1,400-crore cast wheel factory  the railway ministers pet project.        
	Though the name of the village in Bela panchayat area under Parsa segment of Saran constituency is Lalu Tola, the nomenclature has nothing to do with Lalu Prasad. The tola (village), according to residents, existed much before Lalu Prasad was born.         
	Despite its name, there are few in the village of 1,000 people who would vote for Lalu Prasad, despite receiving the gift of the factory spread over 100 acres. The factory does promise employment to hundreds of villagers, besides prosperity to the region.        
	The reason: Lalu Tola is inhabited by Kurmis  Nitish Kumars caste-men.         
	The reason for not supporting Lalu Prasad is that he belongs to the Yadav community. Nitish Kumar is our favourite leader and we will vote for BJPs Rajiv Pratap Rudi who is the Nitish-supported candidate on the seat, said Nilesh Kumar, sipping tea in front of the factory gate. Nilesh also belongs to Nitish Kumars caste and he abhors Lalu.        
	There is no reason for us to change our loyalty, said Vikram, despite Lalu Prasad pushing three mega railway projects in the region.        
	However Lalu can take solace from the neighbouring Bhutahi Tola  dominated by the Yadavs.         
	There, to woo in villagers votes for BJP candidate Rudi, ruling JD(U) MLA, an Yadav and a resident of the village, Chhote Lal Rai, threw a mutton and rice party for his neighbours on April 6. He failed to draw even a single member of his caste to the feast. Rai should understand that we are Yadavs and his party cannot make us vote against Laluji. Rai should have understood his fellow mens sentiments, said Krishna Yadav, adding: We will teach him a lesson in the next Assembly polls.        
	The antagonism in Lalu Tola is least likely to affect Lalu Prasads prospect in Parsa Assembly segment that has over 60,000 Yadav voters and is described as Lanka because of the Yadav might.        
	Recently, The Telegraph caught Lalu Prasad addressing a meeting at PN College grounds in Parsa. Rajiv Pratap Rudi is not in the race to win, rather to state later that he lost to Lalu and prepare the ground for his Rajya Sabha entry, Lalu Prasad roared.        
	The railway minister and RJD boss does enjoy an unprecedented popularity among the Yadavs and Muslims in Parsa, Garkha and Sonepur. But, the Rajput-dominated Amnaur, Chapra and Marhaura would be backing Rudi  reason being cadte-based yet, again.         
	From the same area, the BSP has fielded Saleem Parvez, a prosperous man, but who has to cover a long ground before he can win the battle of the Titans.

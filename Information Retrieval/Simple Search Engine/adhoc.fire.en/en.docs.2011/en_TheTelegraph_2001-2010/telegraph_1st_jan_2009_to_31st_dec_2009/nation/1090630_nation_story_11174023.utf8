The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Missing MLAs letter puzzle
                                                                                                               Missing MLAs letter puzzle
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Cuttack, June 29: Nine days after Ramesh Rout, an Independent MLA from Athagarh, submitted his resignation, the move still remains a mystery for most people in political circles.         
	And the man himself has remained untraceable for the past nine days.        
	The rumour doing the rounds in political circles is that Routs resignation was prompted by former Athagarh MLA Ranendra Pratap Swain and that the Independent resigned under duress. A letter to this effect reached media offices in the city on June 23, allegedly written by the Independent MLA and addressed to the Speaker, which the latter denied having received.        
	Speaker P.K. Amat is yet to accept his resignation while Routs family residing at Radhagovindpur officially announced yesterday that the Independent MLA has been missing for nine days, ever since he submitted the resignation.         
	He did not return home, said a distraught mother, Tophani Rout, talking to The Telegraph today.        
	We came to know about his resignation through the television. But, we have not been able to make contact with him since then, said Rajashri, his wife.         
	Rout submitted the resignation in person to Speaker P.K. Amat at the latters residence on June 19. At that time, his letter did not site any reason for the move.         
	Copies of yet another letter sent to BJD president and chief minister Naveen Patnaik were also circulated to the media on the same day that stated that he took the step to make way for former MLA Ranendra Pratap Swain.         
	It stated that Rout felt that he had to pave way for a by-election to enable Swain to come back to Assembly to serve the people of Athagarh.         
	While the letter purportedly written on June 23 and sent to media houses (a copy of which is with The Telegraph) said he had resigned under duress.         
	Rout pleading to continue as MLA said he had done so due to pressure from the former MLA and to save my life and my family.         
	The Speaker, however, denied having received the letter and said: I have not received any such letter.        
	Four-times Athagarh MLA Ranendra Pratap Swain was barred from contesting the elections after the returning officer rejected the BJD leaders nomination papers on grounds of non-submission of party ticket.         
	Consequently, BJD-backed Independent candidate Ramesh Rout fought from this seat and ensured his victory by a margin of 25,000 votes.

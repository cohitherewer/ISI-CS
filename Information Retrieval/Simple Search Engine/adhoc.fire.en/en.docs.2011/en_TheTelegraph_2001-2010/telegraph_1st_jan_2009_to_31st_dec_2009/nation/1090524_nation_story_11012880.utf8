The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Flock or family dilemma for DMK
                                                                                                               Flock or family dilemma for DMK
          G.C. SHEKHAR                           Karunanidhis sons MK Stalin (foreground) and MK Azhagiri (right), daughter Kanimozhi (extreme left) and great-nephew Maran (next to Stalin) at his residence in Chennai after the party meeting. DMK leader Raja (behind Maran) is also seen in the picture. (PTI)                                  
	Chennai, May 23: DMK chief M. Karunanidhi today signalled he was considering a fresh proposal on possible ministries even as he sought to find a way out of his dilemma of choosing between family members and other MPs.        
	Karunanidhi thanked the Prime Minister for clarifying that he was not against any particular DMK MP being part of his ministry, after reports that Manmohan Singh was against the return of T.R. Baalu and A. Raja.        
	The whole thing was a false campaign by north Indian news channels which has been proved wrong by the Prime Minister and I thank him for that, Karunanidhi said in a statement.         
	Karunanidhis statement is a pointer that the DMK is considering the latest offer from the Congress and its MPs could be part of the next swearing-in on Tuesday or Wednesday.        
	Through the morning, the chief minister continued informal discussions with party leaders on the Congress offer  three cabinet berths and three minister of state berths, including one with independent charge.         
	The DMK is trying to get an additional post of minister of state with independent charge to strike a balance within the first family.        
	But the dilemma gripping Karunanidhi, according to insiders, is whether to have two family members as cabinet ministers, which would be viewed as brazen nepotism not only by his critics but also within the party. So if Baalu and Raja get the two cabinet ranks and the third goes to son M.K. Azhagiri, then Karunanidhi hopes to give the two slots of independent charge ministries to great-nephew Dayanidhi Maran  who was a cabinet minister earlier  and daughter Kanimozhi.         
	This is why he is still haggling for the additional post of minister of state with independent charge.        
	The DMKs insistence on the shipping or highways and road transport portfolios  all three were held by Baalu earlier  or power is another stumbling block, with the Congress unwilling to part with the infrastructure berths. It has offered cabinet berths of chemicals and fertilisers, communications and IT, and heavy industry and independent charge of women and child welfare. Apparently the health ministry, which the DMK was eyeing earlier, could also remain with the Congress with Ambika Soni being touted as a front-runner.        
	DMK sources said a clear picture would emerge by tomorrow and that Baalu was in touch with Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad.         
	However, Congress leaders would not put a deadline, with some going so far as to say a resolution may not be reached in time for the second round of swearing-in.         
	First our leader has to decide which family member will occupy what post. The scene has changed from 2004 when he could get away by appointing Dayanidhi Maran. But now there are three claimants from within his family and not enough berths to keep them happy which makes him all the more conscious about public reaction, said a senior minister.

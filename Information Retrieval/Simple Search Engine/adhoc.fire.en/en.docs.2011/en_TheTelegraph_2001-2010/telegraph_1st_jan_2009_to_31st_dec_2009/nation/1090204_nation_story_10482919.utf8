The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Fat levels in veg oil high: NGO 
                                                                                                               Fat levels in veg oil high: NGO 
          G.S. MUDUR                               
	New Delhi, Feb. 3: The levels of dangerous transfats in vegetable oils sold in India remain unregulated more than a year after a government panel had recommended standards for these hazardous fats, a non-government agency said today.         
	The Centre for Science and Environment, New Delhi, said all seven brands of vanaspati that it analysed had transfat levels 5 to 12 times higher than the worlds only standard for transfats oil  set by Denmark at 2 per cent of total oil.         
	Transfats are hazardous molecules that are created when vegetable oils are chemically treated to increase their shelf-life. Doctors warn that transfats are among the worst fats that increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.         
	The values of transfats in the vanaspati samples tested by the CSE at its laboratory ranged from 9.4 per cent to 23.7 per cent. Although the Centre has introduced mandatory labelling of fat content in edible oils, the study found that the transfat content indicated on the labels was ambiguous.         
	The label on one brand of vanaspati (Dalda) indicated a transfat content between 15 and 55 per cent, but the value detected in the laboratory was only 9.4 per cent. Another brand (Rath) had a label indicating transfat content between 8 per cent and 33 per cent. The value observed in the CSE laboratory was 15.9 per cent.         
	Its strange that while the government admits that transfats are dangerous to human health, it has been delaying action to regulate its levels, said Sunita Narain, director of the CSE, the institution that had in 2003 detected pesticides in bottled water.         
	After more than three years of consultations with government departments and industries, a sub-committee on oils and fats set up by the health ministry had last year proposed a three-phase introduction of limits for transfats.         
	The proposal called for a 15 per cent limit during 2008, 10 per cent by 2009 and 5 per cent by 2010. In February 2008, the Central Committee for Food Standards endorsed the proposal but indicated that it wanted additional data from industry groups.         
	Its more than a year ... we dont know what data theyre waiting for, Narain said.         
	But senior health officials have said that while transfats are dangerous, the government was not in a position to ban them overnight. The price (of vanaspati) can be a politically sensitive issue, said a senior official. We need to consider what substitutes are available if transfats are banned before we can ban transfats.

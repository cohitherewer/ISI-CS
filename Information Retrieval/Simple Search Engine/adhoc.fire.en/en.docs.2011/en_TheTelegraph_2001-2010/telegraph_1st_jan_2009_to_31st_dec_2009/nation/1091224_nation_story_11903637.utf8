The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Soren spoils Congress route map
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Soren spoils Congress route map
  - One party places bets on Babulal Marandi, another clings to hope of rift in rival camp         SANJAY K. JHA                                                   
	New Delhi, Dec. 23: The Congress has received the Jharkhand verdict with a tinge of frustration because Shibu Soren has again emerged as the key player.        
	Senior leaders were prepared to deal with Soren in the kingmakers role but his unexpected success has now placed him as the strongest claimant to the chief ministers post, compelling the Congress to review its entire strategy.         
	Sources said the party leadership would now move with extreme caution primarily to achieve two objectives: Soren doesnt explore the possibility of forming a government with the BJPs help and deal with other key players who could destabilise the coalition.        
	A Congress leader said: Soren is obviously in the drivers seat. We would have loved to see him getting fewer seats. Now we may have to deal with him on his terms.        
	The sources said the Congress would not press for its own chief minister in the fluid situation. But its first priority will still be to install Babulal Marandi as chief minister. Congress leaders feel that Marandi has a good image and he can instil a sense of confidence among the people of Jharkhand.        
	The Congress will ideally prefer Marandi being assisted by two deputy chief ministers; one from the JMM and the other from its own stable. But political scripts arent tailor-made and Soren has set a non-negotiable condition of leading the government. It is too early to say anything, said the Congresss Jharkhand in-charge K. Keshava Rao, adding that the party would formulate its strategy only after speaking to prospective allies.        
	Congress spokesperson Manish Tiwari, too, tried to hide behind the plea of fluid situation but asserted that the party would try to form a secular and stable government.        
	He said the verdict was against the BJP if the last Lok Sabha election was taken as the benchmark. Against the 18 seats now, the BJP had led in 39 Assembly segments in the Lok Sabha polls.The Congress refrained from making any song and dance about the result as the partys gain is meagre and the only solace is the BJPs inability to reach closer to the majority mark.        
	Tiwari, however, said both the JMM and the RJD were already UPA allies  the claim is technically correct as both the parties have given letters of support to the President but the Congress never flaunted these assets in the past few months of UPA-II. Party leaders claimed that Soren and Lalu Prasad had spoken to them after the results and a formula was being worked out. Congress leaders forcefully discounted the possibility of a BJP-supported government, assuming that the JMM, too, would not run the risk of choosing a weak alliance against the backdrop of the instability in the past.        
	The younger JMM leaders have to think of their future. We know they will prefer the Congress to the BJP. If Soren forces them to go for the BJP, the JMM could even break up, one leader said.         
	The formation of the government can take some time as the Congress will not announce a decision in a hurry. The Christmas break can further delay the process.

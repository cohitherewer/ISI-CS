The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP attacks Singhs Atal shield 
                                                                                                               BJP attacks Singhs Atal shield 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Arun Jaitley: In the lead                                  
	New Delhi, July 31: The BJP is out to snatch the Vajpayee shield Prime Minister Manmohan Singh used to defend his decision to engage Pakistan in a dialogue despite the Mumbai attack.        
	The partys argument is that Singh had reversed the Vajpayee governments Pakistan policy by adopting a stand that means dialogue irrespective of terrorism.        
	Arun Jaitley led the renewed charge today, telling a news conference the Prime Minister could not use the Vajpayee as a shield to cover his monumental mistake. He agreed that the former Prime Minister held talks with Pakistan despite terror strikes but argued the focus was still on terror.        
	Then, trying to make a distinction, Jaitley said Singh had used the wrong phrase, trust but verify. In the context of Pakistan, the right phrase will be verify and then trust, Jaitley argued.        
	He quoted from the January 6, 2004, joint statement by Vajpayee and President Pervez Musharraf which said violence, hostility and terrorism must be prevented to sustain the dialogue process.        
	Musharraf, Jaitley said, had reassured Vajpayee he would not permit any territory under Pakistans control to be used to support terrorism in any manner. Singh, on the contrary, wasnt even insisting on a commitment as a precondition for talks, Jaitley said.        
	Two statements by Singh after the Sharm-el-Sheikh meeting showed the shift in the governments stance, Jaitley said.        
	In the first, on July 17, Singh had said the starting point of any meaningful dialogue with Pakistan was the fulfilment of its commitment in letter and spirit not to allow its territory to be used for terror activities against India.        
	In the second, on July 29, Singh had said it was impossible to work towards normalisation of relations unless Islamabad fulfilled its commitment.         
	Jaitley highlighted the difference between starting point and normalisation of relations, saying international diplomacy ran on agreed texts, not on unilateral explanations. He insisted the reference to Balochistan, too, was deliberate, intended to point an invisible finger at India.        
	We went to Sharm-el-Sheikh as a complainant and returned as a guilty, Jaitley said, almost echoing his own statements made earlier in the day in the Rajya Sabha.         
	The BJP leader also objected to the Prime Ministers dialogue-or-war theory, saying such an argument was alarmist. He asked the government not to limit its options.         
	A dialogue-or-war position weakens Indias position as there can be several other ways to put pressure on Pakistan, Jaitley said. Calibrated talks, not composite dialogue, could be one option, he added.        
	Jaitley dared Congress president Sonia Gandhi to categorically say she supported the joint statement instead of backing the Prime Ministers speech in Parliament. He also questioned her silence on Balochistan.

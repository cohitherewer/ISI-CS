          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 18: The defence ministry has cancelled the appointment of a lieutenant general named for the office of the deputy chief of army staff (information systems) as investigations into an alleged land scam in Bengal rock the top echelons of the service.        
	The military secretary at thearmy headquarters, also a lieutenant general, has gone on leave, too.        
	The land was leased by the Bengal government to two or more private businesses with offices in Calcutta and plots in the Matigara police station area of Darjeeling.         
	Documents available so far name Mata Vaishnodevi Mercantile Pvt Ltd and J.F. Low amp; Company as members of the Dilip Agarwal Geetanjali Education Trust, which asked the army for a no-objection certificate to build a Rs 295-crore school on land adjacent to a cantonment.        
	Lt General P.K. Rath, who was the commander of the North Bengal-headquartered 33 (Trishakti) Corps and whose area of responsibility covers Sikkim and part of the border with China, was named deputy chief in September.         
	But the appointment was kept in abeyance after he was asked to report to the Eastern Command headquarters in Fort William, Calcutta, for a court of inquiry. The ministry has now cancelled Raths appointment.        
	The cancellation has not gone down well in the army headquarters. One officer said a court of inquiry had only begun investigations and the cancellation of his appointment tantamount to punishing the general before the charges were established.        
	But a defence ministry official explained that the post could not be left vacant for an indefinite period.        
	The army is investigating circumstances that led to clearance being given to the private trust to build a school on land adjacent to the Trishakti Corps cantonment, overturning an earlier decision to refuse such permission.         
	Rath was the corps commander when the clearance was given by the station commander, a brigadier.        
	This does not rule out the possibility that Rath was acting on the instructions or advice of a senior officer.        
	The military secretary, Lt General Avadhesh Prakash, who has also been summoned by the court of inquiry in Calcutta, has gone on leave, a defence ministry source said.        
	The military secretary, in charge of all personnel matters, transfers and postings and one of the busiest officers, is not required to go on leave to depose before the court of inquiry. It was not immediately clear if the general had been asked to go on leave, pending the investigation.

      15 DAYS TO GO*              
	Mascot PM      
	Betul: Mascot Manmohan after weak Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.    
	Shivraj Singh Chauhan, Madhya Pradeshs BJP chief minister, thinks the Prime Minister is a mascot and Sonia Gandhi the face behind the mascot. The countrys Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, is a mascot and behind it is Congress president Sonia Gandhi on whose directions only the PM acts, Chauhan said.    
	Manmohan, however, is not the first Prime Minister to be called a mascot. Atal Bihari Vajpayee was also called a mascot by former BJP ideologue K.N. Govindacharya.     
	Chauhan, though, was not done after calling Manmohan a mascot. He said Manmohan and Sonia had not seen villages, poverty and hunger and had never shared the pain and agony of farmers and tribals.    
	Cop phones    
	Kanpur: Come polls, fix police phones.    
	The authorities are scrambling to restore telephones in 20 of the citys 44 police stations that have been dead for nearly a year, either because bills have gone unpaid or from technical snags.    
	Police superintendent Ram Lal Verma, also the nodal officer for the Lok Sabha polls, admitted many phones were out of order now.    
	We have asked the administration for adequate funds to pay the bills and also written a letter to BSNL to restore the telephone lines of all police stations and offices before the election.    
	Another police official said though they had been provided with cellphones, it was not possible for get all calls on their mobiles.     
	The defunct telephones include many in the offices of circle officers and senior inspectors.    
	CM pictures    
	Coimbatore: The ADMK has urged the Coimbatore district collector to remove banners of Tamil Nadu chief minister M. Karunanidhi in front of all ration shops, which the party said was a violation of the model code of conduct.     
	In a memorandum to the collector, four ADMK MLAs demanded that the ration shops should stop selling products such as wheat and cheap spice powders which, they said, had photographs of Karunanidhi on the packets.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | NCP for Singh contest
                                                                                                               NCP for Singh contest
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Singh: Ally push                                  
	New Delhi, March 31: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh should contest in the Lok Sabha elections, Sharad Pawars Nationalist Congress Party, an ally of the Congress, said today.         
	But the NCP also made it clear that it was keeping its options open on whom to support for the post of Prime Minister after the elections and did not rule out rooting for Pawar.         
	It would have been better if Manmohan Singh contested. He would have won from any seat in the country. He is not only Manmohan but Janmohan (popular to the masses), NCP general secretary Devi Prasad Tripathi said.        
	But Tripathi clarified that Singh was only the prime ministerial candidate of the Congress, not of the UPA.         
	If the Congress chooses Manmohan Singh as its prime ministerial candidate after the elections, other allies will consider that option, Tripathi said. We are in a piquant situation not seen in any democracy yet  the UPA government is intact, but the alliance doesnt exist outside the government, going into elections.        
	The Congress, he said, was solely to blame for the UPA not entering the elections for the 15th Lok Sabha as a coalition.         
	We were the ones who told the Congress that the UPA should go into the elections as a nationwide alliance. But the Congress gave an illogical argument against the proposition, Tripathi said.         
	Asked if the Congress, in his opinion, is responsible for weakening the UPA, Tripathi replied: Objectively, yes.         
	The NCP leaders comments follow tensions in the Congress-NCP ties after Pawar publicly accepted that his party was keen to project him as a prime ministerial candidate.         
	The Congress has stated that Manmohan is its candidate for the top job. Officially, both parties and other parties in the UPA government have claimed cordial relations and have suggested a post-poll alliance of the grouping as the most likely option.         
	On the NCPs ties with the third front with the Left as its fulcrum, Tripathi said: The third front is closer to the UPA than the NDA is to us. So if the scenario arises, talks may be necessary with parties that are members of that grouping.         
	In fact, the third front should be called the first front in our opinion, he said.         
	Tripathi announced that the Congress and the NCP had also finalised an alliance in Goa after sealing ties in Maharashtra. The NCP will contest the Goa North seat and the Congress Goa South.

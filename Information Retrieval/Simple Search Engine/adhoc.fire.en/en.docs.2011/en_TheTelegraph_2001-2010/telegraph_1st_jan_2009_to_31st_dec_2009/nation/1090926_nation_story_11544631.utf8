The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Karuna sons donate house
                                                                                                               Karuna sons donate house
          G.C. SHEKHAR                                            
	Chennai, Sept. 25: M. Karunanidhis children may fight over his political succession but they have agreed to turn their fathers house of over 50 years into a hospital once their parents pass away.        
	Today, the chief ministers three sons signed a release document to facilitate the setting up of the hospital to offer free treatment to the poor.        
	The document signed by M.K. Alagiri, M.K. Stalin and M.K. Thamilarasu  all with big properties of their own  was registered in the presence of a sub-registrar in the two-storeyed house at Gopalapuram in central Chennai. The 85-year-old Karunanidhi had purchased the house in the 1950s from his earnings as a successful film script and dialogue writer.         
	In 1968, when he was PWD minister in the first DMK government, he had drawn up a settlement deed that gave his sons equal share of the house once he and his second wife Dayulu Ammal were dead.        
	In July this year, the chief minister changed his mind, announcing at the launch of a free medical insurance scheme for the poor that the residence would be converted into a charitable hospital. Todays deed means none of the sons or their children can lay claim to the house once it becomes a hospital, to be named after Karunanidhis parents.        
	While Karunanidhis sons have consented to their fathers plan to use his house as a hospital, another political stalwart, Jyoti Basus son recently turned the familys ancestral property into a guesthouse.         
	Doubts have been expressed, though, if the 2000sqft home of Karunanidhi has enough space for a hospital. Although our leader has a hospital in mind, the house may ultimately serve as a nursing home, with free outpatient consultation and a lab, a DMK MP said.        
	The house, near a Krishna temple, has been one of the more permanent fixtures in Karunanidhis political journey.         
	While Karunanidhis third wife Rajathi (Rajya Sabha member Kanimozhis mother) moved into a bungalow in CIT Colony, a kilometre from this house, Karunanidhi and his second wife Dayulu have chosen to live in their old home for over five decades.         
	The DMK chief alternates between his two homes  CIT colony for lunch and Gopalapuram for dinner and breakfast.        
	That cant be said for the women, though. It was only during his (Karunanidhis) midnight arrest in June 2001 from Rajathis house that Dayulu first stepped into Rajathis home, recalled a DMK functionary.         
	The sons dont exactly have an accommodation problem. Alagiri lives in a huge bungalow in Madurai, his turf; in Chennai, he stays in a farmhouse outside the city.         
	Stalin bought his own house in Velachery, south Chennai, a decade ago but recently moved into a swank bungalow, 2km from his dads official home.        
	Tamilarasu, a businessman, has his home at Gopalapuram, a few blocks away from his dads place.

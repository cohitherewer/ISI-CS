The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Punctual PC cracks the whip
                                                                                                               Punctual PC cracks the whip
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                              
	New Delhi, June 3: If your boss is PC, better be punctual.        
	Latecomers learnt it the hard way when home minister P. Chidambaram hauled some of them up yesterday.        
	Be in office by 9am and not leave before 5.30pm, he is said to have told them.        
	Even senior officers are not exempt from the ministers tongue-lashing, as a joint secretary who came in late found out recently.        
	Sources said Chidambaram has issued a terse note reminding employees about the work hours. But while such reminders have been issued in the past, it is swipe cards that many employees fear.        
	Your time of entry is recorded the moment you punch in.        
	There is another problem too. Many paramilitary jawans are on attachment for sundry duties of officers and, if swipe cards are introduced, their presence would be recorded. Not many would like that to happen, said a source.        
	But most employees realise control is necessary. With offices spread over several locations in Delhi, and 18 divisions spanning six departments, the home ministry not only handles internal security but is also in charge of dispensing relief in times of disaster in co-ordination with the ministry of finance.        
	It also takes care of eight-lakh-odd paramilitary personnel engaged in anti-insurgency operations and law and order duties across the country.         
	Sources also said his 100-day plans were working wonders. Every day is the 100th day, said a bureaucrat, poring over records.

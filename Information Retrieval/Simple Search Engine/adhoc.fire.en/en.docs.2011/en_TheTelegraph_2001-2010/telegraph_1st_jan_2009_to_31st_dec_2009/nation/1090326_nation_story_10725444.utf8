The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Tears at home, tip-off across border   Army makes rare claim

	Srinagar, March 25: The army today made a rare disclosure that intelligence inputs from the Pakistani side of the Line of Control had helped it hunt down the militants who engaged soldiers for days in the longest encounter of the year in Kupwara.         
	Terrorists were intercepted based on accurate and human intelligence both from our side and the other side of the LoC, said Brigadier Gurmeet Singh, Brigadier-General Staff of the 15 Corps.        
	Seventeen of them have been killed and they include both the infiltrating group and the party that had gone to receive them. They were essentially foreign militants from the Lashkar-e-Toiba, he said.         
	Last year, the army spokesperson in Jammu, Lt Col S.D. Goswami, had said the force received information from the Pakistani army about a group of infiltrators. The claim  the first such to be made  was denied by his seniors and the officer sent back to his parent ministry of defence.         
	Although army headquarters on both sides of the border would confirm a major confidence-building measure by making the sharing of intelligence public, they are chary of doing so. Often, the decision to share intelligence is taken not at the level of headquarters or command but by local commanders.         
	Apart from the telephone hotline between the army headquarters in Delhi and Rawalpindi, between the directors-general of military operations, there are also hotlines at Poonch-Rawalkot and at Uri across the Aman Setu.         
	Kupwara, where the firefight with the militants raged, is a particularly vulnerable region of infiltration and help from across the LoC and from across the Shamshabari Range in north Kashmir would have been invaluable. The army has taken so many casualties in a single operation for the first time in two years  eight soldiers have been killed.        
	Brigadier Singh refused to say if it was the Pakistani army or militant moles that tipped them off. In military parlance, intelligence from across the LoC could also mean inputs from Indian operatives.        
	But he said the weapons and war-like stores with the terrorists indicated they were well-equipped and maps and guidance communication equipment with them is indicative that state and security forces assistance from across was with them because such systems are not found usually in the civil domain.

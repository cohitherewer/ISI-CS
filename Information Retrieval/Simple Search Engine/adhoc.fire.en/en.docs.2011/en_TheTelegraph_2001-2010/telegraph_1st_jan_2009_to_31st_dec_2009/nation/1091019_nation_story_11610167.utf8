                                                                                                               Water body problems for Cuttack
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Oct. 18: The government is in a quandary over protecting and preserving water bodies in the city, as criminals continue to have free run damaging precious natural resources by unauthorised constructions.        
	According to tehsil records, there are at least 1,466 water bodies in the city. But 1,044 of those have already been filled up partially or completely for construction of residential complexes by land owners, sources said.        
	The citys perennial problem of waterlogging has been compounded due to conversion of such large number of water bodies, as they are veritable rainwater absorbers.        
	Though a PIL brought to focus illegal construction and depleting water bodies in the city over four years ago and the high court had since issued a series of orders the situation seems to have changed little. Consequent to the court order, the district administration entrusted mapping of water bodies in Cuttack to the Orissa Remote Sensing Application Centre. The report submitted by the centre revealed that there were 424 water bodies in 1990. The number had reduced to 245 in 2006, a senior official said.        
	Cuttack Development Authority maintains that no plans for construction of buildings over jalasaya kisam (marshy) land have been given approval after 2001. The CDA, however, is yet to come up with a report on how many unauthorised structures in the city are constructed over jalasaya kisam land without obtaining approval.         
	The high court had recently given a fresh impetus to judicial activism against illegal conversion of jalasaya kisam lands for homestead purposes by hauling up the government recently for failing to come up with concrete measures to tackle the problem.        
	The court had directed both the secretaries of revenue department and urban development and housing department to make personal appearances on November 3 to explain why a concrete plan to deal with coming up of unauthorised structures over jalasaya kisam land could not be drawn up during the past four years.        
	Meanwhile, as part of the bid to preserve water bodies in the city, people have been warned of non-approval of building plan on jalasaya kisam land, so that they do not purchase or sell such land for building homes.

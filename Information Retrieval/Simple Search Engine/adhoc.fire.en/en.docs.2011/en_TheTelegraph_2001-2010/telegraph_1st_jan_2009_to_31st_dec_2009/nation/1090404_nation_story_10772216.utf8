The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Kasab kept under tight security
                                                                                                               Kasab kept under tight security
                            
	Mumbai, April 3 (PTI): Mohammed Ajmal Kasab, the lone surviving Mumbai gunman, is being kept under round-the-clock surveillance by the Indo-Tibetan Border Police at the Arthur Road jail. His trial begins on April 6.        
	He has been kept in isolation in a separate cell, heavily guarded by ITBP men. Except for a copy of the 11,000-page chargesheet, Kasab has nothing else in his cell, a police source said.        
	Kasabs court-appointed lawyer, Anjali Waghmare, is to help him understand the charges against him. Kasab has asked for newspapers but the court is yet to pass an order on his plea.        
	The jail has two sections, one made up of 11 barracks where under-trials from various gangs are lodged and the other housing the trial court and Kasabs cell.        
	The authorities have built a bomb-proof tunnel that will allow Kasab to walk into the court directly from his cell.        
	Kasabs cell, the court and the tunnel have all been built with steel-concrete walls, strong enough to withstand bomb and bullet attacks. About 250 workers were engaged for the construction, which cost an estimated Rs 2 crore.        
	The court on the jail premises will now be used regularly to try sensitive cases, sources said.        
	The work (on the tunnel and court) is almost over; the finishing touches are being given, a source said.        
	A narrow by-lane near the jail that serves as a business centre and a residential colony in the neighbourhood have been sealed. Residents have been issued with passes to commute from their homes to the main road.        
	Although the jails walls are quite high, its possible to lob a hand-grenade into the premises from outside. Thats why the bomb-proof tunnel was needed, the sources said.

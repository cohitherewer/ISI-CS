The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Advani eyes road ahead 
                                                                                                               Advani eyes road ahead 
  - Poll debacle not to be discussed at BJP meet        SANJAY K. JHA                           Advani at the news conference in Parliament on Friday. (PTI)                                        
	New Delhi, Aug. 7: L.K. Advani today flattened the poll post-mortem balloon saying the BJPs chintan baithak would dwell on the path forward, not the Lok Sabha election debacle.        
	Advani, who also indicated he wasnt planning to retire, said: We have already done (an) analysis of the election results and spoken about it. The chintan baithak is for the road ahead.         
	The statement came as a rude awakening for the majority of leaders as party president Rajnath Singh had discouraged all from raising election-related issues, saying the baithak on August 20 would be exclusively a post-mortem exercise.         
	A senior leader said on the condition of anonymity: Advaniji showed his aversion to any investigation of the causes of the defeat at the national executive itself. It was he who ran the campaign along with his aides and a few party leaders. How can he allow scrutiny of his own system when he is determined to resist change?        
	Many younger leaders said they had apprehensions the meeting in Shimla would be an eyewash. Some leaders close to Advani admitted that the brainstorming session would strictly avoid investigation and blame game and focus on future strategies.         
	The BJP core committee met today to discuss the fate of the meeting as many leaders wanted it cancelled.         
	They argued that the fruitful Parliament session had lifted the morale of the party and there was no point in revisiting the depressing chapter of defeat, which might trigger fresh bouts of factional fights.        
	Asked if the party was trying to sweep questions about the causes of the defeat raised by many senior leaders under the carpet, Advani said: I did not say we will not analyse. But I want to say the chintan baithak will not be in the context of the election defeat.        
	He said only 25 leaders, down from the 40 initially planned, would be invited to the meeting, the limited number being seen as another indication of the ploy to limit the discussions to a comfortable level as fewer participants would mean fewer dissenters.        
	Advani also tried to set the tone for the discussions by outlining the reasons for the defeat. But the theory was the same as the one he had offered at the national executive: decimation of smaller parties led to the Congresss gains.        
	Voters, he said, didnt want an unstable experiment with the third front and the Left, and the Congress was the natural beneficiary as the BJP didnt have bases in the south and some more states.        
	Asked about the roadmap for Advani, Sushma Swaraj intervened to say he had been elected the leader of the parliamentary party for five years and would continue. This, however, does not mean he would essentially be leader of the Opposition. The possibility of his elevation as NDA chairperson has not been ruled out.         
	Asked if he was being pressurised by the party to continue, Advani said: I dont do anything that I am reluctant to do. I do everything on my own volition.

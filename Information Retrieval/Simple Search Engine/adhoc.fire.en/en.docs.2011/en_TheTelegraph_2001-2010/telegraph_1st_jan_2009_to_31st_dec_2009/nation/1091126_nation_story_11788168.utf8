                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      In nation of young, 39 is old 
                            
	Jaipur, Nov. 25 (PTI): Congress leader Rahul Gandhi today described himself as old and only playing the role of a catalyst for strengthening the youth wing of his party.         
	If you do a demographic analysis of the population, I am old. I am 39. If you see the population of the country, 60 per cent of our population is below 40, he said.        
	Asked about his involvement with the Youth Congress, he said: Rahul Gandhi has not empowered the Youth Congress. The youth empowered themselves in the Youth Congress. I am a catalyst. I am not the leader of the Youth Congress.         
	On being asked when he would graduate from the NSUI and the Youth Congress to handle party matters, Rahul said: There is a habit in our country that when we watch a cricket match we think we can bat better than Sachin Tendulkar. You are playing cricket from outside the field. I do my job whatever it is,

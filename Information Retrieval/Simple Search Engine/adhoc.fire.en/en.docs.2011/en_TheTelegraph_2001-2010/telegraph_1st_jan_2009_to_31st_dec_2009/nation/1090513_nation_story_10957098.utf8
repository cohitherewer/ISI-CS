The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Amar faces suicide slur
                                                                                                               Amar faces suicide slur
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Jaya Prada: Double battle                                  
	Lucknow, May 12: The political pot-boiler under way in the countrys most volatile electoral arena headed towards a bizarre climax with Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh slapped with a complaint that he was instigating his partys Rampur candidate Jaya Prada to end her life.        
	Police in Rampur, the erstwhile princely state in northern Uttar Pradesh, today received the complaint from Mohammad Qamaruddin, believed to be a supporter of rebel Samajwadi leader Azam Khan who is campaigning against Jaya Prada and is at loggerheads with Amar.         
	The complaint says the Samajwadi general secretary encouraged Jaya Prada, a former actress, to commit suicide at an election rally yesterday.        
	Amar has been engaged in a bitter war of words with Khan over the invitation to former chief minister Kalyan Singh to campaign for party candidates.         
	Khan, the Muslim face of the Samajwadi Party, has dubbed Kalyan a murderer as it was during his tenure as BJP chief minister that the Babri Masjid was demolished.         
	Amar had said at the rally that if Jaya Prada lost the elections, she could commit suicide.         
	She would be so devastated by this defeat that she might end her life, he had said to describe how attached she was to the constituency.        
	Jyoti Narayan, Rampurs special superintendent of police, said the complaint was being investigated.         
	We have asked for the video-recording of the speech made by Amar Singh and will ask witnesses at the meeting. If the complaint is found to be true, a case will be registered against the accused, he said.        
	Amar said he was stunned to hear that his remark could be the subject for a complaint. Any child will understand the import of my statement, he said.         
	Jaya Prada refused to comment. But an aide scoffed at the complaint. Amar Singhs apprehension of suicide was a metaphor for Jaya Pradas love for Rampur. It should not be taken literally, he said.        
	The complaint is the latest twist in the ugly political drama that has been unfolding in Rampur.         
	The campaign turned bitter last week when a mob attacked her campaign cavalcade at which the partys Mumbai strongman Abu Azmi was present. The attack was blamed on supporters of Khan, who denied involvement.         
	On Sunday, the Samajwadi office was ransacked, and yesterday, raids were conducted by the district administration on the hotel in which Jaya Prada has put up.         
	The actress has also accused Khan of circulating obscene posters of her in the constituency. These raids, the morphing of my image with a nude woman, the attack on Abu Azmi are all part of an orchestrated campaign against my candidature. The people of Rampur will give a proper reply to this, she said.        
	The police today said the raids were conducted on the advice of the Election Commission to flush out outsiders from the hotels of Rampur.

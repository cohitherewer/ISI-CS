The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Tytler exit robs BJP 
                                                                                                               Tytler exit robs BJP 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Sikh protesters in Delhi on Thursday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, April 9: Jagdish Tytlers exit from the poll fray has snatched a major issue from the BJP which had been invoking the 1984 anti-Sikh riots to paint the Congress as Indias most communal party.        
	Although BJP leaders insist that Tytlers pressure-induced pullout would not make much difference since the damage to the Congress is already done, the partys charge of communalism against the Congress is bound to lose much of its sting.        
	The BJP was hoping the Tytler controversy would benefit the party in Punjab and Delhi. Punjab has 13 Lok Sabha seats, and the BJP-Akali Dal combine is struggling in most of them because of strong anti-incumbency.        
	After the exit of Tytler and Sajjan Kumar  another 1984 riot-tainted Congress candidate  from the polls, BJP spokesman Prakash Javadekar claimed that communal politics had recoiled on the Congress. He said that just because these two were gone, people would not forget 1984 and how the CBI was misused to hand Tytler a clean chit.         
	BJP and Akali Dal leaders are arguing that Tytlers exit means little since Sikhs have not received justice despite 25 years of struggle. But they know the tide of Sikh anger is now likely to ebb.        
	Even before Tytlers departure, the BJP had faced a volley of questions about the Babri demolition, Gujarat riots, Varun Gandhi and Kandhamal. But it had kept harping on 1984, with Javadekar describing the anti-Sikh riots as the worst pogrom in Independent India.        
	To buttress his charge that the Congress was Indias most communal outfit, Javadekar had mentioned the Shahbano case, the plight of Kashmiri Pandits, the Congresss alliance with the Muslim League, the religion-wise headcount in the armed forces and Muslim reservation in Andhra Pradesh. He said the BJP was a nationalist party that believed in equality for all.        
	Grilled on these claims, Javadekar said: We want answers from the Congress. Why is the Babri mosque secular and the Ram temple communal? Why is denying the existence of Ram secular and devotion to Ram communal? Why is giving subsidy for Haj secular and giving facilities for Amarnath communal? Why are cow protection, uniform civil code and the singing of Vande Mataram communal?        
	He was using these old chestnuts, however, mainly to widen the scope of the debate around Tytler.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Oct. 10: Tension prevails in Kalinga Nagar Industrial Complex following a clash between local tribals and police, who raided Baligaotha village to arrest two murder accused.        
	While around 400 tribals armed with bows and arrows violently resisted the entry of the police, the latter used teargas shells and rubber bullets to disperse the mob, said Kalinga Nagar police station inspector-in-charge K.C. Mund.        
	However, no casualty or injury was reported, he said.        
	Sources said around seven platoons of the police had been to Baligotha village this morning to arrest Amar Singh Banara and Thuram Purti, who were wanted in the Sridhar Sai murder case. However, a large number of tribal villagers, owing allegiance to the Visthapan Virodhi Jan Manch, an anti-displacement organisation, resisted the police action.        
	Sai was reported missing for a few days. His body was later recovered on September 11, the police said. His murder was believed to be the handiwork of activists of the organisation.

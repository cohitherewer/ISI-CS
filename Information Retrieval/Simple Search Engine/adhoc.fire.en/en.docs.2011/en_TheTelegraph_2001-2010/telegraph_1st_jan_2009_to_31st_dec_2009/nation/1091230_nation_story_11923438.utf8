          ANANYA SENGUPTA                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 29: An award-winning sprinter set to represent India at next Octobers Commonwealth Games has accused five government officials of stalking her and sending obscene messages, as another tale of a harassed woman athlete unfolded.        
	Poonam Tomar, who won the Rajiv Gandhi award in 2006 and some 70 medals in a career spanning 23 years, has approached the anti- corruption bureau of Delhi police against the customs and railway officials harassing her for the past few months.        
	Sources close to Tomar, 39, said the railway employee, who has represented India at several international events, was not only getting lewd mobile phone messages from these men but was also being stalked during training sessions.        
	She cannot even go to the gym for railway employees where she works out. In her complaint she said that for more than three months she has been harassed so much that she had had to hunt for other places to work out, said a police source.        
	The complaint comes at a time the Centre is thinking of taking firm action against retired top cop S.P.S. Rathore, who was last week sentenced to six months in jail for molesting Ruchika Girhotra, a budding tennis player, 19 years ago. Ruchika later drank poison.        
	Although the sources wouldnt confirm it, they said Tomar, in her complaint, had written that she too had contemplated suicide several times.        
	Tomar, who is away at a national camp, was unavailable for comment.        
	I.D. Shukla, DCP, anti-corruption bureau, said he had received the complaint five days ago. I have forwarded it to the relevant departments. Since it is a case pertaining to harassment, the concerned authorities need to investigate the matter.        
	The authorities concerned in this case are the chief vigilance officer, railways, customs commissioner and the DCP, New Delhi district.        
	Sources said the level of harassment had reached such a stage that more than once during practice sessions, Tomar was tripped while running full throttle.        
	They told her if she opened her mouth they would make her a laughing stock in Delhi. They also threatened her by saying that since they were customs officers, they could implicate her anytime during any of her trips abroad. She had complained to Chanakyapuri police station, but nothing came of it, said a source.        
	But Tomar, often called the sprint queen of Delhi, could hope for some action after the Union home ministry yesterday said the police must file an FIR on every complaint.         
	Sources said Tomar had also approached the National Human Rights Commission, the Delhi chief minister and the Union sports minister.

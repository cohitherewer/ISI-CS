The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Visa fight in America, target India
                                                                                                               Visa fight in America, target India
          K.P. NAYAR                              
	Washington, April 28: The fight in America over H-1B visas is becoming ethnic and acquiring the shades of a campaign on Capitol Hill specifically targeting India.        
	Although a bill introduced in the Senate last week by two of its members, Chuck Grassley and Dick Durbin, does not mention India anywhere, its passage will make it difficult for Indian information technology firms to operate profitably in the US.        
	The new bill is the result of a failure of earlier attempts by senators and members of the House of Representatives to curb the use of H-1B visas in a populist effort by politicians to show that they are protecting the jobs of Americans in the midst of the current economic crisis.        
	The legislation, which has propelled Indian lobbies into action to stop its passage, requires that if a company in the US employs 50 or more people, the number of such employees who are H-1B non-immigrants plus the number of such employees who are non-immigrants... may not exceed 50 per cent of the total number of employees.        
	That means Indian information technology firms operating in the US, such as Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys and Wipro, may have to cap the number of their Indian employees at 50 per cent.        
	Many Indian companies employ 5,000 people or more across the US at varying points of time and estimates are that up to 70 per cent of such employees are Indians brought to America on H-1B or L-1 visas.        
	If the Grassley-Durbin bill gets adopted in the US Congress, an Indian company employing 5,000 people here, 70 per cent of them on H-1B or L-1 visas, for example, will have to terminate 1,000 Indians and replace them with US citizens or immigrants.        
	This will not only disrupt the businesses of these firms, but could also have a crippling effect on their balance sheets as they hire Americans, train them for jobs that are now being smoothly done and wade into the unknown in staffing.        
	The latest developments were viewed in New Delhi to be serious enough for commerce minister Kamal Nath to warn in a statement that the new moves on Capitol Hill would restrict the ability of Indian companies to compete in the US high-tech market.        
	This is certainly not in line with the US Presidents stand against protectionism at the recent G20 meeting where he met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.        
	Nath hinted at tensions in Indo-US relations when he referred to our desire to mainstream development in the Doha negotiations where the two countries are already at odds.        
	An H-1B visa is used to bring in foreign workers in specialised jobs while an L-1 visa can be used by foreign companies which have US subsidiaries and vice versa.        
	In their bill, Senators Grassley and Durbin are also seeking to inflame passions over alleged discrimination against Americans by prohibiting advertisements that call for H-1B employees.        
	The two senators said in identical statements that their bill would, among other things... prohibit the blatantly discriminatory practice of H-1B only advertisements.        
	Durbin is assistant Senate majority leader, a Democrat from Obamas home state of Illinois, while Grassley of Iowa is the senior-most Republican member of the Senates powerful finance committee.

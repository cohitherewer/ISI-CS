The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Relief for Modi in poll win 
                                                                                                               Relief for Modi in poll win 
          BASANT RAWAT                               
	Ahmedabad, Sept. 14: The BJP today wrested five Assembly seats from the Congress in a crucial Assembly bypoll dubbed to be a vote on the Narendra Modi regime which has been steadily losing electoral ground over the past few months.         
	The Congress  some of its leaders admitted the results had left them stunned and shocked  won only two seats (Dhoraji and Kodinar) of the seven seats where polling was held on September 10.         
	The byelections were necessitated because in six of the constituencies the sitting MLAs had been elected to Parliament, while in the seventh, the incumbent had died.         
	The BJP now has 121 MLAs in the House of 182, while the Congresss tally has dipped to 55.         
	For Modi, the success is a much-needed relief after the not-so-good showing the Lok Sabha elections and the humiliating defeat in the Junagadh civic polls, for which the chief minister had handpicked candidates.        
	The BJP wrested Jasdan, Chotila, Dehgam, Danta and Sami Assembly segments, which were all held by the Congress.         
	The only saving grace for the Congress was Kodinar, which it won back from the BJP, besides Dhoraji, which the party managed to retain.         
	The BJP was quick to attribute the victory to Modis charismatic leadership, though the chief minister did not campaign for the partys candidates.         
	BJP sources claimed the party gained from a wave in its favour spurred by the recent criticism of Modis regime in the alleged fake encounter cases and the investigation into the chief ministers possible role in the 2002 riots.         
	Whenever Modi is criticised, he benefits. He is capable of projecting any personal attack on him as anti-Gujarati sentiment, said a BJP leader who did not wish to be named.         
	The Congress put up a brave front and said the choice of candidates may have led to its poor show.
